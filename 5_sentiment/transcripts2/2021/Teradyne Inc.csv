In our call today, I'll summarize our Q4 and 2020 full year highlights and provide some initial comments on our outlook for 2021. Sanjay will then provide the financial details, Q1 outlook and review our updated earnings model and capital allocation plans. 
Fourth quarter capped off an amazing year for Teradyne, with sales up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2019 and non-GAAP earnings per share up 25%. That brought our full year sales to just over $3.1 billion, up 36% and non-GAAP EPS to $4.62, up 62% versus 2019. These annual results, driven by strength in all of our test businesses, more than made up for a soft industrial automation market that was impacted by COVID. For the full year, our Semi Test business was especially strong, driven by investments in smartphone-related test capacity, our expansion into the compute sector of SOC with our new UltraFLEXplus product and the ramp of our Magnum EPIC product for DRAM test. 
In smartphones, global unit shipments contracted in 2020, but the growth in chipset complexity continued driving tester demand higher. Each subsystem on the phone, cellular power management, connectivity, display, cameras and application processing has its own cycle. And in 2020, both the processor and the cellular areas took big steps up in complexity. We use transistor count as a proxy for complexity and the leading phone applications processors now exceed 10 billion transistors, growing double digits each generation. 
In 2020, we also saw the beginning of meaningful 5G silicon content, which necessitated a build-out of new tester capacity. Together, these listed the mobility test market in 2020, roughly $200 million to about $1.7 billion. This continuous refresh of smartphone silicon should be a tailwind for the semiconductor test business for the foreseeable future. 
In 2020, we also ramped our UltraFLEXplus product in the compute portion of the SOC market. Recall, this has historically been a $500 million to $600 million market, where we've had relatively low share. With the emergence of more players and applications in the processor market, including hyperscalers and AI, we expect this sector to outgrow the general market. The plus brings a powerful value proposition in managing the unique complexity, power dynamics, yield learning and time-to-market requirements of this segment. 
For 2020, we estimate the SOC market was in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion, up from about $3.3 billion in 2019. We estimate our SOC test market share moved up 15 points to about 54%. However, our internal view of share smooths out year-on-year swings due to the unique timing of investment cycles of both our and our competitors' customers. By that measure, we estimate our normalized 2020 SOC share at about 50%. 
Another notable growth segment of our Semi Test business in 2020 was memory. In this call, a year ago, we noted a significant design win for our Magnum EPIC product in the LPDDR5 portion of the DRAM market. This new entry into DRAM test ramped through the year and combined with healthy growth in our traditional NAND business, drove a 41% increase in memory sales from 2019. We estimate the market was about $900 million in 2020, up from $600 million in 2019 and our normalized 2020 memory share at about 42%. Beyond Semi Test, our System Test group also had a great year, delivering 43% growth with the Storage Test business more than doubling from 2019. This is the second consecutive year of hyper growth in Storage Test, driven by steady test intensity growth of terabyte HDD drives and similar growth in the system-level test of complex semiconductor devices. 
In our wireless test business at LitePoint, sales grew 10% from 2019 with solid demand for both our connectivity and cellular end markets. Wi-Fi 6 ultra-wideband test and increased investments in 5G-related handset tests all contributed. The performance of our test businesses more than offset the weaker results in our Industrial Automation business, which contracted 6% for the year. The global slowdown in manufacturing activity led to a 12% decline in sales at our Universal Robots unit. 
MiR, on the other hand, grew 1% as makers of ultraviolet disinfecting products recognize the value of an easier to deploy fully autonomous mobile robot. 
On a pro forma basis, AutoGuide also grew for the year. While the environment in IA was weaker than expected, the business troughed in the second quarter of 2020 and has improved dramatically in the second half, including record sales at UR in the fourth quarter. Collectively, the business returned to year-over-year growth in Q4, with UR growing 6% year-over-year and 41% sequential growth. With test slowing -- with test showing continued strength and industrial automation returning to growth, we are set up for another exciting year in 2021. Specifically, we are expecting a strong start to the year across all our businesses, with Q1 showing greater than 6% growth at the midpoint compared to Q1 of '19 -- sorry, Q1 of '20. 
As you know, full year visibility is always a challenge, as evidenced by our missing the strength of the test market and the decline of the IA market in our forecast just 1 year ago. That said, let me describe how we see things today and of course, we'll keep you updated in future calls. I will preface my remarks with a note that the well-publicized surge in the forecasted semiconductor CapEx in 2021 is a very bullish sign. However, the impact on test is likely to be felt in 2022 and beyond as fab capacity built this year will drive additional testers in future years aligned to fab commissioning and ramping volumes and yields. 
In SOC test, the dynamics that made 2020 such a strong year continue into 2021. In addition, we have strengthening demand in the long dormant automotive test market with orders for our Eagle test product line surging. Smartphone shipments are expected to grow in 2021 after contracting about 10% in 2020, and 5G content should increase. On the other hand, the SOC test market in China will likely be down in 2021 due to the expanded and full year effects of trade restrictions that were widened in 2020. Also, as always, tester demand from our largest customer will remain opaque until sometime in Q2. Additionally, the global economic impact of COVID and its impact on electronics demand after a surge in 2020, it's hard to forecast with arguments for both positive and negative effects. Taking all of that into account, we have a bit wider range in our SOC market size estimate for 2021 at $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion, up slightly from 2020 at the midpoint. 
In memory test, the transition to LPDDR5 and DDR5 should gain momentum in 2021 and beyond. After growing about 50% in 2020, we view the memory market to be in the $800 million to $1 billion range in 2021, about even with 2020 at the midpoint. In storage test, the underlying demand drivers of increased density in HDD and increased complexity in semi devices driving system-level test remain in place. However, visibility is limited and annual shipments can be very lumpy. After more than tripling over the last 3 years, we expect 2021 sales to be in a band of plus or minus 20% from the 2020 level. For the rest of our test businesses, we expect growth in the 5% to 10% range in 2021. 
In Industrial Automation, 2021 is starting off on a strong footing. Borrowing any additional COVID-related manufacturing sector shutdowns, we expect to deliver the highest ever first quarter sales in each of our automation businesses, and we are well positioned to grow in excess of 30% for the year. 2020's results reflect well on Teradyne's strategy, execution and efficiency. Our test businesses show the successful results of R&D bets made in years past and enable us to increase those bets for the future. Our Industrial Automation investments continue undeterred by short-term impacts of COVID, and we are well positioned to capitalize on a world emerging to invest even more in automation to improve resilience and productivity. 
Equally significant, 2020 show the resilience of Teradyne employees, our global suppliers and our operating model. In the face of unimaginable challenges across communities worldwide, the team dealt with health, safety and operation obstacles daily, met R&D milestones, executed steep new product ramps and delivered record shipments of SOC, memory and storage tech products to meet our customers' needs. We did all this while exercising the cost and schedule discipline expected at Teradyne. This is truly extraordinary and I am very grateful to be part of such a powerful team. 
As we move into 2021, the outlook appears bright across all our markets. As Sanjay will detail, we are returning to our share repurchase program and have an active M&A pipeline. As 2020 taught us, no matter what comes our way in the short term, I am confident our global team and market strategy will deliver exciting long-term returns for our customers, investors and employees. 
Sanjay will now take you through the financial and modeling details. Sanjay?"

Today, I'll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2020. Looking forward, I'll provide our Q1 outlook, an update to our midterm earnings model and our capital allocation plans. N",1539,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2020. Looking forward, I'll provide our Q1 outlook, an update to our midterm earnings model and our capital allocation plans. 
Now to Q4. Revenues were $759 million, which were $19 million above the high end of the guidance range. We delivered a non-GAAP operating profit of 30% and EPS of $1.10. Semi Test revenue of $524 million was driven by SOC and memory test demand, enabling 5G handsets and higher speed flash and DRAM devices. System Test group had revenue of $104 million, down quarter-over-quarter driven by lower storage test shipments. Industrial Automation, or IA, revenue of $92 million had a seasonal increase over Q3 and delivered year-over-year growth for the first time in 2020. LitePoint revenue of $40 million was approximately flat with Q3 and down year-over-year with a decline in trailing edge connectivity products, partially offset by new sales of new connectivity technology like WiFi 6 and emerging UWB technology. 
Non-GAAP gross margins were 59%, on plan and up quarter-over-quarter due to product mix. You'll see our non-GAAP operating expenses were up $14 million to $224 million from the third quarter due to increased test spending to support design wins, higher payroll due to 4 extra days in the quarter and ongoing IA investments. We generated $222 million in free cash in the fourth quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 13% on a GAAP basis and 14.5% on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, it is 14.75% on a GAAP basis and 15.25% on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the year with cash and marketable securities of $1.55 billion. 
Turning to the full year results of 2020. Teradyne revenues of $3.12 billion grew $826 million or 36% year-over-year. $845 million of the growth was from our test portfolio, while IA contracted $18 million due to the pandemic-related slowdown. We had 1 customer that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2020, which we'll disclose in our 10-K filing. 
Gross margins for the year were 57% and operating profit was 30%, which is up from 25% in 2019. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $4.62, an increase of 62% over 2019. We generated $684 million in free cash in 2020. 
Breaking down the components of 2020 revenues. As outlined by Mark, SOC test revenues grew $595 million or 46% on strength in mobility, market-driven by increased by device complexity and new standards like 5G along with growing growth in computing. In memory, revenues were $383 million, up 41%. While LPDDR-related DRAM revenues were a significant contributor to our results, we also continue to see strong NAND test demand through the year. 
In System Test, sales grew for the fourth year running. Revenue of $410 million grew $122 million or 43% year-over-year, primarily on growth in Storage Test for both hard disk drive and system level test. storage Test sales were $242 million, up from $115 million in 2019. We also saw annual growth in our defense and aerospace component of STG. 
At LitePoint, sales grew for the fourth consecutive year to $173 million, 10% above 2019. In 2020, IA revenue was $280 million, a decline of 6% from 2019 on an as-reported basis or 9% on a pro forma basis. As Mark noted, the COVID-related driven slowdown in manufacturing impacted Universal Robots, reducing revenue to $219 million, down 12% year-over-year. 
After troughing in Q2, UR grew in the second half of 2020 versus the first half of the year. In Q4, revenue grew 6% year-over-year, giving confidence heading into 2021. MiR grew slightly year-over-year with annual sales of $45 million and AutoGuide full year's sales grew on a pro forma basis. 
Now to our outlook for Q1. Sales are expected to be between $720 million and $780 million. Non-GAAP EPS range of $0.95 to $1.11 on 175 -- 179 million diluted shares. The first quarter guidance excludes amortization of acquired intangibles and the noncash imputed interest on the convertible debt. First quarter gross margins are estimated at 58% to 59%. First quarter OpEx running at 29% to 31% of first quarter sales, is about flat with Q4 at the midpoint of guidance. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 29%. 
Regarding our OpEx plans for 2021, we expect our OpEx to grow 8% to 10% from 2020's $840 million. Approximately 2 points of the spend will be in the back half of the year related to travel, which we expect to resume to pre-COVID levels along with trade shows. In our test portfolio, we plan to increase our spending in engineering, sales and marketing, primarily in Semi Test. In IA, we'll continue to invest to reinforce our competitive product and ecosystem position across the sector. Also in IA, go-to-market investments will be made to support expected revenue growth. 
Turning to capital expenditures. In 2020, our CapEx was $185 million. This was used primarily for customer demonstration equipment, operations engineering and initial spending on new facilities to replace leased ones in locations where we plan to grow over the next several years. We'll continue to invest in these new facilities in 2021, so CapEx is expected to be similar to 2020. Recall, we are buying land and developing it to eliminate lease costs and enable a more efficient spend profile over the mid- to long-term. 
For 2021, our GAAP tax rate is estimated at 15.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate is estimated at 16% based on current tax laws. 
Moving to our midterm earnings model. As you've seen with 2020, our non-GAAP EPS of $4.62, we've exceeded our 2022 earnings model 2 years early on the strength of our test businesses. We continue to have confidence in the long-term growth outlook for test, and we expect IA to return to high growth as the global industrial economy improved. When building our midterm model, given our year-on-year demand swings, we've seen both in test and IA, we use the average of 2019 and 2020 revenues as the baseline for our growth projections. From that baseline, we expect test revenue to grow 4% to 8% compounded and IA revenues to grow 20% to 35% through 2024. 
In test, we expect that growth will be driven by steady increase in device complexity across our businesses along with the high single-digit semiconductor unit growth trend line. In IA, market penetration of cobots and autonomous mobile robots and forklifts remains low while the range of applications they economically serve continues to expand, resulting in an attractive long-term growth opportunity for Teradyne. We expect this will drive 2024 company revenue to $3.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $6 at the midpoint of our estimates. 
Gross margin is modeled at 58% to 59%, OpEx as a percentage of sales will decline to 28% to 29% and non-GAAP operating margin will improve to 30% to 31%. The model assumes the current tax laws are in place. 
Shifting to capital allocation. We'll continue to balance a strong cash position to support our operating investments and potential M&A with direct shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. We are raising our minimum cash levels from $1 billion to $1.25 billion, with the $250 million increase tied to the increased valuations of potential acquisitions. Recall, we held $500 million for M&A and $500 million for severe economic downturn. We will also be increasing our cash balance in 2021 through 2023 to service our convertible bond, which comes due in December 2023. To date, $51 million of that bond has been redeemed early with payment planned in Q1, with the remaining face value of $409 million. 
Regarding share repurchases. In 2020, we bought back $1.5 million -- sorry, 1.5 million shares for $88 million at an average price of $58.32. Recall, we suspended our share repurchase program in April due to COVID-related uncertainty. We are replacing our prior approved program with a new share repurchase authorization of $2 billion with no fixed end date. We plan a minimum of $600 million of repurchases in 2021. As in the past, the plan has both a programmatic and opportunistic components. 
In summary, 2020 inflicted incredible human and economic hardship on societies across the world, and we're respectful of the widespread pain and loss. When the pandemic hit, I noted our priorities were the safety of our employees, supporting our customers and continued execution in achieving our financial objectives. The Teradyne community responded with a collaborative and supportive spirit, incredible energy, ingenuity and purpose, which delivered on all 3 of these priorities. I'm incredibly proud and thankful to be part of this team. 
We enter 2021 in the strongest position in our history. The work in 2020 has made us more resilient and prepared us for the strong market demand that we currently see in both test and IA. While our visibility for the full year is limited, we're confident and the underlying market fundamentals are competitive, diversified portfolio and our team, which will enable long-term growth prospects for the markets we serve. Collectively, we're excited to turn our new financial model into reality. 
With that, I'll turn things back to Andy."

So I'm going to speak more to the segment a bit, which I'll bundle compute and mobility together here. So yes, last year was incredibly strong in both our traditional mobility market because of the complexity growth of phones, which we alluded to and the fact that we did enter compute as a new segment. So we ended up with additional revenues in compute last year, that north of $50 million for the first year in that market. So as we think about this year, the issue of smartphone unit growth and complexity growth of the apps processor, the camera systems and such in the phones is part of the equation. And we have a reasonably good read on that. 
On the compute side, there's a lot of moving parts there. And there's a lot -- since it's a new market for us and a new market for some of our customers, that has the bigger range of potential outcomes for the year. So that's the one we're triangulating on. That could be up significantly over last year. It could be up modestly over last year. But at this point, we really can't be too specific."

But the other piece of color in terms of aggressive versus conservative that I'd add here is the recent investment profile of the front end with CapEx moving up into the $70 billion range, it's something we haven't modeled into our midterm plan. We've assumed that incremental fab capacity across the midterm would be sort of consistent with the rate that it's been added for the prior 4 years.

On SOC, it's really a little bit more difficult to see growth occurring this year because the impact of the trade restrictions on Huawei and HiSilicon are tremendous in terms of their buying power in the market historically. What they buy in both silicon and then test capacity for that silicon has been severely hampered. And then further restrictions on other companies like SMIC and such are much smaller factors, but tail or headwinds against growth. So I think SOC is likely to contract. Memory is going to grow.

And I think in my prepared remarks, I noted that we're getting back to travel and trade shows, which is a key point. You really -- if you look at it in 2 portfolios, we -- for the year, we're going to have leverage in the test business, where the growth in OpEx as a percentage will be lower, but the growth in the IA space, the OpEx growth is higher. And so the leverage from a -- like we're growing in the IA space, but we will see -- we should see a degree of leverage in the short-term in the test business. When you cascade that out to 2024, obviously, with the revenues that we're predicting in IA, I think Mark described it well. If we're growing at 50% and have a forecast to continue to grow, we'll continue to drive the investment. But as the growth starts to go down, let's say, below the Rule 40, then we'll start to drop more to the bottom line. That's how we're thinking about it."

When you look at the phone, there's various elements of the phone in terms of technology, depths processors, the modem, the cameras, the memory, those areas of the phone refresh and take leaps of complexity in different cadences. And in 2020, the apps processor and 5G -- basically, the apps processor had a big jump in complexity and 5G proliferated throughout all the phones. So as you look at 2021, the need for incremental 5G capacity, whereas in 2020, several, let's say, 100 million units worth of phones needed 5G capacity. This year, it will be less because the incremental unit growth there is one factor in incremental 5G capacity plus complexity growth of the 5G modem itself. So 5G is big in 2020, not as big in 2021. 
That leaves what's happening with the cameras, what's happening with power management, what's happening with the screen resolution. Other things could be balloons that pull it back up. But I do think you do have that 5G has happened for that one area of our mobility customer base."

So as it ebbs and flows back and forth, I wouldn't say there's a big ramification. 
On the U.S. domestic supply question, I think it's going to take a long time and many, many years of a steadfast set of incentives from the government for that to mature to something significant to our business. If we stick at that in the U.S. for 7, 8 years and really build up an infrastructure to manufacture semiconductors domestically, I think it could have a bit of a positive impact, but I think it's small. I don't think because semiconductors might be manufactured in the U.S., all of a sudden, there's a propensity that they're going to buy more Teradyne equipment. It's at the margin, but nothing I would bake in as a trend line to count on."

In our call today, I'll summarize our Q4 and 2020 full year highlights and provide some initial comments on our outlook for 2021. Sanjay will then provide the financial details, Q1 outlook and review our updated earnings model and capital allocation plans. 
Fourth quarter capped off an amazing year for Teradyne, with sales up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2019 and non-GAAP earnings per share up 25%. That brought our full year sales to just over $3.1 billion, up 36% and non-GAAP EPS to $4.62, up 62% versus 2019. These annual results, driven by strength in all of our test businesses more than made up for a soft industrial automation market that was impacted by COVID.
For the full year, our Semi Test business was especially strong, driven by investments in smartphone-related test capacity, our expansion into the compute sector of SOC with our new UltraFLEXplus product and the ramp of our Magnum EPIC product for DRAM test. 
In smartphones, global unit shipments contracted in 2020, but the growth in chipset complexity continued driving tester demand higher. Each subsystem on the phone, cellular power management, connectivity, display, cameras and application processing has its own cycle. And in 2020, both the processor and the cellular areas took big steps up in complexity. We use transistor count as a proxy for complexity, and the leading phone applications processors now exceed 10 billion transistors, growing double digits each generation. 
In 2020, we also saw the beginning of meaningful 5G silicon content, which necessitated a build-out of new tester capacity. Together, these listed the mobility test market in 2020, roughly $200 million to about $1.7 billion. This continuous refresh of smartphone silicon should be a tailwind for the semiconductor test business for the foreseeable future. 
In 2020, we also ramped our UltraFLEXplus product in the compute portion of the SOC market. Recall, this has historically been a $500 million to $600 million market, where we've had relatively low share. With the emergence of more players and applications in the processor market, including hyperscalers and AI, we expect this sector to outgrow the general market. The plus brings a powerful value proposition in managing the unique complexity, power dynamics, yield learning and time-to-market requirements of this segment. 
For 2020, we estimate the SOC market was in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion, up from about $3.3 billion in 2019. We estimate our SOC test market share moved up 15 points to about 54%. However, our internal view of share smooths out year-on-year swings due to the unique timing of investment cycles of both our and our competitors' customers. By that measure, we estimate our normalized 2020 SOC share at about 50%. 
Another notable growth segment of our Semi Test business in 2020 was memory. In this call, a year ago, we noted a significant design win for our Magnum EPIC product in the LPDDR5 portion of the DRAM market. This new entry into DRAM test ramped through the year and combined with healthy growth in our traditional NAND business, drove a 41% increase in memory sales from 2019. We estimate the market was about $900 million in 2020, up from $600 million in 2019 and our normalized 2020 memory share at about 42%.
Beyond Semi Test, our System Test group also had a great year delivering 43% growth, with the Storage Test business more than doubling from 2019. This is the second consecutive year of hyper growth in Storage Test driven by stedy test intensity growth of terabyte HDD drives and similar growth in the system level test of complex semiconductor devices. In our Wireless Test business, our LitePoint sales grew 10% from 2019, with solid demand for both our connectivity and cellular end markets. WiFi 6, also wideband test and increased investments in 5G related handset tests all contributed.
The performance of our test businesses more than offset the weaker results in our industrial automation business, which contracted 6% for the year. The global slowdown in manufacturing activity led to a 12% decline in sales at our Universal Robots unit. MiR, on the other hand, grew 1% as makers of ultraviolet disinfecting products recognize the value of an easier to deploy fully autonomous mobile robot. 
On a pro forma basis, AutoGuide also grew for the year. While the environment in IA was weaker than expected, the business troughed in the second quarter of 2020 and has improved dramatically in the second half, including record sales at UR in the fourth quarter. Collectively, the business returned to year-over-year growth in Q4, with UR growing 6% year-over-year and 41% sequential growth. With test slowing -- with test showing continued strength and industrial automation returning to growth, we are set up for another exciting year in 2021. Specifically, we are expecting a strong start to the year across all our businesses, with Q1 showing greater than 6% growth at the midpoint compared to Q1 of '19 -- sorry, Q1 of '20. 
As you know, full year visibility is always a challenge, as evidenced by our missing the strength of the test market and the decline of the IA market in our forecast just 1 year ago. That said, let me describe how we see things today, and of course, we'll keep you updated in future calls. I will preface my remarks with a note that the well-publicized surge in the forecasted semiconductor CapEx in 2021 is a very bullish sign. However, the impact on test is likely to be felt in 2022 and beyond as fab capacity built this year will drive additional testers in future years aligned to fab commissioning and ramping volumes and yields. 
In SOC test, the dynamics that made 2020 such a strong year continue into 2021. In addition, we have strengthening demand in the long dormant automotive test market with orders for our Eagle Test product line surging. Smartphone shipments are expected to grow in 2021 after contracting about 10% in 2020, and 5G content should increase. On the other hand, the SOC test market in China will likely be down in 2021 due to the expanded and full year effects of trade restrictions that were widened in 2020. Also, as always, tester demand from our largest customer will remain opaque until sometime in Q2.
Additionally, the global economic impact of COVID and its impact on electronics demand after a surge in 2020, it's hard to forecast with arguments for both positive and negative effects. Taking all of that into account, we have a bit wider range in our SOC market size estimate for 2021 at $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion, up slightly from 2020 at the midpoint. 
In memory test, the transition to LPDDR5 and DDR5 should gain momentum in 2021 and beyond. After growing about 50% in 2020, we view the memory market to be in the $800 million to $1 billion range in 2021, about even with 2020 at the midpoint. In Storage Test, the underlying demand drivers of increased density in HDD and increased complexity in semi devices driving system-level test remain in place. However, visibility is limited and annual shipments can be very lumpy. After more than tripling over the last 3 years, we expect 2021 sales to be in a band of plus or minus 20% from the 2020 level. For the rest of our test businesses, we expect growth in the 5% to 10% range in 2021. 
In Industrial Automation, 2021 is starting off on a strong footing. Barring any additional COVID-related manufacturing sector shutdowns, we expect to deliver the highest ever first quarter sales in each of our automation businesses, and we are well positioned to grow in excess of 30% for the year.
2020's results reflect well on Teradyne's strategy, execution and efficiency. Our test businesses show the successful results of R&D bets made in years past and enable us to increase those bets for the future. Our Industrial Automation investments continue undeterred by short-term impacts of COVID, and we are well positioned to capitalize on a world emerging to invest even more in automation to improve resilience and productivity. 
Equally significant, 2020 showed the resilience of Teradyne employees, our global suppliers and our operating model. In the face of unimaginable challenges across communities worldwide, the team dealt with health, safety and operation obstacles daily, met R&D milestones, executed steep new product ramps and delivered record shipments of SOC, memory and storage tech products to meet our customers' needs. We did all this while exercising the cost and schedule discipline expected at Teradyne. This is truly extraordinary, and I am very grateful to be part of such a powerful team. 
As we move into 2021, the outlook appears bright across all our markets. As Sanjay will detail, we are returning to our share repurchase program and have an active M&A pipeline. As 2020 taught us, no matter what comes our way in the short term, I am confident our global team and market strategy will deliver exciting long-term returns for our customers, investors and employees. 
Sanjay will now take you through the financial and modeling details. Sanjay?"
94728,701302321,2183960,"Teradyne, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Teradyne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2020. Looking forward, I'll provide our Q1 outlook, an update to our midterm earnings model and our capital allocation plans. N",1539,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2020. Looking forward, I'll provide our Q1 outlook, an update to our midterm earnings model and our capital allocation plans. 
Now to Q4. Revenues were $759 million, which were $19 million above the high end of the guidance range. We delivered a non-GAAP operating profit of 30% and EPS of $1.10. Semi Test revenue of $524 million was driven by SOC and memory test demand, enabling 5G handsets and higher speed flash and DRAM devices. System Test group had revenue of $104 million, down quarter-over-quarter driven by lower storage test shipments. Industrial Automation, or IA, revenue of $92 million had a seasonal increase over Q3 and delivered year-over-year growth for the first time in 2020. LitePoint revenue of $40 million was approximately flat with Q3 and down year-over-year with a decline in trailing edge connectivity products, partially offset by new sales of new connectivity technology like WiFi 6 and emerging UWB technology. 
Non-GAAP gross margins were 59%, on plan and up quarter-over-quarter due to product mix. You'll see our non-GAAP operating expenses were up $14 million to $224 million from the third quarter due to increased test spending to support design wins, higher payroll due to 4 extra days in the quarter and ongoing IA investments. We generated $222 million in free cash in the fourth quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 13% on a GAAP basis and 14.5% on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, it is 14.75% on a GAAP basis and 15.25% on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the year with cash and marketable securities of $1.55 billion. 
Turning to the full year results of 2020. Teradyne revenues of $3.12 billion grew $826 million or 36% year-over-year. $845 million of the growth was from our test portfolio, while IA contracted $18 million due to the pandemic-related slowdown. We had 1 customer that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2020, which we'll disclose in our 10-K filing. 
Gross margins for the year were 57% and operating profit was 30%, which is up from 25% in 2019. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $4.62, an increase of 62% over 2019. We generated $684 million in free cash in 2020. 
Breaking down the components of 2020 revenues. As outlined by Mark, SOC test revenues grew $595 million or 46% on strength in mobility, market-driven by increased by device complexity and new standards like 5G along with growing growth in computing. In memory, revenues were $383 million, up 41%. While LPDDR-related DRAM revenues were a significant contributor to our results, we also continue to see strong NAND test demand through the year. 
In System Test, sales grew for the fourth year running. Revenue of $410 million grew $122 million or 43% year-over-year, primarily on growth in Storage Test for both hard disk drive and system level test. Storage Test sales were $242 million, up from $115 million in 2019. We also saw annual growth in our Defense & Aerospace component of STG. 
At LitePoint, sales grew for the fourth consecutive year to $173 million, 10% above 2019. In 2020, IA revenue was $280 million, a decline of 6% from 2019 on an as-reported basis or 9% on a pro forma basis. As Mark noted, the COVID-related driven slowdown in manufacturing impacted Universal Robots, reducing revenue to $219 million, down 12% year-over-year. 
After troughing in Q2, UR grew in the second half of 2020 versus the first half of the year. In Q4, revenue grew 6% year-over-year, giving confidence heading into 2021. MiR grew slightly year-over-year with annual sales of $45 million, and AutoGuide full year's sales grew on a pro forma basis. 
Now to our outlook for Q1. Sales are expected to be between $720 million and $780 million. Non-GAAP EPS range of $0.95 to $1.11 on 175 -- 179 million diluted shares. The first quarter guidance excludes amortization of acquired intangibles and the noncash imputed interest on the convertible debt. First quarter gross margins are estimated at 58% to 59%. First quarter OpEx, running at 29% to 31% of first quarter sales, is about flat with Q4 at the midpoint of guidance. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 29%. 
Regarding our OpEx plans for 2021, we expect our OpEx to grow 8% to 10% from 2020's $840 million. Approximately 2 points of the spend will be in the back half of the year related to travel, which we expect to resume to pre-COVID levels along with trade shows. In our test portfolio, we plan to increase our spending in engineering, sales and marketing, primarily in Semi Test. In IA, we'll continue to invest to reinforce our competitive product and ecosystem position across the sector. Also in IA, go-to-market investments will be made to support expected revenue growth. 
Turning to capital expenditures. In 2020, our CapEx was $185 million. This was used primarily for customer demonstration equipment, operations, engineering and initial spending on new facilities to replace leased ones in locations where we plan to grow over the next several years. We'll continue to invest in these new facilities in 2021, so CapEx is expected to be similar to 2020. Recall, we are buying land and developing it to eliminate lease costs and enable a more efficient spend profile over the mid- to long-term. 
For 2021, our GAAP tax rate is estimated at 15.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate is estimated at 16% based on current tax laws. 
Moving to our midterm earnings model. As you've seen with 2020, our non-GAAP EPS of $4.62, we've exceeded our 2022 earnings model 2 years early on the strength of our test businesses. We continue to have confidence in the long-term growth outlook for test, and we expect IA to return to high growth as the global industrial economy improved. When building our midterm model, given our year-on-year demand swings, we've seen both in test and IA, we use the average of 2019 and 2020 revenues as the baseline for our growth projections. From that baseline, we expect test revenue to grow 4% to 8% compounded and IA revenues to grow 20% to 35% through 2024. 
In test, we expect that growth will be driven by steady increase in device complexity across our businesses along with the high single-digit semiconductor unit growth trend line. In IA, market penetration of cobots and autonomous mobile robots and forklifts remains low, while the range of applications they economically serve continues to expand, resulting in an attractive long-term growth opportunity for Teradyne. We expect this will drive 2024 company revenue to $3.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $6 at the midpoint of our estimates. 
Gross margin is modeled at 58% to 59%, OpEx as a percentage of sales will decline to 28% to 29% and non-GAAP operating margin will improve to 30% to 31%. The model assumes the current tax laws are in place. 
Shifting to capital allocation. We'll continue to balance a strong cash position to support our operating investments and potential M&A with direct shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. We are raising our minimum cash levels from $1 billion to $1.25 billion, with the $250 million increase tied to the increased valuations of potential acquisitions.
Recall, we held $500 million for M&A and $500 million for severe economic downturn. We will also be increasing our cash balance in 2021 through 2023 to service our convertible bond, which comes due in December 2023. To date, $51 million of that bond has been redeemed early with payment planned in Q1, with the remaining face value of $409 million. 
Regarding share repurchases. In 2020, we bought back $1.5 million -- sorry, 1.5 million shares for $88 million at an average price of $58.32. Recall, we suspended our share repurchase program in April due to COVID-related uncertainty. We are replacing our prior approved program with a new share repurchase authorization of $2 billion with no fixed end date. We plan a minimum of $600 million of repurchases in 2021. As in the past, the plan has both a programmatic and opportunistic components. 
In summary, 2020 inflicted incredible human and economic hardship on societies across the world, and we're respectful of the widespread pain and loss. When the pandemic hit, I noted our priorities were the safety of our employees, supporting our customers and continued execution in achieving our financial objectives. The Teradyne community responded with a collaborative and supportive spirit, incredible energy, ingenuity and purpose, which delivered on all 3 of these priorities. I'm incredibly proud and thankful to be part of this team. 
We enter 2021 in the strongest position in our history. The work in 2020 has made us more resilient and prepared us for the strong market demand that we currently see in both test and IA. While our visibility for the full year is limited, we're confident in the underlying market fundamentals, our competitive, diversified portfolio and our team, which will enable long-term growth prospects for the markets we serve. Collectively, we're excited to turn our new financial model into reality. 
With that, I'll turn things back to Andy."

So this year, that should be up at least $150 million, maybe $200 million. It's really right now a bit of a rush for capacity. And we don't know exactly when the demand profile of the orders are going to taper off here. So it could go higher if this persists. So that's the color on auto. 
In mobility, I think it's harder for us to see that at the moment because of the significant impact of our largest customer on both us and the market, which doesn't really become solidified until April-ish of the year. So we're looking at it sort of flat, plus or minus $1 million in mobility."

So as we think about this year, the issue of smartphone unit growth and complexity growth of the apps processor, the camera systems and such in the phones is part of the equation. And we have a reasonably good read on that. 
On the compute side, there's a lot of moving parts there.

And in memory, share was a little chunkier because there's only a few players there. So on the memory side, we could be in the mid to upper mid-40s by then, I would say, is one way to think about it.
But the other piece of color in terms of aggressive versus conservative that I'd add here is the recent investment profile of the front end with CapEx moving up into the $70 billion range, it's something we haven't modeled into our midterm plan. We've assumed that incremental fab capacity across the midterm would be sort of consistent with the rate that it's been added for the prior 4 years. So if $70-plus billion of investment in WFE is the new normal for the next 4 years, that's certainly going to drive more tests than we modeled."

On SOC, it's really a little bit more difficult to see growth occurring this year because the impact of the trade restrictions on Huawei and HiSilicon are tremendous in terms of their buying power in the market historically. What they buy in both silicon and then test capacity for that silicon has been severely hampered. And then further restrictions on other companies like SMIC and such are much smaller factors, but tail or headwinds against growth.
So I think SOC is likely to contract. Memory is going to grow. But net-net, it's not going to be hugely down, but it will probably be down a little bit on the test side of life."

So when you were going to your top customer, you presented a couple of scenarios. I know it's very tough to predict. But the scenarios you presented didn't include that revenue from that customer is down. I get that the compute piece is going to be up, but they're also not going to shrink this year. And in the past, that's been sort of a harbinger of a potential decline in the number of testers they buy unless they're willing to live with a much larger dye size, which may or may not be the case. So I'm just kind of wondering -- I'm not asking for any specifics on that customer. I'm just sort of wondering if you can look back in the past and draw in your past experience and say, well, yes, in the past, when that happens, that is sort of a harbinger of the potential that it could be down because you didn't present that as a down or as a possible outcome this year?"

I think it's a possible outcome, but let me go back to what I was outlining in my remarks. When you look at the phone, there's various elements of the phone in terms of technology, depths processors, the modem, the cameras, the memory, those areas of the phone refresh and take leaps of complexity in different cadences. And in 2020, the apps processor and 5G -- basically, the apps processor had a big jump in complexity, and 5G proliferated throughout all the phones.
So as you look at 2021, the need for incremental 5G capacity, whereas in 2020, several, let's say, 100 million units worth of phones needed 5G capacity. This year, it will be less because the incremental unit growth there is one factor in incremental 5G capacity plus complexity growth of the 5G modem itself. So 5G is big in 2020, not as big in 2021. 
That leaves what's happening with the cameras, what's happening with power management, what's happening with the screen resolution. Other things could be balloons that pull it back up. But I do think you do have that -- 5G has happened for that one area of our mobility customer base."

If for some reason, the restrictions on China ease and more indigenous Chinese makers start to grow again, I think it's neutral. As business shifted out of China in 2020, it was pretty much neutral to us. There was -- the customers that picked up the manufacturing of, let's say, applications processors or modems that would have been done by indigenous Chinese suppliers or Teradyne customers and Advantest customers and a proportion that isn't that different than it was in China. So as it ebbs and flows back and forth, I wouldn't say there's a big ramification. 
On the U.S. domestic supply question, I think it's going to take a long time and many, many years of a steadfast set of incentives from the government for that to mature to something significant to our business.
If we stick at that in the U.S. for 7, 8 years and really build up an infrastructure to manufacture semiconductors domestically, I think it could have a bit of a positive impact, but I think it's small. I don't think because semiconductors might be manufactured in the U.S., all of a sudden, there's a propensity that they're going to buy more Teradyne equipment. It's at the margin, but nothing I would bake in as a trend line to count on."

In our call today, I'll summarize our Q4 and 2020 full year highlights and provide some initial comments on our outlook for 2021. Sanjay will then provide the financial details, Q1 outlook and review our updated earnings model and capital allocation plans. 
Fourth quarter capped off an amazing year for Teradyne, with sales up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2019 and non-GAAP earnings per share up 25%. That brought our full year sales to just over $3.1 billion, up 36% and non-GAAP EPS to $4.62, up 62% versus 2019. These annual results, driven by strength in all of our test businesses more than made up for a soft industrial automation market that was impacted by COVID.
For the full year, our Semi Test business was especially strong, driven by investments in smartphone-related test capacity, our expansion into the compute sector of SOC with our new UltraFLEXplus product and the ramp of our Magnum EPIC product for DRAM test. 
In smartphones, global unit shipments contracted in 2020, but the growth in chipset complexity continued driving tester demand higher. Each subsystem on the phone, cellular power management, connectivity, display, cameras and application processing has its own cycle. And in 2020, both the processor and the cellular areas took big steps up in complexity. We use transistor count as a proxy for complexity, and the leading phone applications processors now exceed 10 billion transistors, growing double digits each generation. 
In 2020, we also saw the beginning of meaningful 5G silicon content, which necessitated a build-out of new tester capacity. Together, these lifted the mobility test market in 2020, roughly $200 million to about $1.7 billion. This continuous refresh of smartphone silicon should be a tailwind for the semiconductor test business for the foreseeable future. 
In 2020, we also ramped our UltraFLEXplus product in the compute portion of the SOC market. Recall, this has historically been a $500 million to $600 million market, where we've had relatively low share. With the emergence of more players and applications in the processor market, including hyperscalers and AI, we expect this sector to outgrow the general market. The plus brings a powerful value proposition in managing the unique complexity, power dynamics, yield learning and time-to-market requirements of this segment. 
For 2020, we estimate the SOC market was in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion, up from about $3.3 billion in 2019. We estimate our SOC test market share moved up 15 points to about 54%. However, our internal view of share smooths out year-on-year swings due to the unique timing of investment cycles of both our and our competitors' customers. By that measure, we estimate our normalized 2020 SOC share at about 50%. 
Another notable growth segment of our Semi Test business in 2020 was memory. In this call, a year ago, we noted a significant design win for our Magnum EPIC product in the LPDDR5 portion of the DRAM market. This new entry into DRAM test ramped through the year and combined with healthy growth in our traditional NAND business, drove a 41% increase in memory sales from 2019. We estimate the market was about $900 million in 2020, up from $600 million in 2019 and our normalized 2020 memory share at about 42%.
Beyond Semi Test, our System Test group also had a great year delivering 43% growth, with the Storage Test business more than doubling from 2019. This is the second consecutive year of hyper growth in Storage Test driven by steady test intensity growth of terabyte HDD drives and similar growth in the system level test of complex semiconductor devices. 
In our Wireless Test business at LitePoint sales grew 10% from 2019, with solid demand for both our connectivity and cellular end markets. WiFi 6, ultra-wideband test and increased investments in 5G-related handset tests all contributed. 
The performance of our test businesses more than offset the weaker results in our industrial automation business, which contracted 6% for the year. The global slowdown in manufacturing activity led to a 12% decline in sales at our Universal Robots unit. MiR, on the other hand, grew 1% as makers of ultraviolet disinfecting products recognize the value of an easier to deploy fully autonomous mobile robot. 
On a pro forma basis, AutoGuide also grew for the year. While the environment in IA was weaker than expected, the business troughed in the second quarter of 2020 and has improved dramatically in the second half, including record sales at UR in the fourth quarter. Collectively, the businesses returned to year-over-year growth in Q4, with UR growing 6% year-over-year and 41% sequential growth. With test slowing -- with test showing continued strength and industrial automation returning to growth, we are set up for another exciting year in 2021. Specifically, we are expecting a strong start to the year across all our businesses, with Q1 showing greater than 6% growth at the midpoint compared to Q1 of '19 -- sorry, Q1 of '20. 
As you know, full year visibility is always a challenge, as evidenced by our missing the strength of the test market and the decline of the IA market in our forecast just 1 year ago. That said, let me describe how we see things today, and of course, we'll keep you updated in future calls. I will preface my remarks with a note that the well-publicized surge in the forecasted semiconductor CapEx in 2021 is a very bullish sign. However, the impact on test is likely to be felt in 2022 and beyond as fab capacity built this year will drive additional testers in future years aligned to fab commissioning and ramping volumes and yields. 
In SOC test, the dynamics that made 2020 such a strong year continue into 2021. In addition, we have strengthening demand in the long dormant automotive test market with orders for our Eagle Test product line surging. Smartphone shipments are expected to grow in 2021 after contracting about 10% in 2020, and 5G content should increase. On the other hand, the SOC test market in China will likely be down in 2021 due to the expanded and full year effects of trade restrictions that were widened in 2020. Also, as always, tester demand from our largest customer will remain opaque until sometime in Q2.
Additionally, the global economic impact of COVID and its impact on electronics demand after a surge in 2020, it's hard to forecast with arguments for both positive and negative effects. Taking all of that into account, we have a bit wider range in our SOC market size estimate for 2021 at $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion, up slightly from 2020 at the midpoint. 
In memory test, the transition to LPDDR5 and DDR5 should gain momentum in 2021 and beyond. After growing about 50% in 2020, we view the memory market to be in the $800 million to $1 billion range in 2021, about even with 2020 at the midpoint. In Storage Test, the underlying demand drivers of increased density in HDD and increased complexity in semi devices driving system-level test remain in place. However, visibility is limited and annual shipments can be very lumpy. After more than tripling over the last 3 years, we expect 2021 sales to be in a band of plus or minus 20% from the 2020 level. For the rest of our test businesses, we expect growth in the 5% to 10% range in 2021. 
In Industrial Automation, 2021 is starting off on a strong footing. Barring any additional COVID-related manufacturing sector shutdowns, we expect to deliver the highest ever first quarter sales in each of our automation businesses, and we are well positioned to grow in excess of 30% for the year.
2020's results reflect well on Teradyne's strategy, execution and efficiency. Our test businesses show the successful results of R&D bets made in years past and enable us to increase those bets for the future. Our Industrial Automation investments continue undeterred by short-term impacts of COVID, and we are well positioned to capitalize on a world emerging to invest even more in automation to improve resilience and productivity. 
Equally significant, 2020 showed the resilience of Teradyne employees, our global suppliers and our operating model. In the face of unimaginable challenges across communities worldwide, the team dealt with health, safety and operation obstacles daily, met R&D milestones, executed steep new product ramps and delivered record shipments of SOC, memory and storage tech products to meet our customers' needs. We did all this while exercising the cost and schedule discipline expected at Teradyne. This is truly extraordinary, and I am very grateful to be part of such a powerful team. 
As we move into 2021, the outlook appears bright across all our markets. As Sanjay will detail, we are returning to our share repurchase program and have an active M&A pipeline. As 2020 taught us, no matter what comes our way in the short term, I am confident our global team and market strategy will deliver exciting long-term returns for our customers, investors and employees. 
Sanjay will now take you through the financial and modeling details. Sanjay?"

Today, I'll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2020. Looking forward, I'll provide our Q1 outlook, an update to our midterm earnings model and our capital allocation plans. N",1539,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2020. Looking forward, I'll provide our Q1 outlook, an update to our midterm earnings model and our capital allocation plans. 
Now to Q4. Revenues were $759 million, which were $19 million above the high end of the guidance range. We delivered a non-GAAP operating profit of 30% and EPS of $1.10. Semi Test revenue of $524 million was driven by SOC and memory test demand, enabling 5G handsets and higher speed flash and DRAM devices. System Test group had revenue of $104 million, down quarter-over-quarter driven by lower storage test shipments. Industrial Automation, or IA, revenue of $92 million had a seasonal increase over Q3 and delivered year-over-year growth for the first time in 2020. LitePoint revenue of $40 million was approximately flat with Q3 and down year-over-year with a decline in trailing edge connectivity products, partially offset by new sales of new connectivity technology like WiFi 6 and emerging UWB technology. 
Non-GAAP gross margins were 59%, on plan and up quarter-over-quarter due to product mix. You'll see our non-GAAP operating expenses were up $14 million to $224 million from the third quarter due to increased test spending to support design wins, higher payroll due to 4 extra days in the quarter and ongoing IA investments. We generated $222 million in free cash in the fourth quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 13% on a GAAP basis and 14.5% on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, it is 14.75% on a GAAP basis and 15.25% on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the year with cash and marketable securities of $1.55 billion. 
Turning to the full year results of 2020. Teradyne revenues of $3.12 billion grew $826 million or 36% year-over-year. $845 million of the growth was from our test portfolio, while IA contracted $18 million due to the pandemic-related slowdown. We had 1 customer that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2020, which we'll disclose in our 10-K filing. 
Gross margins for the year were 57% and operating profit was 30%, which is up from 25% in 2019. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $4.62, an increase of 62% over 2019. We generated $684 million in free cash in 2020. 
Breaking down the components of 2020 revenues. As outlined by Mark, SOC test revenues grew $595 million or 46% on strength in mobility, market-driven by increased by device complexity and new standards like 5G along with growing growth in computing. In memory, revenues were $383 million, up 41%. While LPDDR-related DRAM revenues were a significant contributor to our results, we also continue to see strong NAND test demand through the year. 
In System Test, sales grew for the fourth year running. Revenue of $410 million grew $122 million or 43% year-over-year, primarily on growth in Storage Test for both hard disk drive and system level test. Storage Test sales were $242 million, up from $115 million in 2019. We also saw annual growth in our Defense & Aerospace component of STG. 
At LitePoint, sales grew for the fourth consecutive year to $173 million, 10% above 2019. In 2020, IA revenue was $280 million, a decline of 6% from 2019 on an as-reported basis or 9% on a pro forma basis. As Mark noted, the COVID-related driven slowdown in manufacturing impacted Universal Robots, reducing revenue to $219 million, down 12% year-over-year. 
After troughing in Q2, UR grew in the second half of 2020 versus the first half of the year. In Q4, revenue grew 6% year-over-year, giving confidence heading into 2021. MiR grew slightly year-over-year with annual sales of $45 million, and AutoGuide full year's sales grew on a pro forma basis. 
Now to our outlook for Q1. Sales are expected to be between $720 million and $780 million. Non-GAAP EPS range of $0.95 to $1.11 on 175 -- 179 million diluted shares. The first quarter guidance excludes amortization of acquired intangibles and the noncash imputed interest on the convertible debt. First quarter gross margins are estimated at 58% to 59%. First quarter OpEx, running at 29% to 31% of first quarter sales, is about flat with Q4 at the midpoint of guidance. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 29%. 
Regarding our OpEx plans for 2021, we expect our OpEx to grow 8% to 10% from 2020's $840 million. Approximately 2 points of the spend will be in the back half of the year related to travel, which we expect to resume to pre-COVID levels along with trade shows. In our test portfolio, we plan to increase our spending in engineering, sales and marketing, primarily in Semi Test. In IA, we'll continue to invest to reinforce our competitive product and ecosystem position across the sector. Also in IA, go-to-market investments will be made to support expected revenue growth. 
Turning to capital expenditures. In 2020, our CapEx was $185 million. This was used primarily for customer demonstration equipment, operations, engineering and initial spending on new facilities to replace leased ones in locations where we plan to grow over the next several years. We'll continue to invest in these new facilities in 2021, so CapEx is expected to be similar to 2020. Recall, we are buying land and developing it to eliminate lease costs and enable a more efficient spend profile over the mid- to long-term. 
For 2021, our GAAP tax rate is estimated at 15.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate is estimated at 16% based on current tax laws. 
Moving to our midterm earnings model. As you've seen with 2020, our non-GAAP EPS of $4.62, we've exceeded our 2022 earnings model 2 years early on the strength of our test businesses. We continue to have confidence in the long-term growth outlook for test, and we expect IA to return to high growth as the global industrial economy improves. When building our midterm model, given our year-on-year demand swings, we've seen both in test and IA, we use the average of 2019 and 2020 revenues as the baseline for our growth projections. From that baseline, we expect test revenue to grow 4% to 8% compounded and IA revenues to grow 20% to 35% through 2024. 
In test, we expect that growth will be driven by steady increase in device complexity across our businesses along with the high single-digit semiconductor unit growth trend line. In IA, market penetration of cobots and autonomous mobile robots and forklifts remains low, while the range of applications they economically serve continues to expand, resulting in an attractive long-term growth opportunity for Teradyne. We expect this will drive 2024 company revenue to $3.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $6 at the midpoint of our estimates. 
Gross margin is modeled at 58% to 59%, OpEx as a percentage of sales will decline to 28% to 29% and non-GAAP operating margin will improve to 30% to 31%. The model assumes the current tax laws are in place. 
Shifting to capital allocation. We'll continue to balance a strong cash position to support our operating investments and potential M&A with direct shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. We are raising our minimum cash levels from $1 billion to $1.25 billion, with the $250 million increase tied to the increased valuations of potential acquisitions.
Recall, we held $500 million for M&A and $500 million for severe economic downturn. We will also be increasing our cash balance in 2021 through 2023 to service our convertible bond, which comes due in December 2023. To date, $51 million of that bond has been redeemed early with payment planned in Q1, with the remaining face value of $409 million. 
Regarding share repurchases. In 2020, we bought back $1.5 million -- sorry, 1.5 million shares for $88 million at an average price of $58.32. Recall, we suspended our share repurchase program in April due to COVID-related uncertainty. We are replacing our prior approved program with a new share repurchase authorization of $2 billion with no fixed end date. We plan a minimum of $600 million of repurchases in 2021. As in the past, the plan has both a programmatic and opportunistic components. 
In summary, 2020 inflicted incredible human and economic hardship on societies across the world, and we're respectful of the widespread pain and loss. When the pandemic hit, I noted our priorities were the safety of our employees, supporting our customers and continued execution in achieving our financial objectives. The Teradyne community responded with a collaborative and supportive spirit, incredible energy, ingenuity and purpose, which delivered on all 3 of these priorities. I'm incredibly proud and thankful to be part of this team. 
We enter 2021 in the strongest position in our history. The work in 2020 has made us more resilient and prepared us for the strong market demand that we currently see in both test and IA. While our visibility for the full year is limited, we're confident in the underlying market fundamentals, our competitive, diversified portfolio and our team, which will enable long-term growth prospects for the markets we serve. Collectively, we're excited to turn our new financial model into reality. 
With that, I'll turn things back to Andy."

In mobility, I think it's harder for us to see that at the moment because of the significant impact of our largest customer on both us and the market, which doesn't really become solidified until April-ish of the year. So we're looking at it sort of flat, plus or minus $100 million in mobility."

So as we think about this year, the issue of smartphone unit growth and complexity growth of the apps processor, the camera systems and such in the phones is part of the equation. And we have a reasonably good read on that.

But the other piece of color in terms of aggressive versus conservative that I'd add here is the recent investment profile of the front end with CapEx moving up into the $70 billion range, is something we haven't modeled into our midterm plan. We've assumed that incremental fab capacity across the midterm would be sort of consistent with the rate that it's been added for the prior 4 years. So if $70-plus billion of investment in WFE is the new normal for the next 4 years, that's certainly going to drive more tests than we modeled."

On SOC, it's really a little bit more difficult to see growth occurring this year because the impact of the trade restrictions on Huawei and HiSilicon are tremendous in terms of their buying power in the market historically. What they buy in both silicon and then test capacity for that silicon has been severely hampered. And then further restrictions on other companies like SMIC and such are much smaller factors, but tail or headwinds against growth.
So I think SOC is likely to contract. Memory is going to grow. But net-net, it's not going to be hugely down, but it will probably be down a little bit on the test side of life."

And in 2020, the apps processor and 5G -- basically, the apps processor had a big jump in complexity, and 5G proliferated throughout all the phones.
So as you look at 2021, the need for incremental 5G capacity, whereas in 2020, several, let's say, 100 million units worth of phones needed 5G capacity. This year, it will be less because the incremental unit growth there is one factor in incremental 5G capacity plus complexity growth of the 5G modem itself. So 5G is big in 2020, not as big in 2021. 
That leaves what's happening with the cameras, what's happening with power management, what's happening with the screen resolution. Other things could be balloons that pull it back up. But I do think you do have that -- 5G has happened for that one area of our mobility customer base."

On the U.S. domestic supply question, I think it's going to take a long time and many, many years of a steadfast set of incentives from the government for that to mature to something significant to our business.
If we stick at that in the U.S. for 7, 8 years and really build up an infrastructure to manufacture semiconductors domestically, I think it could have a bit of a positive impact, but I think it's small.

I'm just kind of curious, to the extent that the top line proves to be conservative, how should we think about incremental operating margins above sort of the high end of the target model? Or maybe another way of thinking about it, as IA gets scale, where do we think the longer-term op margin of the business can go?"

In our call today, I'll summarize our Q4 and 2020 full year highlights and provide some initial comments on our outlook for 2021. Sanjay will then provide the financial details, Q1 outlook and review our updated earnings model and capital allocation plans. 
Fourth quarter capped off an amazing year for Teradyne, with sales up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2019 and non-GAAP earnings per share up 25%. That brought our full year sales to just over $3.1 billion, up 36% and non-GAAP EPS to $4.62, up 62% versus 2019. These annual results, driven by strength in all of our test businesses more than made up for a soft industrial automation market that was impacted by COVID.
For the full year, our Semi Test business was especially strong, driven by investments in smartphone-related test capacity, our expansion into the compute sector of SOC with our new UltraFLEXplus product and the ramp of our Magnum EPIC product for DRAM test. 
In smartphones, global unit shipments contracted in 2020, but the growth in chipset complexity continued driving tester demand higher. Each subsystem on the phone, cellular power management, connectivity, display, cameras and application processing has its own cycle. And in 2020, both the processor and the cellular areas took big steps up in complexity. We use transistor count as a proxy for complexity, and the leading phone applications processors now exceed 10 billion transistors, growing double digits each generation. 
In 2020, we also saw the beginning of meaningful 5G silicon content, which necessitated a build-out of new tester capacity. Together, these lifted the mobility test market in 2020, roughly $200 million to about $1.7 billion. This continuous refresh of smartphone silicon should be a tailwind for the semiconductor test business for the foreseeable future. 
In 2020, we also ramped our UltraFLEXplus product in the compute portion of the SOC market. Recall, this has historically been a $500 million to $600 million market, where we've had relatively low share. With the emergence of more players and applications in the processor market, including hyperscalers and AI, we expect this sector to outgrow the general market. The plus brings a powerful value proposition in managing the unique complexity, power dynamics, yield learning and time-to-market requirements of this segment. 
For 2020, we estimate the SOC market was in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion, up from about $3.3 billion in 2019. We estimate our SOC test market share moved up 15 points to about 54%. However, our internal view of share smooths out year-on-year swings due to the unique timing of investment cycles of both our and our competitors' customers. By that measure, we estimate our normalized 2020 SOC share at about 50%. 
Another notable growth segment of our Semi Test business in 2020 was memory. In this call, a year ago, we noted a significant design win for our Magnum EPIC product in the LPDDR5 portion of the DRAM market. This new entry into DRAM test ramped through the year and combined with healthy growth in our traditional NAND business, drove a 41% increase in memory sales from 2019. We estimate the market was about $900 million in 2020, up from $600 million in 2019 and our normalized 2020 memory share at about 42%.
Beyond Semi Test, our System Test group also had a great year delivering 43% growth, with the Storage Test business more than doubling from 2019. This is the second consecutive year of hyper growth in Storage Test driven by steady test intensity growth of terabyte HDD drives and similar growth in the system level test of complex semiconductor devices. 
In our Wireless Test business at LitePoint sales grew 10% from 2019, with solid demand for both our connectivity and cellular end markets. WiFi 6, ultra-wideband test and increased investments in 5G-related handset tests all contributed. 
The performance of our test businesses more than offset the weaker results in our industrial automation business, which contracted 6% for the year. The global slowdown in manufacturing activity led to a 12% decline in sales at our Universal Robots unit. MiR, on the other hand, grew 1% as makers of ultraviolet disinfecting products recognize the value of an easier to deploy fully autonomous mobile robot. 
On a pro forma basis, AutoGuide also grew for the year. While the environment in IA was weaker than expected, the business troughed in the second quarter of 2020 and has improved dramatically in the second half, including record sales at UR in the fourth quarter. Collectively, the businesses returned to year-over-year growth in Q4, with UR growing 6% year-over-year and 41% sequential growth. With test slowing -- with test showing continued strength and industrial automation returning to growth, we are set up for another exciting year in 2021. Specifically, we are expecting a strong start to the year across all our businesses, with Q1 showing greater than 6% growth at the midpoint compared to Q1 of '19 -- sorry, Q1 of '20. 
As you know, full year visibility is always a challenge, as evidenced by our missing the strength of the test market and the decline of the IA market in our forecast just 1 year ago. That said, let me describe how we see things today, and of course, we'll keep you updated in future calls. I will preface my remarks with a note that the well-publicized surge in the forecasted semiconductor CapEx in 2021 is a very bullish sign. However, the impact on test is likely to be felt in 2022 and beyond as fab capacity built this year will drive additional testers in future years aligned to fab commissioning and ramping volumes and yields. 
In SOC test, the dynamics that made 2020 such a strong year continue into 2021. In addition, we have strengthening demand in the long dormant automotive test market with orders for our Eagle Test product line surging. Smartphone shipments are expected to grow in 2021 after contracting about 10% in 2020, and 5G content should increase. On the other hand, the SOC test market in China will likely be down in 2021 due to the expanded and full year effects of trade restrictions that were widened in 2020. Also, as always, tester demand from our largest customer will remain opaque until sometime in Q2.
Additionally, the global economic impact of COVID and its impact on electronics demand after a surge in 2020, it's hard to forecast with arguments for both positive and negative effects. Taking all of that into account, we have a bit wider range in our SOC market size estimate for 2021 at $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion, up slightly from 2020 at the midpoint. 
In memory test, the transition to LPDDR5 and DDR5 should gain momentum in 2021 and beyond. After growing about 50% in 2020, we view the memory market to be in the $800 million to $1 billion range in 2021, about even with 2020 at the midpoint. In Storage Test, the underlying demand drivers of increased density in HDD and increased complexity in semi devices driving system-level test remain in place. However, visibility is limited and annual shipments can be very lumpy. After more than tripling over the last 3 years, we expect 2021 sales to be in a band of plus or minus 20% from the 2020 level. For the rest of our test businesses, we expect growth in the 5% to 10% range in 2021. 
In Industrial Automation, 2021 is starting off on a strong footing. Barring any additional COVID-related manufacturing sector shutdowns, we expect to deliver the highest ever first quarter sales in each of our automation businesses, and we are well positioned to grow in excess of 30% for the year.
2020's results reflect well on Teradyne's strategy, execution and efficiency. Our test businesses show the successful results of R&D bets made in years past and enable us to increase those bets for the future. Our Industrial Automation investments continue undeterred by short-term impacts of COVID, and we are well positioned to capitalize on a world emerging to invest even more in automation to improve resilience and productivity. 
Equally significant, 2020 showed the resilience of Teradyne employees, our global suppliers and our operating model. In the face of unimaginable challenges across communities worldwide, the team dealt with health, safety and operation obstacles daily, met R&D milestones, executed steep new product ramps and delivered record shipments of SOC, memory and storage tech products to meet our customers' needs. We did all this while exercising the cost and schedule discipline expected at Teradyne. This is truly extraordinary, and I am very grateful to be part of such a powerful team. 
As we move into 2021, the outlook appears bright across all our markets. As Sanjay will detail, we are returning to our share repurchase program and have an active M&A pipeline. As 2020 taught us, no matter what comes our way in the short term, I am confident our global team and market strategy will deliver exciting long-term returns for our customers, investors and employees. 
Sanjay will now take you through the financial and modeling details. Sanjay?"

Today, I'll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2020. Looking forward, I'll provide our Q1 outlook, an update to our midterm earnings model and our capital allocation plans. N",1539,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2020. Looking forward, I'll provide our Q1 outlook, an update to our midterm earnings model and our capital allocation plans. 
Now to Q4. Revenues were $759 million, which were $19 million above the high end of the guidance range. We delivered a non-GAAP operating profit of 30% and EPS of $1.10. Semi Test revenue of $524 million was driven by SOC and memory test demand, enabling 5G handsets and higher speed flash and DRAM devices. System Test group had revenue of $104 million, down quarter-over-quarter driven by lower storage test shipments. Industrial Automation, or IA, revenue of $92 million had a seasonal increase over Q3 and delivered year-over-year growth for the first time in 2020. LitePoint revenue of $40 million was approximately flat with Q3 and down year-over-year with a decline in trailing edge connectivity products, partially offset by new sales of new connectivity technology like WiFi 6 and emerging UWB technology. 
Non-GAAP gross margins were 59%, on plan and up quarter-over-quarter due to product mix. You'll see our non-GAAP operating expenses were up $14 million to $224 million from the third quarter due to increased test spending to support design wins, higher payroll due to 4 extra days in the quarter and ongoing IA investments. We generated $222 million in free cash in the fourth quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 13% on a GAAP basis and 14.5% on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, it is 14.75% on a GAAP basis and 15.25% on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the year with cash and marketable securities of $1.55 billion. 
Turning to the full year results of 2020. Teradyne revenues of $3.12 billion grew $826 million or 36% year-over-year. $845 million of the growth was from our test portfolio, while IA contracted $18 million due to the pandemic-related slowdown. We had 1 customer that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2020, which we'll disclose in our 10-K filing. 
Gross margins for the year were 57% and operating profit was 30%, which is up from 25% in 2019. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $4.62, an increase of 62% over 2019. We generated $684 million in free cash in 2020. 
Breaking down the components of 2020 revenues. As outlined by Mark, SOC test revenues grew $595 million or 46% on strength in mobility, market-driven by increased by device complexity and new standards like 5G along with growing growth in computing. In memory, revenues were $383 million, up 41%. While LPDDR-related DRAM revenues were a significant contributor to our results, we also continue to see strong NAND test demand through the year. 
In System Test, sales grew for the fourth year running. Revenue of $410 million grew $122 million or 43% year-over-year, primarily on growth in Storage Test for both hard disk drive and system level test. Storage Test sales were $242 million, up from $115 million in 2019. We also saw annual growth in our Defense & Aerospace component of STG. 
At LitePoint, sales grew for the fourth consecutive year to $173 million, 10% above 2019. In 2020, IA revenue was $280 million, a decline of 6% from 2019 on an as-reported basis or 9% on a pro forma basis. As Mark noted, the COVID-related driven slowdown in manufacturing impacted Universal Robots, reducing revenue to $219 million, down 12% year-over-year. 
After troughing in Q2, UR grew in the second half of 2020 versus the first half of the year. In Q4, revenue grew 6% year-over-year, giving confidence heading into 2021. MiR grew slightly year-over-year with annual sales of $45 million, and AutoGuide full year's sales grew on a pro forma basis. 
Now to our outlook for Q1. Sales are expected to be between $720 million and $780 million. Non-GAAP EPS range of $0.95 to $1.11 on 175 -- 179 million diluted shares. The first quarter guidance excludes amortization of acquired intangibles and the noncash imputed interest on the convertible debt. First quarter gross margins are estimated at 58% to 59%. First quarter OpEx, running at 29% to 31% of first quarter sales, is about flat with Q4 at the midpoint of guidance. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 29%. 
Regarding our OpEx plans for 2021, we expect our OpEx to grow 8% to 10% from 2020's $840 million. Approximately 2 points of the spend will be in the back half of the year related to travel, which we expect to resume to pre-COVID levels along with trade shows. In our test portfolio, we plan to increase our spending in engineering, sales and marketing, primarily in Semi Test. In IA, we'll continue to invest to reinforce our competitive product and ecosystem position across the sector. Also in IA, go-to-market investments will be made to support expected revenue growth. 
Turning to capital expenditures. In 2020, our CapEx was $185 million. This was used primarily for customer demonstration equipment, operations, engineering and initial spending on new facilities to replace leased ones in locations where we plan to grow over the next several years. We'll continue to invest in these new facilities in 2021, so CapEx is expected to be similar to 2020. Recall, we are buying land and developing it to eliminate lease costs and enable a more efficient spend profile over the mid- to long-term. 
For 2021, our GAAP tax rate is estimated at 15.5% and our non-GAAP tax rate is estimated at 16% based on current tax laws. 
Moving to our midterm earnings model. As you've seen with 2020, our non-GAAP EPS of $4.62, we've exceeded our 2022 earnings model 2 years early on the strength of our test businesses. We continue to have confidence in the long-term growth outlook for test, and we expect IA to return to high growth as the global industrial economy improves. When building our midterm model, given our year-on-year demand swings, we've seen both in test and IA, we use the average of 2019 and 2020 revenues as the baseline for our growth projections. From that baseline, we expect test revenue to grow 4% to 8% compounded and IA revenues to grow 20% to 35% through 2024. 
In test, we expect that growth will be driven by steady increase in device complexity across our businesses along with the high single-digit semiconductor unit growth trend line. In IA, market penetration of cobots and autonomous mobile robots and forklifts remains low, while the range of applications they economically serve continues to expand, resulting in an attractive long-term growth opportunity for Teradyne. We expect this will drive 2024 company revenue to $3.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $6 at the midpoint of our estimates. 
Gross margin is modeled at 58% to 59%, OpEx as a percentage of sales will decline to 28% to 29% and non-GAAP operating margin will improve to 30% to 31%. The model assumes the current tax laws are in place. 
Shifting to capital allocation. We'll continue to balance a strong cash position to support our operating investments and potential M&A with direct shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. We are raising our minimum cash levels from $1 billion to $1.25 billion, with the $250 million increase tied to the increased valuations of potential acquisitions.
Recall, we held $500 million for M&A and $500 million for severe economic downturn. We will also be increasing our cash balance in 2021 through 2023 to service our convertible bond, which comes due in December 2023. To date, $51 million of that bond has been redeemed early with payment planned in Q1, with the remaining face value of $409 million. 
Regarding share repurchases. In 2020, we bought back $1.5 million -- sorry, 1.5 million shares for $88 million at an average price of $58.32. Recall, we suspended our share repurchase program in April due to COVID-related uncertainty. We are replacing our prior approved program with a new share repurchase authorization of $2 billion with no fixed end date. We plan a minimum of $600 million of repurchases in 2021. As in the past, the plan has both a programmatic and opportunistic components. 
In summary, 2020 inflicted incredible human and economic hardship on societies across the world, and we're respectful of the widespread pain and loss. When the pandemic hit, I noted our priorities were the safety of our employees, supporting our customers and continued execution in achieving our financial objectives. The Teradyne community responded with a collaborative and supportive spirit, incredible energy, ingenuity and purpose, which delivered on all 3 of these priorities. I'm incredibly proud and thankful to be part of this team. 
We enter 2021 in the strongest position in our history. The work in 2020 has made us more resilient and prepared us for the strong market demand that we currently see in both test and IA. While our visibility for the full year is limited, we're confident in the underlying market fundamentals, our competitive, diversified portfolio and our team, which will enable long-term growth prospects for the markets we serve. Collectively, we're excited to turn our new financial model into reality. 
With that, I'll turn things back to Andy."

But yes, last year, if you recall, there was also a significant step-up in the hundreds of millions of units of millimeter wave-enabled phones were brought to market last year. So if you add another 200 million to 300 million additional millimeter wave-enabled units this year and, let's say, that brings the global total to 600 million units out of 1.4 billion, you're essentially adding about as much capacity, maybe a little bit more because there'll be more than -- let's say, last year, added 250 million, this year, might add 350 million units. So yes, there will be a little bit of growth in additional millimeter wave test capacity. But last year was a pretty big year, too."

So we ended up with additional revenues in compute last year, that north of $50 million for the first year in that market.
So as we think about this year, the issue of smartphone unit growth and complexity growth of the apps processor, the camera systems and such in the phones is part of the equation. And we have a reasonably good read on that. 
On the compute side, there's a lot of moving parts there. And there's a lot -- since it's a new market for us and a new market for some of our customers, that has the bigger range of potential outcomes for the year. So that's the one we're triangulating on.

And in memory, share was a little chunkier because there's only a few players there. So on the memory side, we could be in the mid to upper mid-40s by then, I would say, is one way to think about it.
But the other piece of color in terms of aggressive versus conservative that I'd add here is the recent investment profile of the front end with CapEx moving up into the $70 billion range, is something we haven't modeled into our midterm plan. We've assumed that incremental fab capacity across the midterm would be sort of consistent with the rate that it's been added for the prior 4 years.

On the memory side, there will be growth in China this year in test as well and we -- or we expect that at least. And so that's a healthy, growing midt",170,"Yes. So if you look at China, I think you need to separate memory and SOC because it's quite different. On the memory side, there will be growth in China this year in test as well and we -- or we expect that at least. And so that's a healthy, growing midterm profile, I'd say, for China. 
On SOC, it's really a little bit more difficult to see growth occurring this year because the impact of the trade restrictions on Huawei and HiSilicon are tremendous in terms of their buying power in the market historically. What they buy in both silicon and then test capacity for that silicon has been severely hampered. And then further restrictions on other companies like SMIC and such are much smaller factors, but tail or headwinds against growth.
So I think SOC is likely to contract. Memory is going to grow. But net-net, it's not going to be hugely down, but it will probably be down a little bit on the test side of life."

When you cascade that out to 2024, obviously, with the revenues that we're predicting in IA, I think Mark described it well. If we're growing at 50% and have a forecast to continue to grow, we'll continue to drive the investment.

When you look at the phone, there's various elements of the phone in terms of technology, dapps processors, the modem, the cameras, the memory, those areas of the phone refresh and take leaps of complexity in different cadences. And in 2020, the apps processor and 5G -- basically, the apps processor had a big jump in complexity, and 5G proliferated throughout all the phones.
So as you look at 2021, the need for incremental 5G capacity, whereas in 2020, several, let's say, 100 million units worth of phones needed 5G capacity. This year, it will be less because the incremental unit growth there is one factor in incremental 5G capacity plus complexity growth of the 5G modem itself. So 5G is big in 2020, not as big in 2021. 
That leaves what's happening with the cameras, what's happening with power management, what's happening with the screen resolution. Other things could be balloons that pull it back up. But I do think you do have that -- 5G has happened for that one area of our mobility customer base."

So as it ebbs and flows back and forth, I wouldn't say there's a big ramification. 
On the U.S. domestic supply question, I think it's going to take a long time and many, many years of a steadfast set of incentives from the government for that to mature to something significant to our business.
If we stick at that in the U.S. for 7, 8 years and really build up an infrastructure to manufacture semiconductors domestically, I think it could have a bit of a positive impact, but I think it's small. I don't think because semiconductors might be manufactured in the U.S., all of a sudden, there's a propensity that they're going to buy more Teradyne equipment.

In my remarks, I'll summarize our Q1 results, review current market conditions and provide an update on how we're looking at Q2 and the full year. Sanjay will then take you through the financial details of the quarter and our outlook for the second quarter. As you saw in our press release, our Q1 sales and profits grew double digits from Q1 of 2020's record level. Test sales grew 9% on broad-based demand with notable strength in automotive, industrial compute, memory and storage. Industrial Automation sales grew 33% in the quarter with strong demand at both UR and MiR. Notably, since our January call, the market demand in both Test and IA has been greater than we expected, as you can see from our Q2 guidance. In Semiconductor Test, customer orders are very strong as complexity continues to increase and chip units are expected to grow almost 15% this year, more than twice last year's rate. Regarding the sustainability of this demand, our visibility is limited to just a quarter or 2 but the growth in WFE from $50 billion in 2017 to $60 billion last year to over $75 billion this year should translate into a healthy tester market in the years ahead. 
Looking at SOC demand, the auto industrial segment is especially robust, with our Q1 Eagle shipments up nearly 90% year-on-year, and deliveries expected to grow further in Q2. Test demand for mobility and compute devices is also running ahead of our January estimates as these end markets push the performance limits of advanced process nodes and drive the highest complexity growth. This higher complexity drives longer chip test times and often demand's unique tester capabilities. Our UltraFLEX platforms are well aligned to these performance dynamics. 
As a result of this demand strength, we now expect the SOC test market to be in the $4 billion to $4.4 billion range, up about $700 million at the midpoint from our January estimate. This equates to about 16% growth from 2020, and we expect our share in SOC to be at about the 50% level. In memory test, we are seeing continued strength in both flash and DRAM. We now expect the full year memory test market to be in the $900 million to $1.1 billion range, up about $100 million from our January estimate and up about 5% from 2020 levels. 
Our Magnum platform is in lockstep with the performance trends in both markets, and we expect another strong year in 2021. However, since most of the test market growth is expected to be wafer test applications, where we have less exposure, we're likely to see our share dip a few points into the upper 30s. 
In System Test, revenue grew 14% from Q1 '20, primarily on higher Storage Test shipments. As we've noted in past calls, Storage Test is linked to increasing density and complexity of data center hard disk drives and the expanding adoption of system-level test per chip test. Our full year outlook for this business has improved from January as well on strength in both applications. The defense and aerospace and Board test units of STG are also performing well, and we expect the overall group will grow revenue 5% to 10% this year. 
Our LitePoint business is driven by the complexity of new wireless standards and the connectivity cellular and other wireless markets. In Q1, connectivity demand was the dominant revenue driver as WiFi 6E ramps in smartphones and access points. We expect LitePoint to grow in the 0% to 5% range in 2021. 
Shifting to Industrial Automation. We are on track to grow 30-plus percent for the year. At the macro level, industrial economies are recovering with global PMIs above 50, indicating growing manufacturing investments. At the ground level, we are seeing increasing customer buying driven by economics, quality and lack of available shop floor labor. At UR, revenue grew 32% from Q1 '20 with a notable recovery in China where sales more than doubled in the quarter. Our China performance reflects the compelling value proposition UR offers, even in the face of low-cost competitors. 
We not only have the durability to operate in high-intensity production environments where downtime can't be tolerated, but we also offer a unique suite of organic and ecosystem provided software and peripherals to address a wide range of tasks with short deployment times. We're also seeing growth outside of the traditional manufacturing tasks. In the last several quarters, we've seen volume shipments of cobots to perform industrial service tasks, such as maintenance of high-power transmission lines while energized and robotic inspection of wind turbine blades. Together, these 2 applications account for over 500 installed cobots, and this should approximately double in 2021. Both examples highlight the flexibility of UR arms and value in performing dangerous service tasks. 
MiR also delivered strong results in the quarter, growing 55% year-on-year. A big part of that success has been the new MiR 250, which was introduced in March of last year and was our leading seller in Q1. We are also seeing a nice expansion of applications for mere products. Initially, most applications were moving goods to and fro. Last year, we saw a dramatic expansion in the use of MiR robots as a platform for mobile tasks such as disinfected workspaces. And now we're seeing growing use in the conveyor market where our mobile platform replaces fixed conveyors. This provides owners greater flexibility than traditional fixed conveyor system and allows them to reconfigure their factory on the fly as production requirements dictate. 
Although both you are in -- had both UR and MiR, our expanding range of plug-and-play apps, now totaling over 430 in our UR+ and MiRGo ecosystem shortens the deployment time and increases the addressable market for cobots, adding additional growth factors for us. But we're not firing on all cylinders in IA yet. At AutoGuide, we have lowered our expectations for 2021. The this year, we will focus on expanding existing customer deployments while we complete a series of engineering projects designed to scale and win new customers in the future. While this is surely a reset at our AutoGuide plan, we remain confident in the potential of the nascent market for high payload autonomous mobile robots and our ability to leverage AutoGuide's unique product architecture to deliver differentiated value to this growing market. 
Rolling it all up, the demand environment in our test businesses has strengthened dramatically since January and the wafer front end equipment forecasts suggest that tester demand over the next few years will continue to grow. In Industrial Automation, UR and MiR are benefiting from their differentiated products and the improving global economy, which puts us on track for a total IA group revenue growth of 30-plus percent for the year. Our employees are doing a great job, and our operating model is delivering strong financial profits and free cash flow. 
And finally, I'd like to recognize and thank our Board chair, Roy Valley, who will be retiring next month after 20 years on the Teradyne Board. Roy's leadership, integrity and wise counsel have been invaluable to me and the executive team, and we all wish him the best in his future pursuits. 
Sanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay?"

Today, I'll provide details on our Q1 results, offer additional color on the operating environment, along with our plans to address a very strong demand environment and describe our Q2 outlook.  During the appropri",1586,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide details on our Q1 results, offer additional color on the operating environment, along with our plans to address a very strong demand environment and describe our Q2 outlook.  During the appropriate sections, I'll provide some full year expectations. 
Now to Q1. First year -- or sorry, first quarter sales were $782 million with non-GAAP EPS of $1.11. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.1% and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $230 million, above our high guidance due to high variable compensation and G&A expenses. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 29.6%. We had 2 10% customers in the quarter. Tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter, was 14.75% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Looking at the results from a business unit perspective, semi test revenue was $528 million, was up 9% from Q1 '21. SOC revenue was $420 million, up from prior year, driven by strength in compute, industrial and automotive markets, offset by a decline and our mobility shipments. 
Memory revenue was $108 million, up from prior year, driven by strength in flash final test segment. System Test Group had revenue of $133 million which was up 14% year-over-year. This was driven by $95 million in storage test sales, including HDD and SLT solutions and $38 million in defense and aerospace and production board test. At LitePoint, revenue of $41 million was above plan, but down about 6% from prior year due to lower cellular test shipments. 
Looking at our test portfolio overall. We're very optimistic about the market and technology trends unfolding over the midterm. The growing attach rate of electronics across the economy, the increasing complexity of those devices and significantly, a faster refresh rate for many of these complex devices benefit all of our test businesses. Looking at a significant example, the increasing number of companies creating high-performance processors to serve a growing range of end applications, each with unique performance and design cycles, is driving an estimated doubling of the compute portion of the SOC test market this year compared with 2018. We've designed our UltraFLEXplus platform to serve this growing market and are having early success. This trend has complementary impacts on memory and SLT markets as well. 
Now to Industrial Automation. Given 2020 was a contraction year, I'll provide revenue metrics comparing Q1 '21 results with Q1 '20 and Q1 '19. Industrial Automation revenue was $80 million, was up 33% year-over-year and 21% over Q1 '19. Q1 '21 was a record for the seasonally soft first quarter of the year. U.S. and Europe represented over 70% of our IA revenue in the first quarter. As Mark noted, strength in China for UR, I'll add that we saw the IA group revenue in China more than double year-over-year and grow greater than 50% over Q1 '19. UR sales were $66 million in Q1, up 32% year-over-year and 15% over Q1 '19. MiR sales were $14 million, up 55% from both Q1 '20 and Q1 '19. Sales increased in every region over Q1 '20. In addition to the success of MiR 250 that Mark noted, we also are starting to see a positive shipment trend towards higher payload MiR 500 and MiR 1,000 models, which should improve our ASPs over time. 
Demand at both UR and MiR continues to improve as the global economy recovers and companies work to add production capacity. The opportunity of automation is growing. Our IA portfolio is solving problems for companies such as improving economics with a typical ROI of approximately 1 year, addressing labor shortages experienced by manufacturing and warehousing firms and adding supply chain resilience over the long term. From a financial perspective in IA, we continue to lean into engineering, ecosystem and distribution investments to expand the range of applications in our IA products  address and extend our global distribution reach. 
Our goal in the short-term is to balance investments with sales growth in order to deliver an annual IA group operating profit of between 5% and 15%. And however, given the reset mark described at AutoGuide, we now expect ag revenues of less than $10 million in 2021, and ag will not be profitable in '21. As a result, at the IA group level, we expect we'll operate above breakeven in '21, but below that target profit range. We do expect both UR and MiR each operate above the rule of 40 in 2021. That is the sum of the operating profit, revenue growth will be over $40 million. We continue to have confidence in our IA growth over the midterm, as articulated in our January earnings model update and expect the overall group to grow revenue over 30% in 2021. 
Shifting to supply. As Mark noted, the test market size has increased significantly across the board. From a supply perspective, we are dealing with increasing lead times and cost increases, predominantly in the semiconductor area. Given the significant demand increase in the challenging supply environment, we are experiencing some shipment delays. This is most acute in the automotive and industrial tester markets where demand is significantly outstripping supply. We are working with our customers on a daily basis to minimize the impact of these delays. We see this challenge accelerating into the third quarter with supplier lead times increasing. 
I appreciate the incredible pace of our operations team and partners around the world have operated for over a year and continue to be impressed with their efforts to meet the needs of our customers. To sustain that pace and create a more resilient operation, we're continuing to invest in manufacturing capacity around the world. This includes qualifying redundant suppliers, production sites for critical components and redundant manufacturing capacity in new locations. 
Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.43 billion. We had $1 million in negative free cash flow in the quarter and spent $45 million and $17 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively. To date, $67 million of the RTI convertible bondholders have elected to convert early. And in Q1, we paid $51 million of it to the bondholders. Regarding the buyback, we plan to increase our daily buying throughout the year and expect to purchase a minimum of $600 million in 2021, as noted in January. The relatively low volume of buybacks in Q1 was planned for 3 reasons. 
First, recall Q1 is a seasonally high use of cash, where we typically pay out our variable compensation and ramp up our prepayments to support increased Q2 test production. Second, we wanted to understand how much of our convertible debt would be redeemed in Q1. Third, we wanted to confirm the global recovery from the pandemic remained on track. 
Now to Q2. As you've heard this morning, customer demand is strong and in nearly all parts of the business, our guidance assumes that we'll continue to be successful dealing with the numerous material shortages we noted earlier and that we won't see additional pandemic related issues. With that said, sales in Q2 are expected to be between $1.01 billion and $1.09 billion, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.62 and to $1.83 on 177 million diluted shares. The second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and the noncash imputed interest on the convertible debt. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 58%. OpEx is expected to run at 23% to 25% of second quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance is 34%. 
Regarding OpEx for the full year. We now expect OpEx will grow 17% to 19% over 2020. Note that this is up from our January plan for 2021, where we guided growth over 2020 at 8% to 10%. The increase from January in order of magnitude is in 3 general categories. One, higher revenue-driving higher estimated variable compensation and higher engineering costs related to mitigating supply constraints. Two, higher incremental spending to accelerate several engineering projects in test and IA. And three, higher-than-expected G&A spending related to legal, insurance and IT costs. As we noted in January and included in the estimate, we expect travel and marketing expenses to increase through the remainder of the year as pandemic restrictions ease. As outlined last quarter, we set our sight on reaching $5.25 to $6.75 in EPS by 2024 in our earnings model. In 2021, we expect our largest end market, semi test, to grow 14% and at the estimated midpoint above the estimate in our earnings model. 
Combined with industrial end markets recovering from the pandemic slump, these data points reinforce that our midterm earnings plan is on a solid foundation. We update our earnings model each January. In our next update, we'll look closely at both the WFE forecast and test growth rates. To sum up, the demand environment across nearly all of our markets remain strong, and we're working closely with our suppliers and customers to expand shipments and minimize the impact of material shortages. We've had an outstanding start to the year, and we are on a path to healthy sales growth and profit growth for 2021. 
At the midpoint of our Q2 guidance, we'll see sales grow 19% and non-GAAP EPS grow 21% above the first half of 2020, which itself was a record. We are well on our way to achieving our midterm revenue and earnings goals we set in our new earnings model. 
With that, I'll turn things back to Andy."

The exabyte growth in the 18-terabyte and above drive space just is very test intensive. And I don't see anything sort of blunting the transitions in the cloud storage to anything but those high-intensity drives. 
SLT is a little more of a, I think, a lumpy market at this point. It could continue to sequentially grow, but it's still limited to very, I would say, a small subset of the market. Manufacturers building very high complexity devices in high volumes. Now engineering work is going on to make SLT more meaningful to lower complexity devices. And I think as those products come to market over the next few years, you'll start to see customer expansion in SLT and the market will grow. But I would sort of say, I wouldn't be surprised to see plus or minus 25% year-over-year swings as we try to get to a broader adoption of SLT."

I'm curious, what have been your impressions over this correlation from a historical perspective? Because this year will be kind of the second very strong year for WFE. And that are expectations for almost 30% kind of growth this year. When do you see that impacting the demand for testers? Does it happen with a 6 month lag? Does it happen with a 1 year lag? And what is the kind of -- should we be expecting a 30% growth in testers next year, right? So just curious what you think the correlation is?"
94728,711666829,2260392,"Teradyne, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Teradyne, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So there is a correlation and a lag, as you alluded to. So front end equipment usually goes into fabs, there's a period of time then after all of that is installed. Revenue gets recognized on behalf of those equipment makers and the fab gets tuned. T",378,"Yes. So there is a correlation and a lag, as you alluded to. So front end equipment usually goes into fabs, there's a period of time then after all of that is installed. Revenue gets recognized on behalf of those equipment makers and the fab gets tuned. The recipe, the yields and things before the fab has put into commission for real customer shipments. So that can take anywhere from -- the good suppliers these days maybe get through that phase in about 3 to 4 months. But then it's not a light switch that turns on. It's more like a knob on a faucet because you start to ramp wafer outs slowly and you proportionately start adding testers. 
So what you can expect to see is, let's say, maybe the beginning of tester orders lag 4 to 5 months, but they really get going kind of a year after the fab equipment goes in. So if you offset the tester market from the fab investments by about, let's say, a year plus or minus 3 months, you get a good indication of growth. Now if you go back for the past 5 years, you'll see there's been pretty steady monotonic growth in WFE and there's been pretty steady monotonic growth in the tester market. It's just -- I think the most recent step, though, from 60 to 70 plus is larger than we've seen historically. So if all of that happens and it's truly put into commission, I would expect it to be something that pulls up the growth rate a little bit higher than we've seen in the past. 
But the 1 caution I would add is that what drives test again is transistor count, which we sometimes call complexity, but it's transistor count. And the capital intensity to build transistors at 3 nanometers and such on a per transistor basis, is getting to be quite high. So it may turn out that it takes more CapEx per transistor at some of these nodes than it has historically. So that could mute a little bit the cause and effect. If you follow what I'm saying. But overall, the big, big picture is, you're right, it's correlated. Maybe it's a year plus or minus 3 month delay."

So now we have units working for us a little more in a year where complexity, it's going up, but not as dramatically as it did last year. So it's almost a multiplicative effect of the 2. And this year is really a story of both, but I'd say the -- without the unit growth, we would be looking at a smaller market, a smaller overall TAM than we're seeing."

And so AutoGuide is a case where we're kind of in that same situation. We've -- We started out last year, deploying the product into multiple big name, high potential accounts. And we're sort of lilly pad getting these initial deployments up and running. As we reflected back on where we stood, we were getting overextended on new accounts where the current accounts potential could be jeopardized by not doing more to augment the product with the ability to dock into other factory automation systems that these customers are implementing. So we've just decided, let's retrench around the 5 or 6 big accounts we have today. Get them rock solid, develop these linkages to warehouse automation, manufacturing systems, strengthen our linkage to our mere product line, so we have more of a seamless connection there. And just grow within those accounts and then go on to a more expensive footprint. 
So it's absolutely not what we planned a year ago when we acquired AutoGuide. But in the light of today, the opportunity looks so large that we think better off doing -- taking this tax than just trying to proliferate more and more accounts."

It's interesting and also possibly a deterrent to these regional fabs because a regional fab is, in my view, meaningless without the associated infrastructure around it, including test, supply of the chemistry, the local supply thing makes the whole venture economical. And as an alternative to doing everything in Taiwan, if you want to do in the U.S. or Japan or Europe, you really need a competitive infrastructure to get it done. So it will necessarily require test if it's not going to be an orphan. 
And I'm a little bit skeptical, will all of these jurisdictions have the 10-year sort of intestinal fortitude to move forward and invest in that kind of infrastructure build-out. But I think in the U.S. case, my read is that the answer is probably yes. The national security issues, there's just a lot behind this that suggests it's probably going to happen. And in the case of test and robots as well, I think the fracturing of the supply chain to be more geographically dispersed, on the 1 hand, maybe for a global economy is a little bad because it creates some inefficiency in the market, but for a supplier of equipment into that market. It's a helpful, it's a tailwind. And so I do think you're going to find probably globally a little bit less utilization efficiency of equipment because of this trend. 
But the national instincts around secure supply chains are going to overdrive that and probably subsidize it to some level. And I think both of our businesses will be a beneficiary of that."

I'll give you some rough numbers, but take it a little bit with a grain of salt because here we are 3 months later, talking about a big revision to our view of what the market size is. So I don't profess to be overly wise on this. But our current view on compute would be about $1 billion-ish market this year, for example. So not quite doubling. It's only -- the year is not even halfway over. So who knows what could happen, but that's our current view. Mobility compared to last year is probably flattish, could be down a little bit compared to last year. The 1 part of mobility we haven't talked about that of all the places that are surging for demand, there is a pocket where demand is softer this year, and that's in millimeter wave test capability. 
And last year, there was a lot of tooling for millimeter wave as some of the phones were early adopters of millimeter wave technology. But the fact of the matter is that telcos globally aren't deploying millimeter wave to any large extent. Spotty deployment in the U.S. and almost nothing outside of the U.S. And so that's suppressing demand this year for millimeter wave test equipment. That makes the -- is a little bit of a headwind for the mobility market. So call it flat to slightly down in mobility. At about, let's say, it's about $1.6 billion or $1.65 billion or so. 
The automotive and MCU market is closer to [ $450 million ] for the year. That's up from about [ $225 million ] last year. So big, big jump there. And the last segment that we sort of track is industrial, and that one is up to about $500 million from maybe $340 million, [ $325 million ] last year. So that's how we segment it right now."

It's been a little more consistent in memory the past couple of years, of course, when you get these big pricing swings, that's going to probably go away. But on the SOC side, wouldn't you agree, your big customer is a significantly larger portion of the SOC Test TAM than they are of consumption in the front end non-memory WFE world. So doesn't the SOC market depends a lot more on what the large customer is doing in the test world than in the WFE world. So the correlation in SOC could sort of break down a bit because of what the large customer is doing. And I guess on that point, they've never been good 3 years in a row, not once, and this is the second big year. So how do you handicap the odds that next year is a big down year and that works against you in terms of share, even if the market doesn't come down that much."

So your point about the large customer or our large customer, never having sort of as a proportion of our revenue, 3 big years in a row. I think there's truth to that, but there's also a difference in what's happening because the portfolio there is growing. If you go back to the sort of 2014, '15 -- '13, '14, '15, '16 area. It was kind of 1 device type that was driving the story and the demand. And now we're into a much broader portfolio, so I would just offer that, that dynamics changed. And that's a fact that could propel this more sequential growth for a longer period of time. 
On the correlation between WFE test, SOC Test demand and whether that's stronger than who's buying, let's say, big -- certainly, customers have different test intensities. And so part of the noise that's running under the hood, certainly as it relates to our revenue is related to large high test intensity customers and how much they're buying. We're fortunate that we participate in segments of the market that tend to have high test intensities, but that's by design. We target those segments. And it's not just 1 large customer that produces devices that have high test intensity. There's others, and that's where we play. 
So I would agree with you that if the market shifted away from high test intensity customers meeting high complexity devices, you could see a disconnect, an anchor on the test market that was disconnected from WFE. But it just doesn't seem likely because the reason these investments are being made in the front end. And the reason they're so expensive to make is that they're going after 3-nanometer EUV lines to build devices for these very customers we're talking about. So I just don't see that the disconnect can emerge unless the fab sit idle. If the fabs are going to say, idle, yes. But if the fabs aren't going to be idle, it's the exact customers we're talking about that are going to utilize them. 
So I don't disabuse your point. It actually has some merit, but I just think the correlation, almost by definition, has to occur unless the fabs are idle."

And as to our share position, historically, our share in compute has been below our overall market share. So maybe in the 30s, and it moves around in the 30s is where it's been.

And I know that raises the specter of everybody's worry that there's inventory being going to be built in addition to real line demand. And I think that will happen. That's certainly not happening yet, that's to come. So there's going to be a phase here where we get through the urgency, then there will be investments made to build more, I'd say, slack in the system for the devices that go into automotive. So that will be a bit of a balloon. But then it will settle back to, I think it's normal rhythm. Where increasing electronic and chip attach rates in automobiles will drive the market. And we're going to get to kind of a peak level of test investment in automotive this year, close to that $500 million number. And that could even -- certainly, I think it could sustain through the end of the year because of this inventory catch up. But my guess is as we get into the 2022 area and beyond, it'll sort of back into oscillating between the $300 million to $500 million rate."

And those devices in the high-end phones, which comprise maybe 400 million to 500 million units out of the [ 1.5 ], have transistor counts on par with any desktop or laptop computer you might buy. 10 billion-plus kind of transistors. So the test -- when you look at the test intensity there compared to a traditional microprocessor, it's a little bit more efficient, I would say than a traditional microprocessor, but not a lot, more efficient. So for the same, let's say, 10 billion transistor x86 architecture compared to a map device in your phone, maybe it's at 90% versus 100% kind of test time delta, so not big. 
Now when you get into arm-based compute devices for more non phone applications. There's different cash requirements, different IO technologies needed that further complexify the arm implementation that bring it back up to test intensity is very similar to the x86 world. So I don't see a big difference there."

The bigger one is what happens with the phones and the terminals and such. And there, the U.S., the spectrum auction around sub-6G is concluded. I think that carriers are kind of clearly going to roll that out as their next step. 
That's, as I said earlier, going to suppress the demand for millimeter wave, which is the most test intensive portion of 5G. And so in the past calls, I've talked about LitePoint and Semi Test combined driving an incremental $400 million to $500 million worth of tester demand in the 5G era. And I think where we are in that now is we're probably in that $250 million to $300 million piece of it and I think it's going to go sideways here for a while because of the fact that millimeter wave this year will be less probably investment than last year. And that will be the last kicker. Maybe it's still a couple of years out to bring it up to that full potential."

I think some like the automotive market, as an example, is a very high-quality demanding market. But the volumes, frankly, are relatively low compared to something like a phone, 100 million cars versus 1.5 billion phones. 
So for a market like that with lower volume devices to take advantage of SLT, which they would love to.

In my remarks, I'll summarize our Q1 results, review current market conditions and provide an update on how we're looking at Q2 and the full year. Sanjay will then take you through the financial details of the quarter and our outlook for the second quarter. As you saw in our press release, our Q1 sales and profits grew double digits from Q1 of 2020's record level. 
Test sales grew 9% on broad-based demand with notable strength in automotive, industrial compute, memory and storage. Industrial Automation sales grew 33% in the quarter with strong demand at both UR and MiR. Notably, since our January call, the market demand in both Test and IA has been greater than we expected, as you can see from our Q2 guidance. In Semiconductor Test, customer orders are very strong as complexity continues to increase and chip units are expected to grow almost 15% this year, more than twice last year's rate. Regarding the sustainability of this demand, our visibility is limited to just a quarter or 2, but the growth in WFE from $50 billion in 2017 to $60 billion last year to over $75 billion this year should translate into a healthy tester market in the years ahead. 
Looking at SOC demand, the auto industrial segment is especially robust, with our Q1 Eagle shipments up nearly 90% year-on-year, and deliveries expected to grow further in Q2. Test demand for mobility and compute devices is also running ahead of our January estimates as these end markets push the performance limits of advanced process nodes and drive the highest complexity growth. This higher complexity drives longer chip test times and often demands unique tester capabilities. Our UltraFLEX platforms are well aligned to these performance dynamics. 
As a result of this demand strength, we now expect the SOC Test market to be in the $4 billion to $4.4 billion range, up about $700 million at the midpoint from our January estimate. This equates to about 16% growth from 2020, and we expect our share in SOC to be at about the 50% level. In memory test, we are seeing continued strength in both flash and DRAM. We now expect the full year memory test market to be in the $900 million to $1.1 billion range, up about $100 million from our January estimate and up about 5% from 2020 levels. 
Our Magnum platform is in lockstep with the performance trends in both markets, and we expect another strong year in 2021. However, since most of the test market growth is expected to be wafer test applications, where we have less exposure, we're likely to see our share dip a few points into the upper 30s. 
In System Test, revenue grew 14% from Q1 '20, primarily on higher Storage Test shipments. As we've noted in past calls, Storage Test is linked to increasing density and complexity of data center hard disk drives and the expanding adoption of system-level test per chip test. Our full year outlook for this business has improved from January as well on strength in both applications. The defense and aerospace and Board test units of STG are also performing well, and we expect the overall group will grow revenue 5% to 10% this year. 
Our LitePoint business is driven by the complexity of new wireless standards in the connectivity, cellular and other wireless markets. In Q1, connectivity demand was the dominant revenue driver as WiFi 6E ramps in smartphones and access points. We expect LitePoint to grow in the 0% to 5% range in 2021. 
Shifting to Industrial Automation. We are on track to grow 30-plus percent for the year. At the macro level, industrial economies are recovering with global PMIs above 50, indicating growing manufacturing investments. At the ground level, we are seeing increasing customer buying driven by economics, quality and lack of available shop floor labor. At UR, revenue grew 32% from Q1 '20 with a notable recovery in China where sales more than doubled in the quarter. Our China performance reflects the compelling value proposition UR offers, even in the face of low-cost competitors. 
We not only have the durability to operate in high-intensity production environments where downtime can't be tolerated, but we also offer a unique suite of organic and ecosystem provided software and peripherals to address a wide range of tasks with short deployment times. We're also seeing growth outside of the traditional manufacturing tasks. In the last several quarters, we've seen volume shipments of cobots to perform industrial service tasks, such as maintenance of high-power transmission lines while energized and robotic inspection of wind turbine blades. Together, these 2 applications account for over 500 installed cobots, and this should approximately double in 2021. Both examples highlight the flexibility of UR arms and value in performing dangerous service tasks. 
MiR also delivered strong results in the quarter, growing 55% year-on-year. A big part of that success has been the new MiR250, which was introduced in March of last year and was our leading seller in Q1. We are also seeing a nice expansion of applications for MiR products. Initially, most applications were moving goods to and fro. Last year, we saw a dramatic expansion in the use of MiR robots as the platform for mobile tasks such as disinfecting workspaces. And now we're seeing growing use in the conveyor market where our mobile platform replaces fixed conveyors. This provides owners greater flexibility than traditional fixed conveyor system and allows them to reconfigure their factory on the fly as production requirements dictate. 
Although both UR and -- at both UR and MiR, our expanding range of plug-and-play apps, now totaling over 430 in our UR+ and MiRGo ecosystem, shortens the deployment time and increases the addressable market for cobots, adding additional growth factors for us. But we're not firing on all cylinders in IA yet. At AutoGuide, we have lowered our expectations for 2021. This year, we will focus on expanding existing customer deployments while we complete a series of engineering projects designed to scale and win new customers in the future. While this is surely a reset at our AutoGuide plan, we remain confident in the potential of the nascent market for high payload autonomous mobile robots and our ability to leverage AutoGuide's unique product architecture to deliver differentiated value to this growing market. 
Rolling it all up, the demand environment in our test businesses has strengthened dramatically since January and the wafer front end equipment forecasts suggest that tester demand over the next few years will continue to grow. In Industrial Automation, UR and MiR are benefiting from their differentiated products and the improving global economy, which puts us on track for a total IA group revenue growth of 30-plus percent for the year. Our employees are doing a great job, and our operating model is delivering strong financial profits and free cash flow. 
And finally, I'd like to recognize and thank our Board Chair, Roy Vallee, who will be retiring next month after 20 years on the Teradyne Board. Roy's leadership, integrity and wise counsel have been invaluable to me and the executive team, and we all wish him the best in his future pursuits.

Today, I'll provide details on our Q1 results, offer additional color on the operating environment, along with our plans to address a very strong demand environment and describe our Q2 outlook.  During the appropriate sections, I'll provide some full year expectations. 
Now to Q1. First year -- or sorry, first quarter sales were $782 million with non-GAAP EPS of $1.11. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.1% and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $230 million, above our high guidance due to high variable compensation and G&A expenses. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 29.6%. We had 2 10% customers in the quarter. Tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter, was 14.75% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Looking at the results from a business unit perspective, Semi Test revenue was $528 million, was up 9% from Q1 '21. SOC revenue was $420 million, up from prior year, driven by strength in compute, industrial and automotive markets, offset by a decline in our mobility shipments. 
Memory revenue was $108 million, up from prior year, driven by strength in flash final test segment. System Test group had revenue of $133 million which was up 14% year-over-year. This was driven by $95 million in Storage Test sales, including HDD and SLT solutions and $38 million in defense and aerospace and production board test. At LitePoint, revenue of $41 million was above plan, but down about 6% from prior year due to lower cellular test shipments. 
Looking at our test portfolio overall. We're very optimistic about the market and technology trends unfolding over the midterm. The growing attach rate of electronics across the economy, the increasing complexity of those devices and significantly, a faster refresh rate for many of these complex devices benefit all of our test businesses. Looking at a significant example, the increasing number of companies creating high-performance processors to serve a growing range of end applications, each with unique performance and design cycles, is driving an estimated doubling of the compute portion of the SOC Test market this year compared with 2018. We've designed our UltraFLEXplus platform to serve this growing market and are having early success. This trend has complementary impacts on memory and SLT markets as well. 
Now to Industrial Automation. Given 2020 was a contraction year, I'll provide revenue metrics comparing Q1 '21 results with Q1 '20 and Q1 '19. Industrial Automation revenue was $80 million, was up 33% year-over-year and 21% over Q1 '19. Q1 '21 was a record for the seasonally soft first quarter of the year. U.S. and Europe represented over 70% of our IA revenue in the first quarter. As Mark noted, strength in China for UR, I'll add that we saw the IA group revenue in China more than double year-over-year and grow greater than 50% over Q1 '19. UR sales were $66 million in Q1, up 32% year-over-year and 15% over Q1 '19. MiR sales were $14 million, up 55% from both Q1 '20 and Q1 '19. Sales increased in every region over Q1 '20. In addition to the success of MiR250 that Mark noted, we also are starting to see a positive shipment trend towards higher payload MiR500 and MiR1000 models, which should improve our ASPs over time. 
Demand at both UR and MiR continues to improve as the global economy recovers and companies work to add production capacity. The opportunity of automation is growing. Our IA portfolio is solving problems for companies such as improving economics with a typical ROI of approximately 1 year, addressing labor shortages experienced by manufacturing and warehousing firms and adding supply chain resilience over the long term. From a financial perspective in IA, we continue to lean into engineering, ecosystem and distribution investments to expand the range of applications in our IA products -- our IA products address and extend our global distribution reach. 
Our goal in the short-term is to balance investments with sales growth in order to deliver an annual IA group operating profit of between 5% and 15%. However, given the reset Mark described at AutoGuide, we now expect AG revenues of less than $10 million in 2021, and AG will not be profitable in '21. As a result, at the IA group level, we expect we'll operate above breakeven in '21, but below that target profit range. We do expect both UR and MiR each to operate above the Rule of 40 in 2021. That is, the sum of the operating profit, revenue growth will be over 40%. We continue to have confidence in our IA growth over the midterm, as articulated in our January earnings model update and expect the overall group to grow revenue over 30% in 2021. 
Shifting to supply. As Mark noted, the test market size has increased significantly across the board. From a supply perspective, we are dealing with increasing lead times and cost increases, predominantly in the semiconductor area. Given the significant demand increase and the challenging supply environment, we are experiencing some shipment delays. This is most acute in the automotive and industrial tester markets where demand is significantly outstripping supply. We are working with our customers on a daily basis to minimize the impact of these delays. We see this challenge accelerating into the third quarter with supplier lead times increasing. 
I appreciate the incredible pace of our operations team and partners around the world have operated for over a year and continue to be impressed with their efforts to meet the needs of our customers. To sustain that pace and create a more resilient operation, we're continuing to invest in manufacturing capacity around the world. This includes qualifying redundant suppliers, production sites for critical components and redundant manufacturing capacity in new locations. 
Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.43 billion. We had $1 million in negative free cash flow in the quarter and spent $45 million and $17 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively. To date, $67 million of the convertible bondholders have elected to convert early. And in Q1, we paid $51 million of it to the bondholders. Regarding the buyback, we plan to increase our daily buying throughout the year and expect to purchase a minimum of $600 million in 2021, as noted in January. The relatively low volume of buybacks in Q1 was planned for 3 reasons. 
First, recall Q1 is a seasonally high use of cash, where we typically pay out our variable compensation and ramp up our prepayments to support increased Q2 test production. Second, we wanted to understand how much of our convertible debt would be redeemed in Q1. Third, we wanted to confirm the global recovery from the pandemic remained on track. 
Now to Q2. As you've heard this morning, customer demand is strong and in nearly all parts of the business, our guidance assumes that we'll continue to be successful dealing with the numerous material shortages we noted earlier and that we won't see additional pandemic-related issues. With that said, sales in Q2 are expected to be between $1.01 billion and $1.09 billion, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.62 to $1.83 on 177 million diluted shares. The second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and the noncash imputed interest on the convertible debt. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 58%. OpEx is expected to run at 23% to 25% of second quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance is 34%. 
Regarding OpEx for the full year. We now expect OpEx will grow 17% to 19% over 2020. Note that this is up from our January plan for 2021, where we guided growth over 2020 at 8% to 10%. The increase from January in order of magnitude is in 3 general categories. One, higher revenue-driving, higher estimated variable compensation and higher engineering costs related to mitigating supply constraints. Two, higher incremental spending to accelerate several engineering projects in test and IA. And three, higher-than-expected G&A spending related to legal, insurance and IT costs. As we noted in January and included in the estimate, we expect travel and marketing expenses to increase through the remainder of the year as pandemic restrictions ease. As outlined last quarter, we set our sight on reaching $5.25 to $6.75 in EPS by 2024 in our earnings model. In 2021, we expect our largest end market, semi test, to grow 14% at the estimated midpoint above the estimate in our earnings model. 
Combined with industrial end markets recovering from the pandemic slump, these data points reinforce that our midterm earnings plan is on a solid foundation. We update our earnings model each January. In our next update, we'll look closely at both the WFE forecasts and test growth rates. 
To sum up, the demand environment across nearly all of our markets remain strong, and we're working closely with our suppliers and customers to expand shipments and minimize the impact of material shortages. We've had an outstanding start to the year, and we are on a path to healthy sales growth and profit growth for 2021. At the midpoint of our Q2 guidance, we'll see sales grow 19% and non-GAAP EPS grow 21% above the first half of 2020, which itself was a record. We are well on our way to achieving our midterm revenue and earnings goals we set in our new earnings model. 
With that, I'll turn things back to Andy."

And I don't see anything sort of blunting the transitions in the cloud storage to anything but those high-intensity drives. 
SLT is a little more of, I think, a lumpy market at this point. It could continue to sequentially grow, but it's still limited to very, I would say, a small subset of the market. Manufacturers building very high complexity devices in high volumes. Now engineering work is going on to make SLT more meaningful to lower complexity devices. And I think as those products come to market over the next few years, you'll start to see customer expansion in SLT and the market will grow. But I would sort of say, I wouldn't be surprised to see plus or minus 25% year-over-year swings as we try to get to a broader adoption of SLT."

I'm curious, what have been your impressions over this correlation from a historical perspective. Because this year will be kind of the second very strong year for WFE. And there are expectations for almost 30% kind of growth this year. When do you see that impacting the demand for testers? Does it happen with a 6-month lag? Does it happen with a 1-year lag? And what is the kind of -- should we be expecting a 30% growth in testers next year, right? So just curious what you think the correlation is?"
94728,711666829,2261094,"Teradyne, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Teradyne, Inc.","Executives","Yes. So there is a correlation and a lag, as you alluded to. So front end equipment usually goes into fabs. There's a period of time then after all of that is installed. Revenue gets recognized on behalf of those equipment makers and the fab gets tuned. T",379,"Yes. So there is a correlation and a lag, as you alluded to. So front end equipment usually goes into fabs. There's a period of time then after all of that is installed. Revenue gets recognized on behalf of those equipment makers and the fab gets tuned. The recipe, the yields and things before the fab is put into commission for real customer shipments. So that can take anywhere from -- the good suppliers these days maybe get through that phase in about 3 to 4 months. But then it's not a light switch that turns on. It's more like a knob on a faucet because you start to ramp wafer outs slowly and you proportionately start adding testers. 
So what you can expect to see is, let's say, maybe, in the beginning, the tester orders lag 4 to 5 months, but they really get going kind of a year after the fab equipment goes in. So if you offset the tester market from the fab investments by about, let's say, a year plus or minus 3 months, you get a good indication of growth. Now if you go back for the past 5 years, you'll see there's been pretty steady monotonic growth in WFE and there's been pretty steady monotonic growth in the tester market. It's just -- I think the most recent step, though, from 60 to 70 plus is larger than we've seen historically. So if all of that happens and it's truly put into commission, I would expect it to be something that pulls up the growth rate a little bit higher than we've seen in the past. 
But the one caution I would add is that what drives test again is transistor count, which we sometimes call complexity, but it's transistor count. And the capital intensity to build transistors at 3 nanometers and such on a per transistor basis, is getting to be quite high. So it may turn out that it takes more CapEx per transistor at some of these nodes than it has historically. So that could mute a little bit the cause and effect, if you follow what I'm saying. But overall, the big, big picture is, you're right, it's correlated. Maybe it's a year plus or minus 3 months delay."

Now in 2021, interestingly, we're getting a year where the, I would say, complexity growth of the silicon going into phones is less than it was in 2020, but that's been more than offset by the fact that units are going to grow. So now we have units working for us a little more in a year where complexity, it's going up, but not as dramatically as it did last year. So it's almost a multiplicative effect of the 2. And this year is really a story of both, but I'd say the -- without the unit growth, we would be looking at a smaller market, a smaller overall TAM than we're seeing."

The bigger acquisitions like the Nextest, the Eagles, the URs and the MiRs of the world have gone really, really well. And some of the smaller ones have taken longer to realize their potential than we expected at the beginning. 
And so AutoGuide is a case where we're kind of in that same situation. We've -- We started out last year deploying the product into multiple big name, high potential accounts. And we're sort of a lily pad getting these initial deployments up and running. As we reflected back on where we stood, we were getting overextended on new accounts where the current accounts' potential could be jeopardized by not doing more to augment the product with the ability to dock into other factory automation systems that these customers are implementing. So we've just decided, let's retrench around the 5 or 6 big accounts we have today, get them rock solid, develop these linkages to warehouse automation, manufacturing systems, strengthen our linkage to our MiR product line, so we have more of a seamless connection there. And just grow within those accounts and then go on to a more expansive footprint. 
So it's absolutely not what we planned a year ago when we acquired AutoGuide. But in the light of today, the opportunity looks so large that we think we're better off doing -- taking this tack than just trying to proliferate more and more accounts."

Sanjay, I just want to go back to your commentaries around supply constraints and duration. It sounds like from your prepared remarks, that this is going to last at least into the calendar third quarter. Do things get worse from here? Is there any way to quantify the impact it's having to your revenue? And usually, when customers can't get what they want, they tend to order more than they need.

So we are seeing shortages, and we've been able to -- through our inventory strategies as well as multiple suppliers been able to work through them. Fundamentally, in the rise of the demand in 2020 and through COVID and then in 2021 in Q1. We're seeing it in Q2, and we see it getting -- supply getting tighter. We're seeing lead times increase from our suppliers across the board. And we're booked out pretty much for the year. And we're -- as I said in my prepared remarks, we're spending more engineering dollars and qualifying different suppliers. So it is getting tighter as demand continues to increase throughout the year. 
And Q2, we feel pretty good about where we're at and the range. Of course, there's always things we're managing. And -- but Q3, we see it getting tighter. Visibility, we have good visibility into Q3, some issues we're working through. And then Q4, the visibility, obviously, further out, it goes down. I'd say on the duplicate orders perspective, I don't really see in the demand statement a whole set of duplication of orders. We're working with our customers, we're understanding their specific needs and working to get them what they need and just working through that."

I'm just kind of curious from your perspective, are you seeing any drive towards sort of regionalization of test capacity, what might that mean for your business in the future? And maybe beyond even Semi Test, are you seeing across other supply chains, sort of a redomiciling of that supply chain that might actually help your IA business."

So I think there's a lot in what you just said that's interesting and also possibly a deterrent to these regional fabs because a regional fab is, in my view, meaningless without the associated infrastructure around it, including test, supply of the chemistry. The local supply thing makes the whole venture economical. And as an alternative to doing everything in Taiwan, if you want to do in the U.S. or Japan or Europe, you really need a competitive infrastructure to get it done. So it will necessarily require test if it's not going to be an orphan. 
And I'm a little bit skeptical, will all of these jurisdictions have the 10-year sort of intestinal fortitude to move forward and invest in that kind of infrastructure build-out. But I think in the U.S. case, my read is that the answer is probably yes. The national security issues, there's just a lot behind this that suggests it's probably going to happen. And in the case of test and robots as well, I think the fracturing of the supply chain to be more geographically disperse, on the one hand, maybe for a global economy is a little bad because it creates some inefficiency in the market, but for a supplier of equipment into that market, it's a helpful, it's a tailwind. And so I do think you're going to find probably globally a little bit less utilization efficiency of equipment because of this trend. 
But the national instincts around secure supply chains are going to overdrive that and probably subsidize it to some level. And I think both of our businesses will be a beneficiary of that."

I'll give you some rough numbers, but take it a little bit with a grain of salt because here we are 3 months later, talking about a big revision to our view of what the market size is. So I don't profess to be overly wise on this. But our current view on compute would be about $1 billion-ish market this year, for example. So not quite doubling. It's only -- the year is not even halfway over, so who knows what could happen, but that's our current view. Mobility compared to last year is probably flattish, could be down a little bit compared to last year. The one part of mobility we haven't talked about that of all the places that are surging for demand, there is a pocket where demand is softer this year, and that's in millimeter wave test capability. 
And last year, there was a lot of tooling for millimeter wave as some of the phones were early adopters of millimeter wave technology. But the fact of the matter is that telcos globally aren't deploying millimeter wave to any large extent. Spotty deployment in the U.S. and almost nothing outside of the U.S. And so that's suppressing demand this year for millimeter wave test equipment. That makes the -- is a little bit of a headwind for the mobility market. So call it flat to slightly down in mobility at about -- let's say, it's about $1.6 billion or $1.65 billion or so. 
The automotive and MCU market is closer to $450 million for the year. That's up from about $225 million last year. So big, big jump there. And the last segment that we sort of track is industrial, and that one is up to about $500 million from maybe $340 million, $325 million last year. So that's how we segment it right now."

It's been a little more consistent in memory the past couple of years. Of course, when you get these big pricing swings, that's going to probably go away. But on the SOC side, wouldn't you agree, your big customer is a significantly larger portion of the SOC Test TAM than they are of consumption in the front end non-memory WFE world. So doesn't the SOC market depend a lot more on what the large customer is doing in the test world than in the WFE world. So the correlation in SOC could sort of break down a bit because of what the large customer is doing. And I guess on that point, they've never been good 3 years in a row, not once, and this is the second big year. So how do you handicap the odds that next year is a big down year and that works against you in terms of share, even if the market doesn't come down that much."

A lot in there, Tim, but I'll try to take it on. So your point about the large customer or our large customer never having sort of as a proportion of our revenue, 3 big years in a row, I think there's truth to that, but there's also a difference in what's happening because the portfolio there is growing. If you go back to the sort of 2014, '15 -- '13, '14, '15, '16 area, it was kind of one device type that was driving the story and the demand. And now we're into a much broader portfolio than that. So I would just offer that, that dynamic's changed. And that's a fact that could propel this more sequential growth for a longer period of time. 
On the correlation between WFE, Test -- SOC Test demand and whether that's stronger than who's buying, let's say, big -- certainly, customers have different test intensities. And so part of the noise that's running under the hood, certainly as it relates to our revenue, is related to large high test intensity customers and how much they're buying. We're fortunate that we participate in segments of the market that tend to have high test intensities, but that's by design. We target those segments. And it's not just one large customer that produces devices that have high test intensity. There's others, and that's where we play. 
So I would agree with you that if the market shifted away from high test intensity customers, meaning high complexity devices, you could see a disconnect, an anchor on the test market that was disconnected from WFE. But it just doesn't seem likely because the reason these investments are being made in the front end and the reason they're so expensive to make is that they're going after 3-nanometer EUV lines to build devices for these very customers we're talking about. So I just don't see that the disconnect can emerge unless the fabs sit idle. If the fabs are going to sit idle, yes. But if the fabs aren't going to be idle, it's the exact customers we're talking about that are going to utilize them. So I don't disabuse your point. It actually has some merit, but I just think the correlation, almost by definition, has to occur unless the fabs are idle."

And NVIDIA is obviously growing. So it's broad-based. But as a proportion, I'd say, yes, you're right. It's probably some of the newer players that are growing the market faster than others. And as to our share position, historically, our share in compute has been below our overall market share. So maybe in the 30s, and it moves around in the 30s, is where it's been. 
This -- we're trending into a period of time because of this change of who's building these devices where our share is more likely to move up closer to our overall average share in the market.

So the test -- when you look at the test intensity there compared to a traditional microprocessor, it's a little bit more efficient, I would say, than a traditional microprocessor, but not a lot more efficient. So for the same, let's say, 10 billion transistor x86 architecture compared to a map device in your phone, maybe it's at 90% versus 100% kind of test time delta, so not big. 
Now when you get into arm-based compute devices for more non-phone applications, there's different cash requirements, different IO technologies needed that further complexify the arm implementation that bring it back up to test intensities very similar to the x86 world.

It did for us back in 2019 when China was going crazy, rolling out sub-6G and Huawei was investing heavily at the time. But the kind of what is now a $5 billion tester market, infrastructure, 5G investments are, I think, always going to be sub-$100 million and maybe more in the sort of $60 million to $70 million range. The bigger one is what happens with the phones and the terminals and such. And there, the U.S., the spectrum auction around sub-6G is concluded. I think that carriers are kind of clearly going to roll that out as their next step. 
That's, as I said earlier, going to suppress the demand for millimeter wave, which is the most test intensive portion of 5G. And so in the past calls, I've talked about LitePoint and Semi Test combined driving an incremental $400 million to $500 million worth of tester demand in the 5G era. And I think where we are in that now is we're probably in that $250 million to $300 million piece of it. And I think it's going to go sideways here for a while because of the fact that millimeter wave this year will be less probably investment than last year. And that will be the last kicker. Maybe it's still a couple of years out to bring it up to that full potential."

And Advantest and Teradyne are kind of, I think, both hard-core players here. We each have our own benefits. And as we said earlier, this additional test step that high complexity devices are requiring is likely to proliferate into other markets. But 2 things are kind of important. I think from like the automotive market, as an example, is a very high-quality demanding market. But the volumes, frankly, are relatively low compared to something like a phone, 100 million cars versus 1.5 billion phones. 
So for a market like that with lower volume devices to take advantage of SLT, which they would love to, we need a different architecture that we're developing to address these, I'd say, higher mix, lower volume markets. And I think our position and the sustainability of this is pretty good. It's like semiconductor tests, where the changeover costs are pretty high.

94728,1674258151,2352597,"Teradyne, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Teradyne, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll summarize our results for the second quarter and first half of 2021, update on current conditions in both test and Industrial Automation, and comment on our view for the second half of the yea",1220,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll summarize our results for the second quarter and first half of 2021, update on current conditions in both test and Industrial Automation, and comment on our view for the second half of the year. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on the quarter and our guidance for Q3. 
The strong demand we saw in Q1 accelerated in Q2 as both our Test and Industrial Automation groups grew substantially in the quarter. The long-term demand drivers we've discussed in the past continue to power demand for our products. In Test, it's device complexity and unit growth, in Industrial Automation, it's labor scarcity, the need for resiliency and productivity improvement. 
Opening further, performance at the company level from 2016 through 2020 saw our sales and non-GAAP EPS grow at a compounded rate of 16% and 32%, respectively. For the first half of this year, sales are running ahead of that rate at 21%, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew at 29% compared with last year. This demonstrates both the vitality of the markets we serve and the efficiency of our operating model. 
Significantly, in Q2, we saw Industrial Automation demand recover in all major regions, but particularly in North America. As a result, our production teams operated at a high pace in Q2, and that pace is seen in Q3. 
For the year, our IA business is on track to grow about 30% from 2019 and about 40% from 2020. 
Looking closely at the segment level. In Semi Test, SOC shipments grew 29% in Q2 from Q2 of 2020, with particular strength in both the compute and mobility end markets. For the first half, SoC sales grew 19%. For the first time in several years, smartphone unit shipments are helping growth in the mobility segment, where as recent years have mostly relied on complexity growth. 
Commodity and compute are the 2 largest subsegments in SOC. Automotive, electric and industrial demand continues to be strong. The auto-related semi test market is expected to exceed $500 million this year, the highest level since 2017. This is despite the fact that automobile unit production will be lower in 2017 -- lower than 2017. A portion of this strength is Test. We're also seeing the impact of increased semi content and complexity per automobile, driving the test market. 
Our Memory Test shipments also grew in Q2 -- from Q2 of 2020, up 9%, led by flash tester demand. For the 6-month period, overall shipments were up 18% from last year on solid demand for both flash wafer and systems. This reflects significant growth in smartphone demand, the build-out of new memory capacity in China and the growth of SSD demand. Looking at the full year we are again revising up the SOC market for 2021 to now be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion, with increasing strength in the x86 GPU and display driver segments. 
Recall that we have lower customer exposure in those markets, with much of this incremental growth going to our competitors. So we'll likely see our SoC share around 48% for the year. 
In Memory, at the macro level, our market estimates are unchanged with the test market this year expected to be about $1 billion and our share to be at about the 40% level. I will note that the expected ramp of DDR5 for server applications and the broader adoption of LPDDR5 is pushing out into 2022. 
Shifting to our System Test group. Sales were up 26% in the first half compared with 2020 with strong storage test demand and a recovery in our production board test unit driving the growth. For the full year, we see System Test group -- the System Test group grow in the 10% to 20% range. 
At LitePoint, sales in Q2 were up 12% over 2Q 2020. While 5G millimeter wave demand is lower than expected, the environment in wireless test is improving as we move through the year due to the continued WiFi 6 growth and early WiFi 7 investments. In addition, ultra wideband adoption is increasing, adding a new growth vector for LitePoint. For the full year, LitePoint will likely grow in the 10% range. 
Moving on to Industrial Automation. The combination of expanding demand across our major markets and the increase in the range of tests served by our universal robots and mirror units drove group sales up 57% in Q2 last year in the first half. Compared to pre-pandemic 2019, first half sales are up 22%. Supply chain issues have constrained growth a little bit, with lead times pushing out about 1 week. 
The demand environment for IA has recovered in most regions from last year's slowdown. America was the fastest-growing major region in Q2, with sales up over 90% from last year. Although we did see a lull in some countries in Asia where COVID has spiked in recent months, the second half of the year outlook is quite strong in all our major regions. 
Our long-term growth strategy in IA continues unchanged, and we expect long-term annual growth in the [Audio Gap] gross margins get a 5% to 15% operating margin during these high-growth years. [Audio Gap] We are also expanding our sales to OEMs that integrate our robots into their products. 
Last quarter, we noted the expanding range of applications for UR robots in a high-voltage line application with hundreds of being deployed. Today, I'd like to highlight the success of UR+ plug-and-play applications for industrial. There is a long-standing and chronic shortage of qualified welders worldwide, with an estimated 100,000 unfilled welding jobs in the U.S. alone. While automated solutions exist for large applications like auto manufacturing, customers with lower volume and higher mix products are not well served by traditional automation. 
The integration of a forced Torch sensor into E-Series cobots enabled the precision needed for this application, and with UR+ integrating with our partners, we began serving this about 3 years ago. During this time, welding applications have grown to be about 6% of our global and our [ 1,000 cobots ] sold in 2021, more than tripling our 2020 pace. 
As we continue to extend the performance of our UR platform, we expect these applications had vectors to traditional industrial applications. We have similar market expanding initiatives in play on our mirror, but I'll save those details for a future call. 
Summing it all up, the first half of the year has been a strong sales, strong gross margins and earnings growth. Longer term, the markets we serve are showing a future global economy. The importance, pervasiveness and enabling capability of electronics in every facet of our lives and industry is driving more fab investment, more complexity and more test. Likewise, the broadening application and fast ROI of robots in a world with labor shortages and productivity challenges is another growth trend. 
Strategically, we positioned ourselves in line with and plan to continue to make the Test and IA as our full potential while driving world-class returns. 
While the rate of change in our markets is accelerating; we are well positioned to thrive as a company and to bring additional value to customers and shareholders. 
I'll now turn things over to Sanjay to provide additional color on the financials."

Today, I'll on our Q2 results, comment on current business conditions and describe Q3. Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $1.086 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $1.91, up 29% and 44%, respectively, from Q2 '20. No",1024,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll on our Q2 results, comment on current business conditions and describe Q3. 
Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $1.086 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $1.91, up 29% and 44%, respectively, from Q2 '20. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.6% and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $250 million, $5 million below the high guidance due to the timing of some nonrecurring engineering expenses. Non operating profit rate was 36.5%. In the quarter was 59% compared with our of 58%. The increase was tied to favorable product mix in the quarter versus planned. 
For context, Q2 2020 gross margin was approximately. In April, the earnings noted that this level of gross margin would continue in the near term, driven by the introduction of several key test systems in early 2020, which would take quarters to come down the cost curve. These new product introductions, coupled with heightened costs driven by COVID shortages, were impacting our gross margins in 2020. One year later, we have now most of these test solutions at volume, and they have come down the cost curve as expected. 
The result contributed to higher margins in the second quarter, which we expect will continue in the second half of the year. A component of gross margin improvement over 2020 is higher revenue-yielding of leverage in the gross margin line. We had one 10% customer in the quarter. 
Excluding discrete items for the 14.5% on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis. 
Looking at the results from a business unit perspective, revenue of $834 million was up 27% from Q2 2020. SOC revenue was $742 million, up 29%, driven by strength in compute, mobility, industrial and automotive. Memory revenue was $92 million, up 9% from prior year, driven by strength in flash test and flash wafer sort segments. 
System Test group had revenue of $105 million, which was up 46% year-over-year. This is driven by $58 million in storage test sales, including both and SLT solutions. In defense and aerospace and production board test. 
Storage Test, HDD and SLT demand remains robust as drive densities continue to increase and the number of devices adopting. 
At LitePoint, revenue of $55 million was 2% -- was up 12% prior year due to continued strength in, increases in and ultra-wide band test market segments. 
Now to Industrial Automation. As we did in April, I'll provide revenue metrics comparing Q2 '21 results with both Q2 '20 and Q2 '19, so you'll have the full context given the impact of a contracting market tied to COVID last year. Industrial revenue of $92 million was up 57% year-over-year and 23% over Q2 '19. Revenue expanded in all regions in Q2 over last year, with North America delivering the highest absolute revenue growth. U.S. and Europe represented about 77% of IA revenue in the quarter, with China contributing about 14%. 
UR sales were $76 million in Q2, up 75% year-over-year and up over 2019. Mir sales were $16 million, up 41% from Q2 '20 and 51% from Q2 '19. Recall, Mir had an unusual in Q2 '20 as its robots were widely deployed in automated COVID disinfectant applications. 
The longer-term outlook in our IA business continues to brighten. We expect continued labor shortages to drive new applications for both our fixed and mobile robots. Mark highlighted the shortage of welders and how that has opened up a new market for our UR cobs, but that is just 1 of many job categories with acute short-term and long-term labor shortages. 
Our strategy is to provide an open platform that creative developers can leverage to solve industry-specific labor shortages. The numerous filling ultraviolet producing solutions built on our platform last year is a shining example of the agility of our partner networks to solve problems. 
We're investing in engineering, support and marketing resources to make Mir platforms even easier to build upon, which will enable the continued proliferation of high-value automated solutions of challenging problems for an expanding range of customers. 
Significantly, these development partners and customers provide great feedback on our R&D development plans. 
From a financial perspective, we expect IA will operate around the low end of our target profit range of 5% and 15%. We do expect IA to operate above the Rule of 40 in 2021. That is, the sum of operating profit and revenue growth over 40%. Longer term, when growth moderates, we expect the IA Group to have a similar operating profit rate as our test portfolio. 
Shifting to supply. We continue to manage through numerous supply constraints along with increased material, manufacturing and logistics costs in both our test and IA businesses. For some products in both Test and IA, the supply constraints have extended our lead times, and we're working closely with customers to minimize the impact of these delays. 
But we've been able to offset these higher costs through operating leverage with higher volumes and other cost-saving measures, so the cost increase impact on the P&L has not been material. 
We do expect to be dealing with supply line related issues in Q3 and Q4 this year, which are reflected in our forecasts. 
[Audio Gap] were $25.69 per share. Regarding our convertible debt. $15.6 million was paid in Q2 to convertible bondholders ahead of maturity. By the end of August 2021, bondholders will have nearly converted a total of $302 million, leaving a face value of [ $58 million ] outstanding. 
Looking at our operating model, I'd like to make 3 quick points. First, our performance over time. From 10 years ago, our gross margin percent has expanded from the low to mid to nearly 60%, and our operating margin from the teens to low 20s to greater than 30% today. 
Second, our flexible business model shifts fixed cost to variable costs where appropriate, through contracted or outsourced manufacturing, variable compensation and other levers which enables resiliency on the downside and is creative when business is strong. 
Third; the operating leverage in the model is evident in our Q2 results. Our test businesses are dropping through over $0.50 per revenue dollar through to the profit line in 2021."

Third, the operating leverage in the model is evident in our Q2 results. Our test businesses are dropping through over $0.50 per revenue dollar through to the profit line in 2021, even while we continue to increase our R&D, support -- and support investments to strengthen our test business. This enables Teradyne to continue to invest in both our test and IA portfolios. 
For IA, we are building a deeper product ecosystem and distribution differentiation while achieving the Rule of 40 in our IA portfolio. 
Now to our outlook for Q3. As Mark noted, the demand environment across the business remains strong. Our guidance assumes no significant changes, positive or negative, in the availability of materials and also assumes that we won't see additional pandemic-related issues. With that said, sales in Q3 are expected to be between $880 million and $960 million, with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.29 to $1.55 and 176 million diluted shares. 
Third quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and noncash imputed interest on convertible debt. Third quarter gross margins are estimated to be between 59% and 60%. OpEx is expected to run at 27% to 29% of third quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 32%. 
Regarding OpEx for the full year. While we spent a bit lower than planned in Q2, we expect the full year OpEx will be about in line with the plan we described in April. We expect total operating expenses for 2021 to be about $1 billion, or up approximately 19% from 2020. We recognize that we're on track to meet our 2024 earnings model this year. We'll update the model on our regular cadence in January, after our detailed midterm plan income is complete in Q4 this year. 
In summary, our businesses are performing extremely well, delivering strong revenue and earnings growth while funding the investments that will drive future success. Our first half sales grew 21% and non-GAAP EPS grew 29% above the first half of 2020, which itself was a record. We expect to deliver the highest Q3 sales and profit in history. 
Our employees and production partners around the world have delivered a record number of systems under challenging conditions. Our support teams have done whatever was needed to make our customers successful. And our engineering teams have kept the new product pipeline moving on schedule. It's been an impressive display of teamwork, and I'm proud to be part of the powerful Teradyne team. 
With that, I'll turn things back to Andrew."

So I think the complexity trends looking even into next year are all very strong and positive. In the case of mobility, the newer lithographies that are coming online are being widely adopted by the manufacturers of silicon for phones, which portends more transistors, which portends more test time. So that looking into next year, all looks positive. And we get, at this point in the year, early glimpses of what the silicon for next year might actually look like. 
The -- on the compute side, similarly, we not only have the trend of lower lithography nodes, but the new interface standards related to LPDDR5 and DDR5, as I mentioned in my remarks, -- The early adoption of that has been pushed out a little bit as the processors that go with it have been delayed a bit. But all of the complexity required to run at those higher bandwidths is coming in 2022. So those are 2 positive things I look at that gives me confidence that this driver of complexity growth is definitely going to be strong next year. 
In terms of share, what we said before is that penetrating the traditional x86 GPU stalwarts is going to be a long-term endeavor for us that's going to hinge on some kind of technological discontinuity likely shift to DDR5 or like a shift to PAM4 interfaces, to crack into. So that one is episodic and will play out over, let's say, 3 to 5 years. 
On the other front is -- are the emerging hyperscalers and new people coming into the market of creating complex silicon. These are automobile manufacturers, hyperscalers that we've talked about in the past, the Googles, the Facebooks, the Microsofts, the Amazons, That's where we're focused on getting a position to grow with them as they launch their products into the market in the shorter term."

And the test times comparatively between those 2 are not that different. It's kind of proportional to test count. 
The new ARM processors that are coming to market for compute applications, not smartphone applications, have perhaps anywhere from 25% to 60% at or on transistor count above what's at the highest end of smartphones. And the test time associated with them, I would say, is proportionately longer at this point. And so I think it's, generally speaking, scaling with transistor count and the transistor count on the arm side is running a little bit at a faster clip than it is on the more traditional architecture side, if that helps."

And in terms of the applications coming to market, in the short term, we know about the phone applications. We know about some early adopters of ARM for compute. Those are all coming to market or are in the market now. The hyperscalers that we're working with are coming into market at various points over next year with products that are quite interesting but highly speculative as to whether they'll latch in the market.

Obviously, the different components within Semi Test are  going to be a little volatile, but we do see a trend down. It's still what we believe is very strong demand, but we see a trend down. And we see in our IA portfolio, really, strength. Obviously, with the COVID impact in 2020, industrials are really coming back. I'll cite some PMIs in the 60s at the U.S. and Europe.

So for example, we're going to be up about 30% from revenue in 2019, 40% of up from 2020. And in the script, I mentioned this application for welding, which is a brand-new application that is now driving about 6% of our sales for the year. Last quarter, I talked about this service application for servicing high-voltage power lines that's also running at around that 6% of sales applications that was nonexistent -- essentially nonexistent 2 years ago. 
So already, we have 12% of our growth attributed to new applications in new markets with new customers that we didn't have 2 years ago. So it's a combination of expanding applications like those 2 examples as well as established markets growing that's driving this. 
And our top 3 applications tend to be the same. It's automotive supply chain, it's industrial machine tending and its electronic assembly tend to be the ones that are at the top of the pack. But frankly, they are shrinking as a percentage of sales as these new applications come online. 
So what gives me confidence looking forward is that ecosystem of partners who are developing these application solutions on our platform, not our competitors, is just continuing to grow and prosper. And they're not all going to be as successful as high voltage line tending or welding, but it only takes 10% of them to fuel the kind of growth numbers that we've been seeing. And the activity there is very strong, and the technology is maturing to the point that more and more applications can economically be served. 
And over the horizon, when you look at what AI can bring, there's a whole new set of, let's say, features that will enable yet another expansion of the market. It's what gives us the confidence to talk about these kind of decade-long growth rates of 25%, 30%, 35%."

So I guess the bias is to the upside, but curious how you're thinking about that market. 
And then as a follow-up, a question on storage test. It seems like both HDD and SLT are trending very nicely. I think the business was up more than 2x last year in 2020. Curious what you're thinking about the business full year 2021. If you can differentiate between SLT and HDD, that would be super helpful."

So from an auto market perspective, it's true this year, we've seen tremendous growth and just about $500 million or plus or minus a bit from a market size. And yes, as far as we've seen even back to 2017. 
And fundamentally, I think in the last call, there was commentary around the auto industry, for years, has lived on a just-in-time manufacturing. And fundamentally, in back half of 2019, sales weren't so high. And coming into '20, obviously, demand has really picked up. And so you're seeing just a significant replenishment of inventory back into the system. And we're seeing that continue. We see, obviously, the lead times. And currently, the demand is outstripping our supply. And we see that with good visibility until the end of 2021. 
2022 will be interesting because we'll have to take a look at where the inventory levels and what is the market demand in 2022 in first half. And so it's a little bit opaque, I'd say, in 2022, but it will depend on what lead to be the inventory level turns out and the end market demand 
And from a storage perspective, a little bit of color around 2020 and 2021. If I go back to 2020, HDD and our SLT business was kind of split relatively even. One was a little bigger than the other. And from an HDD perspective, we've seen continued end market demand fueling that business. 
But when we look into 2021 from an SLT perspective, we're seeing a broadening of devices being adopted for SLT testing, which is providing a tailwind, which is enabling a larger growth in that segment of the storage business this year relative to the HDD business. So the HDD business is still very strong end market demand, very strong, but the broadening of the SLT -- or sorry, the ASICs being tested under SLT is increasing, which is really good news. So it's growing a little faster than the HDD shipments from a storage perspective."

So you've sort of given us all the different pieces. You guided wireless for the year, you guided systems for the year, and you gave us the pieces on the test businesses. So if I just look at what that implies for SSC in Q4, I mean, you're going to do about $575 million roughly for SOC in Q3. That's not a big mystery. But the Q4 number implies it goes down to like $425 million, somewhere in the low 4s. That will be down year-over-year. 
So I guess my first question is like why would that be, given that you have all this visibility? And obviously, you're quite bullish about the market. So why would Q4 be down so much? That's my first question, in SoC."

It's a portfolio of businesses, and all of those numbers have a margin of plus or minus, let's say, 1% around them. So that creates a large Monte Carlo simulation. And if you go right down the middle, I think you probably -- I'm sure you did the math right, that's probably what you come up with. 
But that's typical, as I said earlier, of where we stand at this point in the year looking into Q4 as in past years, where it's come in higher. There's a significant unknown around what we'll book between now and through October that can drive Q4 shipments. And while we have backlog that extends in some product lines, as Sanjay mentioned, all the way through the end of the year, there's others that's more of a turns business. 
And we've positioned ourselves to be very responsive on the SoC front in general to capitalize on these sort of short-demand request to come from our customers. That's why we've in the past been able to, in the quarter, exceed our guidance, and even in the fourth quarter and prior years, exceed what we thought when we were talking back then in July. 
So it could very well turn out that the demand that we've seen in the last couple of years in Q4 yet materializes again, and we end up, and as C.J. was hinting at, having a second half larger than first. It's just that at this point in the year, given what customers are talking about, we just don't see that as the most likely outcome. 
And it's episodic, too. What happens in Q4, a lot of it happens, in the past couple of years, in the December quarter, preparing for product launches that occur in February time frame, new phones and things like that. And so again, with a rash of phone introductions in February, although we don't see it now, we could see a demand for SoC testers to support that driving December shipments."

Today, I'll summarize our results for the second quarter and first half of 2021, update on current conditions in both Test and Industrial Automation, and comment on our view for the second half of the yea",1341,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll summarize our results for the second quarter and first half of 2021, update on current conditions in both Test and Industrial Automation, and comment on our view for the second half of the year. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on the quarter and our guidance for Q3. 
The strong demand we saw in Q1 accelerated in Q2 as both our Test and Industrial Automation groups grew substantially in the quarter. The long-term demand drivers we've discussed in the past continue to power demand for our products. In Test, it's device complexity and unit growth; in Automation, it's labor scarcity, the need for resiliency and productivity improvement. 
Opening further, performance at the company level from 2016 through 2020 saw our sales and non-GAAP EPS grow at a compounded rate of 16% and 32%, respectively. For the first half of this year, sales are running ahead of that rate at 21%, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew at 29% compared with last year. This demonstrates both the [ vitality ] of the markets we serve and the efficiency of our operating model. 
Significantly, in Q2, we saw Industrial Automation demand recover in all major regions, but particularly in North America. As a result, our production and [ operating teams ] operated at a high pace in Q2, and that pace is [ increasing ] in Q3. For the year, our IA business is on track to grow about 30% from 2019 and about 40% from 2020. 
Looking closely at the segment level. In Semi Test, SOC shipments grew 29% in Q2 from Q2 of 2020 with particular strength in both the compute and mobility end markets. For the first half, SOC sales grew 19%. For the first time in several years, smartphone unit shipments are helping growth in the mobility [ segment ], where as recent years have mostly relied on complexity growth. 
[ IA ] and compute are the 2 largest subsegments in SOC. Automotive, analog and industrial demand continues to be strong. The auto-related semi test market is expected to exceed $500 million this year, the highest level since 2017. This is despite the fact that automobile unit production will be about lower in 2017 -- lower than 2017. A portion of this strength is test equipment. We're also seeing the impact of increased semi content and complexity per automobile, driving the test market. 
Our memory test shipments also grew in Q2 from Q2 of 2020, up 9%, led by flash tester demand. For the 6-month period, overall shipments were up 18% from last year on solid demand for both flash wafer and [ flash ] systems. This reflects significant growth in smartphone demand, the build-out of new memory capacity in China and the growth of SSD demand.
Looking at the full year, we are again revising up the SOC market for 2021 to now be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion with increasing strength in the x86 GPU and display driver segments. Recall that we have lower customer exposure in those markets with much of this incremental growth going to our competitors. So we'll likely see our SOC share around 48% for the year. 
In memory, at the macro level, our market estimates are unchanged with the test market this year expected to be about $1 billion and our share to be at about the 40% level. I will note that the expected ramp of DDR5 for server applications and the broader adoption of LPDDR5 is pushing out into 2022. 
Shifting to our System Test group, sales were up 26% in the first half compared with 2020, with strong Storage Test demand and a recovery in our Production Board Test unit driving the growth. For the full year, we see System Test group -- the System Test group grow in the 10% to 20% range. 
At LitePoint, sales in Q2 were up 12% over 2Q 2020. While 5G millimeter wave demand is lower than expected, the environment in Wireless Test is improving as we move through the year due to the continued WiFi 6 growth and early WiFi 7 investments. In addition, ultra-wideband adoption is increasing, adding a new growth vector for LitePoint. For the full year, LitePoint will likely grow in the 10% range. 
Moving on to Industrial Automation. The combination of expanding demand across our major markets and the increase in the range of tests served by our Universal Robots and MiR units drove group sales up 57% in Q2 last year [ to 45% ] in the first half. Compared to pre-pandemic 2019, first half sales are up 22%. Supply chain issues have constrained growth a little bit with lead times pushing out about 1 week. 
The demand environment for IA has recovered in most regions from last year's slowdown. America was the fastest-growing major region in Q2 with sales up over 90% from last year. Although we did see a [ lull ] in some countries in Asia where COVID has spiked in recent months, the second half of the year outlook is quite strong in all our major regions. 
Our long-term growth strategy in IA continues unchanged, and we expect long-term annual growth in the 20% to 35% range. This year, we will likely have a growth of about 40% from 2020, and we will continue to invest to enable this growth, target [ 15% ] gross margins, [ get ] a 5% to 15% operating margin during these high-growth years.
From an investment perspective, we are expanding our engineering programs to shorten deployment times, increase the served market and improve the customer support experience. We are also growing our capacity to support distributors, integrators and UR plus and MiRGo apps development partners as they engage customers. We are also expanding our sales to OEMs that integrate our robots into their products. 
Last quarter, we noted the expanding range of applications for UR robots into high-voltage line application with hundreds of [indiscernible] being deployed. Today, I'd like to highlight the success of UR+ plug-and-play applications for Industrial [ Automation ]..There is a long-standing and chronic shortage of qualified welders worldwide with an estimated 100,000 unfilled welding jobs in the U.S. alone. While automated solutions exist for large applications like auto manufacturing, customers with lower volume and higher mix products are not well served by traditional automation. 
The integration of a force torque sensor into e-Series cobots enabled the precision needed for this application. And with UR+ [ integrating ] with our partners, we began serving this market about 3 years ago. During this time, welding applications have grown to be about 6% of our global [ sales ] and are on [indiscernible] 1,000 cobots sold in 2021, more than tripling our 2020 pace. 
As we continue to extend the performance of our UR platform, we expect these high applications had growth vectors to traditional industrial applications. We have similar market-expanding initiatives in play on our MiR platform, but I'll save those details for a future call. 
Summing it all up, the first half of the year has been a strong sales, strong gross margins and earnings growth [indiscernible]. Longer term, the markets we serve are showing [ increasing demand ] in a future global economy. The importance, pervasiveness and enabling capability of electronics in every [ aspect ] of our lives and industry is driving more fab investment, more complexity and more test. Likewise, the broadening application and fast [ ROI of ] collaborative robots in a world with labor shortages and productivity challenges is another growth trend. 
Strategically, we positioned ourselves in line with [indiscernible] and plan to continue to make [indiscernible] Test and IA as our full potential while driving world-class [ returns ]. While the rate of change in our markets is accelerating, we are well positioned to thrive as a company and to bring additional value to customers and shareholders. 
I'll now turn things over to Sanjay [ to provide ] additional color on the financials."

Second quarter sales were $1.086 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $1.91, up 29",1144,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll [ provide details ] on our Q2 results, comment on current business conditions and describe [ our outlook for ] Q3. 
Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $1.086 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $1.91, up 29% and 44%, respectively, from Q2 '20. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.6%, and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $250 million, but $5 million below the high guidance due to the timing of some nonrecurring engineering expenses.
Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 36.5%. [ Gross margin ] in the quarter was [ 59.6% ] compared with our plan of 58%. The increase was tied to favorable product mix in the quarter versus planned. 
For context, Q2 2020 gross margin was approximately [indiscernible]. In April [indiscernible] earnings, we noted that this level of gross margin would continue in the near term, driven by the introduction of several key test systems in early 2020, which would [ take several ] quarters to come down the cost curve. These new product introductions, coupled with heightened costs driven by COVID shortages, were impacting our gross margins in 2020. One year later, we have now most of these test solutions at volume, and they have come down the cost curve as expected. 
The result contributed to higher margins in the second quarter, which we expect will continue in the second half of the year. A component of gross margin improvement over 2020 is higher revenue yielding of leverage in the gross margin line. We had one 10% customer in the quarter [indiscernible] excluding discrete items of 14.5% on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis. 
Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. [ Semi Test ] revenue of $834 million was up 27% from Q2 2020. SOC revenue was $742 million, up 29%, driven by strength in compute, mobility, industrial and automotive. Memory revenue was $92 million, up 9% from prior year, driven by strength in flash test and flash wafer sort segments. 
System Test group had revenue of $105 million, which was up 46% year-over-year. This is driven by $58 million in Storage Test sales, including both HDD and SLT solutions; [ $27 million ] in Defense & Aerospace and Production Board Test. 
In Storage Test, HDD and SLT demand remains robust as drive densities continue to increase and the number of devices adopting [ SLT spokes ]. At LitePoint, revenue of $55 million was 12% -- was up 12% from prior year due to continued strength at [ WiFi ], increases in [indiscernible] and ultra-wide band test market segments. 
Now to Industrial Automation. As we did in April, I'll provide revenue metrics comparing Q2 '21 results with both Q2 '20 and Q2 '19, so you'll have the full context given the impact of a contracting market tied to COVID last year. Industrial Automation revenue of $92 million was up 57% year-over-year and 23% over Q2 '19. Revenue expanded in all regions in Q2 [ over ] last year, with North America delivering the highest absolute revenue growth. U.S. and Europe represented about 77% of IA revenue in the quarter, with China contributing about 14%. 
UR sales were $76 million in Q2, up 75% year-over-year and [ 80% ] over 2019. MiR sales were $16 million, up 41% from Q2 '20 and 51% from Q2 '19. Recall, MiR had an [indiscernible] on Q2 '20 as its robots were widely deployed in automated COVID disinfectant applications. 
The longer-term outlook in our IA business continues to brighten. We expect continued labor shortages to drive new applications for both our fixed and mobile robots. Mark highlighted the shortage of welders and how that has opened up a new market for our UR cobots, but that is just one of many job categories with acute short-term and long-term labor shortages. 
Our strategy is to provide an open platform that creative developers can leverage to solve industry-specific labor shortages. The numerous filling ultraviolet disinfecting solutions built on our [ platform ] last year is a shining example of the agility of our partner networks to solve problems. 
We're investing in engineering support and marketing resources to make our MiR platforms even easier to build upon, which will enable the continued proliferation of high-value automated solutions to solve challenging problems for an expanding range of customers. Significantly, these development partners and customers provide great feedback on our R&D development plans. 
From a financial perspective, we expect IA will operate around the low end of our target profit range of 5% and 15%. We do expect IA to operate above the Rule of 40 in 2021, that is the sum of operating profit and revenue growth of over [ 40% ]. Longer term, when growth moderates, we expect the IA group to have a similar operating profit rate as our Test portfolio. 
Shifting to supply. We continue to manage through numerous supply constraints along with increased material, manufacturing and logistics costs in both our Test and IA businesses. For some products in both Test and IA, the supply constraints have extended our [ lead times ], and we're working closely with customers to minimize the impact of these delays. 
But we've been able to offset these higher costs through operating leverage with higher volumes and other cost-saving measures, so the cost increase impact on the P&L has not been material. We do expect to be dealing with supply line-related issues in Q3 and Q4 this year, which are reflected in our forecasts. 
Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.42 billion, $172 million of free cash flow in the quarter, $151 million and $17 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.6 million shares for $197 million at an average [ price ] of $125.69 per share.
Regarding our convertible debt. $15.6 million was paid in Q2 to convertible bondholders ahead of maturity. By the end of August 2021, bondholders will have early converted a total of $302 million, leaving a face value of $58 million outstanding. 
Looking at our operating model, I'd like to make 3 quick points. First, our performance over time. From 10 years ago, our gross margin percent has expanded from the low to [ mid-50s ] to nearly 60% [ today ] and our operating margin from the teens to low 20s to greater than 30% today. 
Second, our flexible business model shifts fixed cost to variable costs where appropriate through [ contract ] or outsourced manufacturing, variable compensation and other [ means ], which enables resiliency on the downside and is creative (sic) [ accretive ] when business is strong. 
Third, the operating leverage in the model is evident in our Q2 results. Our Test businesses are dropping through over $0.50 per revenue dollar through to the profit line in 2021..."

Second, our flexible business model shifts fixed cost to variable costs, where appropriate, through contract or outsourced manufacturing, variable compensation and other means, which enables resiliency on the downside and is accretive when business is strong. 
Third, the operating leverage in the model is evident in our Q2 results. Our Test businesses are dropping through over $0.50 per revenue dollar through to the profit line in 2021, even while we continue to increase our R&D support -- and support investments to strengthen our Test business. This enables Teradyne to continue to invest in both our Test and IA portfolios. For IA, we are building a deeper product ecosystem and distribution differentiation while achieving the Rule of 40 in our IA portfolio. 
Now to our outlook for Q3. As Mark noted, the demand environment across the business remains strong. Our guidance assumes no significant changes, positive or negative, in the availability of materials and also assumes that we won't see additional pandemic-related issues. With that said, sales in Q3 are expected to be between $880 million and $960 million with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.29 to $1.55 and 176 million diluted shares. 
Third quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and noncash imputed interest on convertible debt. Third quarter gross margins are estimated to be between 59% and 60%. OpEx is expected to run at 27% to 29% of third quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 32%. 
Regarding OpEx for the full year. While we spent a bit lower than planned in Q2, we expect the full year OpEx will be about in line with the plan we described in April. We expect total operating expenses for 2021 to be about $1 billion or up approximately 19% from 2020. We recognize that we're on track to meet our 2024 earnings model this year. We'll update the model on a regular cadence in January after our detailed midterm plan income is complete in Q4 this year. 
In summary, our businesses are performing extremely well, delivering strong revenue and earnings growth while funding the investments that will drive future success. Our first half sales grew 21%, and non-GAAP EPS grew 29% above the first half of 2020, which itself was a record. We expect to deliver the highest Q3 sales and profits in history. 
Our employees and production partners around the world have delivered a record number of systems under challenging conditions. Our support teams have done whatever was needed to make our customers successful. And our engineering teams have kept the new product pipeline moving on schedule. It's been an impressive display of teamwork, and I'm proud to be part of this powerful Teradyne team. 
With that, I'll turn things back to Andrew."

So I think the complexity trends looking even into the next year are all very strong and positive. In the case of mobility, the newer lithographies that are coming online are being widely adopted by the manufacturers of silicon for phones, which portends more transistors, which portends more test time. So that, looking into next year, all looks positive. And we get, at this point in the year, early glimpses of what the silicon for next year might actually look like. 
The -- on the compute side, similarly, we not only have the trend of lower lithography nodes, but the new interface standards related to LPDDR5 and DDR5, as I mentioned in my remarks, the early adoption of that has been pushed out a little bit as the processors that go with it have been delayed a bit. But all of the complexity required to run at those higher bandwidths is coming in 2022. So those are 2 positive things I look at that gives me confidence that this driver of complexity growth is definitely going to be strong next year. 
In terms of share, what we said before is that penetrating the traditional x86 GPU stalwarts is going to be a long-term endeavor for us that's going to hinge on some kind of technological discontinuity like that shift to DDR5 or like a shift to PAM4 interfaces to crack into. So that one is episodic and will play out over, let's say, 3 to 5 years. 
On the other front is -- are the emerging hyperscalers and new people coming into the market of creating complex silicon. These are automobile manufacturers, hyperscalers that we've talked about in the past, the Googles, the Facebooks, the Microsofts, the Amazons, That's where we're focused on getting a position to grow with them as they launch their products into the market in the shorter term."

And the environment is tighter, I would say, today. And frankly, we don't see it letting up until the second half of 2022.

And the test times comparatively between those 2 are not that different. It's kind of proportional to test count. 
The new ARM processors that are coming to market for compute applications, not smartphone applications, have perhaps anywhere from 25% to 60% at or on transistor count above what's at the highest end of smartphones. And the test time associated with them, I would say, is proportionately longer at this point. And so I think it's, generally speaking, scaling with transistor count, and the transistor count on the ARM side is running a little bit at a faster clip than it is on the more traditional architecture side, if that helps."

It's interesting because there's no silver bullet as to what's driving the growth at UR. So for example, we're going to be up about 30% from revenue in 2019, 40% up from 2020. And in the script, I mentioned this application for welding, which is a br",326,"Yes. It's interesting because there's no silver bullet as to what's driving the growth at UR. So for example, we're going to be up about 30% from revenue in 2019, 40% up from 2020. And in the script, I mentioned this application for welding, which is a brand-new application that is now driving about 6% of our sales for the year. Last quarter, I talked about this service application for servicing high-voltage power lines that's also running at around that 6% of sales applications that was nonexistent -- essentially nonexistent 2 years ago. 
So already, we have 12% of our growth attributed to new applications in new markets with new customers that we didn't have 2 years ago. So it's a combination of expanding applications like those 2 examples as well as established markets growing that's driving this. And our top 3 applications tend to be the same. It's automotive supply chain, it's industrial machine tending and it's electronic assembly tend to be the ones that are at the top of the pack. But frankly, they are shrinking as a percentage of sales as these new applications come online. 
So what gives me confidence looking forward is that ecosystem of partners who are developing these application solutions on our platform, not our competitors, is just continuing to grow and prosper. And they're not all going to be as successful as high-voltage line tending or welding. But it only takes 10% of them to fuel the kind of growth numbers that we've been seeing. And the activity there is very strong, and the technology is maturing to the point that more and more applications can economically be served. 
And over the horizon, when you look at what AI can bring, there's a whole new set of, let's say, features that will enable yet another expansion of the market. It's what gives us the confidence to talk about these kind of decade-long growth rates of 25%, 30%, 35%."

But it's hard to sort of prognosticate too much about where the share comes from. And as you know, one customer's buying capacity can swing multiple points of share in any given year.

So from an auto market perspective, it's true this year, we've seen tremendous growth and just about $500 million or plus or minus a bit from a market size, and yes, as far as we've seen even back to 2017. And fundamentally, I think in the last call, there was commentary around the auto industry, for years, has lived on a just-in-time manufacturing. And fundamentally, in back half of 2019, sales weren't so high. And coming into '20, obviously, demand has really picked up. And so you're seeing just a significant replenishment of inventory back into the system. And we're seeing that continue. We see, obviously, the lead times. And currently, the demand is outstripping our supply. And we see that with good visibility until the end of 2021. 
2022 will be interesting because we'll have to take a look at what are the inventory levels and what is the market demand in 2022 in first half. And so it's a little bit opaque, I'd say, in 2022, but it will depend on what I believe to be the inventory level and, obviously, the end market demand.
And from a storage perspective, a little bit of color around 2020 and 2021. If I go back to 2020, HDD and our SLT business was kind of split relatively even. One was a little bigger than the other. And from an HDD perspective, we've seen continued end-market demand fueling that business. But when we look into 2021 from an SLT perspective, we're seeing a broadening of devices being adopted for SLT testing, which is providing a tailwind, which is enabling a larger growth in that segment of the storage business this year relative to the HDD business.
So the HDD business is still very strong; end-market demand, very strong. But the broadening of the SLT -- or sorry, the ASICs being tested under SLT is increasing, which is really good news. So it's growing a little faster than the HDD shipments from a storage perspective."

So you've sort of given us all the different pieces. You guided wireless for the year, you guided systems for the year and you gave us the pieces on the Test businesses.
So if I just look at what that implies for SOC in Q4, I mean you're going to do about $575 million roughly for SOC in Q3. That's not a big mystery. But the Q4 number implies it goes down to like $425 million, somewhere in the low 4s. That will be down year-over-year.

And if you go right down the middle, I think you probably -- I'm sure you did the math right, that's probably what you come up with. 
But that's typical, as I said earlier, of where we stand at this point in the year looking into Q4 as in past years where it's come in higher. There's a significant unknown around what we'll book between now and through October that can drive Q4 shipments. And while we have backlog that extends in some product lines, as Sanjay mentioned, all the way through the end of the year, there's others that's more of a turns business. 
And we've positioned ourselves to be very responsive on the SOC front in general to capitalize on these sort of short demand request to come from our customers. That's why we've in the past been able to, in the quarter, exceed our guidance and even in the fourth quarter and prior years exceed what we thought when we were talking back then in July. 
So it could very well turn out that the demand that we've seen in the last couple of years in Q4 yet materializes again and we end up, as C.J. was hinting at, having a second half larger than first. It's just that at this point in the year, given what customers are talking about, we just don't see that as the most likely outcome. 
And it's episodic, too. What happens in Q4, a lot of it happens, in the past couple of years, in the December quarter, preparing for product launches that occur in February time frame, new phones and things like that. And so -- and again, with a rash of phone introductions in February, although we don't see it now, we could see a demand for SOC testers to support that driving December shipments."

94728,1674258151,2361745,"Teradyne, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Teradyne, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll summarize our results for the second quarter and first half of 2021, update on current conditions in both Test and Industrial Automation, and comment on our view for the second half of the yea",1328,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll summarize our results for the second quarter and first half of 2021, update on current conditions in both Test and Industrial Automation, and comment on our view for the second half of the year. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on the quarter and our guidance for Q3. 
The strong demand we saw in Q1 accelerated in Q2 as both our Test and Industrial Automation groups grew substantially in the quarter. The long-term demand drivers we've discussed in the past continue to power demand for our products. In Test, it's device complexity and unit growth; in Automation, it's labor scarcity, the need for resiliency and productivity improvement. 
Opening further, performance at the company level from 2016 through 2020 saw our sales and non-GAAP EPS grow at a compounded rate of 16% and 32%, respectively. For the first half of this year, sales are running ahead of that rate at 21%, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew at 29% compared with last year. This demonstrates both the [ vitality   of the markets we serve and the efficiency of our operating model. 
Significantly, in Q2, we saw Industrial Automation demand recover in all major regions, but particularly in North America. As a result, our production and [ operating teams   operated at a high pace in Q2, and that pace is [ increasing   in Q3. For the year, our IA business is on track to grow about 30% from 2019 and about 40% from 2020. 
Looking closely at the segment level. In Semi Test, SOC shipments grew 29% in Q2 from Q2 of 2020 with particular strength in both the compute and mobility end markets. For the first half, SOC sales grew 19%. For the first time in several years, smartphone unit shipments are helping growth in the mobility [ segment  , where as recent years have mostly relied on complexity growth. 
[ IA   and compute are the 2 largest subsegments in SOC. Automotive, analog and industrial demand continues to be strong. The auto-related semi test market is expected to exceed $500 million this year, the highest level since 2017. This is despite the fact that automobile unit production will be about [indiscernible] lower in 2017 -- lower than 2017. A portion of this strength is test equipment. We're also seeing the impact of increased semi content and complexity per automobile, driving the test market. 
Our memory test shipments also grew in Q2 from Q2 of 2020, up 9%, led by flash tester demand. For the 6-month period, overall shipments were up 18% from last year on solid demand for both flash wafer and [ flash   systems. This reflects significant growth in smartphone demand, the build-out of new memory capacity in China and the growth of SSD demand.
Looking at the full year, we are again revising up the SOC market for 2021 to now be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion with increasing strength in the x86 GPU and display driver segments. Recall that we have lower customer exposure in those markets with much of this incremental growth going to our competitors. So we'll likely see our SOC share around 48% for the year. 
In memory, at the macro level, our market estimates are unchanged with the test market this year expected to be about $1 billion and our share to be at about the 40% level. I will note that the expected ramp of DDR5 for server applications and the broader adoption of LPDDR5 is pushing out into 2022. 
Shifting to our System Test group, sales were up 26% in the first half compared with 2020, with strong Storage Test demand and a recovery in our Production Board Test unit driving the growth. For the full year, we see System Test group -- the System Test group grow in the 10% to 20% range. 
At LitePoint, sales in Q2 were up 12% over 2Q 2020. While 5G millimeter wave demand is lower than expected, the environment in Wireless Test is improving as we move through the year due to the continued WiFi 6 growth and early WiFi 7 investments. In addition, ultra-wideband adoption is increasing, adding a new growth vector for LitePoint. For the full year, LitePoint will likely grow in the 10% range. 
Moving on to Industrial Automation. The combination of expanding demand across our major markets and the increase in the range of tests served by our Universal Robots and MiR units drove group sales up 57% in Q2 last year [ to 45%   in the first half. Compared to pre-pandemic 2019, first half sales are up 22%. Supply chain issues have constrained growth a little bit with lead times pushing out about 1 week. 
The demand environment for IA has recovered in most regions from last year's slowdown. America was the fastest-growing major region in Q2 with sales up over 90% from last year. Although we did see a [indiscernible] some countries in Asia where COVID has spiked in recent months, the second half of the year outlook is quite strong in all our major regions. 
Our long-term growth strategy in IA continues unchanged, and we expect long-term annual growth in the 20% to 35% range. This year, we will likely have a growth of about 40% from 2020, and we will continue to invest to enable this growth target of [ 15%   gross margins, [ get   a 5% to 15% operating margin during these high-growth years.
From an investment perspective, we are expanding our engineering programs to shorten deployment times, increase the served market and improve the customer support experience. We are also growing our capacity to support distributors, integrators and UR plus and MiRGo apps development partners as [ they ] engage customers. We are also expanding our sales to OEMs that integrate our robots into their products. 
Last quarter, we noted the expanding range of applications for UR robots into the high-voltage line application with hundreds of                 being deployed. Today, I'd like to highlight the success of UR+ plug-and-play applications for Industrial [ Automation  ..There is a long-standing and chronic shortage of qualified welders worldwide with an estimated 100,000 unfilled welding jobs in the U.S. alone. While automated solutions exist for large applications like auto manufacturing, customers with lower volume and higher mix products are not well served by traditional automation. 
The integration of a force torque sensor into e-Series cobots enabled the precision needed for this application. And with UR+ [ integrating   with our partners, we began serving this market about 3 years ago. During this time, welding applications have grown to be about 6% of our global [ sales   and are on                 1,000 cobots sold in 2021, more than tripling our 2020 pace. 
As we continue to extend the performance of our UR platform, we expect these high applications had growth vectors to traditional industrial applications. We have similar market-expanding initiatives in play on our MiR platform, but I'll save those details for a future call. 
Summing it all up, the first half of the year has been a strong sales, strong gross margins and earnings growth               ]. Longer term, the markets we serve are showing [ increasing demand   in a future global economy. The importance, pervasiveness and enabling capability of electronics in every [ aspect   of our lives and industry is driving more fab investment, more complexity and more test. Likewise, the broadening application and fast [ ROI of   [ collaborative ] robots in a world with labor shortages and productivity challenges is another growth trend. 
Strategically, we positioned ourselves in line with                 and plan to continue to make   System   Test and IA as our full potential while driving world-class [ returns  . While the rate of change in our markets is accelerating, we are well positioned to thrive as a company and to bring additional value to customers and shareholders. 
I'll now turn things over to Sanjay [ to provide   additional color on the financials."
94728,1674258151,2361745,"Teradyne, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Teradyne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll [ provide details   on our Q2 results, comment on current business conditions and describe [ our outlook for   Q3. Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $1.086 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $1.91, up 29",1128,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll [ provide details   on our Q2 results, comment on current business conditions and describe [ our outlook for   Q3. 
Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $1.086 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $1.91, up 29% and 44%, respectively, from Q2 '20. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.6%, and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $250 million, but $5 million below the high guidance due to the timing of some nonrecurring engineering expenses.
Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 36.5%. [ Gross margin   in the quarter was [ 59.6%   compared with our plan of 58%. The increase was tied to favorable product mix in the quarter versus planned. 
For context, Q2 2020 gross margin was approximately   56.2%  . In April                , we noted that this level of gross margin would continue in the near term, driven by the introduction of several key test systems in early 2020, which would [ take several   quarters to come down the cost curve. These new product introductions, coupled with heightened costs driven by COVID shortages, were impacting our gross margins in 2020. One year later, we have now most of these test solutions at volume, and they have come down the cost curve as expected. 
The result contributed to higher margins in the second quarter, which we expect will continue in the second half of the year. A component of gross margin improvement over 2020 is higher revenue yielding of leverage in the gross margin line. We had one 10% customer in the quarter                 excluding discrete items of [ 14.5% ]on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis. 
Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. [ Semi Test   revenue of $834 million was up 27% from Q2 2020. SOC revenue was $742 million, up 29%, driven by strength in compute, mobility, industrial and automotive. Memory revenue was $92 million, up 9% from prior year, driven by strength in flash test and flash wafer sort segments. 
System Test group had revenue of $105 million, which was up 46% year-over-year. This is driven by $58 million in Storage Test sales, including both HDD and SLT solutions; [ $27 million   in Defense & Aerospace and Production Board Test. 
In Storage Test, HDD and SLT demand remains robust as drive densities continue to increase and the number of devices adopting [ SLT spokes  . At LitePoint, revenue of $55 million was 12% -- was up 12% from prior year due to continued strength at [ WiFi ], increases in                 and ultra-wide band test market segments. 
Now to Industrial Automation. As we did in April, I'll provide revenue metrics comparing Q2 '21 results with both Q2 '20 and Q2 '19, so you'll have the full context given the impact of a contracting market tied to COVID last year. Industrial Automation revenue of $92 million was up 57% year-over-year and 23% over Q2 '19. Revenue expanded in all regions in Q2 [ over   last year, with North America delivering the highest absolute revenue growth. U.S. and Europe represented about 77% of IA revenue in the quarter, with China contributing about 14%. 
UR sales were $76 million in Q2, up 75% year-over-year and [ 80%   over 2019. MiR sales were $16 million, up 41% from Q2 '20 and 51% from Q2 '19. Recall, MiR had an                 on Q2 '20 as its robots were widely deployed in automated COVID disinfectant applications. 
The longer-term outlook in our IA business continues to brighten. We expect continued labor shortages to drive new applications for both our fixed and mobile robots. Mark highlighted the shortage of welders and how that has opened up a new market for our UR cobots, but that is just one of many job categories with acute short-term and long-term labor shortages. 
Our strategy is to provide an open platform that creative developers can leverage to solve industry-specific labor shortages. The numerous filling ultraviolet disinfecting solutions built on our [ platform   last year is a shining example of the agility of our partner networks to solve problems. 
We're investing in engineering, support and marketing resources to make our MiR platforms even easier to build upon, which will enable the continued proliferation of high-value automated solutions to solve challenging problems for an expanding range of customers. Significantly, these development partners and customers provide great feedback on our R&D development plans. 
From a financial perspective, we expect IA will operate around the low end of our target profit range of 5% and 15%. We do expect IA to operate above the Rule of 40 in 2021, that is the sum of operating profit and revenue growth of over [ 40%  . Longer term, when growth moderates, we expect the IA group to have a similar operating profit rate as our Test portfolio. 
Shifting to supply. We continue to manage through numerous supply constraints along with increased material, manufacturing and logistics costs in both our Test and IA businesses. For some products in both Test and IA, the supply constraints have extended our [ lead times  , and we're working closely with customers to minimize the impact of these delays. 
But we've been able to offset these higher costs through operating leverage with higher volumes and other cost-saving measures, so the cost increase impact on the P&L has not been material. We do expect to be dealing with supply line-related issues in Q3 and Q4 this year, which are reflected in our forecasts. 
Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.42 billion, $172 million of free cash flow in the quarter, $151 million and $17 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.6 million shares for $197 million at an average [ price   of $125.69 per share.
Regarding our convertible debt. $15.6 million was paid in Q2 to convertible bondholders ahead of maturity. By the end of August 2021, bondholders will have already converted a total of $302 million, leaving a face value of $58 million outstanding. 
Looking at our operating model, I'd like to make 3 quick points. First, our performance over time. From 10 years ago, our gross margin percent has expanded from the low to [ mid-50s   to nearly 60% [ today   and our operating margin from the teens to low 20s to greater than 30% today. 
Second, our flexible business model shifts fixed cost to variable costs where appropriate through [ contract   or outsourced manufacturing, variable compensation and other [ means  , which enables resiliency on the downside and is creative (sic) [ accretive ] when business is strong. 
Third, the operating leverage in the model is evident in our Q2 results. Our Test businesses are dropping through over $0.50 per revenue dollar through to the profit line in 2021..."

Third, the operating leverage in the model is evident in our Q2 results. Our Test businesses are dropping through over $0.50 per revenue dollar through to the profit line in 2021, even while we continue to increase our R&D support -- and support investments to strengthen our Test business. This enables Teradyne to continue to invest in both our Test and IA portfolios. For IA, we are building a deeper product ecosystem and distribution differentiation while achieving the Rule of 40 in our IA portfolio. 
Now to our outlook for Q3. As Mark noted, the demand environment across the business remains strong. Our guidance assumes no significant changes, positive or negative, in the availability of materials and also assumes that we won't see additional pandemic-related issues. With that said, sales in Q3 are expected to be between $880 million and $960 million with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.29 to $1.55 and 176 million diluted shares. 
Third quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and noncash imputed interest on convertible debt. Third quarter gross margins are estimated to be between 59% and 60%. OpEx is expected to run at 27% to 29% of third quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 32%. 
Regarding OpEx for the full year. While we spent a bit lower than planned in Q2, we expect the full year OpEx will be about in line with the plan we described in April. We expect total operating expenses for 2021 to be about $1 billion or up approximately 19% from 2020. We recognize that we're on track to meet our 2024 earnings model this year. We'll update the model on a regular cadence in January after our detailed midterm plan income is complete in Q4 this year. 
In summary, our businesses are performing extremely well, delivering strong revenue and earnings growth while funding the investments that will drive future success. Our first half sales grew 21%, and non-GAAP EPS grew 29% above the first half of 2020, which itself was a record. We expect to deliver the highest Q3 sales and profits in history. 
Our employees and production partners around the world have delivered a record number of systems under challenging conditions. Our support teams have done whatever was needed to make our customers successful. And our engineering teams have kept the new product pipeline moving on schedule. It's been an impressive display of teamwork, and I'm proud to be part of this powerful Teradyne team. 
With that, I'll turn things back to Andrew."

So I think the complexity trends looking even into the next year are all very strong and positive. In the case of mobility, the newer lithographies that are coming online are being widely adopted by the manufacturers of silicon for phones, which portends more transistors, which portends more test time. So that, looking into next year, all looks positive. And we get, at this point in the year, early glimpses of what the silicon for next year might actually look like. 
The -- on the compute side, similarly, we not only have the trend of lower lithography nodes, but the new interface standards related to LPDDR5 and DDR5, as I mentioned in my remarks, the early adoption of that has been pushed out a little bit as the processors that go with it have been delayed a bit. But all of the complexity required to run at those higher bandwidths is coming in 2022. So those are 2 positive things I look at that gives me confidence that this driver of complexity growth is definitely going to be strong next year. 
In terms of share, what we said before is that penetrating the traditional x86 GPU stalwarts is going to be a long-term endeavor for us that's going to hinge on some kind of technological discontinuity like that shift to DDR5 or like a shift to PAM4 interfaces to crack into. So that one is episodic and will play out over, let's say, 3 to 5 years. 
On the other front is -- are the emerging hyperscalers and new people coming into the market of creating complex silicon. These are automobile manufacturers, hyperscalers that we've talked about in the past, the Googles, the Facebooks, the Microsofts, the Amazons, that's where we're focused on getting a position to grow with them as they launch their products into the market in the shorter term."

And the environment is tighter, I would say, today. And frankly, we don't see it letting up until the second half of 2022. 
So I think as the semiconductor industry goes through continued growth, you're seeing supply chains really getting tested.

And the test times comparatively between those 2 are not that different. It's kind of proportional to test count. 
The new ARM processors that are coming to market for compute applications, not smartphone applications, have perhaps anywhere from a 25% to 60% at or, on transistor count, above what's at the highest end of smartphones. And the test time associated with them, I would say, is proportionately longer at this point. And so I think it's, generally speaking, scaling with transistor count, and the transistor count on the ARM side is running a little bit at a faster clip than it is on the more traditional architecture side, if that helps."

So for example, we're going to be up about 30% from revenue in 2019, 40% up from 2020. And in the script, I mentioned this application for welding, which is a brand-new application that is now driving about 6% of our sales for the year. Last quarter, I talked about this service application for servicing high-voltage power lines that's also running at around that 6% of sales applications that was nonexistent -- essentially nonexistent 2 years ago. 
So already, we have 12% of our growth attributed to new applications in new markets with new customers that we didn't have 2 years ago. So it's a combination of expanding applications like those 2 examples as well as established markets growing that's driving this. And our top 3 applications tend to be the same. It's automotive supply chain, it's industrial machine tending and it's electronic assembly tend to be the ones that are at the top of the pack. But frankly, they are shrinking as a percentage of sales as these new applications come online. 
So what gives me confidence looking forward is that ecosystem of partners who are developing these application solutions on our platform, not our competitors, is just continuing to grow and prosper. And they're not all going to be as successful as high-voltage line tending or welding. But it only takes 10% of them to fuel the kind of growth numbers that we've been seeing. And the activity there is very strong, and the technology is maturing to the point that more and more applications can economically be served. 
And over the horizon, when you look at what AI can bring, there's a whole new set of, let's say, features that will enable yet another expansion of the market. It's what gives us the confidence to talk about these kind of decade-long growth rates of 25%, 30%, 35%."

And fundamentally, I think in the last call, there was commentary around the auto industry, for years, has lived on a just-in-time manufacturing. And fundamentally, in back half of 2019, sales weren't so high. And coming into '20, obviously, demand has really picked up. And so you're seeing just a significant replenishment of inventory back into the system. And we're seeing that continue. We see, obviously, the lead times. And currently, the demand is outstripping our supply. And we see that good visibility until the end of 2021. 
2022 will be interesting because we'll have to take a look at what are the inventory levels and what is the market demand in 2022 in first half. And so it's a little bit opaque, I'd say, in 2022, but it will depend on what I believe to be the inventory level and, obviously, the end market demand.
And from a storage perspective, a little bit of color around 2020 and 2021. If I go back to 2020, HDD and our SLT business was kind of split relatively even. One was a little bigger than the other. And from an HDD perspective, we've seen continued end-market demand fueling that business. But when we look into 2021 from an SLT perspective, we're seeing a broadening of devices being adopted for SLT testing, which is providing a tailwind, which is enabling a larger growth in that segment of the storage business this year relative to the HDD business.
So the HDD business is still very strong; end-market demand, very strong. But the broadening of the SLT -- or sorry, the ASICs being tested under SLT is increasing, which is really good news. So it's growing a little faster than the HDD shipments from a storage perspective."

So you've sort of given us all the different pieces. You guided wireless for the year, you guided systems for the year and you gave us the pieces on the Test businesses.
So if I just look at what that implies for SOC in Q4, I mean you're going to do about $575 million roughly for SOC in Q3. That's not a big mystery. But the Q4 number implies it goes down to like $425 million, somewhere in the low 4s. That will be down year-over-year. So I guess my first question is like why would that be given that you have all this visibility? And obviously, you're quite bullish about the market. So why would Q4 be down so much? That's my first question in SOC."

It's a portfolio of businesses, and all of those numbers have a margin of plus or minus, let's say, 1% around them. So that creates a large Monte Carlo simulation. And if you go right down the middle, I think you probably -- I'm sure you did the math right, that's probably what you come up with. 
But that's typical, as I said earlier, of where we stand at this point in the year looking into Q4 as in past years where it's come in higher. There's a significant unknown around what we'll book between now and through October that can drive Q4 shipments. And while we have backlog that extends in some product lines, as Sanjay mentioned, all the way through the end of the year, there's others that's more of a turns business. 
And we've positioned ourselves to be very responsive on the SOC front, in general, to capitalize on these sort of short demand request to come from our customers. That's why we've in the past been enabled to, in the quarter, exceed our guidance and even in the fourth quarter and prior years exceed what we thought when we were talking back then in July. 
So it could very well turn out that the demand that we've seen in the last couple of years in Q4 yet materializes again and we end up, as C.J. was hinting at, having a second half larger than first. It's just that at this point in the year, given what customers are talking about, we just don't see that as the most likely outcome. 
And it's episodic, too. What happens in Q4, a lot of it happens, in the past couple of years, in the December quarter, preparing for product launches that occur in February time frame, new phones and things like that. And so -- and again, with a rash of phone introductions in February, although we don't see it now, we could see a demand for SOC testers to support that driving December shipments."

Today, I'll summarize our results for the second quarter and first half of 2021, update on current conditions in both Test and Industrial Automation, and comment on our view for the second half of the yea",1346,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll summarize our results for the second quarter and first half of 2021, update on current conditions in both Test and Industrial Automation, and comment on our view for the second half of the year. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on the quarter and our guidance for Q3. 
The strong demand we saw in Q1 accelerated in Q2 as both our Test and Industrial Automation groups grew substantially in the quarter. The long-term demand drivers we've discussed in the past continue to power demand for our products. In Test, it's device complexity and unit growth; in Automation, it's labor scarcity, the need for resiliency and productivity improvement. 
Opening further, performance at the company level from 2016 through 2020 saw our sales and non-GAAP EPS grow at a compounded rate of 16% and 32%, respectively. For the first half of this year, sales are running ahead of that rate at 21%, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew at 29% compared with last year. This demonstrates both the [ vitality ] of the markets we serve and the efficiency of our operating model. 
Significantly, in Q2, we saw Industrial Automation demand recover in all major regions, but particularly in North America. As a result, our production and [ operating teams ] operated at a high pace in Q2, and that pace is [ increasing ] in Q3. For the year, our IA business is on track to grow about 30% from 2019 and about 40% from 2020. 
Looking closely at the segment level. In Semi Test, SOC shipments grew 29% in Q2 from Q2 of 2020 with particular strength in both the compute and mobility end markets. For the first half, SOC sales grew 19%. For the first time in several years, smartphone unit shipments are helping growth in the mobility [ segment ], where as recent years have mostly relied on complexity growth. 
[ IA ] and compute are the 2 largest subsegments in SOC. Automotive, analog and industrial demand continues to be strong. The auto-related semi test market is expected to exceed $500 million this year, the highest level since 2017. This is despite the fact that automobile unit production will be about [indiscernible] lower in 2017 -- lower than 2017. A portion of this strength is test equipment. We're also seeing the impact of increased semi content and complexity per automobile, driving the test market. 
Our memory test shipments also grew in Q2 from Q2 of 2020, up 9%, led by flash tester demand. For the 6-month period, overall shipments were up 18% from last year on solid demand for both flash wafer and [ flash ] systems. This reflects significant growth in smartphone demand, the build-out of new memory capacity in China and the growth of SSD demand.
Looking at the full year, we are again revising up the SOC market for 2021 to now be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion with increasing strength in the x86 GPU and display driver segments. Recall that we have lower customer exposure in those markets with much of this incremental growth going to our competitors. So we'll likely see our SOC share around 48% for the year. 
In memory, at the macro level, our market estimates are unchanged with the test market this year expected to be about $1 billion and our share to be at about the 40% level. I will note that the expected ramp of DDR5 for server applications and the broader adoption of LPDDR5 is pushing out into 2022. 
Shifting to our System Test group, sales were up 26% in the first half compared with 2020, with strong Storage Test demand and a recovery in our Production Board Test unit driving the growth. For the full year, we see System Test group -- the System Test group grow in the 10% to 20% range. 
At LitePoint, sales in Q2 were up 12% over 2Q 2020. While 5G millimeter wave demand is lower than expected, the environment in Wireless Test is improving as we move through the year due to the continued WiFi 6 growth and early WiFi 7 investments. In addition, ultra-wideband adoption is increasing, adding a new growth vector for LitePoint. For the full year, LitePoint will likely grow in the 10% range. 
Moving on to Industrial Automation. The combination of expanding demand across our major markets and the increase in the range of tests served by our Universal Robots and MiR units drove group sales up 57% in Q2 last year [ to 45% ] in the first half. Compared to pre-pandemic 2019, first half sales are up 22%. Supply chain issues have constrained growth a little bit with lead times pushing out about 1 week. 
The demand environment for IA has recovered in most regions from last year's slowdown. America was the fastest-growing major region in Q2 with sales up over 90% from last year. Although we did see a [indiscernible] some countries in Asia where COVID has spiked in recent months, the second half of the year outlook is quite strong in all our major regions. 
Our long-term growth strategy in IA continues unchanged, and we expect long-term annual growth in the 20% to 35% range. This year, we will likely have a growth of about 40% from 2020, and we will continue to invest to enable this growth target of [ 15% ] gross margins, [ get ] a 5% to 15% operating margin during these high-growth years.
From an investment perspective, we are expanding our engineering programs to shorten deployment times, increase the served market and improve the customer support experience. We are also growing our capacity to support distributors, integrators and UR plus and MiRGo apps development partners as [ they ] engage customers. We are also expanding our sales to OEMs that integrate our robots into their products. 
Last quarter, we noted the expanding range of applications for UR robots into the high-voltage line application with hundreds of [indiscernible] being deployed. Today, I'd like to highlight the success of UR+ plug-and-play applications for Industrial [ Automation ].There is a long-standing and chronic shortage of qualified welders worldwide with an estimated 100,000 unfilled welding jobs in the U.S. alone. While automated solutions exist for large applications like auto manufacturing, customers with lower volume and higher mix products are not well served by traditional automation. 
The integration of a force torque sensor into e-Series cobots enabled the precision needed for this application. And with UR+ [ integrating ] with our partners, we began serving this market about 3 years ago. During this time, welding applications have grown to be about 6% of our global [ sales ]and are on  [indiscernible] 1,000 cobots sold in 2021, more than tripling our 2020 pace. 
As we continue to extend the performance of our UR platform, we expect these high applications had growth vectors to traditional industrial applications. We have similar market-expanding initiatives in play on our MiR platform, but I'll save those details for a future call. 
Summing it all up, the first half of the year has been a strong sales, strong gross margins and earnings growth  [indiscernible]. Longer term, the markets we serve are showing [ increasing demand ] in a future global economy. The importance, pervasiveness and enabling capability of electronics in every [ aspect ] of our lives and industry is driving more fab investment, more complexity and more test. Likewise, the broadening application and fast [ ROI of ] [ collaborative ] robots in a world with labor shortages and productivity challenges is another growth trend. 
Strategically, we positioned ourselves in line with  [indiscernible]  and plan to continue to make [ System ] Test and IA as our full potential while driving world-class [ returns ]. While the rate of change in our markets is accelerating, we are well positioned to thrive as a company and to bring additional value to customers and shareholders. 
I'll now turn things over to Sanjay [ to provide ] additional color on the financials."

Today, I'll [ provide details ] on our Q2 results, comment on current business conditions and describe [ our outlook for ] Q3. Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $1.086 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $1.91, up 29",1146,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll [ provide details ] on our Q2 results, comment on current business conditions and describe [ our outlook for ] Q3. 
Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $1.086 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $1.91, up 29% and 44%, respectively, from Q2 '20. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.6%, and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $250 million, but $5 million below the high guidance due to the timing of some nonrecurring engineering expenses.
Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 36.5%. [ Gross margin ] in the quarter was [ 59.6% ] compared with our plan of 58%. The increase was tied to favorable product mix in the quarter versus planned. 
For context, Q2 2020 gross margin was approximately [ 56.2% ]. In April [indiscernible], we noted that this level of gross margin would continue in the near term, driven by the introduction of several key test systems in early 2020, which would [ take several ] quarters to come down the cost curve. These new product introductions, coupled with heightened costs driven by COVID shortages, were impacting our gross margins in 2020. One year later, we have now most of these test solutions at volume, and they have come down the cost curve as expected. 
The result contributed to higher margins in the second quarter, which we expect will continue in the second half of the year. A component of gross margin improvement over 2020 is higher revenue yielding of leverage in the gross margin line. We had one 10% customer in the quarter [indiscernible] excluding discrete items of [ 14.5% ]on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis. 
Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. [ Semi Test ] revenue of $834 million was up 27% from Q2 2020. SOC revenue was $742 million, up 29%, driven by strength in compute, mobility, industrial and automotive. Memory revenue was $92 million, up 9% from prior year, driven by strength in flash test and flash wafer sort segments. 
System Test group had revenue of $105 million, which was up 46% year-over-year. This is driven by $58 million in Storage Test sales, including both HDD and SLT solutions; [ $27 million ] in Defense & Aerospace and Production Board Test. 
In Storage Test, HDD and SLT demand remains robust as drive densities continue to increase and the number of devices adopting [ SLT spokes ]. At LitePoint, revenue of $55 million was 12% -- was up 12% from prior year due to continued strength at [ WiFi ], increases in [indiscernible] and ultra-wide band test market segments. 
Now to Industrial Automation. As we did in April, I'll provide revenue metrics comparing Q2 '21 results with both Q2 '20 and Q2 '19, so you'll have the full context given the impact of a contracting market tied to COVID last year. Industrial Automation revenue of $92 million was up 57% year-over-year and 23% over Q2 '19. Revenue expanded in all regions in Q2 [ over ] last year, with North America delivering the highest absolute revenue growth. U.S. and Europe represented about 77% of IA revenue in the quarter, with China contributing about 14%. 
UR sales were $76 million in Q2, up 75% year-over-year and [ 80% ] over 2019. MiR sales were $16 million, up 41% from Q2 '20 and 51% from Q2 '19. Recall, MiR had an  [indiscernible]  on Q2 '20 as its robots were widely deployed in automated COVID disinfectant applications.
The longer-term outlook in our IA business continues to brighten. We expect continued labor shortages to drive new applications for both our fixed and mobile robots. Mark highlighted the shortage of welders and how that has opened up a new market for our UR cobots, but that is just one of many job categories with acute short-term and long-term labor shortages. 
Our strategy is to provide an open platform that creative developers can leverage to solve industry-specific labor shortages. The numerous filling ultraviolet disinfecting solutions built on our [ platform ] last year is a shining example of the agility of our partner networks to solve problems. 
We're investing in engineering, support and marketing resources to make our MiR platforms even easier to build upon, which will enable the continued proliferation of high-value automated solutions to solve challenging problems for an expanding range of customers. Significantly, these development partners and customers provide great feedback on our R&D development plans. 
From a financial perspective, we expect IA will operate around the low end of our target profit range of 5% and 15%. We do expect IA to operate above the Rule of 40 in 2021, that is the sum of operating profit and revenue growth of over [ 40% ]. Longer term, when growth moderates, we expect the IA group to have a similar operating profit rate as our Test portfolio. 
Shifting to supply. We continue to manage through numerous supply constraints along with increased material, manufacturing and logistics costs in both our Test and IA businesses. For some products in both Test and IA, the supply constraints have extended our [ lead times ], and we're working closely with customers to minimize the impact of these delays. 
But we've been able to offset these higher costs through operating leverage with higher volumes and other cost-saving measures, so the cost increase impact on the P&L has not been material. We do expect to be dealing with supply line-related issues in Q3 and Q4 this year, which are reflected in our forecasts. 
Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.42 billion, $172 million of free cash flow in the quarter, $151 million and $17 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.6 million shares for $197 million at an average [ price ] of $125.69 per share.
Regarding our convertible debt. $15.6 million was paid in Q2 to convertible bondholders ahead of maturity. By the end of August 2021, bondholders will have already converted a total of $302 million, leaving a face value of $58 million outstanding. 
Looking at our operating model, I'd like to make 3 quick points. First, our performance over time. From 10 years ago, our gross margin percent has expanded from the low to [ mid-50s ] to nearly 60% [ today ] and our operating margin from the teens to low 20s to greater than 30% today. 
Second, our flexible business model shifts fixed cost to variable costs where appropriate through [ contract ] or outsourced manufacturing, variable compensation and other [ means ], which enables resiliency on the downside and is creative (sic) [ accretive ] when business is strong. 
Third, the operating leverage in the model is evident in our Q2 results. Our Test businesses are dropping through over $0.50 per revenue dollar through to the profit line in 2021..."

Second, our flexible business model shifts fixed cost to variable costs, where appropriate, through contract or outsourced manufacturing, variable compensation and other means, which enables resiliency on the downside and is accretive when business is strong. 
Third, the operating leverage in the model is evident in our Q2 results. Our Test businesses are dropping through over $0.50 per revenue dollar through to the profit line in 2021, even while we continue to increase our R&D support -- and support investments to strengthen our Test business. This enables Teradyne to continue to invest in both our Test and IA portfolios. For IA, we are building a deeper product ecosystem and distribution differentiation while achieving the Rule of 40 in our IA portfolio. 
Now to our outlook for Q3. As Mark noted, the demand environment across the business remains strong. Our guidance assumes no significant changes, positive or negative, in the availability of materials and also assumes that we won't see additional pandemic-related issues. With that said, sales in Q3 are expected to be between $880 million and $960 million with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.29 to $1.55 and 176 million diluted shares. 
Third quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and noncash imputed interest on convertible debt. Third quarter gross margins are estimated to be between 59% and 60%. OpEx is expected to run at 27% to 29% of third quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 32%. 
Regarding OpEx for the full year. While we spent a bit lower than planned in Q2, we expect the full year OpEx will be about in line with the plan we described in April. We expect total operating expenses for 2021 to be about $1 billion or up approximately 19% from 2020. We recognize that we're on track to meet our 2024 earnings model this year. We'll update the model on a regular cadence in January after our detailed midterm plan income is complete in Q4 this year. 
In summary, our businesses are performing extremely well, delivering strong revenue and earnings growth while funding the investments that will drive future success. Our first half sales grew 21%, and non-GAAP EPS grew 29% above the first half of 2020, which itself was a record. We expect to deliver the highest Q3 sales and profits in history. 
Our employees and production partners around the world have delivered a record number of systems under challenging conditions. Our support teams have done whatever was needed to make our customers successful. And our engineering teams have kept the new product pipeline moving on schedule. It's been an impressive display of teamwork, and I'm proud to be part of this powerful Teradyne team. 
With that, I'll turn things back to Andrew."

So I think the complexity trends looking even into the next year are all very strong and positive. In the case of mobility, the newer lithographies that are coming online are being widely adopted by the manufacturers of silicon for phones, which portends more transistors, which portends more test time. So that, looking into next year, all looks positive. And we get, at this point in the year, early glimpses of what the silicon for next year might actually look like. 
The -- on the compute side, similarly, we not only have the trend of lower lithography nodes, but the new interface standards related to LPDDR5 and DDR5, as I mentioned in my remarks, the early adoption of that has been pushed out a little bit as the processors that go with it have been delayed a bit. But all of the complexity required to run at those higher bandwidths is coming in 2022. So those are 2 positive things I look at that gives me confidence that this driver of complexity growth is definitely going to be strong next year. 
In terms of share, what we said before is that penetrating the traditional x86 GPU stalwarts is going to be a long-term endeavor for us that's going to hinge on some kind of technological discontinuity like that shift to DDR5 or like a shift to PAM4 interfaces to crack into. So that one is episodic and will play out over, let's say, 3 to 5 years. 
On the other front is -- are the emerging hyperscalers and new people coming into the market of creating complex silicon. These are automobile manufacturers, hyperscalers that we've talked about in the past, the Googles, the Facebooks, the Microsofts, the Amazons, that's where we're focused on getting a position to grow with them as they launch their products into the market in the shorter term."

And the test times comparatively between those 2 are not that different. It's kind of proportional to test count. 
The new ARM processors that are coming to market for compute applications, not smartphone applications, have perhaps anywhere from a 25% to 60% at or, on transistor count, above what's at the highest end of smartphones. And the test time associated with them, I would say, is proportionately longer at this point. And so I think it's, generally speaking, scaling with transistor count, and the transistor count on the ARM side is running a little bit at a faster clip than it is on the more traditional architecture side, if that helps."

And in the script, I mentioned this application for welding, which is a brand-new application that is now driving about 6% of our sales for the year. Last quarter, I talked about this service application for servicing high-voltage power lines that's also running at around that 6% of sales applications that was nonexistent -- essentially nonexistent 2 years ago. 
So already, we have 12% of our growth attributed to new applications in new markets with new customers that we didn't have 2 years ago. So it's a combination of expanding applications like those 2 examples as well as established markets growing that's driving this. And our top 3 applications tend to be the same. It's automotive supply chain, it's industrial machine tending and it's electronic assembly tend to be the ones that are at the top of the pack. But frankly, they are shrinking as a percentage of sales as these new applications come online. 
So what gives me confidence looking forward is that ecosystem of partners who are developing these application solutions on our platform, not our competitors, is just continuing to grow and prosper. And they're not all going to be as successful as high-voltage line tending or welding. But it only takes 10% of them to fuel the kind of growth numbers that we've been seeing. And the activity there is very strong, and the technology is maturing to the point that more and more applications can economically be served. 
And over the horizon, when you look at what AI can bring, there's a whole new set of, let's say, features that will enable yet another expansion of the market. It's what gives us the confidence to talk about these kind of decade-long growth rates of 25%, 30%, 35%."

So despite all that, the share position for Teradyne, we think, is unchanged from our earlier estimates at around 40% of the market, and it's going to be a tailwind next year when the DDR5  and LPDDR5 ramp as was originally thought would happen toward the end of this year.

But it's hard to sort of prognosticate too much about where the share comes from. And as you know, one customer's buying capacity can swing multiple points of share in any given year. And so one of our customers could come in and drive a demand that we don't see right now. We have the manufacturing capacity to serve it. And yes, I guess we could be up at 50% share if that happened. It's just a little opaque at the moment."

So from an auto market perspective, it's true this year, we've seen tremendous growth and just about $500 million or plus or minus a bit from a market size, and yes, as far as we've seen even back to 2017. And fundamentally, I think in the last call, there was commentary around the auto industry, for years, has lived on a just-in-time manufacturing. And fundamentally, in back half of 2019, sales weren't so high. And coming into '20, obviously, demand has really picked up. And so you're seeing just a significant replenishment of inventory back into the system. And we're seeing that continue. We see, obviously, the lead times. And currently, the demand is outstripping our supply. And we see that good visibility until the end of 2021. 
2022 will be interesting because we'll have to take a look at what are the inventory levels and what is the market demand in 2022 in first half. And so it's a little bit opaque, I'd say, in 2022, but it will depend on what I believe to be the inventory level and, obviously, the end market demand.
And from a storage perspective, a little bit of color around 2020 and 2021. If I go back to 2020, HDD and our SLT business was kind of split relatively even. One was a little bigger than the other. And from an HDD perspective, we've seen continued end-market demand fueling that business. But when we look into 2021 from an SLT perspective, we're seeing a broadening of devices being adopted for SLT testing, which is providing a tailwind, which is enabling a larger growth in that segment of the storage business this year relative to the HDD business.
So the HDD business is still very strong; end-market demand, very strong. But the broadening of the SLT -- or sorry, the ASICs being tested under SLT is increasing, which is really good news. So it's growing a little faster than the HDD shipments from a storage perspective."

So you've sort of given us all the different pieces. You guided wireless for the year, you guided systems for the year and you gave us the pieces on the Test businesses.
So if I just look at what that implies for SOC in Q4, I mean you're going to do about $575 million roughly for SOC in Q3. That's not a big mystery. But the Q4 number implies it goes down to like $425 million, somewhere in the low 4s. That will be down year-over-year. So I guess my first question is like why would that be given that you have all this visibility? And obviously, you're quite bullish about the market. So why would Q4 be down so much?

And if you go right down the middle, I think you probably -- I'm sure you did the math right, that's probably what you come up with. 
But that's typical, as I said earlier, of where we stand at this point in the year looking into Q4 as in past years where it's come in higher. There's a significant unknown around what we'll book between now and through October that can drive Q4 shipments. And while we have backlog that extends in some product lines, as Sanjay mentioned, all the way through the end of the year, there's others that's more of a turns business. 
And we've positioned ourselves to be very responsive on the SOC front, in general, to capitalize on these sort of short demand request to come from our customers. That's why we've in the past been enabled to, in the quarter, exceed our guidance and even in the fourth quarter and prior years exceed what we thought when we were talking back then in July. 
So it could very well turn out that the demand that we've seen in the last couple of years in Q4 yet materializes again and we end up, as C.J. was hinting at, having a second half larger than first. It's just that at this point in the year, given what customers are talking about, we just don't see that as the most likely outcome. 
And it's episodic, too. What happens in Q4, a lot of it happens, in the past couple of years, in the December quarter, preparing for product launches that occur in February time frame, new phones and things like that. And so -- and again, with a rash of phone introductions in February, although we don't see it now, we could see a demand for SOC testers to support that driving December shipments."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll cover 4 topics: the highlights of our third quarter and the first 9 months of the year, the changes we're observing in the SOC test market, our outlook for the industrial automation market and how we're thinking about the test and automation markets as we close out this year and look into 2022 and beyond. 
As our Q3 results demonstrate, demand remains strong across all of our businesses. At the company level, Q3 sales grew 16% from last year's record Q3 and non-GAAP EPS grew 35%. We did experience increased supply chain bottlenecks in our Industrial Automation business in the quarter and under ship demand. Sanjay will describe this in more detail, but we expect these constraints to persist into Q4. Despite this, for the first 9 months of 2021, company-wide sales grew 19% and non-GAAP EPS grew 31% from the year ago level. 
In each of our businesses, we are writing long-term secular trends that we expect will drive revenue and earnings growth for years to come. In our test businesses, the unit growth and complexity drivers that power these markets continue unabated. For example, our semiconductor test business grew 18% through Q3, while -- with SOC leading the charge growing 22%. Sales continue to be dominated by our UltraFLEX product line, which is well aligned to the performance requirements of the growing compute and mobility markets. 
Additionally, sales of our Eagle Test systems more than doubled in the 9-month period as automotive and industrial test markets have also rapidly expanded. Eagle's unique architecture hits the sweet spot of these markets by balancing high precision with the stress testing needed for these demanding applications. 
Within SOC, there's been a clear shift this year to higher demand from the compute, automotive and industrial markets. While mobility is still the largest subsegment of SOC and growing, it has dropped from the high 50% range of the SOC test market in recent years to the high 40% range this year. Over the midterm, we expect mobility will remain the largest SOC submarket and continue to grow but we also expect compute to grow at a faster rate, while automotive should remain at its current elevated levels. 
For the last decade or so, mobility has made rapid annual advances in semiconductor complexity that has enabled the advancement of smartphone sophistication. The refresh pace has been much faster than traditional PCs, graphics, automotive and industrial end markets, leading to smartphone ICs rapidly progressing along the complexity scale. This is true in many areas of smartphone silicon, apps processor compute engines, graphics engines, AI engines, image sensors, power management and more. Our leading position in testing these key technologies has driven our growth. 
At the same time, up until recently, the traditional compute testing market has been relatively flat with slower refresh rates and slower complexity growth. However, the groundwork laid by mobility designs combined with advancing lithography nodes and design tools has enabled new entrants into the chip design space for compute engines. The complexity of these chips whether for laptops, servers, autonomous driving, AI or graphics is incredible and advancing at an accelerated rate. For example, laptop CPUs are now crossing the 30 billion transistor level, which is a huge leap over previous legacy designs. 
As we've said in the past, increased transistor counts drives increased test time and increased tester demand. We've seen that this year and there's more to come. We're targeting this expanding collection of new players and new designs, leaning heavily into our UltraFLEX family's hardware performance and time-to-market advantages of our software. We've been adding new design wins every quarter. And while development pipelines can be long and these new designs can be speculative, we're confident we'll see growing production business from these wins in the future. It's also notable that the traditional chip suppliers in these markets aren't standing still, they are doubling down on their advanced designs too, which is collectively driving WFE investments higher as applications expand and competition heats up. 
We expect this rate to lead to higher test TAMs and given the higher performance and faster design to market cycle times, more share gain opportunities for Teradyne over the midterm. Our System Test segment last year -- sorry, our System Test segment year-to-date sales grew 11% from 2020 and Storage Test continued its multiyear growth trajectory, expanding sales 12% in the same period. Higher capacity HDDs and more complex SOC devices, which require system-level test are driving this demand. 
Both trends are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. At LitePoint, sales were up 24% through 9 months compared with 2020, driven by WiFi 6 production WiFi 7 R&D demand as well as ultra wideband. More connected devices demanding more bandwidth while managing growing congestion drives complexity increases in each new WiFi standard and more tests. UWB, on the other hand, is a whole new wireless standard and application space. It's a new proximity detection wireless technology with the future of many promising security applications. We expect these trends to continue and to provide a long-term tailwind to our wireless test business. 
Shifting to Industrial Automation. Universal Robots revenue grew 50% through the first 9 months of the year, while MiR grew 40% despite supply chain challenges. Each has a unique story. At UR, it's a combination of increasing sales for existing tasks and the expanding number of UR+ offerings, making it easier for customers to deploy our cobots to do new applications. We highlighted welding in our last call, but other examples include screwdriving and palletizing. The UR+ ecosystem is key to expanding these tasks and now totals over 360 products created by over 300 partners, both riding on and broadening the [indiscernible] of our UR platform. This is a key advantage in the combination of our organic investments and our UR+ and OEM partners R&D dollars and creativity that's going into expanding the UR platform and it's unmatched. 
At MiR, the story is about new products. The MiR250 which was introduced just as COVID hit last March of last year, is now our largest seller by far. This year, we added the MiR Hook to the 250 family to expand its applications into tugging. We've introduced higher payload products such as the MiR 600 and 1350 to expand our footprint in the fast-growing logistics market. 
Unfortunately, with all this good news come supply chain issues that will limit IA growth in 2021 to be between 30% to 40% year-on-year, but demand is strong. The long-term outlook in IA remains very bright. Looking at the capabilities of UR cobots today, we estimate the penetration rate is less than 2% of the servable market. UR's approximate 45% market share puts us clearly in the lead, and we continue to drive R&D and distribution investments to extend our competitive advantages, expand the servable market and drive penetration higher. 
It's a similar story at MiR, where we estimate the autonomous mobile robot penetration is under 3%. The AMR market doesn't have a single dominant player like UR cobots, and we estimate we're close to #2 in the broadly defined market. And like at UR, we're making investments in both the distribution and product level to both reinforce our advantages and extend our product reach. 
In both IA businesses, the fact that our penetration of today's servable market is low single digits and that the servable market continues to expand each year with product enhancements, sets up a fantastic future. So even with very high growth rates in our IA business, we expect the penetration rates to remain low for many years, sustaining our long-term annual growth forecast of 20% to 35%. In January, we will update you on the outlook for 2022 and our midterm earnings model. Between now and then, we'll be looking at the rate and timing of new semiconductor fab capacity coming online, especially at the more advanced lithography nodes. And we'll also be looking at the rate of adoption of DDR5 as key swing factors. 
In IA, we will be looking at the manufacturing output expansion, on-shoring trends and PMIs in our principal geographies as tailwinds for continued robust growth. On the other hand, in both markets, supply chain bottlenecks could slow certain industries and become a headwind to growth demand. Short-term demand is influenced by many factors, but we manage our business aligned to the long-term trends. The trend of growing prevalence of increasingly complex semiconductors and a myriad of applications drives our semiconductor business and investments. The trend of new increasingly smart, cost-effective automation in a world with labor scarcity and onshoring challenges drives our IA business and investment strategy. These systemic long-term trends paid an exciting future for Teradyne. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Sanjay."
94728,1685270027,2414042,"Teradyne, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Teradyne, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. In my remarks, I'll review our Q3 financial results, discuss our supply line strategy in this challenging environment, provide Q4 guidance and comment on our full year financial outlook at the midpoint of our Q4 guidan",1461,"Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone. 
In my remarks, I'll review our Q3 financial results, discuss our supply line strategy in this challenging environment, provide Q4 guidance and comment on our full year financial outlook at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance to the financial headlines for Q3. 
Our third quarter sales were $951 million was near the high end of guidance driven by strength in Semi Test and wireless test. Gross margin in the quarter was approximately 60%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $242 million or 25.5% of revenue. The favorability in OpEx drove a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35% and and non-GAAP EPS of $1.59. 
A few more components of third quarter data. Our tax rate, excluding discrete items, was 14.8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP diluted share count was approximately $176 million. We had 2 10% customers. 
Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. Semi Test revenue of $688 million was up 16% from Q3 '20. SOC revenue was $575 million, up 28%, driven by strength in applications processors, RF, industrial and automotive applications. Automotive and industrials doubled revenue year-over-year. Memory revenue was the second highest in history at $113 million, but down 21% from Q3 of last year's record. Flash final test demand was the strongest segment on handset and SSD end market demand. System Test group had revenue of $103 million, which was down 13% year-over-year. Recall Storage is the largest business in this segment and has lumpy shipments. While Storage Test will still grow more than 15% for the year, sales, including HDD and SLT declined to $56 million on the timing of shipments in Q3. 
Defense and aerospace and production board test combined grew 10% year-on-year to $47 million. At LitePoint, revenue of $69 million was up 70% from prior year due to early success of our new WiFi 7 product, continued strength in 4G cellular and EEB. 
Now to Industrial Automation. As in July, given COVID shutdowns had impaired the UR business in 2020, I'll provide revenue metrics comparing Q3 '21 results with both Q3 '20 and Q3 '19. Industrial Automation revenue of $91 million was up 32% from both Q3 '19 and Q3 '20. North America delivered the highest revenue growth from last year, but all regions expanded year-on-year. As Mark noted, supply issues, primarily semiconductors, reduced our IA shipments in the quarter. UR sales were $78 million in Q3, up 46% year-over-year and 31% over Q3 '19. MiR sales were $13 million, up 27% from Q3 '20 and 35% from Q3 '19. IA was about breakeven in the quarter and full -- breakeven in the quarter and full year, we expect low single-digit profitability. As we've noted before, we continue our strategy of investing during this high-growth era while maintaining gross margins to enable mid-20s operating profit in the future. 
Shifting to supply. We continue to deal with numerous supply constraints across the company. While semiconductor shortages are well reported, we're also seeing delays in mechanical parts and logistics, all exacerbated by rolling COVID-related shutdowns or labor shortages. We expect these issues will continue through the first half of 2022. Despite these issues, we've been able to deliver record shipments and a big part of that performance is a result of the supply line management, operations teams and engineering teams working with our supply chain and contract manufacturing manufacturing partners. 
We view our operational business model and execution against it as a core competence. Our gross margin performance over the last 10 years displays the financial value of this model. In our test portfolio, our execution has kept most of our tester lead times within the range that meet customers' needs to expand their production capacity in this dynamic environment. The significance of this lead time performance is that customer orders more closely reflect true test demand. So while a bit counterintuitive, we feel that maintaining short lead times are a more accurate indicator of test demand with lower risk than holding orders with lead times far beyond chip manufacturing cycle times. Of course, our supply line and operations model isn't static. We began adding resiliency through both geographic and supplier diversity prior to COVID. Those efforts have accelerated over the last 20 months. 
This work is paying dividends in the current environment, and we'll continue to invest to harden our supply chain further. Our lead time performance is an example of our resilience and execution. Another example is the ability to scale to significantly increase demand. Auto and industrial sales have more than doubled year-over-year. While we're not perfectly aligned to all customer requested delivery dates, we are managing through delivery issues in a reasonable manner. The value of these efforts can also be seen in the operating leverage in our gross margin line. In IA, we've seen lead times extend from our normal 1 to 2 weeks to 4 to 6 weeks for some products. While this is a challenge, with the business growing so quickly and ongoing industry supply issues, we've already seen the positive impact of our work in material sourcing and manufacturing cycle times. 
We expect to bring lead times back to model over the next 2 to 3 quarters. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.45 billion. We had $493 million in free cash flow in the quarter, and through 9 months, we've spent $103 million on CapEx, and we expect we'll spend $148 million for the full year. We spent $210 million and $16 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.3 million shares for $406 million at an average price of $123.53. In 2021, we expect to return over 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders. And from 2015, when we began repurchasing shares, we've returned 85% of our free cash flow to owners. 
Regarding our convertible debt, $302 million of principal was paid in the first 9 months to the convertible bondholders ahead of maturity. By mid-December, bondholders will have converted approximately $343 million, leaving a face value of $117 million. 
Now to our outlook for Q4. Sales in Q4 are expected to be between $820 million and $900 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.14 to $1.40 on 174 million diluted shares. Fourth quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and noncash imputed interest on the convertible debt. Our guidance assumes no significant changes, positive or negative, in the availability of materials and assumes that we won't see additional pandemic-related issues. Fourth quarter gross margins are estimated at 59% to 60%. OpEx is expected to run at 28% to 31% of fourth quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 30%. 
Regarding OpEx for the full year. We spent a bit lower than planned in Q3, and we expect the full year OpEx will be about $980 million, up 17% from 2020. At the midpoint of our guidance, 2021 will be another year of growth in both revenue and EPS, while sales growing -- or sorry, with sales growing 18% to $3.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS growing to $5.88, up 27%. Gross margin for the full year should be approximately 59.5%, up from 57.2% in 2020, reflecting the ramp of new products, product mix and operating leverage, offsetting component and logistics cost increases. 
Our 2021 non-GAAP operating profit rate is expected to be about 33%, up from last year's 30%. Our full year tax rate is expected to be 14.8%. These results put us comfortably in the range of our 2024 earnings model this year. We'll update the model on our regular cadence in January. The breadth of our customer buying in 2021 is also broader than last year. In 2020, we had 1 customer that drove 25% of sales. In 2021, we do not expect to have any customer larger than 20% of our yearly revenue. This reflects the trend Mark noted about 2021's higher growth in compute, auto and industrial demand compared with mobility demand in SemiTest. IA growth of over 30% year-over-year continues to diversify our revenue. This growth is expected to continue over the midterm and become a larger portion of our revenue. 
In summary, we expect to end the year with another quarter of strong year-on-year revenue and EPS growth. On a full year basis, we'll exceed our midterm targets on stronger-than-expected demand on our test businesses, continued high growth in IA and excellent execution across the company. While we don't have a clear picture of 2022 yet, we're confident in the long-term industry trends powering our test and IA businesses remain firmly in place. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Andy."

I mean we look at the trends that I just -- you cited and I cited and see that there's very little standing in the way of sort of this increased growth, but the caveat I would mention is there's a lot of supply chain bottlenecks in the system. So if end products get bottlenecked, that can slow down the unit volume demand for new semiconductors. And the other thing we're looking at is when do these new nodes really come online in terms of capacity. All that $90 billion of WFE that was put in place this year hasn't yet had a single impact on test. That's all to come. But it kind of depends on when do those additional 5- and 3-nanometer fabs come online. That is kind of a big swing factor in the calendar year 2022 as to how our growth will shrunk out. And that's kind of why we wait until January because we don't get good enough visibility on that right now."

In your prepared remarks, you noted that the business is up more than 2x year-to-date. I guess historically, like many other parts of your business, I think the Eagle Test has been quite cyclical. You would be up for a year, 1.5 years, 4 to 6 quarters and then down a little bit as customers digest their test capacity. Based on what you said, it seemed like you're expecting 2022 to be another strong year. I guess the question is what's different this time as you think about Eagle Test into '22. I realize there's complexity growth, but you could argue there's been complexity growth for a very long time. So just curious how different this cycle could be relative to past cycles."

And in addition, automobile unit volume isn't near its historical peak either. So how could this thing keep going beyond the normal 6-quarter surge in automotive, which is you're right, again, that's kind of the traditional pattern. But I think what we see happening and makes us believe this will persist at least through 2022 is there's a lot of silicon refresh going on that's new in the automotive space. New -- kind of racing to get new more current generation lithography node silicon into automotive design because the legacy lines out there are hard to get at chip suppliers are trying to obsolete those fabs. And so the automotive customers don't have as much, I would say, power in this frothy demand environment on the semiconductor supply side. And so the semiconductor suppliers are kind of same, get with the program, move to more advanced nodes. And a little bit of that's happening, which is what -- that means complexity, yield issues, and that means a little more test than you might expect. And I think that's what's giving us a different view this time."

And then the advanced package itself has more potential defect failure modes that need to be tested. So that's 1 thing around the whole chiplet, multi-chip package thing. The other thing, though, that's happening, and this is really going to become prevalent at 3-nanometer and beyond is the move from FinFET to gate all around transistor architectures. 
And if you remember, when the world moved from planar to FinFET, it was back in 2012, '13, '14 era, that drove -- if you go back and look at the history of sort of the test market, that drove incremental test intensity and complexity in the market. And we're headed for another 1 of those with gate all around. There's going to be new defect modes, new kind of test intensity boosts coming from this new architecture on the transistor. So even at equivalent transistor counts, we're going to see a little bit more test intensity because of that.

In terms of fungibility, they're pretty fungible to testers across what's used for compute engine in a phone versus a compute engine in a laptop or a desktop or anything else. The one that's a little bit unique is when you get into things like the RF type products, of course, have a bit of a different architecture, power management type products have a bit of a different architecture. And so those testers tend to be a little more unique. But we've talked about in the past that -- I think people have looked at us and said, well, in a world where cell phones are kind of plateauing, doesn't that -- unit growth of cell phones doesn't that portends some kind of slowing for us. And what we've always said is that, look, cell phone unit growth can slow, complexity isn't. And some of these customers are diversifying into more silicon, both in the phone and now more silicon outside the phone into compute. There are these emerging hyperscalers that are building silicon for both cloud computing and other new yet to be introduced consumer products. So the ability of a design team today to be formed and put together a $10 billion-plus transistor chip for a consumer application is easier and easier and easier. And as I said in my script, we worked with a lot of them. Maybe a small fraction of them will be hits in the future, but they can bring entirely new classes of sector high compute engine semiconductor applications to the market.

I assume that the tester installations occurred about 3 months prior. That's kind of the best guidance I can give you there.

Is it sort of what the yield modeling suggests for kind of lower yield rates there compounded by die sizes, compounded by transistors or advanced packaging? Or is it also sort of a combination of the types of devices that you think that enables in terms of the intersection point of various customers and their kind of chip road maps. Just kind of want to get at that. And then like in kind of bigger picture, if the high-performance compute test TAM is a little bit more secular, a little bit more growthy, if you've kind of benchmarked test growth at sort of 4% to 8%, how much of a premium do you think we're looking at over the next several years in terms of HPC TAM?"

So the issues about 3-nanometer certainly enables more dense, more transistors per die. That's not what I'm talking about. That's a big driver of test in the future. that would absolutely be something that would give us a positive outlook for the next midterm. There's the chiplet thing that we talked about where you have mixed nodes going into chips, and then you need known good die testing and then the multi-packaging needs increasingly test intensity. That's not what I'm talking about. But that's real and that's there, too. The thing that I'm talking about with 3-nanometer that's unique, let's say, is the change in the transistor architecture from FinFET to gate all around. That happens once per decade. Again, he it happened with FinFETs earlier in the last decade. It's happening with data all around here in the next few years. Those transitions, everything else being equal, introduce additional, typically, failure modes that need more test methodologies to make sure the device is functionally correctly. And so let's say, the average test time per transistor can tend to be higher because of the additional verification needed related to that new architecture. Now early in the architecture's life, that tends to be higher as the architecture matures over time, that premium, let's say, comes down. So -- and the world doesn't shift to 3-nanometer in mass day 1 either. So there's this bleeding up of certain devices using 3-nanometer that are highly test-intensive and more and more come online year after year, and then the learning curve comes on. But net-net, again, if you look at the test market from 2000 to 2012, it had been a declining market. In 2012 to now, it's been growing quite well in excess of 10%. Part of that is the parallel testing, ameliorating that we've talked about, part of it's the FinFET story that we've talked about and the growing transistor count. So we're at another 1 of those junctures with gate all around. 
And then sorry, HPC."

But absent that story, what we've been seeing for the past 10 years in test, since 3-nanometer in 2022 is likely not going to be a huge event because it's likely to be later in the year. People will still move down the complexity curve at 5- and 5-plus nanometer nodes and increase transistor counts and such along that that path. So even absent 3-nanometer, we have an optimistic view of what '22 looks like. We'll probably start out the year similar to how we started out years in the past. And at the beginning of the year with some modest growth in the first quarter and then it kind of swings on what's going to happen over the summer, which is our peak quarters. around the refreshes. Will those refreshes of silicon be in 3-nanometer, Will they be in 5 plus with the traditional normal transistor count growth that we've seen for the past 10 years. Those are things that we have to get closer to next year to really understand."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll cover 4 topics: the highlights of our third quarter and the first 9 months of the year, the changes we're observing in the SOC test market, our outlook for the industrial automation market and how we're thinking about the test and automation markets as we close out this year and look into 2022 and beyond.  
As our Q3 results demonstrate, demand remains strong across all of our businesses. At the company level, Q3 sales grew 16% from last year's record Q3 and non-GAAP EPS grew 35%. We did experience increased supply chain bottlenecks in our Industrial Automation business in the quarter and under ship demand. Sanjay will describe this in more detail, but we expect these constraints to persist into Q4. Despite this, for the first 9 months of 2021, company-wide sales grew 19% and non-GAAP EPS grew 31% from the year ago level.  
In each of our businesses, we are writing long-term secular trends that we expect will drive revenue and earnings growth for years to come. In our Test businesses, the unit growth and complexity drivers that power these markets continue unabated. For example, our semiconductor test business grew 18% through Q3, while -- with SOC leading the charge growing 22%. Sales continue to be dominated by our UltraFLEX product line, which is well aligned to the performance requirements of the growing compute and mobility markets.  
Additionally, sales of our Eagle Test systems more than doubled in the 9-month period as Automotive and Industrial Test markets have also rapidly expanded. Eagle's unique architecture hits the sweet spot of these markets by balancing high precision with the stress testing needed for these demanding applications.  
Within SOC, there's been a clear shift this year to higher demand from the compute, automotive and industrial markets. While mobility is still the largest subsegment of SOC and growing, it has dropped from the high 50% range of the SOC test market in recent years to the high 40% range this year. Over the midterm, we expect mobility will remain the largest SOC submarket and continue to grow but we also expect compute to grow at a faster rate, while automotive should remain at its current elevated levels.  
For the last decade or so, mobility has made rapid annual advances in semiconductor complexity that has enabled the advancement of smartphone sophistication. The refresh pace has been much faster than traditional PCs, graphics, automotive and industrial end markets, leading to smartphone ICs rapidly progressing along the complexity scale. This is true in many areas of smartphone silicon, apps processor compute engines, graphics engines, AI engines, image sensors, power management and more. Our leading position in testing these key technologies has driven our growth.  
At the same time, up until recently, the traditional compute testing market has been relatively flat with slower refresh rates and slower complexity growth. However, the groundwork laid by mobility designs combined with advancing lithography nodes and design tools has enabled new entrants into the chip design space for compute engines. The complexity of these chips whether for laptops, servers, autonomous driving, AI or graphics is incredible and advancing at an accelerated rate. For example, laptop CPUs are now crossing the 30 billion transistor level, which is a huge leap over previous legacy designs.  
As we've said in the past, increased transistor counts drives increased test time and increased tester demand. We've seen that this year and there's more to come. We're targeting this expanding collection of new players and new designs, leaning heavily into our UltraFLEX family's hardware performance and time-to-market advantages of our software. We've been adding new design wins every quarter. And while development pipelines can be long and these new designs can be speculative, we're confident we'll see growing production business from these wins in the future. It's also notable that the traditional chip suppliers in these markets aren't standing still, they are doubling down on their advanced designs too, which is collectively driving WFE investments higher as applications expand and competition heats up.  
We expect this rate to lead to higher test TAMs and given the higher performance and faster design to market cycle times, more share gain opportunities for Teradyne over the midterm. Our System Test segment last year -- sorry, our System Test segment year-to-date sales grew 11% from 2020 and Storage Test continued its multiyear growth trajectory, expanding sales 12% in the same period. Higher capacity HDDs and more complex SOC devices, which require system-level test are driving this demand.  
Both trends are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. At LitePoint, sales were up 24% through 9 months compared with 2020, driven by WiFi 6E production, WiFi 7 R&D demand as well as ultra wideband. More connected devices demanding more bandwidth while managing growing congestion drives complexity increases in each new WiFi standard and more tests. UWB, on the other hand, is a whole new wireless standard and application space. It's a new proximity detection wireless technology with the future of many promising security applications. We expect these trends to continue and to provide a long-term tailwind to our wireless Test business.  
Shifting to Industrial Automation. Universal Robots revenue grew 50% through the first 9 months of the year, while MiR grew 40% despite supply chain challenges. Each has a unique story. At UR, it's a combination of increasing sales for existing tasks and the expanding number of UR+ offerings, making it easier for customers to deploy our cobots to do new applications. We highlighted welding in our last call, but other examples include screwdriving and palletizing. The UR+ ecosystem is key to expanding these tasks and now totals over 360 products created by over 300 partners, both riding on and broadening the coattails of our UR platform. This is a key advantage in the combination of our organic investments and our UR+ and OEM partners R&D dollars and creativity that's going into expanding the UR platform and it's unmatched.  
At MiR, the story is about new products. The MiR250 which was introduced just as COVID hit last March of last year, is now our largest seller by far. This year, we added the MiR Hook to the 250 family to expand its applications into tugging. We've introduced higher payload products such as the MiR 600 and 1350 to expand our footprint in the fast-growing logistics market.  
Unfortunately, with all this good news come supply chain issues that will limit IA growth in 2021 to be between 30% to 40% year-on-year, but demand is strong. The long-term outlook in IA remains very bright. Looking at the capabilities of UR cobots today, we estimate the penetration rate is less than 2% of the servable market. UR's approximate 45% market share puts us clearly in the lead, and we continue to drive R&D and distribution investments to extend our competitive advantages, expand the servable market and drive penetration higher.  
It's a similar story at MiR, where we estimate the autonomous mobile robot penetration is under 3%. The AMR market doesn't have a single dominant player like UR cobots, and we estimate we're close to #2 in the broadly defined market. And like at UR, we're making investments in both the distribution and product level to both reinforce our advantages and extend our product reach.  
In both IA businesses, the fact that our penetration of today's servable market is low single digits and that the servable market continues to expand each year with product enhancements, sets up a fantastic future. So even with very high growth rates in our IA business, we expect the penetration rates to remain low for many years, sustaining our long-term annual growth forecast of 20% to 35%. In January, we will update you on the outlook for 2022 and our midterm earnings model. Between now and then, we'll be looking at the rate and timing of new semiconductor fab capacity coming online, especially at the more advanced lithography nodes. And we'll also be looking at the rate of adoption of DDR5 as key swing factors.  
In IA, we will be looking at the manufacturing output expansion, onshoring trends and PMIs in our principal geographies as tailwinds for continued robust growth. On the other hand, in both markets, supply chain bottlenecks could slow certain industries and become a headwind to growth demand. Short-term demand is influenced by many factors, but we manage our business aligned to the long-term trends. The trend of growing prevalence of increasingly complex semiconductors and a myriad of applications drives our semiconductor business and investments. The trend of new increasingly smart, cost-effective automation in a world with labor scarcity and onshoring challenges drives our IA business and investment strategy. These systemic long-term trends paid an exciting future for Teradyne.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Sanjay."

In my remarks, I'll review our Q3 financial results, discuss our supply line strategy in this challenging environment, provide Q4 guidance and comment on our full year financial outlook at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance to the financial headlines for Q3.  
Our third quarter sales were $951 million was near the high end of guidance driven by strength in Semi Test and wireless test. Gross margin in the quarter was approximately 60%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $242 million or 25.5% of revenue. The favorability in OpEx drove a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.59, a few more components of third quarter data. Our tax rate, excluding discrete items, was 14.8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP diluted share count was approximately $176 million. We had two 10% customers.  
Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. Semi Test revenue of $688 million was up 16% from Q3 '20. SOC revenue was $575 million, up 28%, driven by strength in applications processors, RF, industrial and automotive applications. Automotive and industrials doubled revenue year-over-year. Memory revenue was the second highest in history at $113 million, but down 21% from Q3 of last year's record. 
FLASH final test demand was the strongest segment on handset and SSD end market demand. System Test group had revenue of $103 million, which was down 13% year-over-year. Recall Storage is the largest business in this segment and has lumpy shipments. While Storage Test will still grow more than 15% for the year, sales, including HDD and SLT declined to $56 million on the timing of shipments in Q3.  
Defense and aerospace and production board test combined grew 10% year-on-year to $47 million. At LitePoint, revenue of $69 million was up 70% from prior year due to early success of our new WiFi 7 product, continued strength in 4G cellular and [ Utilev ].  
Now to Industrial Automation. As in July, given COVID shutdowns had impaired the UR business in 2020, I'll provide revenue metrics comparing Q3 '21 results with both Q3 '20 and Q3 '19. Industrial Automation revenue of $91 million was up 32% from both Q3 '19 and Q3 '20. North America delivered the highest revenue growth from last year, but all regions expanded year-on-year. As Mark noted, supply issues, primarily semiconductors, reduced our IA shipments in the quarter. UR sales were $78 million in Q3, up 46% year-over-year and 31% over Q3 '19. MiR sales were $13 million, up 27% from Q3 '20 and 35% from Q3 '19. IA was about breakeven in the quarter and full -- breakeven in the quarter and full year, we expect low single-digit profitability. As we've noted before, we continue our strategy of investing during this high-growth era while maintaining gross margins to enable mid-20s operating profit in the future.  
Shifting to supply. We continue to deal with numerous supply constraints across the company. While semiconductor shortages are well reported, we're also seeing delays in mechanical parts and logistics, all exacerbated by rolling COVID-related shutdowns or labor shortages. We expect these issues will continue through the first half of 2022. Despite these issues, we've been able to deliver record shipments and a big part of that performance is a result of the supply line management, operations teams and engineering teams working with our supply chain and contract manufacturing partners.  
We view our operational business model and execution against it as a core competence. Our gross margin performance over the last 10 years displays the financial value of this model. In our test portfolio, our execution has kept most of our tester lead times within the range that meet customers' needs to expand their production capacity in this dynamic environment. The significance of this lead time performance is that customer orders more closely reflect true test demand. So while a bit counterintuitive, we feel that maintaining short lead times are a more accurate indicator of test demand with lower risk than holding orders with lead times far beyond chip manufacturing cycle times. Of course, our supply line and operations model isn't static. We begin in adding resiliency through both geographic and supplier diversity prior to COVID. Those efforts have accelerated over the last 20 months.  
This work is paying dividends in the current environment, and we'll continue to invest to harden our supply chain further. Our lead time performance is an example of our resilience and execution. Another example is the ability to scale to significantly increase demand. Auto and industrial sales have more than doubled year-over-year. While we're not perfectly aligned to all customer requested delivery dates, we are managing through delivery issues in a reasonable manner. The value of these efforts can also be seen in the operating leverage in our gross margin line. In IA, we've seen lead times extend from our normal 1 to 2 weeks to 4 to 6 weeks for some products. While this is a challenge, with the business growing so quickly and ongoing industry supply issues, we've already seen the positive impact of our work in material sourcing and manufacturing cycle times.  
We expect to bring lead times back to model over the next 2 to 3 quarters. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.45 billion. We had $493 million in free cash flow in the quarter, and through 9 months, we've spent $103 million on CapEx, and we expect we'll spend $148 million for the full year. We spent $210 million and $16 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.3 million shares for $406 million at an average price of $123.53. In 2021, we expect to return over 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders. And from 2015, when we began repurchasing shares, we've returned 85% of our free cash flow to owners.  
Regarding our convertible debt, $302 million of principal was paid in the first 9 months to the convertible bondholders ahead of maturity. By mid-December, bondholders will have converted approximately $343 million, leaving a face value of $117 million.  
Now to our outlook for Q4. Sales in Q4 are expected to be between $820 million and $900 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.14 to $1.40 on 174 million diluted shares. Fourth quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and noncash imputed interest on the convertible debt. Our guidance assumes no significant changes, positive or negative, in the availability of materials and assumes that we won't see additional pandemic-related issues. Fourth quarter gross margins are estimated at 59% to 60%. OpEx is expected to run at 28% to 31% of fourth quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 30%.  
Regarding OpEx for the full year. We spent a bit lower than planned in Q3, and we expect the full year OpEx will be about $980 million, up 17% from 2020. At the midpoint of our guidance, 2021 will be another year of growth in both revenue and EPS, while sales growing -- or sorry, with sales growing 18% to $3.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS growing to $5.88, up 27%. Gross margin for the full year should be approximately 59.5%, up from 57.2% in 2020, reflecting the ramp of new products, product mix and operating leverage, offsetting component and logistics cost increases.  
Our 2021 non-GAAP operating profit rate is expected to be about 33%, up from last year's 30%. Our full year tax rate is expected to be 14.8%. These results put us comfortably in the range of our 2024 earnings model this year. We'll update the model on our regular cadence in January. The breadth of our customer buying in 2021 is also broader than last year. In 2020, we had 1 customer that drove 25% of sales. In 2021, we do not expect to have any customer larger than 20% of our yearly revenue. This reflects the trend Mark noted about 2021's higher growth in compute, auto and industrial demand compared with mobility demand in Semi Test. IA growth of over 30% year-over-year continues to diversify our revenue. This growth is expected to continue over the midterm and become a larger portion of our revenue.  
In summary, we expect to end the year with another quarter of strong year-on-year revenue and EPS growth. On a full year basis, we'll exceed our midterm targets on stronger-than-expected demand on our test businesses, continued high growth in IA and excellent execution across the company. While we don't have a clear picture of 2022 yet, we're confident in the long-term industry trends powering our test and IA businesses remain firmly in place.  
With that, I'll turn the call back to Andy."

I mean we look at the trends that I just -- you cited and I cited and see that there's very little standing in the way of sort of this increased growth, but the caveat I would mention is there's a lot of supply chain bottlenecks in the system. So if end products get bottlenecked, that can slow down the unit volume demand for new semiconductors. And the other thing we're looking at is when do these new nodes really come online in terms of capacity. All that $90 billion of WFE that was put in place this year hasn't yet had a single impact on test. That's all to come. But it kind of depends on when do those additional 5- and 3-nanometer fabs come online. That is kind of a big swing factor in the calendar year 2022 as to how our growth will shrunk out. And that's kind of why we wait until January because we don't get good enough visibility on that right now."

So how could this thing keep going beyond the normal 6-quarter surge in automotive, which is you're right, again, that's kind of the traditional pattern.

New -- kind of racing to get new, more current generation lithography node silicon into automotive design because the legacy lines out there are hard to get at chip suppliers are trying to obsolete those fabs. And so the automotive customers don't have as much, I would say, power in this frothy demand environment on the semiconductor supply side. And so the semiconductor suppliers are kind of same, get with the program, move to more advanced nodes. And a little bit of that's happening, which is what -- that means complexity, yield issues, and that means a little more test than you might expect.

And then the advanced package itself has more potential defect failure modes that need to be tested. So that's 1 thing around the whole chiplet, multi-chip package thing. The other thing, though, that's happening, and this is really going to become prevalent at 3-nanometer and beyond is the move from FinFET to gate all around transistor architectures.

In terms of fungibility, they're pretty fungible to testers across what's used for compute engine in a phone versus a compute engine in a laptop or a desktop or anything else.

And so those testers tend to be a little more unique. But we've talked about in the past that -- I think people have looked at us and said, well, in a world where cell phones are kind of plateauing, doesn't that -- unit growth of cell phones doesn't that portends some kind of slowing for us. 
And what we've always said is that, look, cell phone unit growth can slow, complexity isn't. And some of these customers are diversifying into more silicon, both in the phone and now more silicon outside the phone into compute. There are these emerging hyperscalers that are building silicon for both cloud computing and other new yet to be introduced consumer products. So the ability of a design team today to be formed and put together a $10 billion-plus transistor chip for a consumer application is easier and easier and easier.

Maybe a small fraction of them will be hits in the future, but they can bring entirely new classes of sector high compute engine semiconductor applications to the market.

And with that, we're very focused and conscious on both engineering and go-to-market investments. And so how we think about it is quite simple. And that is where we have a strong belief that we're going to grow and it's going to accelerate that revenue growth, we're going to lean into the investment. And again, think about it in the rule of 40. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our gross margins are actually improving in that portfolio.

So a little bit could happen in '22, how much we won't know more until January. In terms of markets next year that are interesting and exciting. I think it goes back to these emergent hyperscalers that are developing some new applications and very complex silicon for those new applications. Some of those could latch in the market with new product introductions and drive a whole new sort of demand stream for semiconductors and the testers associated with them. So that's kind of what we're rooting for and what we're close to, and we're seeing could be breakouts for 2022."

So it's a broad spectrum is, I guess, the bottom line. But if you sort of play it out. I'd say the hyperscalers are going to, on average, bring cell phone-like complexity applications to the market. It's probably not going to be something that's -- take the $50 billion transistor device that kind of surprised everybody. It's probably not at that extreme. It's probably more in the $10 billion transistor range on average and then moving up year-over-year over year after that as they iterate on the design."

So all of the WFE investment gets recognized before a single testers associated with that investment. So the way to think about test is whenever you see some silicon coming off a new node, I assume that the testers were installed maybe 3 months or so prior to that. So once the 3-nanometer fab comes online and you start to see product coming off of it in reasonable volume more than sort of pilot line volume. I assume that the tester installations occurred about 3 months prior. That's kind of the best guidance I can give you there. And then the only other thing I would caution about memory versus SOC is that the curve of test time to transistor count is not the same in memory as it is in SOC. Memory tends to be a bit more efficient for reasons I won't get into here. So you can double transistors and memory, and you're not going to probably move test time more than 20%, 30% or so, let's say, whereas in SOC, it's not quite linear, but it's closer."

Or is it also sort of a combination of the types of devices that you think that enables in terms of the intersection point of various customers and their kind of chip road maps.

So the issues about 3-nanometer certainly enables more dense, more transistors per die. That's not what I'm talking about. That's a big driver of test in the future. that would absolutely be something that would give us a positive outlook for the next midterm. There's the chiplet thing that we talked about where you have mixed nodes going into chips, and then you need known good die testing and then the multi-packaging needs increasingly test intensity. That's not what I'm talking about. But that's real and that's there, too. The thing that I'm talking about with 3-nanometer that's unique, let's say, is the change in the transistor architecture from FinFET to gate all around. 
That happens once per decade. Again, he it happened with FinFETs earlier in the last decade. It's happening with data all around here in the next few years. Those transitions, everything else being equal, introduce additional, typically, failure modes that need more test methodologies to make sure the device is functioning correctly. And so let's say, the average test time per transistor can tend to be higher because of the additional verification needed related to that new architecture. Now early in the architecture's life, that tends to be higher as the architecture matures over time, that premium, let's say, comes down. So -- and the world doesn't shift to 3-nanometer in mass day 1 either. 
So there's this bleeding up of certain devices using 3-nanometer that are highly test-intensive and more and more come online year after year, and then the learning curve comes on. But net-NAND, again, if you look at the test market from 2000 to 2012, it had been a declining market. In 2012 to now, it's been growing quite well in excess of 10%. Part of that is the parallel testing, ameliorating that we've talked about, part of it's the FinFET story that we've talked about and the growing transistor count. So we're at another one of those junctures with gate all around.

But absent that story, what we've been seeing for the past 10 years in test, since 3-nanometer in 2022 is likely not going to be a huge event because it's likely to be later in the year. People will still move down the complexity curve at 5- and 5-plus nanometer nodes and increase transistor counts and such along that path. So even absent 3-nanometer, we have an optimistic view of what '22 looks like. 
We'll probably start out the year similar to how we started out years in the past. And at the beginning of the year with some modest growth in the first quarter and then it kind of swings on what's going to happen over the summer, which is our peak quarters. around the refreshes. Will those refreshes of silicon be in 3-nanometer, Will they be in 5 plus with the traditional normal transistor count growth that we've seen for the past 10 years.

Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2021's third quarter along with our outlook for the fourth quarter.  
The press release containing our third quarter results was issued last evening. We're providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends.  
The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call.  
During today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We've posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate on the Investor page of the website. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by Baird, Credit Suisse, Davidson and UBS.  
Now let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark will comment on our recent results, current market conditions and thoughts on the rest of 2021 and '22. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results along with our guidance for the fourth quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for 1 hour.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll cover 4 topics: the highlights of our third quarter and the first 9 months of the year, the changes we're observing in the SOC test market, our outlook for the industrial automation market and how we're thinking about the test and automation markets as we close out this year and look into 2022 and beyond.  
As our Q3 results demonstrate, demand remains strong across all of our businesses. At the company level, Q3 sales grew 16% from last year's record Q3 and non-GAAP EPS grew 35%. We did experience increased supply chain bottlenecks in our Industrial Automation business in the quarter and under ship demand. Sanjay will describe this in more detail, but we expect these constraints to persist into Q4. Despite this, for the first 9 months of 2021, company-wide sales grew 19% and non-GAAP EPS grew 31% from the year ago level.  
In each of our businesses, we are riding long-term secular trends that we expect will drive revenue and earnings growth for years to come. In our Test businesses, the unit growth and complexity drivers that power these markets continue unabated. For example, our semiconductor test business grew 18% through Q3, while -- with SOC leading the charge growing 22%. Sales continue to be dominated by our UltraFLEX product line which is well aligned to the performance requirements of the growing compute and mobility markets.  
Additionally, sales of our Eagle Test Systems more than doubled in the 9-month period as Automotive and Industrial Test markets have also rapidly expanded. Eagle's unique architecture hits the sweet spot in these markets by balancing high precision with the stress testing needed for these demanding applications.  
Within SOC, there's been a clear shift this year to higher demand from the compute, automotive and industrial markets. While mobility is still the largest subsegment of SOC and growing, it has dropped from the high 50% range of the SOC test market in recent years to the high 40% range this year. Over the midterm, we expect mobility will remain the largest SOC submarket and continue to grow but we also expect compute to grow at a faster rate, while automotive should remain at its current elevated levels.  
For the last decade or so, mobility has made rapid annual advances in semiconductor complexity that has enabled the advancement of smartphone sophistication. The refresh pace has been much faster than traditional PCs, graphics, automotive and industrial end markets, leading to smartphone ICs rapidly progressing along the complexity scale. This is true in many areas of smartphone silicon, apps processor compute engines, graphics engines, AI engines, image sensors, power management and more. Our leading position in testing these key technologies has driven our growth.  
At the same time, up until recently, the traditional compute testing market has been relatively flat with slower refresh rates and slower complexity growth. However, the groundwork laid by mobility designs combined with advancing lithography nodes and design tools has enabled new entrants into the chip design space for compute engines. The complexity of these chips whether for laptops, servers, autonomous driving, AI or graphics is incredible and advancing at an accelerated rate. For example, laptop CPUs are now crossing the 30 billion transistor level, which is a huge leap over previous legacy designs.  
As we've said in the past, increased transistor counts drives increased test time and increased tester demand. We've seen that this year and there's more to come. We're targeting this expanding collection of new players and new designs, leaning heavily into our UltraFLEX family's hardware performance and time-to-market advantages of our software. We've been adding new design wins every quarter. And while development pipelines can be long and these new designs can be speculative, we're confident we'll see growing production business from these wins in the future. It's also notable that the traditional chip suppliers in these markets aren't standing still, they are doubling down on their advanced designs too, which is collectively driving WFE investments higher as applications expand and competition heats up.  
We expect this race to lead to higher test TAMs and given the higher performance and faster design to market cycle times, more share gain opportunities for Teradyne over the midterm. 
 
Our System Test segment last year -- sorry, our System Test segment year-to-date sales grew 11% from 2020 and Storage Test continued its multiyear growth trajectory, expanding sales 12% in the same period. Higher capacity HDDs and more complex SOC devices, which require system-level test, are driving this demand. Both trends are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. 
At LitePoint, sales were up 24% through 9 months compared with 2020, driven by WiFi 6E production, WiFi 7 R&D demand as well as ultra-wideband. More connected devices demanding more bandwidth while managing growing congestion drive complexity increases in each new WiFi standard and more tests. UWB, on the other hand, is a whole new wireless standard in application space. It's a new proximity detection wireless technology with the future of many promising security applications. We expect these trends to continue and to provide a long-term tailwind to our Wireless Test business.  
Shifting to Industrial Automation. Universal Robots revenue grew 50% through the first 9 months of the year, while MiR grew 40% despite supply chain challenges. Each has a unique story. At UR, it's a combination of increasing sales for existing tasks and the expanding number of UR+ offerings, making it easier for customers to deploy our cobots to do new applications. We highlighted welding in our last call, but other examples include screw-driving and palletizing. 
The UR+ ecosystem is key to expanding these tasks and now totals over 360 products created by over 300 partners, both riding on and broadening the coattails of our UR platform. This is a key advantage in the combination of our organic investments and our UR+ and OEM partners R&D dollars and creativity that's going into expanding the UR platform and it's unmatched.  
At MiR, the story is about new products. The MiR250 which was introduced just as COVID hit last March of last year, is now our largest seller by far. This year, we added the MiR Hook to the 250 family to expand its applications into tugging. We've introduced higher payload products such as the MiR 600 and 1350 to expand our footprint in the fast-growing logistics market.  
Unfortunately, with all this good news come supply chain issues that will limit IA growth in 2021 to be between 30% to 40% year-on-year, but demand is strong. The long-term outlook in IA remains very bright. Looking at the capabilities of UR cobots today, we estimate the penetration rate is less than 2% of the servable market. UR's approximate 45% market share puts us clearly in the lead, and we continue to drive R&D and distribution investments to extend our competitive advantages, expand the servable market and drive penetration higher.  
It's a similar story at MiR, where we estimate the autonomous mobile robot penetration is under 3%. The AMR market doesn't have a single dominant player like UR cobots, and we estimate we're close to #2 in the broadly defined market. And like at UR, we're making investments in both the distribution and product level to both reinforce our advantages and extend our product reach.  
In both IA businesses, the fact that our penetration of today's servable market is low single digits and that the servable market continues to expand each year with product enhancements, sets up a fantastic future. So even with very high growth rates in our IA business, we expect the penetration rates to remain low for many years, sustaining our long-term annual growth forecast of 20% to 35%. In January, we will update you on the outlook for 2022 and our midterm earnings model. Between now and then, we'll be looking at the rate and timing of new semiconductor fab capacity coming online, especially at the more advanced lithography nodes. And we'll also be looking at the rate of adoption of DDR5 as key swing factors.  
In IA, we will be looking at the manufacturing output expansion, onshoring trends and PMIs in our principal geographies as tailwinds for continued robust growth. On the other hand, in both markets, supply chain bottlenecks could slow certain industries and become a headwind to growth demand. Short-term demand is influenced by many factors, but we manage our business aligned to the long-term trends. The trend of growing prevalence of increasingly complex semiconductors and a myriad of applications drives our semiconductor business and investments. The trend of new increasingly smart, cost-effective automation in a world with labor scarcity and onshoring challenges drives our IA business and investment strategy. These systemic long-term trends paint an exciting future for Teradyne.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Sanjay."
94728,1685270027,2442421,"Teradyne, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Teradyne, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone.  In my remarks, I'll review our Q3 financial results, discuss our supply line strategy in this challenging environment, provide Q4 guidance and comment on our full year financial outlook at the midpoint of our Q4 guida",1460,"Thanks, Mark, and hello, everyone.  
In my remarks, I'll review our Q3 financial results, discuss our supply line strategy in this challenging environment, provide Q4 guidance and comment on our full year financial outlook at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. 
To the financial headlines for Q3. Our third quarter sales were $951 million was near the high end of guidance driven by strength in Semi Test and Wireless Test. Gross margin in the quarter was approximately 60%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $242 million or 25.5% of revenue. The favorability in OpEx drove a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.59. A few more components of third quarter data. Our tax rate, excluding discrete items, was 14.8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP diluted share count was approximately 176 million. We had two 10% customers.  
Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. Semi Test revenue of $688 million was up 16% from Q3 '20. SOC revenue was $575 million, up 28%, driven by strength in applications processors, RF, industrial and automotive applications. Automotive and industrials doubled revenue year-over-year. Memory revenue was the second highest in history at $113 million, but down 21% from Q3 of last year's record. 
FLASH final test demand was the strongest segment on handset and SSD end market demand. System Test group had revenue of $103 million, which was down 13% year-over-year. Recall Storage is the largest business in this segment and has lumpy shipments. While Storage Test will still grow more than 15% for the year, sales, including HDD and SLT declined to $56 million on the timing of shipments in Q3.  
Defense and aerospace and production board test combined grew 10% year-on-year to $47 million. At LitePoint, revenue of $69 million was up 70% from prior year due to early success of our new WiFi 7 product, continued strength in 4G cellular and UWB.  
Now to Industrial Automation. As in July, given COVID shutdowns had impaired the UR business in 2020, I'll provide revenue metrics comparing Q3 '21 results with both Q3 '20 and Q3 '19. Industrial Automation revenue of $91 million was up 32% from both Q3 '19 and Q3 '20. North America delivered the highest revenue growth from last year, but all regions expanded year-on-year. As Mark noted, supply issues, primarily semiconductors, reduced our IA shipments in the quarter. UR sales were $78 million in Q3, up 46% year-over-year and 31% over Q3 '19. MiR sales were $13 million, up 27% from Q3 '20 and 35% from Q3 '19. IA was about breakeven in the quarter and full -- breakeven in the quarter and full year, we expect low single-digit profitability. As we've noted before, we continue our strategy of investing during this high-growth era while maintaining gross margins to enable mid-20s operating profit in the future.  
Shifting to supply. We continue to deal with numerous supply constraints across the company. While semiconductor shortages are well reported, we're also seeing delays in mechanical parts and logistics, all exacerbated by rolling COVID-related shutdowns or labor shortages. We expect these issues will continue through the first half of 2022. Despite these issues, we've been able to deliver record shipments and a big part of that performance is a result of the supply line management, operations teams and engineering teams working with our supply chain and contract manufacturing partners.  
We view our operational business model and execution against it as a core competence. Our gross margin performance over the last 10 years displays the financial value of this model. 
In our test portfolio, our execution has kept most of our tester lead times within the range that meet customers' needs to expand their production capacity in this dynamic environment. The significance of this lead time performance is that customer orders more closely reflect true test demand. So while a bit counterintuitive, we feel that maintaining short lead times are a more accurate indicator of test demand with lower risk than holding orders with lead times far beyond chip manufacturing cycle times. Of course, our supply line and operations model isn't static. We began adding resiliency through both geographic and supplier diversity prior to COVID. Those efforts have accelerated over the last 20 months.  
This work is paying dividends in the current environment, and we'll continue to invest to harden our supply chain further. Our lead time performance is an example of our resilience and execution. Another example is the ability to scale to significantly increase demand. Auto and industrial sales have more than doubled year-over-year. While we're not perfectly aligned to all customer requested delivery dates, we are managing through delivery issues in a reasonable manner. The value of these efforts can also be seen in the operating leverage in our gross margin line. 
 
In IA, we've seen lead times extend from our normal 1 to 2 weeks to 4 to 6 weeks for some products. While this is a challenge with the business growing so quickly and ongoing industry supply issues, we've already seen the positive impact of our work in material sourcing and manufacturing cycle times.  We expect to bring lead times back to model over the next 2 to 3 quarters. 
Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.45 billion. We had $493 million in free cash flow in the quarter, and through 9 months, we've spent $103 million on CapEx, and we expect we'll spend $148 million for the full year. We spent $210 million and $16 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.3 million shares for $406 million at an average price of $123.53. In 2021, we expect to return over 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders. And from 2015, when we began repurchasing shares, we've returned 85% of our free cash flow to owners.  
Regarding our convertible debt, $302 million of principal was paid in the first 9 months to the convertible bondholders ahead of maturity. By mid-December, bondholders will have converted approximately $343 million, leaving a face value of $117 million.  
Now to our outlook for Q4. Sales in Q4 are expected to be between $820 million and $900 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.14 to $1.40 on 174 million diluted shares. Fourth quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and noncash imputed interest on the convertible debt. Our guidance assumes no significant changes, positive or negative, in the availability of materials and assumes that we won't see additional pandemic-related issues. Fourth quarter gross margins are estimated at 59% to 60%. OpEx is expected to run at 28% to 31% of fourth quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 30%.  
Regarding OpEx for the full year. We spent a bit lower than planned in Q3, and we expect the full year OpEx will be about $980 million, up 17% from 2020. At the midpoint of our guidance, 2021 will be another year of growth in both revenue and EPS, while sales growing -- or sorry, with sales growing 18% to $3.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS growing to $5.88, up 27%. Gross margin for the full year should be approximately 59.5%, up from 57.2% in 2020, reflecting the ramp of new products, product mix and operating leverage, offsetting component and logistics cost increases.   
Our 2021 non-GAAP operating profit rate is expected to be about 33%, up from last year's 30%. Our full year tax rate is expected to be 14.8%. These results put us comfortably in the range of our 2024 earnings model this year. We'll update the model on our regular cadence in January. 
The breadth of our customer buying in 2021 is also broader than last year. In 2020, we had 1 customer that drove 25% of sales. In 2021, we do not expect to have any customer larger than 20% of our yearly revenue. This reflects the trend Mark noted about 2021's higher growth in compute, auto and industrial demand compared with mobility demand in Semi Test. IA growth of over 30% year-over-year continues to diversify our revenue. This growth is expected to continue over the midterm and become a larger portion of our revenue.  
In summary, we expect to end the year with another quarter of strong year-on-year revenue and EPS growth. On a full year basis, we'll exceed our midterm targets on stronger-than-expected demand on our test businesses, continued high growth in IA and excellent execution across the company. While we don't have a clear picture of 2022 yet, we're confident that the long-term industry trends powering our test and IA businesses remain firmly in place.  
With that, I'll turn the call back to Andy."

I mean we look at the trends that I just -- you cited and I cited and see that there's very little standing in the way of sort of this increased growth, but the caveat I would mention is there's a lot of supply chain bottlenecks in the system. So if end products get bottlenecked, that can slow down the unit volume demand for new semiconductors. And the other thing we're looking at is when do these new nodes really come online in terms of capacity. All that $90 billion of WFE that was put in place this year hasn't yet had a single impact on test. That's all to come. But it kind of depends on when do those additional 5- and 3-nanometer fabs come online. That is kind of a big swing factor in the calendar year 2022 as to how our growth will chunk up. And that's kind of why we wait until January because we don't get a good enough visibility on that right now."

And I expect we'll be out of the supply chain crunch given our visibility in Q2 or Q3 for IA. So that's the IA side. And then from a supply chain perspective on the test side, we've seen the supply chain tightening on the test portfolio quarter-over-quarter, where we don't think it's going to be abated until the end of Q2 of 2022. And again, mainly semiconductor parts. And really, we see that coming back online in the second half, really tied to the wafer and the substrate capacity coming online.  
And then from a gross margin perspective, we've been managing through the component increases and logistics increases in cost. And we've -- as I've said earlier, we've had favorable product mix. And as our volumes or our revenues are higher, we're gaining operating leverage along with coming down the cost curve of our new products that we've introduced late last year.

And in addition, automobile unit volume isn't near its historical peak either. So how could this thing keep going beyond the normal 6-quarter surge in automotive, which is you're right, again, that's kind of the traditional pattern. But I think what we see happening and makes us believe this will persist at least through 2022 is there's a lot of silicon refresh going on that's new in the automotive space. New -- kind of racing to get new, more current generation lithography node silicon into automotive design because the legacy lines out there are hard to get at. Chip suppliers are trying to obsolete those fabs. And so the automotive customers don't have as much, I would say, power in this frothy demand environment on the semiconductor supply side. And so the semiconductor suppliers are kind of same, get with the program, move to more advanced nodes. And a little bit of that's happening, which is what -- that means complexity, yield issues, and that means a little more test than you might expect. And I think that's what's giving us a different view this time."

And then the advanced package itself has more potential defect failure modes that need to be tested. So that's one thing around the whole chiplet, multi-chip package thing. 
The other thing, though, that's happening, and this is really going to become prevalent at 3-nanometer and beyond is the move from FinFET to gate-all-around transistor architectures. And if you remember, when the world moved from planar to FinFET, it was back in 2012, '13, '14 era, that drove -- if you go back and look at the history of sort of the test market, that drove incremental test intensity and complexity in the market. And we're headed for another one of those with gate-all-around. There's going to be new defect modes, new kind of test intensity boosts coming from this new architecture on the transistor. So even at equivalent transistor counts, we're going to see a little bit more test intensity because of that.

In terms of fungibility, they're pretty fungible to testers across what's used for compute engine in a phone versus a compute engine in a laptop or a desktop or anything else.

And so those testers tend to be a little more unique. But we've talked about in the past that -- I think people have looked at us and said, well, in a world where cell phones are kind of plateauing, doesn't that -- unit growth of cell phones doesn't that that portends some kind of slowing for us. 
And what we've always said is that, look, cell phone unit growth can slow, complexity isn't. And some of these customers are diversifying into more silicon, both in the phone and now more silicon outside the phone into compute. There are these emerging hyperscalers that are building silicon for both cloud computing and other new yet-to-be introduced consumer products. So the ability of a design team today to be formed and put together a $10 billion-plus transistor chip for a consumer application is easier and easier and easier. And as I said in my script, we work with a lot of them. Maybe a small fraction of them will be hits in the future, but they can bring entirely new classes of semiconductor -- high compute engine semiconductor applications to the market.

Memory tends to be a bit more efficient for reasons I won't get into here.

Or is it also sort of a combination of the types of devices that you think that enables in terms of the intersection point of various customers and their kind of chip road maps?

So the issues about 3-nanometer certainly enables more dense, more transistors per die. That's not what I'm talking about. That's a big driver of test in the future. That would absolutely be something that would give us a positive outlook for the next midterm. There's the chiplet thing that we talked about where you have mixed nodes going into chips, and then you need known good die testing and then the multi-packaging needs increasingly test intensity. That's not what I'm talking about. But that's real and that's there, too. The thing that I'm talking about with 3-nanometer that's unique, let's say, is the change in the transistor architecture from FinFET to gate-all-around. 
That happens once per decade. Again, it happened with FinFETs earlier in the last decade. It's happening with gate-all-around here in the next few years. Those transitions, everything else being equal, introduce additional, typically, failure modes that need more test methodologies to make sure the device is functioning correctly. And so let's say, the average test time per transistor can tend to be higher because of the additional verification needed related to that new architecture. Now early in the architecture's life, that tends to be higher. As the architecture matures over time, that premium, let's say, comes down. So -- and the world doesn't shift to 3-nanometer en masse day 1 either. 
So there's this bleeding up of certain devices using 3-nanometer that are highly test-intensive and more and more come online year after year, and then the learning curve comes on. But net-net, again, if you look at the test market from 2000 to 2012, it had been a declining market. And 2012 to now, it's been growing quite well in excess of 10%. Part of that is the parallel testing, ameliorating that we've talked about, part of it's the FinFET story that we've talked about and the growing transistor count. So we're at another one of those junctures with gate-all-around.

So there's nothing in terms of a new tester here that comes with 3-nanometer. And yes, by and large, it's a 2023 and beyond type story. But absent that story, what we've been seeing for the past 10 years in test, since 3-nanometer in 2022 is likely not going to be a huge event because it's likely to be later in the year, people will still move down the complexity curve at 5- and 5-plus nanometer nodes and increase transistor counts and such along that path. So even absent 3-nanometer, we have an optimistic view of what '22 looks like. 
We'll probably start out the year similar to how we started out years in the past and at the beginning of the year with some modest growth in the first quarter and then it kind of swings on what's going to happen over the summer, which is our peak quarters, around the refreshes. Will those refreshes of silicon be in 3-nanometer, will they be in 5 plus with the traditional normal transistor count growth that we've seen for the past 10 years, those are things that we have to get closer to next year to really understand."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll cover 4 topics: the highlights of our third quarter and the first 9 months of the year, the changes we're observing in the SOC test market, our outlook for the industrial automation market and how we're thinking about the test and automation markets as we close out this year and look into 2022 and beyond.  
As our Q3 results demonstrate, demand remains strong across all of our businesses. At the company level, Q3 sales grew 16% from last year's record Q3 and non-GAAP EPS grew 35%. We did experience increased supply chain bottlenecks in our Industrial Automation business in the quarter and under ship demand. Sanjay will describe this in more detail, but we expect these constraints to persist into Q4. Despite this, for the first 9 months of 2021, company-wide sales grew 19% and non-GAAP EPS grew 31% from the year ago level.  
In each of our businesses, we are riding long-term secular trends that we expect will drive revenue and earnings growth for years to come. In our Test businesses, the unit growth and complexity drivers that power these markets continue unabated. For example, our semiconductor test business grew 18% through Q3, while -- with SOC leading the charge growing 22%. Sales continue to be dominated by our UltraFLEX product line which is well aligned to the performance requirements of the growing compute and mobility markets.  
Additionally, sales of our Eagle Test Systems more than doubled in the 9-month period as Automotive and Industrial Test markets have also rapidly expanded. Eagle's unique architecture hits the sweet spot in these markets by balancing high precision with the stress testing needed for these demanding applications.  
Within SOC, there's been a clear shift this year to higher demand from the compute, automotive and industrial markets. While mobility is still the largest subsegment of SOC and growing, it has dropped from the high 50% range of the SOC test market in recent years to the high 40% range this year. Over the midterm, we expect mobility will remain the largest SOC submarket and continue to grow but we also expect compute to grow at a faster rate, while automotive should remain at its current elevated levels.  
For the last decade or so, mobility has made rapid annual advances in semiconductor complexity that has enabled the advancement of smartphone sophistication. The refresh pace has been much faster than traditional PCs, graphics, automotive and industrial end markets, leading to smartphone ICs rapidly progressing along the complexity scale. This is true in many areas of smartphone silicon, apps processor compute engines, graphics engines, AI engines, image sensors, power management and more. Our leading position in testing these key technologies has driven our growth.  
At the same time, up until recently, the traditional compute testing market has been relatively flat with slower refresh rates and slower complexity growth. However, the groundwork laid by mobility designs combined with advancing lithography nodes and design tools has enabled new entrants into the chip design space for compute engines. The complexity of these chips whether for laptops, servers, autonomous driving, AI or graphics is incredible and advancing at an accelerated rate. For example, laptop CPUs are now crossing the 30 billion transistor level, which is a huge leap over previous legacy designs.  
As we've said in the past, increased transistor counts drives increased test time and increased tester demand. We've seen that this year and there's more to come. We're targeting this expanding collection of new players and new designs, leaning heavily into our UltraFLEX family's hardware performance and time-to-market advantages of our software. We've been adding new design wins every quarter. And while development pipelines can be long and these new designs can be speculative, we're confident we'll see growing production business from these wins in the future. It's also notable that the traditional chip suppliers in these markets aren't standing still, they are doubling down on their advanced designs too, which is collectively driving WFE investments higher as applications expand and competition heats up.  
We expect this race to lead to higher test TAMs and given the higher performance and faster design to market cycle times, more share gain opportunities for Teradyne over the midterm. 
 
Our System Test segment last year -- sorry, our System Test segment year-to-date sales grew 11% from 2020 and Storage Test continued its multiyear growth trajectory, expanding sales 12% in the same period. Higher capacity HDDs and more complex SOC devices, which require system-level test, are driving this demand. Both trends are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. 
At LitePoint, sales were up 24% through 9 months compared with 2020, driven by WiFi 6E production, WiFi 7 R&D demand as well as ultra-wideband. More connected devices demanding more bandwidth while managing growing congestion drive complexity increases in each new WiFi standard and more tests. UWB, on the other hand, is a whole new wireless standard in application space. It's a new proximity detection wireless technology with the future of many promising security applications. We expect these trends to continue and to provide a long-term tailwind to our Wireless Test business.  
Shifting to Industrial Automation. Universal Robots revenue grew 50% through the first 9 months of the year, while MiR grew 40% despite supply chain challenges. Each has a unique story. At UR, it's a combination of increasing sales for existing tasks and the expanding number of UR+ offerings, making it easier for customers to deploy our cobots to do new applications. We highlighted welding in our last call, but other examples include screw-driving and palletizing. 
The UR+ ecosystem is key to expanding these tasks and now totals over 360 products created by over 300 partners, both riding on and broadening the coattails of our UR platform. This is a key advantage in the combination of our organic investments and our UR+ and OEM partners R&D dollars and creativity that's going into expanding the UR platform and it's unmatched.  
At MiR, the story is about new products. The MiR250 which was introduced just as COVID hit last March of last year, is now our largest seller by far. This year, we added the MiR Hook to the 250 family to expand its applications into tugging. We've introduced higher payload products such as the MiR 600 and 1350 to expand our footprint in the fast-growing logistics market.  
Unfortunately, with all this good news come supply chain issues that will limit IA growth in 2021 to be between 30% to 40% year-on-year, but demand is strong. The long-term outlook in IA remains very bright. Looking at the capabilities of UR cobots today, we estimate the penetration rate is less than 2% of the servable market. UR's approximate 45% market share puts us clearly in the lead, and we continue to drive R&D and distribution investments to extend our competitive advantages, expand the servable market and drive penetration higher.  
It's a similar story at MiR, where we estimate the autonomous mobile robot penetration is under 3%. The AMR market doesn't have a single dominant player like UR cobots, and we estimate we're close to #2 in the broadly defined market. And like at UR, we're making investments in both the distribution and product level to both reinforce our advantages and extend our product reach.  
In both IA businesses, the fact that our penetration of today's servable market is low single digits and that the servable market continues to expand each year with product enhancements, sets up a fantastic future. So even with very high growth rates in our IA business, we expect the penetration rates to remain low for many years, sustaining our long-term annual growth forecast of 20% to 35%. In January, we will update you on the outlook for 2022 and our midterm earnings model. Between now and then, we'll be looking at the rate and timing of new semiconductor fab capacity coming online, especially at the more advanced lithography nodes. And we'll also be looking at the rate of adoption of DDR5 as key swing factors.  
In IA, we will be looking at the manufacturing output expansion, onshoring trends and PMIs in our principal geographies as tailwinds for continued robust growth. On the other hand, in both markets, supply chain bottlenecks could slow certain industries and become a headwind to growth demand. Short-term demand is influenced by many factors, but we manage our business aligned to the long-term trends. The trend of growing prevalence of increasingly complex semiconductors and a myriad of applications drives our semiconductor business and investments. The trend of new increasingly smart, cost-effective automation in a world with labor scarcity and onshoring challenges drives our IA business and investment strategy. These systemic long-term trends paint an exciting future for Teradyne.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Sanjay."

In my remarks, I'll review our Q3 financial results, discuss our supply line strategy in this challenging environment, provide Q4 guidance and comment on our full year financial outlook at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. 
To the financial headlines for Q3. Our third quarter sales were $951 million was near the high end of guidance driven by strength in Semi Test and Wireless Test. Gross margin in the quarter was approximately 60%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $242 million or 25.5% of revenue. The favorability in OpEx drove a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.59. A few more components of third quarter data. Our tax rate, excluding discrete items, was 14.8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP diluted share count was approximately 176 million. We had two 10% customers.  
Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. Semi Test revenue of $688 million was up 16% from Q3 '20. SOC revenue was $575 million, up 28%, driven by strength in applications processors, RF, industrial and automotive applications. Automotive and industrials doubled revenue year-over-year. Memory revenue was the second highest in history at $113 million, but down 21% from Q3 of last year's record. 
FLASH final test demand was the strongest segment on handset and SSD end market demand. System Test group had revenue of $103 million, which was down 13% year-over-year. Recall Storage is the largest business in this segment and has lumpy shipments. While Storage Test will still grow more than 15% for the year, sales, including HDD and SLT declined to $56 million on the timing of shipments in Q3.  
Defense and aerospace and production board test combined grew 10% year-on-year to $47 million. At LitePoint, revenue of $69 million was up 70% from prior year due to early success of our new WiFi 7 product, continued strength in 4G cellular and UWB.  
Now to Industrial Automation. As in July, given COVID shutdowns had impaired the UR business in 2020, I'll provide revenue metrics comparing Q3 '21 results with both Q3 '20 and Q3 '19. Industrial Automation revenue of $91 million was up 32% from both Q3 '19 and Q3 '20. North America delivered the highest revenue growth from last year, but all regions expanded year-on-year. As Mark noted, supply issues, primarily semiconductors, reduced our IA shipments in the quarter. UR sales were $78 million in Q3, up 46% year-over-year and 31% over Q3 '19. MiR sales were $13 million, up 27% from Q3 '20 and 35% from Q3 '19. IA was about breakeven in the quarter and full -- breakeven in the quarter and full year, we expect low single-digit profitability. As we've noted before, we continue our strategy of investing during this high-growth era while maintaining gross margins to enable mid-20s operating profit in the future.  
Shifting to supply. We continue to deal with numerous supply constraints across the company. While semiconductor shortages are well reported, we're also seeing delays in mechanical parts and logistics, all exacerbated by rolling COVID-related shutdowns or labor shortages. We expect these issues will continue through the first half of 2022. Despite these issues, we've been able to deliver record shipments and a big part of that performance is a result of the supply line management, operations teams and engineering teams working with our supply chain and contract manufacturing partners.  
We view our operational business model and execution against it as a core competence. Our gross margin performance over the last 10 years displays the financial value of this model. 
In our test portfolio, our execution has kept most of our tester lead times within the range that meet customers' needs to expand their production capacity in this dynamic environment. The significance of this lead time performance is that customer orders more closely reflect true test demand. So while a bit counterintuitive, we feel that maintaining short lead times are a more accurate indicator of test demand with lower risk than holding orders with lead times far beyond chip manufacturing cycle times. Of course, our supply line and operations model isn't static. We began adding resiliency through both geographic and supplier diversity prior to COVID. Those efforts have accelerated over the last 20 months.  
This work is paying dividends in the current environment, and we'll continue to invest to harden our supply chain further. Our lead time performance is an example of our resilience and execution. Another example is the ability to scale to significantly increase demand. Auto and industrial sales have more than doubled year-over-year. While we're not perfectly aligned to all customer requested delivery dates, we are managing through delivery issues in a reasonable manner. The value of these efforts can also be seen in the operating leverage in our gross margin line. 
 
In IA, we've seen lead times extend from our normal 1 to 2 weeks to 4 to 6 weeks for some products. While this is a challenge with the business growing so quickly and ongoing industry supply issues, we've already seen the positive impact of our work in material sourcing and manufacturing cycle times.  We expect to bring lead times back to model over the next 2 to 3 quarters. 
Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.45 billion. We had $493 million in free cash flow in the quarter, and through 9 months, we've spent $103 million on CapEx, and we expect we'll spend $148 million for the full year. We spent $210 million and $16 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.3 million shares for $406 million at an average price of $123.53. In 2021, we expect to return over 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders. And from 2015, when we began repurchasing shares, we've returned 85% of our free cash flow to owners.  
Regarding our convertible debt, $302 million of principal was paid in the first 9 months to the convertible bondholders ahead of maturity. By mid-December, bondholders will have converted approximately $343 million, leaving a face value of $117 million.  
Now to our outlook for Q4. Sales in Q4 are expected to be between $820 million and $900 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.14 to $1.40 on 174 million diluted shares. Fourth quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and noncash imputed interest on the convertible debt. Our guidance assumes no significant changes, positive or negative, in the availability of materials and assumes that we won't see additional pandemic-related issues. Fourth quarter gross margins are estimated at 59% to 60%. OpEx is expected to run at 28% to 31% of fourth quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 30%.  
Regarding OpEx for the full year. We spent a bit lower than planned in Q3, and we expect the full year OpEx will be about $980 million, up 17% from 2020. At the midpoint of our guidance, 2021 will be another year of growth in both revenue and EPS, while sales growing -- or sorry, with sales growing 18% to $3.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS growing to $5.88, up 27%. Gross margin for the full year should be approximately 59.5%, up from 57.2% in 2020, reflecting the ramp of new products, product mix and operating leverage, offsetting component and logistics cost increases.   
Our 2021 non-GAAP operating profit rate is expected to be about 33%, up from last year's 30%. Our full year tax rate is expected to be 14.8%. These results put us comfortably in the range of our 2024 earnings model this year. We'll update the model on our regular cadence in January. 
The breadth of our customer buying in 2021 is also broader than last year. In 2020, we had 1 customer that drove 25% of sales. In 2021, we do not expect to have any customer larger than 20% of our yearly revenue. This reflects the trend Mark noted about 2021's higher growth in compute, auto and industrial demand compared with mobility demand in Semi Test. IA growth of over 30% year-over-year continues to diversify our revenue. This growth is expected to continue over the midterm and become a larger portion of our revenue.  
In summary, we expect to end the year with another quarter of strong year-on-year revenue and EPS growth. On a full year basis, we'll exceed our midterm targets on stronger-than-expected demand on our test businesses, continued high growth in IA and excellent execution across the company. While we don't have a clear picture of 2022 yet, we're confident that the long-term industry trends powering our test and IA businesses remain firmly in place.  
With that, I'll turn the call back to Andy."

I mean we look at the trends that I just -- you cited and I cited and see that there's very little standing in the way of sort of this increased growth, but the caveat I would mention is there's a lot of supply chain bottlenecks in the system. So if end products get bottlenecked, that can slow down the unit volume demand for new semiconductors. And the other thing we're looking at is when do these new nodes really come online in terms of capacity. All that $90 billion of WFE that was put in place this year hasn't yet had a single impact on test. That's all to come. But it kind of depends on when do those additional 5- and 3-nanometer fabs come online. That is kind of a big swing factor in the calendar year 2022 as to how our growth will chunk up. And that's kind of why we wait until January because we don't get a good enough visibility on that right now."

New -- kind of racing to get new, more current generation lithography node silicon into automotive design because the legacy lines out there are hard to get at. Chip suppliers are trying to obsolete those fabs. And so the automotive customers don't have as much, I would say, power in this frothy demand environment on the semiconductor supply side. And so the semiconductor suppliers are kind of same, get with the program, move to more advanced nodes. And a little bit of that's happening, which is what -- that means complexity, yield issues, and that means a little more test than you might expect.

And then the advanced package itself has more potential defect failure modes that need to be tested. So that's one thing around the whole chiplet, multi-chip package thing. 
The other thing, though, that's happening, and this is really going to become prevalent at 3-nanometer and beyond is the move from FinFET to gate-all-around transistor architectures. And if you remember, when the world moved from planar to FinFET, it was back in 2012, '13, '14 era, that drove -- if you go back and look at the history of sort of the test market, that drove incremental test intensity and complexity in the market. And we're headed for another one of those with gate-all-around. There's going to be new defect modes, new kind of test intensity boosts coming from this new architecture on the transistor.

In terms of fungibility, they're pretty fungible to testers across what's used for compute engine in a phone versus a compute engine in a laptop or a desktop or anything else. The one that's a little bit unique is when you get into things like, the RF type products, of course, have a bit of a different architecture, power management type products have a bit of a different architecture. And so those testers tend to be a little more unique. But we've talked about in the past that -- I think people have looked at us and said, well, in a world where cell phones are kind of plateauing, doesn't that -- unit growth of cell phones doesn't that that portends some kind of slowing for us. 
And what we've always said is that, look, cell phone unit growth can slow, complexity isn't. And some of these customers are diversifying into more silicon, both in the phone and now more silicon outside the phone into compute. There are these emerging hyperscalers that are building silicon for both cloud computing and other new yet-to-be introduced consumer products. So the ability of a design team today to be formed and put together a $10 billion-plus transistor chip for a consumer application is easier and easier and easier. And as I said in my script, we work with a lot of them. Maybe a small fraction of them will be hits in the future, but they can bring entirely new classes of semiconductor -- high compute engine semiconductor applications to the market.

In terms of markets next year that are interesting and exciting, I think it goes back to these emergent hyperscalers that are developing some new applications and very complex silicon for those new applications. Some of those could latch in the market with new product introductions and drive a whole new sort of demand stream for semiconductors and the testers associated with them.

So it's a broad spectrum is, I guess, the bottom line. But if you sort of play it out, I'd say the hyperscalers are going to, on average, bring cell phone-like complexity applications to the market. It's probably not going to be something that's -- take the $50 billion transistor device that kind of surprised everybody. It's probably not at that extreme.

So all of the WFE investment gets recognized before single testers associated with that investment. So the way to think about test is whenever you see some silicon coming off a new node, assume that the testers were installed maybe 3 months or so prior to that.

That's kind of the best guidance I can give you there. And then the only other thing I would caution about memory versus SOC is that the curve of test time to transistor count is not the same in memory as it is in SOC. Memory tends to be a bit more efficient for reasons I won't get into here. So you can double transistors and memory, and you're not going to probably move test time more than 20%, 30% or so, let's say, whereas in SOC, it's not quite linear, but it's closer."

So the issues about 3-nanometer certainly enables more dense, more transistors per die. That's not what I'm talking about. That's a big driver of test in the future. That would absolutely be something that would give us a positive outlook for the next midterm. There's the chiplet thing that we talked about where you have mixed nodes going into chips, and then you need known good die testing and then the multi-packaging needs increasingly test intensity. That's not what I'm talking about. But that's real and that's there, too. The thing that I'm talking about with 3-nanometer that's unique, let's say, is the change in the transistor architecture from FinFET to gate-all-around. 
That happens once per decade. Again, it happened with FinFETs earlier in the last decade. It's happening with gate-all-around here in the next few years. Those transitions, everything else being equal, introduce additional, typically, failure modes that need more test methodologies to make sure the device is functioning correctly. And so let's say, the average test time per transistor can tend to be higher because of the additional verification needed related to that new architecture. Now early in the architecture's life, that tends to be higher. As the architecture matures over time, that premium, let's say, comes down. So -- and the world doesn't shift to 3-nanometer en masse day 1 either. 
So there's this bleeding up of certain devices using 3-nanometer that are highly test-intensive and more and more come online year after year, and then the learning curve comes on. But net-net, again, if you look at the test market from 2000 to 2012, it had been a declining market. And 2012 to now, it's been growing quite well in excess of 10%. Part of that is the parallel testing, ameliorating that we've talked about, part of it's the FinFET story that we've talked about and the growing transistor count. So we're at another one of those junctures with gate-all-around.

So even absent 3-nanometer, we have an optimistic view of what '22 looks like. 
We'll probably start out the year similar to how we started out years in the past and at the beginning of the year with some modest growth in the first quarter and then it kind of swings on what's going to happen over the summer, which is our peak quarters, around the refreshes. Will those refreshes of silicon be in 3-nanometer, will they be in 5 plus with the traditional normal transistor count growth that we've seen for the past 10 years, those are things that we have to get closer to next year to really understand."
