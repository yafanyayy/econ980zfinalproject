Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington's strategy to build the leading people-first digitally powered bank in the nation. Our 2020 results demonstrate that we're driving revenue growth despite headwinds. We're focused on acquiring new customers and deepening those relationships to gain both market share and share of wallet. We are investing in customer-centric products, services and digital technology that will drive sustainable growth and outperformance, both today and for years to come. 
Huntington operates an intentionally diversified business model, balanced between commercial and consumer, which provides a good mix of revenue and credit exposure. We've built a competitive advantage with our consistently superior customer service and our differentiated products and services. We are committed to developing best-in-class digital capabilities like our mobile banking app, which has been recognized as the highest in customer satisfaction by J.D. Power 2 years in a row. In 2020, we introduced several new innovative products and features that will continue to serve our customers' needs and differentiate Huntington from the competition. 
We are not done. We have a pipeline of innovative products and features that we will release throughout the year. We have a proven track record of solid execution, adjusting our operating plans to the environment in order to drive shareholder returns. This allowed us to deliver our eighth consecutive year of positive operating leverage in 2020. Our focused execution has and will enable us to ensure investments in the products, people and digital capabilities, which will drive sustainable long-term growth and outperformance. 
We are particularly excited about the TCF acquisition we announced last month, which provides additional scale and growth opportunities. We filed the bank regulatory applications last week and announced the planned consolidation of 198 branches. We are making good progress on our preparations for integration later this year. We remain on track with the previously announced schedule for an expected closing date late in the second quarter. 
We are pleased with our 2020 results and continued momentum across the bank despite an extraordinarily challenging operating environment. And I'm incredibly proud of the outstanding efforts of our colleagues to overcome the challenges of the pandemic as well as look out for our customers. For the year, we grew revenues 3%, loans 6% and core deposits 11%. And while bottom line results and EPS were down due to elevated provisioning required under the CECL reserve accounting, our pretax pre-provision earnings increased 4%, and these are all very strong results. 
We also closed the year with strengthening commercial loan production, as expected, in the fourth quarter. Our consumer lending businesses, specialty home lending and vehicle finance, are continuing to provide very good loan originations. Our home lending business achieved record mortgage originations for the second consecutive year. Our deposit growth parallels the entire banking system, and we do not foresee this changing anytime soon. 
Our balance sheet is very well positioned with robust capital liquidity, and our hedging strategy has reduced interest rate risk. 2020 also marked the tenth consecutive year of an increased cash dividend. Credit quality continues to improve, illustrating that our decisive and conservative actions in the second quarter appropriately identified the highest risk portions of our portfolio, allowing us to proactively work with our customers. 
As we enter 2021, I'm very encouraged not only by our momentum, but also the underlying strengths I see in our local economies. Economic data shows that our footprint is recovering more quickly than the nation as a whole, and our conversations with our customers support this. The unemployment rate in November was below the national average in 5 of our 7 states, including our largest market in Ohio at 5.7%. Over 2.9 million jobs were created in our footprint between April and November, which means 24% of the national total were created in these 7 states. Further, 44% of all manufacturing jobs created during this period occurred in our footprint states. 
The V-shaped manufacturing recovery is fueling regional economic growth, even though leading manufacturers continue to  face challenges from supply chain disruptions, skilled labor shortages and periodic plant shutdowns related to the virus. These inventory challenges are visible in the auto, RV and marine industries and inform our belief that continued low dealer floorplan utilization rates to take at least several more quarters to return to longer-term averages. 
A recovery in employment boosted both the region's consumer confidence and consumer retail spending above the respective 2020 national averages. Home prices continue to appreciate, especially with solid increases in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Indiana. The Midwest also led the country in year-over-year growth in single-family home sales in the third quarter, up 56% compared to 39% for the nation. 
Turning to our business. We're also seeing momentum. We saw an uptick in commercial loan activity late in the fourth quarter, consistent with our prior guidance. We are also seeing continued strength in consumer lending. As we enter the first quarter, our commercial pipelines also are up from a year ago. We expect consumer lending to remain strong and commercial activity to continue to improve over the course of the year. The consistently high level of execution we're seeing across our businesses, strengthening commercial loan activity and constructive economic outlook are driving our strategy to accelerate investments, leaning into the recovery to drive increasing growth over the intermediate term. It also informed our decision to pursue and ultimately enter into the TCF acquisition. 
Let me now turn it over to Zach for an overview of our financial performance."

Slides 4 and 5 provide the financial highlights for the full year 2020 and the fourth quarter, respectively. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per common share of $0.27, return on average assets was 1.",1283,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slides 4 and 5 provide the financial highlights for the full year 2020 and the fourth quarter, respectively. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per common share of $0.27, return on average assets was 1.04% and return on average tangible common equity was 13.3%. Results continue to be impacted by the elevated level of credit provision expense, although it was down meaningfully from the third quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 to review our results in a little bit more detail. Annual pretax pre-provision earnings growth was 4% for 2020. We believe this is a very solid performance in light of the low interest rate environment and the economic challenges inflicted by the pandemic, illustrating the underlying earnings power of the bank and the strategies we're executing. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Pretax pre-provision earnings increased 6% year-over-year. Total revenue increased 7% versus last year, with 81% of growth balanced between spread revenues and fee income -- sorry, $81 million of growth balance between spread revenue and fee income. Home lending was a particular bright spot in 2020, and that remained true this quarter, continuing to drive fee income growth of 10%. Our capital markets, wealth and investment management, card and payments and insurance businesses all posted continued growth in the fourth quarter. 
I should also note that deposit service charges remained below the year ago level as elevated customer deposit account balances continue to moderate the recovery of this line. Total expenses were higher by $55 million or 8% from the year ago quarter. Approximately $31 million or more than 4 percentage points of this growth was driven by increased technology investments. Another $20 million or 3 percentage points was the donation to the Columbus Foundation that we made at the year-end. The remaining percentage point was primarily the net result of several unusual items, including TCF legal costs and debt extinguishment costs. The underlying run rate of all other expenses was relatively flat. 
Turning to Slide 7. FTE net interest income increased 6% as earning asset growth more than offset year-over-year growth -- year-over-year NIM compression. As we've stated previously, our main focus is driving risk-adjusted returns and revenue growth. In order to achieve this, we've taken actions to sustain net interest income growth, some of which, as previously discussed, will also help us manage our NIM around current levels for the foreseeable future. On a linked quarter basis, the NIM decreased 2 basis points to 2.94%. As shown in the reconciliation on the right side of the slide, the linked quarter decrease primarily reflected the 3 basis point impact of a change in PPP loan terms to delay the initial repayments. This revenue recognition accounting change had not been anticipated in the original Q4 guidance. 
The other NIM drivers shown on the slide essentially offset each other to keep the NIM stable to slightly higher, consistent with the expectations we provided on last quarter's earnings call. The anticipated forgiveness of the majority of the first round of PPP loans over the next [ 2 ] quarters is expected to provide a near-term boost to net interest income and NIM on a GAAP basis during those periods from the accelerated loan fee recognition. As we have discussed previously, we're taking actions now on both sides of the balance sheet to offset the inherent pressure caused on the margin by prolonged interest rate -- low interest rate environment, managing the net interest margin near current levels on an underlying basis. 
On the earning asset side, we are optimizing our earning asset mix by emphasizing disciplined pricing as well as loan production in certain higher-yielding asset classes. We also expect to deploy an additional $2 billion of excess liquidity into securities, picking up incremental yield. Lastly, we expect to continue to reduce our funding costs, including further optimization of wholesale funding. 
Moving to Slide 8. Average earning assets increased $12 billion or 12% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by $6 billion of PPP loans and $5 billion increase in the aforementioned deposits at the Federal Reserve. Average commercial and industrial loans increased 15% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting the PPP loans. On a linked quarter basis, C&I loans increased modestly, notably benefiting from strong production in asset-based lending. In addition, we saw commercial line utilization trends stabilized and auto floorplan utilization modestly increased during the quarter.  Consumer lending continues to produce steady growth with residential mortgage, RV/Marine and indirect auto, all posting year-over-year growth.  On a linked quarter basis, average earning asset growth primarily reflected the $1 [ billion ] or 5% increase in average securities as we executed our plan to get securities back above the first quarter of 2020 quarter end level by the end of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 9, we will review the deposit growth and funding. Average core deposits increased 16% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. These increases were driven by business and commercial growth related to PPP loans and increased liquidity levels in reaction to the economic downturn. Consumer growth largely related to government stimulus and similar elevated liquidity maintenance behaviors as well as increased consumer and business banking account production with reduced account attrition. 
Slide 10 highlights the more granular trends in commercial loans, total deposits, salable mortgage originations and debit card spend as these are key indicators of behavior and economic activity among our customers. As you can see on the top left chart, after remaining relatively stable for the prior several months, commercial loan balances, excluding PPP, closed the year positively, thanks to strong production in December as expected. Even following this flurry of activity at the year-end, our pipelines today are higher than they were a year ago before the pandemic. 
As previously mentioned, expected gradual normalization of commercial utilization rates provides additional opportunity, which will help offset the near-term headwind from 2020 PPP loans as they're forgiven and repaid over the next 2 quarters. There were $225 million of PPP loans forgiven in the fourth quarter. It's still too early to have a definitive view on the new phase of PPP, but we do expect that the changes in the program that narrow the universe of small businesses eligible to participate. We expect that the ultimate size of the new PPP loan production to be smaller than the phase 1 that we achieved in 2020. 
The top right chart reflects the continued elevated deposit balances resulting from the factors I mentioned previously, providing an attractive source of liquidity. The bottom 2 charts relate to customer activity driving 2 of our key fee income lines. Mortgage banking salable originations remain historically robust, particularly when taking into account the normal seasonality decline in Q4. On the bottom right, we continue to see solid year-over-year growth in both debit card transactions and spend. Aside from the brief period of turbulence at the initial imposition of stay at home and other restrictions in Q4, in the early days of January, we've actually seen a further acceleration of debit spending driven by the recent stimulus payments that is similar to the trend we saw earlier in 2020 during the first round of stimulus. 
Slide 11 illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. The common equity Tier 1 ratio, or CET1, ended the quarter at 10%, up slightly from last quarter. The tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, ended the quarter at 7.16%, down 11 basis points sequentially. Both ratios remain within our operating guidelines, and our strong capital levels position us well to execute on our growth initiatives and adjustment opportunities. 
Let me turn it over now to Rich to cover credit. Rich?"

Before we get into the credit results for the quarter and the entire year, I wanted to reinforce the disciplined credit approach we have followed over the years that has allowed our portfolio to come through this downturn with solid performa",1015,"Thanks, Zach. Before we get into the credit results for the quarter and the entire year, I wanted to reinforce the disciplined credit approach we have followed over the years that has allowed our portfolio to come through this downturn with solid performance. This was due to the foundation we've been laying for a decade now, beginning with instilling a cohesive culture that everyone in the company owns risk. 
We reduced our commercial real estate portfolio from over 200% of capital to under 80% and curtailed CRE construction lending, such that the fourth quarter represented the lowest level of construction in terms of both absolute dollars and as a percentage of capital that we've had since the FirstMerit acquisition in 2016. We slowed leverage lending originations in 2019 and ended 2020 with leveraged loans virtually flat from year-end 2018. We transitioned our health care portfolio to diversify away from long-term care and toward publicly held products and services companies and investment-grade hospital systems, which together now make up 45% of the health care portfolio. 
On the consumer side, we brought our expertise in indirect auto to our RV/Marine business and reduced our exposure to second lien high LTV home equity. These steps and many others have fundamentally transformed the makeup of the Huntington loan portfolios since the last downturn. I'm also extremely pleased with the impact of our 2020 portfolio management activities. First, we reduced our oil and gas portfolio by $780 million or 59% since September 2019. The noncore portion of this portfolio has been reduced to just $243 million. We performed a thorough portfolio review in 2Q that resulted in a net $1.1 billion increase to our criticized loans and put heightened visibility on these and other high-impact credits. Since 2Q, we've been able to reduce our [ crip ] class by $771 million by working with our customers, while, at the same time, effectively managing risk. Finally, our total consumer and commercial delinquency numbers are better than a year ago. We managed nearly $6 billion of loans with payment deferrals, ending the year with just $217 million of loans with a remaining deferral. 
Turning now to the credit results and metrics. Slide 12 provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses from year-end 2019 to year-end 2020. You can see our ACL now represents 2.29% of loans. The fourth quarter allowance represents a modest $12 million reserve release from the third quarter. Like the previous quarters in 2020, there are multiple data points used to size the provision expense for the fourth quarter. The primary economic scenario within our loss estimation process was the November baseline forecast. This scenario was much improved from the August baseline forecast we used in 3Q and assumes unemployment in 2020 ending the year at 7.2% and increasing to 7.5% for the first 3 quarters of 2021 to average 7.4% for the entire year. 2020 GDP ends the full year down 3.6% and demonstrates 4.1% growth for all of 2021, with that growth peaking at 5.8% in the fourth quarter. 
While a number of variables within the baseline economic scenario have improved, as have many of our credit metrics for the quarter, there were still many uncertainties to deal with at December 31, the impact of the COVID resurgence we face today, a smaller-than-expected economic stimulus package and ongoing model challenges related to COVID economic forecasting. We believe maintaining coverage ratios consistent with the third quarter is prudent when considering these factors. 
Slide 13 shows our NPAs and TDRs and demonstrates the continued but more limited impact that our oil and gas portfolio has on our overall level of NPAs. We expect modest oil and gas credit impacts as we head into 2021. So this will be the last time we break out this portfolio within our overall credit results. In Q4, we had 4 new NPAs over $5 million and just 1 over $15 million, all COVID related. 3 of these customers are in Michigan, where the COVID restrictions have impacted their ability to reopen. As we signaled, we also saw an increase in NPAs from our business banking portfolio. These credits were granular with only 7 exposures over $1 million. Despite this, total NPAs were reduced from the third quarter by $39 million or 6% and down from the second quarter peak by $150 million or 21%. 
Slide 14 provides additional details around the financial accommodations we provided our commercial and consumer customers. As we forecasted on our third quarter call, the commercial deferrals have dropped significantly and now total just $151 million, down from $942 million in Q3 and $5 billion at Q2. We expect to have limited commercial deferral balances beyond SBA going forward. Commercial delinquencies are very modest at just 15 basis points. 
Our consumer deferrals have largely run their course as well, down to just $66 million as of December, with post-deferral performance in line with our expectations across all the portfolio segments. Our deferrals in auto, RV/Marine and home equity have nearly all lapsed, and we are managing these portfolios consistent with our pre-pandemic strategies. We expect the remaining mortgage referrals will continue to work their way down to a de minimis level over the next quarter. 
Slide 15 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our credit performance overall was solid. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 55 basis points of average loans and leases. I'm pleased to report our level of criticized loans was reduced by over $340 million or 11% in Q4, which is on top of the $425 million or 12% reduction we saw in the third quarter. Our active portfolio management process enabled us to identify potential problems early. Working with our customers, we continue to proactively remedy a number of these loans. I would also add, our nonperforming asset ratio decreased 5 basis points linked quarter to 69 basis points, our second consecutive quarterly decline in NPAs. As always, we've provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides. 
Let me turn it back over to Zach."

Before we get to expectations, I want to spend a minute on our ongoing technology investments and progress on digital engagement. Looking at slides 16 and 17, you can see a few select illustrations of our continued progress on digital capabilities. In 2020, for example, we significantly expanded our new product origination capabilities to mortgage, home equity, business checking and savings and small business lending. 
You can also see continued growth in digital engagement and usage levels in consumer and business banking. As we've noted, we're investing in clearly defined digital development road maps across all our major business lines that will help us drive momentum, delivering differentiated products and features that will drive new customer acquisition, relationship deepening with existing customers and servicing efficiencies, both internally and for our customers. 
Finally, before we get to your questions, let's discuss Huntington's expectations for the full year 2021 on a stand-alone basis, excluding TCF, as shown on Slide 18. Looking at the average balance sheet for the full year '21, we expect average loans to increase between 2% and 4%, reflecting modestly higher commercial loans, inclusive of PPP, and mid-single-digit growth in consumer loans. Excluding PPP, we would expect to see mid-single-digit growth in both categories. As the economy -- economic recovery progresses, we expect continued acceleration of loan growth over the course of the year. With respect to deposits, we expect average balance sheet growth of 5% to 7% due to the elevated levels of commercial and consumer core deposits, which we expect to persist for several more quarters. 
Compared to the fourth quarter average balances, we expect modest deposit growth, primarily among consumers, during the first half of the year before stabilizing in the second half. We expect to post full year total revenue growth of approximately 1% to 3% and full year total expense growth of 3% to 5%. With respect to revenues, we expect net interest income to be flat to modestly higher, driven by average earning asset growth and a relatively stable NIM compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 level. This guidance assumes the positive impact from the acceleration of PPP fees in the first half of the year, before settling back down in the second half. However, noninterest income is expected to be flat to modestly lower due to the challenging mortgage banking comparisons, partially offset by continued growth in capital markets, carbon payments and our wealth and investment management business lines. 
The current economic outlook presents compelling opportunities to invest in our businesses to meaningfully gain share and accelerate growth over the moderate term, and we intend to capitalize on that. Expense growth in 2021 is expected to be driven by our ongoing strategic investments in digital and technology development, marketing and select personnel ads directly related to our strategic initiatives. The remaining underlying run rate of noninvestment expenses is essentially flat. The investments we're making are heavily front-end loaded, resulting in notably higher year-over-year expense growth rates in the first half of the year. While expense growth is expected to outstrip revenue growth over the near term, our commitment around positive operating leverage remains over the long term. Our expectation is to bring the expense run rate to a level that is lower than the growth rate of revenue during the second half of 2021. 
Finally, our credit remains fundamentally sound. We expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to be around the middle of our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points with potential for some moderate quarterly volatility. Reserve releases remain dependent upon economic recovery and related credit performance. As a reminder, all expectations are standalone for Huntington and do not include consideration made for the recently announced acquisition of TCF.

And so as we look at not only with the economic forecast we're saying, but some of the more qualitative and subjective assessments that we make as part of our process, most COVID related, we didn't feel that there was enough certainty in those forecasts to rely solely on those. And so there was a fair amount of qualitative judgment that we put into the process, like we do every quarter to land at the [ 2 29 ]. I mean the stimulus is still up in the air. All those other types of things, we just thought it was premature to have a significant release. Keep in mind, too, that we also had loan growth in the fourth quarter.

And we have a very large in-store partnership with Meyer and Giant Eagle. But as a result of the combination with first -- with TCF in Michigan, we've been in a position where we're going to be consolidating 198 branches, very substantially in Michigan.

And so store traffic, while the volumes are up and revenues are up, traffic is down in preference for doing banking activities in the in stores is changing a bit. Now having said that, we see very, very strong performance in the TCF in-stores, which are in even denser metropolitan areas than we have with our 2 partners. So we've liked the channel over time and continue to like aspects of it, and we're committed to going forward to Giant Eagle for the next several years, and then we'll assess the TCF partners as we move forward. But again, they're roughly 2.5, 3x the average size of Huntington in-store branches. They've been at it a very long time. They have very patterned behavior. So I suspect we're going to like what we see as we get further along with it."

So in Q4, as I mentioned in my script, we brought the securities portfolio back up to Q1 levels. From endpoint to endpoint, Q3 to Q4, to give you a sense, it was about $2 billion of additional securities on a net basis. And the average yield we were getting on that was [ 1 25 ], to give you a sense. Portfolio was running at [ 1 87 ]. So -- but it's still pretty solid yield. And the mix is pretty similar to what we've invested in the past, mainly mortgage backs. As we go into 2021, one important thing that I also said in my prepared remarks but I would highlight now is that we are intending to invest an additional $2 billion, mostly in the first quarter, to bring the overall securities portfolio up to $24 billion as a result of just continuing to monitor and watch the excess liquidity levels and optimize the balance sheet. 
Likewise, those purchases are expected to be in the mortgage-backed securities structures, most notably with a range of yields that we're forecasting sort between [ 1 20 ], [ 1 30 ]. So pretty similar. As we go forward, we're watching pretty closely any new rounds of stimulus, and certainly, the latest round of PPP, which could cause us to increase that goal over time. We'll have to see where those land. But that's kind of where we're running with those. I'll pause for a second and then move on to the other element you -- or [indiscernible] the question you asked in terms of what assets we're looking at. Just taking a step back, on our balance sheet optimization program, we are very confident in it. We're already starting to see the traction of it. And it's split about half and half from funding optimization and that asset growth mix optimization. And when you think about the asset growth mix optimization, it's really focused on higher-yielding products like small business administration production, where we're, as you know, the nation's leading producer. And also commercial categories like equipment finance, asset-based lending. Those are really the biggest focus areas that I would call out for you as a headline."

It's not where -- it's not normalized, and it will probably be several quarters before it becomes normalized. So all of that's to say that there's a tailwind building for the industry.

There will -- there's a lot of investment activity that's going on, and they're using their cash.

If we think back to just the second quarter and the free fall in GDP, to be able to substantially reverse that in just a couple of quarters is remarkable, unlike anything we've seen in our history. And I think that flows then through the system with lower cum losses over time. I think we've been conservative, maybe very conservative in our loss recognition thus far.

We have a lot of broad-based home lending capabilities and investments in technology in that area as well, which will continue to drive more volume. We have substantial implementation of Blend, for example, that has been ramped up very quickly and will be an important -- a very important app for us as we go forward.

So mortgage banking, as we said, coming off just an incredible year in 2020. To give you a sense, the industry, Mortgage Banking Association is forecasting volumes in 2020 down about 23% with a shift toward purchase, not surprisingly, with refis being very substantially lower. Our -- we've actually been gaining share on app volumes over the last several years, and we expect to continue to do so. So our general expectation for app volume is sort of down in the 10% to 15% range relative to that 20% or more down at an industry level. I think one of the things we're watching pretty closely is also the salable spread and where that trends. We, frankly, budgeted pretty conservatively on that, assuming a relatively continual trend back to more historical levels by the end of the year. We'll see. So far, they're actually holding up fairly solid in the first days of Q1, and we'll see. Those are volatile, as you know. But generally, we've budgeted fairly conservatively. So I think mortgage banking income is going to be down year-on-year.

I think I was a bit brusque with an answer to a question you had last time. So apologies for that. But picking up on TCF, we haven't talked a lot about revenue synergies, but they are clearly there. We have a much broader product venue on both the consumer and business side. So the capacity to cross-sell and deepen, much like we saw with FirstMerit, is very substantial. And it's hard to bake that in, and certainly, not something you guys want to hear. So we haven't front run that with you. But that is definitely a case. We've been very impressed with the quality of the teams that we've seen in a variety of the areas in TCF, both business line and technology and some of the support areas, for example. And so I think we will be a stronger company by the blend as well, and that will have upside. Then finally, they do some things extraordinarily well. Their equipment finance business, their inventory finance business, these are little gems. And they're not widely known or appreciated, but we really liked what we saw in diligence and have learned subsequently. And those are just a few of the businesses and opportunities. There's a substantial outsourcing as well, both on the capital markets side for most products. And again, it's a much more limited menu that we offer as well as their broker-dealers, their credit card. There's a variety of businesses that we'll bring back in fairly quickly as we move forward. So there's the 40% expense, and we just articulated a 43% branch consolidation. So you can see where that's coming from. It will be their systems to ours, 100%. So we've got a lot of early on, very, very good work that's getting us bullish on the expense side. But the play here is a revenue play. New markets, exciting new markets, Minneapolis, St. Paul; Denver, Colorado springs; more than tripling us in Chicago; opening in Milwaukee; and Soltan Valley. I mean there's a lot to go for, plus the scale change in Michigan, we'll be a 1 or 2 and virtually everything in Michigan. So we really like the revenue side of this, and you'll see that reflected in '22 and beyond as we get set."

Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington's strategy to build the leading people-first digitally powered bank in the nation. Our 2020 results demonstrate that we're driving revenue growth despite headwinds. We're focused on acquiring new customers and deepening those relationships to gain both market share and share of wallet. We are investing in customer-centric products, services and digital technology that will drive sustainable growth and outperformance, both today and for years to come. 
 
Huntington operates an intentionally diversified business model, balanced between commercial and consumer, which provides a good mix of revenue and credit exposure. We've built a competitive advantage with our consistently superior customer service and our differentiated products and services. We are committed to developing best-in-class digital capabilities like our mobile banking app, which has been recognized as the highest in customer satisfaction by J.D. Power 2 years in a row. In 2020, we introduced several new innovative products and features that will continue to serve our customers' needs and differentiate Huntington from the competition.  
We are not done. We have a pipeline of innovative products and features that we will release throughout the year. We have a proven track record of solid execution, adjusting our operating plans to the environment in order to drive shareholder returns. This allowed us to deliver our eighth consecutive year of positive operating leverage in 2020. Our focused execution has and will enable us to ensure investments in the products, people and digital capabilities, which will drive sustainable long-term growth and outperformance.  
We are particularly excited about the TCF acquisition we announced last month, which provides additional scale and growth opportunities. We filed the bank regulatory applications last week and announced the planned consolidation of 198 branches. We are making good progress on our preparations for integration later this year. We remain on track with the previously announced schedule for an expected closing date late in the second quarter.  
We are pleased with our 2020 results and continued momentum across the bank despite an extraordinarily challenging operating environment. And I'm incredibly proud of the outstanding efforts of our colleagues to overcome the challenges of the pandemic as well as lookout for our customers. For the year, we grew revenues 3%, loans 6% and core deposits 11%, while bottom line results and EPS were down due to elevated provisioning required under the CECL reserve accounting, our pretax pre-provision earnings increased 4%, and these are all very strong results.  
We also closed the year with strengthening commercial loan production, as expected, in the fourth quarter. Our consumer lending businesses, specialty home lending and vehicle finance, are continuing to provide very good loan originations. Our home lending business achieved record mortgage originations for the second consecutive year. Our deposit growth parallels the entire banking system, and we do not foresee this changing anytime soon.  
Our balance sheet is very well positioned with robust capital liquidity, and our hedging strategy has reduced interest rate risk. 2020 also marked the tenth consecutive year of an increased cash dividend. Credit quality continues to improve, illustrating that our decisive and conservative actions in the second quarter appropriately identified the highest risk portions of our portfolio, allowing us to proactively work with our customers.  
As we enter 2021, I'm very encouraged not only by our momentum, but also the underlying strengths I see in our local economies. Economic data shows that our footprint is recovering more quickly than the nation as a whole, and our conversations with our customers support this. The unemployment rate in November was below the national average in 5 of our 7 states, including our largest market in Ohio at 5.7%. Over 2.9 million jobs were created in our footprint between April and November, which means 24% of the national total were created in these 7 states. Further, 44% of all manufacturing jobs created during this period occurred in our footprint states.  
The V-shaped manufacturing recovery is fueling regional economic growth, even though many manufacturers continue to face challenges from supply chain disruptions, skilled labor shortages and periodic plant shutdowns related to the virus. These inventory challenges are visible in the auto, RV and marine industries and inform our belief that continued low dealer floorplan utilization rates to take at least several more quarters to return to longer-term averages.  
A recovery in employment boosted both the region's consumer confidence and consumer retail spending above the respective 2020 national averages. Home prices continue to appreciate, especially with solid increases in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Indiana. The Midwest also led the country in year-over-year growth in single-family home sales in the third quarter, up 56% compared to 39% for the nation.  
Turning to our business. We're also seeing momentum. We saw an uptick in commercial loan activity late in the fourth quarter, consistent with our prior guidance. We are also seeing continued strength in consumer lending. As we enter the first quarter, our commercial pipelines also are up from a year ago. We expect consumer lending to remain strong and commercial activity to continue to improve over the course of the year. The consistently high level of execution we're seeing across our businesses, strengthening commercial loan activity and constructive economic outlook are driving our strategy to accelerate investments, leaning into the recovery to drive increasing growth over the intermediate term. It also informed our decision to pursue and ultimately enter into the TCF acquisition.  
Let me now turn it over to Zach for an overview of our financial performance."

Slides 4 and 5 provide the financial highlights for the full year 2020 and the fourth quarter, respectively. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per common share of $0.27, return on average assets was 1.",1280,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slides 4 and 5 provide the financial highlights for the full year 2020 and the fourth quarter, respectively. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per common share of $0.27, return on average assets was 1.04% and return on average tangible common equity was 13.3%. Results continue to be impacted by the elevated level of credit provision expense, although it was down meaningfully from the third quarter.  
Now let's turn to Slide 6 to review our results in a little bit more detail. Annual pretax pre-provision earnings growth was 4% for 2020. We believe this is a very solid performance in light of the low interest rate environment and the economic challenges inflicted by the pandemic, illustrating the underlying earnings power of the bank and the strategies we're executing.  
Turning to the fourth quarter. Pretax pre-provision earnings increased 6% year-over-year. Total revenue increased 7% versus last year, with 81% of growth balanced between spread revenues and fee income -- sorry, $81 million of growth balance between spread revenue and fee income. Home lending was a particular bright spot in 2020, and that remained true this quarter, continuing to drive fee income growth of 10%. Our capital markets, wealth and investment management, card and payments and insurance businesses all posted continued growth in the fourth quarter.  
I should also note that deposit service charges remained below the year ago level as elevated customer deposit account balances continue to moderate the recovery of this line. Total expenses were higher by $55 million or 8% from the year ago quarter. Approximately $31 million or more than 4 percentage points of this growth was driven by increased technology investments. Another $20 million or 3 percentage points was the donation to the Columbus Foundation that we made at the year-end. The remaining percentage point was primarily the net result of several unusual items, including TCF legal costs and debt extinguishment costs. The underlying run rate of all other expenses was relatively flat.  
Turning to Slide 7. FTE net interest income increased 6% as earning asset growth more than offset year-over-year growth -- year-over-year NIM compression. As we've stated previously, our main focus is driving risk-adjusted returns and revenue growth. In order to achieve this, we've taken actions to sustain net interest income growth, some of which, as previously discussed, will also help us manage our NIM around current levels for the foreseeable future. On a linked quarter basis, the NIM decreased 2 basis points to 2.94%. As shown in the reconciliation on the right side of the slide, the linked quarter decrease primarily reflected the 3 basis point impact of a change in PPP loan terms to delay the initial repayments. This revenue recognition accounting change had not been anticipated in the original Q4 guidance.  
The other NIM drivers shown on the slide essentially offset each other to keep the NIM stable to slightly higher, consistent with the expectations we provided on last quarter's earnings call. The anticipated forgiveness of the majority of the first round of PPP loans over the next 2 quarters is expected to provide a near-term boost to net interest income and NIM on a GAAP basis during those periods from the accelerated loan fee recognition. As we have discussed previously, we're taking actions now on both sides of the balance sheet to offset the inherent pressure caused on the margin by prolonged interest rate -- low interest rate environment, managing the net interest margin near current levels on an underlying basis.  
On the earning asset side, we are optimizing our earning asset mix by emphasizing disciplined pricing as well as loan production in certain higher-yielding asset classes. We also expect to deploy an additional $2 billion of excess liquidity into securities, picking up incremental yield. Lastly, we expect to continue to reduce our funding costs, including further optimization of wholesale funding.  
Moving to Slide 8. Average earning assets increased $12 billion or 12% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by $6 billion of PPP loans and $5 billion increase in the aforementioned deposits at the Federal Reserve. Average commercial and industrial loans increased 15% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting the PPP loans. On a linked quarter basis, C&I loans increased modestly, notably benefiting from strong production in asset-based lending. In addition, we saw commercial line utilization trends stabilized and auto floorplan utilization modestly increased during the quarter. Consumer lending continues to produce steady growth with residential mortgage, RV/Marine and indirect auto, all posting year-over-year growth.  
On a linked quarter basis, average earning asset growth primarily reflected the $1 billion or 5% increase in average securities as we executed our plan to get securities back above the first quarter of 2020 quarter end level by the end of 2020.  
Turning to Slide 9, we will review the deposit growth and funding. Average core deposits increased 16% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. These increases were driven by business and commercial growth related to PPP loans and increased liquidity levels in reaction to the economic downturn. Consumer growth largely related to government stimulus and similar elevated liquidity maintenance behaviors as well as increased consumer and business banking account production with reduced account attrition.  
Slide 10 highlights the more granular trends in commercial loans, total deposits, salable mortgage originations and debit card spend as these are key indicators of behavior and economic activity among our customers. As you can see on the top left chart, after remaining relatively stable for the prior several months, commercial loan balances, excluding PPP, closed the year positively, thanks to strong production in December as expected. Even following this flurry of activity at the year-end, our pipelines today are higher than they were a year ago before the pandemic.  
As previously mentioned, expected gradual normalization of commercial utilization rates provides additional opportunity, which will help offset in the near-term headwind from 2020 PPP loans as they're forgiven and repaid over the next 2 quarters. There were $225 million of PPP loans forgiven in the fourth quarter. It's still too early to have a definitive view on the new phase of PPP, but we do expect that the changes in the program that narrow the universe of small businesses eligible to participate. We expect that the ultimate size of the new PPP loan production to be smaller than the phase 1 that we achieved in 2020.  
The top right chart reflects the continued elevated deposit balances resulting from the factors I mentioned previously, providing an attractive source of liquidity. The bottom 2 charts relate to customer activity driving 2 of our key fee income lines. Mortgage banking salable originations remain historically robust, particularly when taking into account the normal seasonality decline in Q4. On the bottom right, we continue to see solid year-over-year growth in both debit card transactions and spend. Aside from the brief period of turbulence at the initial imposition of stay at home and other restrictions in Q4, in the early days of January, we've actually seen a further acceleration of debit spending driven by the recent stimulus payments that is similar to the trend we saw earlier in 2020 during the first round of stimulus.  
Slide 11 illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. The common equity Tier 1 ratio, or CET1, ended the quarter at 10%, up slightly from last quarter. The tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, ended the quarter at 7.16%, down 11 basis points sequentially. Both ratios remain within our operating guidelines, and our strong capital levels position us well to execute on our growth initiatives and adjustment opportunities.  
Let me turn it over now to Rich to cover credit. Rich?"

Before we get into the credit results for the quarter and the entire year, I wanted to reinforce the disciplined credit approach we have followed over the years that has allowed our portfolio to come through this downturn with solid performa",1016,"Thanks, Zach. Before we get into the credit results for the quarter and the entire year, I wanted to reinforce the disciplined credit approach we have followed over the years that has allowed our portfolio to come through this downturn with solid performance. This was due to the foundation we've been laying for a decade now, beginning with instilling a cohesive culture that everyone in the company owns risk.  
We reduced our commercial real estate portfolio from over 200% of capital to under 80% and curtailed CRE construction lending, such that the fourth quarter represented the lowest level of construction in terms of both absolute dollars and as a percentage of capital that we've had since the FirstMerit acquisition in 2016. We slowed leverage lending originations in 2019 and ended 2020 with leveraged loans virtually flat from year-end 2018. We transitioned our health care portfolio to diversify away from long-term care and toward publicly held products and services companies and investment-grade hospital systems, which together now make up 45% of the health care portfolio.  
On the consumer side, we brought our expertise in indirect auto to our RV/Marine business and reduced our exposure to second lien-high LTV home equity. These steps and many others have fundamentally transformed the makeup of the Huntington loan portfolios since the last downturn. I'm also extremely pleased with the impact of our 2020 portfolio management activities. First, we reduced our oil and gas portfolio by $780 million or 59% since September 2019. The noncore portion of this portfolio has been reduced to just $243 million. We performed a thorough portfolio review in 2Q that resulted in a net $1.1 billion increase to our criticized loans and put heightened visibility on these and other high-impact credits. Since 2Q, we've been able to reduce our [ crip ] class crit/class by $771 million by working with our customers, while, at the same time, effectively managing risk. 
Finally, our total consumer and commercial delinquency numbers are better than a year ago. We managed nearly $6 billion of loans with payment deferrals, ending the year with just $217 million of loans with a remaining deferral. 
Turning now to the credit results and metrics. Slide 12 provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses from year-end 2019 to year-end 2020. You can see our ACL now represents 2.29% of loans. The fourth quarter allowance represents a modest $12 million reserve release from the third quarter. Like the previous quarters in 2020, there are multiple data points used to size the provision expense for the fourth quarter. The primary economic scenario within our loss estimation process was the November baseline forecast. This scenario was much improved from the August baseline forecast we used in 3Q and assumes unemployment in 2020 ending the year at 7.2% and increasing to 7.5% for the first 3 quarters of 2021 to average 7.4% for the entire year. 2020 GDP ends the full year down 3.6% and demonstrates 4.1% growth for all of 2021, with that growth peaking at 5.8% in the fourth quarter.  
While a number of variables within the baseline economic scenario have improved, as have many of our credit metrics for the quarter, there were still many uncertainties to deal with at December 31. The impact of the COVID resurgence we face today, a smaller-than-expected economic stimulus package and ongoing model challenges related to COVID economic forecasting. We believe maintaining coverage ratios consistent with the third quarter is prudent when considering these factors.  
Slide 13 shows our NPAs and TDRs and demonstrates the continued but more limited impact that our oil and gas portfolio has on our overall level of NPAs. We expect modest oil and gas credit impacts as we head into 2021. So this will be the last time we break out this portfolio within our overall credit results. In Q4, we had 4 new NPAs over $5 million and just 1 over $15 million, all COVID related. 3 of these customers are in Michigan, where the COVID restrictions have impacted their ability to reopen. As we signaled, we also saw an increase in NPAs from our business banking portfolio. These credits were granular with only 7 exposures over $1 million. Despite this, total NPAs were reduced from the third quarter by $39 million or 6% and down from the second quarter peak by $150 million or 21%.  
Slide 14 provides additional details around the financial accommodations we provided to our commercial and consumer customers. As we forecasted on our third quarter call, the commercial deferrals have dropped significantly and now total just $151 million, down from $942 million in Q3 and $5 billion at Q2. We expect to have limited commercial deferral balances beyond SBA going forward. Commercial delinquencies are very modest at just 15 basis points.  
Our consumer deferrals have largely run their course as well, down to just $66 million as of December, with post-deferral performance in line with our expectations across all the portfolio segments. Our deferrals in auto, RV/Marine and home equity have nearly all lapsed, and we are managing these portfolios consistent with our pre-pandemic strategies. We expect the remaining mortgage deferrals will continue to work their way down to a de minimis level over the next quarter.  
Slide 15 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our credit performance overall was solid. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 55 basis points of average loans and leases. I'm pleased to report our level of criticized loans was reduced by over $340 million or 11% in Q4, which is on top of the $425 million or 12% reduction we saw in the third quarter. Our active portfolio management process enabled us to identify potential problems early. Working with our customers, we continue to proactively remedy a number of these loans. I would also add, our nonperforming asset ratio decreased 5 basis points linked quarter to 69 basis points, our second consecutive quarterly decline in NPAs. As always, we've provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides.  
Let me turn it back over to Zach."

Before we get to expectations, I want to spend a minute on our ongoing technology investments and progress on digital engagement. Looking at slides 16 and 17, you can see a few select illustrations of our continued progress on digital capabilities. In 2020, for example, we significantly expanded our new product origination capabilities to mortgage, home equity, business checking and savings and small business lending.  
You can also see continued growth in digital engagement and usage levels in consumer and business banking. As we've noted, we're investing in clearly defined digital development road maps across all our major business lines that will help us drive momentum, delivering differentiated products and features that will drive new customer acquisition, relationship deepening with existing customers and servicing efficiencies, both internally and for our customers.  
Finally, before we get to your questions, let's discuss Huntington's expectations for the full year 2021 on a stand-alone basis, excluding TCF, as shown on Slide 18. Looking at the average balance sheet for the full year '21, we expect average loans to increase between 2% and 4%, reflecting modestly higher commercial loans, inclusive of PPP, and mid-single-digit growth in consumer loans. Excluding PPP, we would expect to see mid-single-digit growth in both categories. As the economy -- economic recovery progresses, we expect continued acceleration of loan growth over the course of the year. With respect to deposits, we expect average balance sheet growth of 5% to 7% due to the elevated levels of commercial and consumer core deposits, which we expect to persist for several more quarters.  
Compared to the fourth quarter average balances, we expect modest deposit growth, primarily among consumers, during the first half of the year before stabilizing in the second half. We expect to post full year total revenue growth of approximately 1% to 3% and full year total expense growth of 3% to 5%. With respect to revenues, we expect net interest income to be flat to modestly higher, driven by average earning asset growth and a relatively stable NIM compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 level. This guidance assumes the positive impact from the acceleration of PPP fees in the first half of the year, before settling back down in the second half. However, noninterest income is expected to be flat to modestly lower due to the challenging mortgage banking comparisons, partially offset by continued growth in capital markets, carbon payments and our wealth and investment management business lines.  
The current economic outlook presents compelling opportunities to invest in our businesses to meaningfully gain share and accelerate growth over the moderate term, and we intend to capitalize on that. Expense growth in 2021 is expected to be driven by our ongoing strategic investments in digital and technology development, marketing and select personnel ads directly related to our strategic initiatives. The remaining underlying run rate of noninvestment expenses is essentially flat. The investments we're making are heavily front-end loaded, resulting in notably higher year-over-year expense growth rates in the first half of the year. While expense growth is expected to outstrip revenue growth over the near term, our commitment around positive operating leverage remains over the long term. Our expectation is to bring the expense run rate to a level that is lower than the growth rate of revenue during the second half of 2021.  
Finally, our credit remains fundamentally sound. We expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to be around the middle of our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points with potential for some moderate quarterly volatility. Reserve releases remain dependent upon economic recovery and related credit performance. As a reminder, all expectations are standalone for Huntington and do not include consideration made for the recently announced acquisition of TCF.

And so as we look at not only with the economic forecast we're seeing, but some of the more qualitative and subjective assessments that we make as part of our process, most COVID related, we didn't feel that there was enough certainty in those forecasts to rely solely on those. And so there was a fair amount of qualitative judgment that we put into the process, like we do every quarter to land the 2.29%. I mean the stimulus is still up in the air. All those other types of things, we just thought it was premature to have a significant release. Keep in mind, too, that we also had loan growth in the fourth quarter. So about $10 million of our provision expense was driven by loan growth."

The -- we've been well served by the in-store branches in the past. And you'll remember, we went into those almost a decade ago. But last week, we announced -- last week, we filed our Federal Reserve and OCC applications. So it's Monday a week ago. And in those apps, we announced the consolidation of branches. And we have a very large in-store partnership with Meijer and Giant Eagle. But as a result of the combination with first -- with TCF in Michigan, we've been in a position where we're going to be consolidating 198 branches, very substantially in Michigan. And that will allow us to cycle out of the in-store branches that we have with Meijer, which we've explained to the company. Just excess distribution with nearly 500 points of distribution in the state of Michigan as a consequence of the combination. So we are adjusting that partnership. There are other things we will look forward to doing with that and some -- a few ideas on the drawing board as well. 
With Giant Eagle, we have consolidated a number of branches over the last year. There's the potential to further consolidate around in-store to traditional as we go forward. We do think the -- we've been well served by the nature of the economics around the in-store branches, but there is a changing distribution, frankly, a thinning of distribution as we move forward. And as we've seen over the past year with the pandemic, more and more home goods delivered, including groceries. And so store traffic, while the volumes are up, the revenues are up, traffic is down and preference for doing banking activities in the in-stores is changing a bit. Now having said that, we see very, very strong performance in the TCF in-stores, which are in even denser metropolitan areas than we have with our 2 partners. So we've liked the channel over time and continue to like aspects of it, and we're committed to, going forward, to Giant Eagle for the next several years, and then we'll assess the TCF partners as we move forward. 
But again, they're roughly 2.5, 3x the average size of Huntington in-store branches. They've been at it a very long time. They have very patterned behavior. So I suspect we're going to like what we see as we get further along with it."

As we go into 2021, one important thing that I also said in my prepared remarks but I would highlight now is that we are intending to invest an additional $2 billion, mostly in the first quarter, to bring the overall securities portfolio up to $24 billion as a result of just continuing to monitor and watch the excess liquidity levels and optimize the balance sheet.  
Likewise, those purchases are expected to be in the mortgage-backed securities structures, most notably with a range of yields that we're forecasting sort between 1.20%, 1.30%. So pretty similar. As we go forward, we're watching pretty closely any new rounds of stimulus, and certainly, the latest round of PPP, which could cause us to increase that goal over time. We'll have to see where those land. But that's kind of where we're running with those. I'll pause for a second and then move on to the other element you -- other aspect of the question you asked in terms of what assets we're looking at. 
Just taking a step back, on our balance sheet optimization program, we are very confident in it. We're already starting to see the traction of it. And it's split about half and half from funding optimization and that asset growth mix optimization. And when you think about the asset growth mix optimization, it's really focused on higher-yielding products like small business administration production, where we're, as you know, the nation's leading producer. And also commercial categories like equipment finance, asset-based lending. Those are really the biggest focus areas that I would call out for you as a headline."

We do see supply chain disruption also impacting utilization. It's very clearly happening in the dealer floorplan side, for example, notwithstanding, it's -- it improved a bit in the fourth quarter. It's not where -- it's not normalized, and it will probably be several quarters before it becomes normalized. So all of that's to say that there's a tailwind building for the industry. And we may see it in the second half of this year, which is, I think, consistent with how many banks are expressing, both GDP growth and optimism as well as the potential for utilization. There will -- there's a lot of investment activity that's going on, and they're using their cash.

To give you a sense, in Q4, it was around $5 billion, and we expect to sort of maintain that rough level through the first half of the year. And then kind of absent the new stimulus and absent the new PPP, our operating outlook had been for sort of a gradual reduction in that toward the back half of the year, but not that substantial, maybe down to $3 billion by the end of the year in terms of billion. I think the -- with that being said, we'll see about any new stimulus coming through on the fiscal side. And likely, if that does happen, we'll see that be elevated even more. And it could, as I mentioned, give an opportunity to invest more in securities. 
And likewise, PPP, the next round of PPP is just now kicking off. We're not sure exactly where it's going to land. We'll see. For my guidance, I've assumed around $1 billion, but I'm hopeful and it's quite likely that it could be potentially up to double that. We'll see.

But it seems to me that the proactive efforts by both the Federal Reserve and the -- via fiscal -- multiple rounds of fiscal stimulus that substantial losses have been likely avoided as support has been delivered to consumers and small business and the interest rate levels at historic lows have helped businesses generally. So I think history will show that very strong actions have mitigated what otherwise could have been a very ugly period in our economic history. If we think back to just the second quarter and the free fall in GDP, to be able to substantially reverse that in just a couple of quarters is remarkable, unlike anything we've seen in our history. And I think that flows then through the system with lower cum losses over time. I think we've been conservative, may be very conservative in our loss recognition thus far. 
But we've tried to maintain that to -- that posture, as you saw with how we approach provision in the fourth quarter, just to let this season and get to a high level of confidence before we do things with lowering reserves in total or things like that.

I think we're taking about 10 days off at the close as a result of using that as an example."

So mortgage banking, as we said, coming off just an incredible year in 2020. To give you a sense, the industry, Mortgage Banking Association is forecasting volumes in 2020 down about 23% with a shift toward purchase, not surprisingly, with refis being very substantially lower. Our -- we've actually been gaining share on app volumes over the last several years, and we expect to continue to do so. So our general expectation for app volume is sort of down in the 10% to 15% range relative to that 20% or more down at an industry level. 
I think one of the things we're watching pretty closely is also the salable spread and where that trends. We, frankly, budgeted pretty conservatively on that, assuming a relatively continual trend back to more historical levels by the end of the year. We'll see. So far, they're actually holding up fairly solid in the first days of Q1, and we'll see. Those are volatile, as you know. But generally, we've budgeted fairly conservatively. So I think mortgage banking income is going to be down year-on-year. And so that's what I said, as I mentioned, really leaning into the other fee income lines that are growing smartly to offset that."

I think I was a bit brusque with an answer to a question you had last time. So apologies for that. But picking up on TCF, we haven't talked a lot about revenue synergies, but they are clearly there. We have a much broader product venue on both the consumer and business side. So the capacity to cross-sell and deepen, much like we saw with FirstMerit, is very substantial. And it's hard to bake that in, and certainly, not something you guys want to hear. So we haven't front-run that with you. But that is definitely a case. 
We've been very impressed with the quality of the teams that we've seen in a variety of the areas in TCF, both business line and technology and some of the support areas, for example. And so I think we will be a stronger company by the blend as well, and that will have upside. Then finally, they do some things extraordinarily well. Their equipment finance business, their inventory finance business, these are little gems. And they're not widely known or appreciated, but we really liked what we saw in diligence and have learned subsequently. And those are just a few of the businesses and opportunities. 
There's a substantial outsourcing as well, both on the capital markets side for most products. And again, it's a much more limited menu that we offer as well as their broker-dealers, their credit card. There's a variety of businesses that we'll bring back in fairly quickly as we move forward. So there's the 40% expense, and we just articulated a 43% branch consolidation. So you can see where that's coming from. It will be their systems to ours, 100%. So we've got a lot of early on, very, very good work that's getting us bullish on the expense side. But the play here is a revenue play. New markets, exciting new markets, Minneapolis, St. Paul; Denver, Colorado Springs; more than tripling us in Chicago; opening in Milwaukee; and Silicon Valley. I mean there's a lot to go for, plus the scale change in Michigan, we'll be a 1 or 2 and virtually everything in Michigan. So we really like the revenue side of this, and you'll see that reflected in '22 and beyond as we get set."

Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington's strategy to build a leading people first digitally powered bank in the nation. We continue to execute against this strategic vision and are pleased with our progress to date. We see significant opportunities ahead of us as we position our businesses for the recovery at hand. Over the past year, we updated our multiyear strategic plan with a focus on driving long-term revenue growth, continuing to build our brand based on best-in-class products and increasing our industry-leading customer satisfaction across our businesses. We also announced the planned acquisition of TCF Financial, which will provide powerful opportunities to grow revenue, expand our market presence and provide scale to our businesses, while increasing our investments in digital and other areas. 
This combination will increase our capacity to invest, and we will become more efficient with the significant expected expense takeouts. We accelerated our digital investments as part of our strategic vision and are encouraged by the digital adoption trends due to the investments we've already made for the first time over half of new customer deposit accounts were originated digitally in the last quarter. The double-digit growth in active digital and mobile engagement is similarly encouraging. 
As we look ahead, we're optimistic about a strong economic recovery. Unemployment has decreased significantly across our footprint. We're again hearing a [indiscernible] commentary from our customers regarding labor constraints and wage inflation. Consumer confidence has meaningfully improved, while average consumers are less leveraged and more liquid. Our debit card trends have consistently posted double-digit year-over-year growth rates for the past several quarters. Consumer spending and service industries is expected to broadly accelerate this year as demand returns. 
Consumer loan production also continues to be strong. On the commercial side, sentiment is encouraging. Our pipelines are up across the board, increasing our confidence in recovery of commercial loan demand later this year. While supply chain constraints such as the semiconductor shortages will likely challenge some manufacturers in the near term, progress of recovery and visibility into growing customer orders are causing outlooks to strengthen. 
Let me also share some high-level remarks on our first quarter results, which provided a strong start to the year and included solid core performance with our momentum building. Commercial loan originations were in line with expectations. However, overall growth was constrained by both forgiveness of PPP loans and continued headwinds in dealer floor plan and commercial line utilization, both of which are temporary challenges. Residential mortgage, auto and RV/Marine produced seasonally strong originations in face of tight inventory. Growth in consumer loan balances was obscured by unprecedented levels of pay downs following the 2 recent rounds of stimulus. Deposit growth continues to consistently exceed expectations. 
Finally, on Slide 4, I'd like to give an update on the pending TCF acquisition. We believe the timing could not be better as the strengthening recovery dovetails with the growth and scale opportunities presented by this combination. We continue to make good progress toward our anticipated closing late in the second quarter and to complete the majority of systems conversions late in the third quarter. 
In March, Huntington and TCF shareholders approved the transaction, and our integration planning is on track. We completed the selection of key management and anticipate receiving the outstanding regulatory approvals, including the required branch divestiture in the coming weeks. We've become major components of the cost reduction plans, including the closure of 44 [indiscernible] branches later this quarter. Now let me turn it over to Zach for more detail on our financial performance."
278614,707434365,2255212,"Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Bancshares Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 provides the financial highlights for the first quarter. We reported earnings per common share of $0.48, return on average assets was 1.76% and return on average tangible common equity was 23.7%. Bottom l",1882,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 provides the financial highlights for the first quarter. We reported earnings per common share of $0.48, return on average assets was 1.76% and return on average tangible common equity was 23.7%. Bottom line results were augmented by 2 notable items. The first was a $144 million mark-to-market benefit on our interest rate caps driven by the steepening yield curve and increased market volatility. The second was $125 million or 7% reserve release, resulting from the improving economic outlook and credit metrics. Partially offsetting these were $21 million of TCF acquisition-related expenses, which are broken out as a significant item in the earnings release with granularity provided in Table 8. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 to review our results in more detail. We continue to be pleased with our sustained growth in pretax, preprovision earnings, which increased 15% year-over-year in the first quarter. Total revenue increased 19% versus the year ago quarter. Net interest income grew 23%, driven by solid underlying loan growth and a 34 basis point increase in NIM, which were positively impacted by the substantial mark-to-market gain that I mentioned in our interest rate cap derivatives and the $44 million accelerated PPP loan fee accretion. Fee income growth of 9% and was aided by a record first quarter for mortgage banking income as salable mortgage originations set its own record with 89% year-over-year growth and secondary marketing spreads remained elevated. Similarly, our wealth and investment management businesses experienced its best quarter ever with respect to net asset flows and also benefited from positive equity market performance over the prior 12 months. 
Card and payments continue to post strong, consistent growth. Deposit service charges remained below the year ago level as elevated consumer deposit account balances continue to moderate the recovery of this line. Total expenses were higher by $141 million or 22% from the year ago quarter. 3 percentage points of this growth can be attributed to the approximately $21 million of significant items related to the TCF acquisition. There were also approximately $45 million of expenses in the quarter, or approximately 7 percentage points of growth, resulting from the pull forward of these 3 expenses that otherwise would have been incurred in the future, the first of which was a $25 million contribution to the Columbus Foundation; second, we moved our annual long-term incentive grants to March from the historical timing in May; third, we retimed some expense related to our colleagues' health savings accounts, which would otherwise have been incurred in the balance of 2021. These 2 compensation related items together totaled approximately $20 million. The remaining approximately 11.5% underlying expense growth rate was driven primarily by the accelerated investment in strategic growth initiatives, which we have been communicating for the past several quarters. 
Turning to Slide 7. FTE net interest income increased 23% as earning asset growth was coupled with year-over-year NIM expansion. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest margin increased 54 basis points to 3.48%. As shown in the reconciliation on the right side of the slide, the linked quarter increase primarily reflected the 49 basis point net change in the interest rate caps. As we've discussed previously, we're taking actions on both sides of the balance sheet to offset the inherent margin pressure caused by the prolonged low interest rate environment, managing the underlying core net interest margin near current levels. 
Given the significant impact on NIM from the interest rate caps, Slide 8 provides additional information on this aspect of our comprehensive hedging strategy. As we disclosed in December, we purchased [ $5  billion ] of interest rate caps with an average tenor of 7 years, to reduce impacts on capital from rising rates. This hedging action performed very well this quarter. 
In March, we subsequently sold $3 billion of new interest rate caps at a higher strike price to create a collar like position. This is expected to dampen further mark-to-market impacts and recovered approximately half of the premium paid on the initial caps, while maintaining the majority of the capital protection from the physician. 
Turning to Slide 9. Average earning assets increased $12 billion or 12% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the $6 billion of PPP loans and the $5 billion increase in deposits of the Fed. Average commercial and industrial loans increased 11% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting the PPP loans. On a linked-quarter basis, C&I loans decreased 1%, primarily reflecting the forgiveness of PPP loans and the decline in dealer floorplan utilization. As we indicated at the RBC conference in March, commercial loan pipelines remain up significantly from a year ago, and we're seeing that manifest in new commercial loan production. Residential mortgage, RV and marine, all posted year-over-year growth in new production. 
Average consumer loan balances declined sequentially as stimulus-related paydowns more than offset strong new production in the quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, average earning asset growth primarily reflected the $2 billion or 9% increase in average securities as we executed our previous announced plan to deploy excess liquidity through the purchase of securities during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 10. We will review deposit growth and funding. Average core deposits increased 20% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven by increased consumer liquidity levels related to the downturn, consumer growth largely related to stimulus, increased account production and reduced attrition. 
Slide 11 provides an update on PPP forgiveness and expectations for the current program. In total, Huntington approved $6.6 billion of PPP loans in the original program and has approved an additional $1.8 billion of loans in the current program. In light of the recent congressional extension of the program, and our current application activity, we now anticipate the total amount for the current round to reach approximately $2 billion. We continue to expect approximately 85% of those balances from the original program and the new program ultimately to be forgiven. Through the end of March, $2.4 billion of loans from the original tranche have been forgiven, and we anticipate approximately $2.3 billion will be forgiven during the second quarter. For the current program, we expect the majority of the forgiveness to occur this year, particularly in the second half of the year. 
Slide 12 illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. The tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, ended the quarter at 7.11%, down 5 basis points sequentially. The common equity Tier 1 ratio, or CET1, ended up the quarter at 10.33%, up 33 basis points from the last quarter. The CET1 ratio was modestly above our 9% to 10% operating guideline, and we feel it's prudent to maintain strong capital levels going into the TCF acquisition. It also positions us well to execute on our growth initiatives and investment opportunities going forward. As we have previously communicated, we've paused share repurchases until we have substantially completed the TCF acquisition and integration. 
Slide 13 provides a lock of our allowance for credit losses. The first quarter included a $125 million reserve release, primarily from consumer, while the quarter in ACL represents 2.17% loans and 2.33% of loans, excluding PPP. We believe this is a prudent level to address remaining economic uncertainty while reflecting the improved overall credit metrics and economic outlook. 
Slide 14 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our overall credit performance continued to strengthen. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 32 basis points of average loans and leases, slightly below the low end of our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Our criticized asset and NPA ratios were both relatively stable. As always, we have provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides. 
I want to spend a minute on our ongoing investments and progress on digital engagement and origination. 
Looking at Slide 15, we continue to invest in a focused set of strategic initiatives to drive revenue acceleration and competitive differentiation. In addition to a variety of digital and product investments, we are adding personnel and core revenue-generating roles to support strategic growth in our capital markets, specialty banking, small business administration and vehicle finance businesses. We have also increased marketing expense back to prepandemic levels and to promote new launches related to fair play banking. 
Slide 16 illustrates several key digital engagement and origination trends. Showing some of the benefits of our ongoing tech investments. On the left side of the slide, you can see continued growth in monthly digital engagement and usage levels in consumer and business banking. The digital origination trends on the right side of the slide are particularly encouraging as they show strong customer uptake of the new consumer and business digital origination capabilities we introduced over the course of the last year. 
We are executing robust technology road maps across our business lines that will drive sustainable revenue momentum via improved customer acquisition, retention and deepening. 
Finally, Slide 17 provides our updated expectations for the full year 2021 on a Huntington stand-alone basis. We now expect full year average loan growth of 1% to 3%, down slightly from prior expectations as a result of the elevated levels of paydowns and a delayed recovery of commercial and vehicle floorplan line utilization. These expectations reflect flat to modestly higher commercial loans inclusive of PPP and low single-digit growth in consumer loans. Excluding PPP, we would expect to see low single-digit growth in both. 
For deposits, we now expect full year average balance growth of 9% to 11%, higher than previous expectations given the stronger-than-anticipated deposit inflows in the first quarter and the overall elevated levels of core deposits, which we expect to persist for several more quarters. We are also adjusting our expectations for full year total revenue growth higher to a range of 3.3% to 5%. 
We expect net interest income growth to be in the mid-single digits, while noninterest income is expected to be modestly lower for the full year. Full year growth expectations for noninterest expense are now between 7% and 9%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding $21 million of significant items I discussed previously, we expect noninterest expense to increase between 6% and 8%. This increase, relative to our prior expectations, is driven by the foundation donation in the first quarter and increases in compensation expenses related to the higher revenue expectation for the year. The large majority of the underlying expense growth continues to be driven by investments in our strategic growth initiatives as we've discussed previously. 
While expense growth is expected to outstrip revenue growth over the near term, our commitment to positive operating leverage remains over the long term. Our expectation and plan is to bring the expense growth rate back to more normalized levels during the second half of 2021. 
Finally, credit remains fundamentally sound. We now expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to be between 30 to 40 basis points, reflecting improving economic conditions and stable charge-offs in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Further reserve releases remain dependent on the economic recovery and related credit performance. 
As a reminder, all expectations are stand-alone for Huntington and do not include consideration made for the pending acquisition of TCF. Now let me turn it back to Mark, so we can get your questions."

I think -- this is Jack. I'll take that, and Steve may want to tack on as well here. But what we really like about our strategic plan is it's incredibly focused, and it's driven by key initiatives across each of our business lines. So within our consumer business line, which we've talked about for a while, much of the increased investment is around digital with 3 major focus areas as we talked about over the last several years and certainly last year, improving our digital point-of-sale and product origination capabilities. We largely completed that last year. And now the teams are working through how to best optimize and incorporate that within the omnichannel client engagement process we have for client origination. Also, a lot of focus around engagement and deepening to personalization and ease of use client account servicing. In the commercial business, significant amount of digital investment as well around new client onboarding, relationship manager digital tool sets as well as focused investment in new people, for example, in specialty banking and in our capital markets business. We're also really pleased with the investments we're putting into our wealth and investment management business, which, again, is sort of a mixture of both technology to improve the client adviser interaction experience and relationship management tools as well as select people hires as we bring on new relationship managers, which is, as I mentioned in my script, really driving substantial sales growth and performance. 
And lastly, I would highlight vehicle finance. For the last several years, we've been working to digitize the customer experience as well as continue to expand the geographic footprint of that business in a way that's really constructive. Steve, do you want to talk about that?"

But kind of an underlying basis, which I know what's the basis of your question, my expectation and goal is that we're growing the top line at or above nominal GDP, with revenue lower than that and driving positive operating leverage. I think over the long term, something like 1.5% to 3.5% sort of inflationary growth is logical. And if revenue is stronger than perhaps expenses are stronger than that.

And so the expectation is really the same as it was before, elevated expense growth on a kind of core run rate basis in the first half coming down to more normal levels in the second half of the year. And of that 6% to 8% underlying core expense, approximately 5 percentage points of that is our long-term strategic investments. And the other 1% to 3% is really sort of a natural expense inflation that you might expect and some normalization of company-wide programs like merit and and T&E and medical costs and things of this nature and some additional expenses to support the additional revenue, as I noted in my prepared remarks.

So in the last 4, 5 weeks, I've had about 50 CEO, CEOs in small meeting virtual conversations. And the outlook by them is virtually all very positive about this year, pipelines, their backlogs, very, very encouraging and their overall economic outlook for the next couple of years also very positive. They have -- in a number of situations, have supply chain constraints, some of it from mundane items, some of it for chips. But there's a curtailment that, I think, is being experienced, at least in part by these companies on the supply chain. Universally, they talk about inability to get adequate labor, very high turnover and clear wage inflation at the low end. A consequence of that will be more investment by many of them into automation all the way through including packaging. So we expect there'll be a fair amount of equipment finance activity this year. And when we combine with TCF, we'll have a seventh, eighth largest equipment finance company in the country, that should position us very well. We have a very good technology finance team that will play well with automation on the factory side. But even in the health care, health care product side, we're seeing a strong uptick. The health care systems are doing better, haven't been able to reopen and sustain activity that was diminished during the peak of the virus. So we -- the people we're talking to, who are the CEOs in that arena, generally very, very confident going forward. So we think the strong pipelines we're seeing, we're up about 40% of the commercial pipeline year-over-year is reflective of what will be demand as we go through the year, probably more in the second half than first, but this -- in part because many of them had very good years have liquidity and they're using that liquidity as opposed to line utilizations and other things. 
Inventories are low in many of these companies, and some of it's supply chain, but some of it's  significant demand, inflation on the commodity side wood or lumber, just a whole host of areas where there's cost push. And I think that will engender further borrowing as their liquidity gets soaked up. So we're -- from these conversations, we're optimistic about the continuing improvement especially seen in the second half."

But combustion engines, we think, are going to be here through the decade in terms of demand and substantially there, if not fully through production. Having said that, in terms of the impact of us, we're a super prime lender. So whether it's a combustion engine or a hybrid or EV, we work with a view of very low default rates. And so marginal loss rates might increase a bit and have probably would anyway because we're at record highs in terms of bluebook values for use. So -- but we don't see it as a big event.

TCF also outsourced a number of businesses or products, which we manage directly. And so we'll expect lift out of those. So there's a variety of revenue initiatives, which we are pursuing, in some cases, we've already activated such as SBA lending Minneapolis, an activity that TCF didn't have.

Thanks, Janet. For the question. This is Zach, I'll take it. Overall, as I mentioned in the comments, the expectation is, excluding PPP, low single-digit growth in commercial loans and approximately 1.5 percentage of that is from some modest line utilization. Overall, the expectation for line utilization is, it has been reset, and I'll come back and speak more specifically about the prepandemic comparisons as you asked. But just generally characterizing the expectation. What we've seen is relatively flat in general middle market lines. My baseline expectation is a modest improvement. Likewise, what we've seen on the vehicle floorplan side is actually some retrenchment from the end of last year to where we stand now. 
As we go forward, we're expecting some modest improvement in both of those. Together, those represent just under 1% asset growth expectation with my total asset growth. But even if you [indiscernible], I think the level of strong production we've got across both consumer and commercial, we do expect to drive accelerated loan growth overall on a net basis as we go forward. 
Just double-clicking into the line utilization expectations, prepandemic, we were running in the middle market line utilization, sort of low 40%. And right now, we're in the high 30%, to give you a sense. It's been roughly flat now for several months in a row. And I would expect it will be flat for a time before it starts to rise later in the year. But I think, as has been well publicized, elevated levels of liquidity across the system are contributing to our clients just not meeting those lines at this point. But everything we're hearing from them is that, ultimately, they expect to go back to a more typical financing posture and that those will start to solely normalize probably more in the back half late 2021 and continuing into 2022. 
On the vehicle floorplan side, historical levels are just around 80% line utilization. By the end of the year, we have gotten to almost 61% to be precise in December. By the end of this quarter, we were at 51% to give you a sense. So it continues to tick down and has tick down even a little bit more into April. So we'll have to see. That one is really driven by the point specific auto manufacturer issues that have been very well documented in the popular press around microchip shortages and other component shortages. Everything we're hearing, though, is that, slowly, but surely that they are chipping away at that issue. The manufacturers and that vehicle will begin to flow at a faster rate in the back half of the year. My general expectations are relatively flat in that for the next several months before it starts to normalize and rise more again towards the very late part of '21 with the longer-term expectation based on our client discussions. But they'll go back to historical levels of utilizing that financing, but probably well into the middle of 2022 based on supply."

I'll take the first crack at it and then Derek [indiscernible], our Treasurers is in the room as well. Let me tack on as we go. On the security side, we feel really good at actually about where the yields are and what we were able to deploy with roughly $2 billion of net add during the quarter came on sort of around the 160 basis point level. As we think about other new many yields, generally, some modest pressure, but not overly so. I think in the commercial business around 0.25 point lower as we went into Q1 from Q4. CRE, likewise, around 30 to 35 basis points lower, auto roughly stable. So we're seeing some modest down drops on new money, but not overly material, I would say, at this point. Most of the curve impacts have been brought into the pricing. As we take a step back and think about the posture around elevated liquidity, I would say that as we've continued to update our forecast, we've ratcheted higher the expectation for elevated levels of liquidity and deposits, as is indicated by our deposit guidance. 
And likewise, ratcheted out in time the duration that this phenomenon will last until it begins to normalize. So likely it will take several more quarters for that to slowly start to weigh in, and it will go all the way into 2022. So that gives us the cause to really look at the best ways to deploy that. Over time, you've seen us optimize our funding structure, and we'll continue to look for opportunity to do that to bring down funding costs using that. But I think as well, looking at whether it's appropriate over time to investment in rental securities is also part of the discussion. To be clear, liquidity is the the primary objective in making sure that we're managing that well. And so we'll leg into and step into in a kind of phased basis any incremental moves on that and still working through it, nothing for us specifically to talk about there. But we'll continue to be dynamic in looking at it and just watching those trends and optimizing. Anything, Derek, you can tack on to what I said?"

We have a set of opportunities with TCF that are substantial in terms of retaining customers. If we think about Michigan, for example, even after our consolidations of branches, and in aggregate, there'll be more than 200 branches affected by consolidation and divestiture, we will still have #1 branch share in Michigan by a factor of about 50%. So we'll be quite a bit larger than the next bank with physical distribution. So that provides an enormous set of opportunities for us in terms of retention, and we have had very high retention coming out of FirstMerit and other in-store branch consolidations. Remember, we can consolidate about 4% of the franchise every year on average. And so our retention efforts, where we decide to drop remaining ATMs outreach, we have a process we call white glove treatment that's been well-defined over the years and developed. Combination of those activities, the uniqueness of the product set, all day deposit, 24-hour grace, safety is on now, things like that also give us a distinct retention advantage. So we expect to have very high retention on the TCF side of the consumer, and on the business side, again, better product, more capabilities as we go forward. But it starts with winning minds and arts of our soon to be new colleagues, and we're actively working that. We would expect that would be successful as it was with Firstmerit. That will set up then this retention of customers through the conversion and beyond. And the product menu has just being substantially different, much bigger and better in many respects, will be to the benefit of the customer base, both consumers, small and medium-sized businesses. So we're very, very optimistic. On the specialty finance side, their equipment finance in ours is almost hand in glove. The combination will be extraordinarily effective. And they have a great team, we think we do as well, and this hand an glove will give us opportunities to further grow that business. We're excited about their inventory finance business. Got some great people in these business lines as well as the company generally, and we're going to be a stronger company as a consequence of the combination. 
So very bullish about the expectations, both on retention and revenue synergies as we go forward. And we'll get the expense synergies largely complete this year."

Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington's strategy to build a leading people-first, digitally powered bank in the nation. We continue to execute against this strategic vision and are pleased with our progress to date. We see significant opportunities ahead of us as we position our businesses for the recovery at hand. Over the past year, we updated our multiyear strategic plan with a focus on driving long-term revenue growth, continuing to build our brand based on best-in-class products and increasing our industry-leading customer satisfaction across our businesses. We also announced the planned acquisition of TCF Financial, which will provide powerful opportunities to grow revenue, expand our market presence and provide scale to our businesses, while increasing our investments in digital and other areas. This combination will increase our capacity to invest, and we will become more efficient with the significant expected expense takeouts. 
We accelerated our digital investments as part of our strategic vision and are encouraged by the digital adoption trends. Due to the investments we've already made, for the first time, over half of new customer deposit accounts were originated digitally in the last quarter. The double-digit growth in active digital and mobile engagement is similarly encouraging. As we look ahead, we're optimistic about a strong economic recovery. Unemployment has decreased significantly across our footprint. We're again hearing a crescendo of commentary from our customers regarding labor constraints and wage inflation. Consumer confidence has meaningfully improved, while average consumers are less leveraged and more liquid. Our debit card trends have consistently posted double-digit year-over-year growth rates for the past several quarters. 
Consumer spending and service industries is expected to broadly accelerate this year as demand returns. Consumer loan production also continues to be strong. On the commercial side, sentiment is encouraging. Our pipelines are up across the board, increasing our confidence in recovery of commercial loan demand later this year. While supply chain constraints, such as the semiconductor shortages, will likely challenge some manufacturers in the near term, progress of the recovery and visibility into growing customer orders are causing outlooks to strengthen.
Let me also share some high-level remarks on our first quarter results, which provided a strong start to the year and included solid core performance with our momentum building. Commercial loan originations were in line with expectations. However, overall growth was constrained by both forgiveness of PPP loans and continued headwinds in dealer floor plan and commercial line utilization, both of which are temporary challenges. Residential mortgage, auto and RV/Marine produced seasonally strong originations in face of tight inventory. Growth in consumer loan balances was obscured by unprecedented levels of pay downs following the 2 recent rounds of stimulus. Deposit growth continues to consistently exceed expectations.  
Finally, on Slide 4, I'd like to give an update on the pending TCF acquisition. We believe the timing could not be better as the strengthening recovery dovetails with the growth and scale opportunities presented by this combination. We continue to make good progress toward our anticipated closing late in the second quarter and to complete the majority of systems conversions late in the third quarter. In March, Huntington and TCF shareholders approved the transaction, and our integration planning is on track. We completed the selection of key management and anticipate receiving the outstanding regulatory approvals, including the required branch divestiture in the coming weeks. We've begun major components of the cost reduction plan, including the closure of 44 Meijer branches later this quarter. 
Now let me turn it over to Zach for more detail on our financial performance."
278614,707434365,2255338,"Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2021",2021-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Bancshares Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 provides the financial highlights for the first quarter. We reported earnings per common share of $0.48, return on average assets was 1.76% and return on average tangible common equity was 23.7%. Bottom l",1878,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 5 provides the financial highlights for the first quarter. We reported earnings per common share of $0.48, return on average assets was 1.76% and return on average tangible common equity was 23.7%. Bottom line results were augmented by 2 notable items. The first was a $144 million mark-to-market benefit on our interest rate caps driven by the steepening yield curve and increased market volatility. The second was $125 million or 7% reserve release, resulting from the improving economic outlook and credit metrics. Partially offsetting these were $21 million of TCF acquisition-related expenses, which are broken out as a significant item in the earnings release with granularity provided in Table 8.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 to review our results in more detail. We continue to be pleased with our sustained growth in pretax, preprovision earnings, which increased 15% year-over-year in the first quarter. Total revenue increased 19% versus the year ago quarter. Net interest income grew 23%, driven by solid underlying loan growth and a 34 basis point increase in NIM, which were positively impacted by the substantial mark-to-market gain that I mentioned in our interest rate cap derivatives and the $44 million of accelerated PPP loan fee accretion. Fee income growth of 9% was aided by a record first quarter for mortgage banking income as salable mortgage originations set its own record with 89% year-over-year growth and secondary marketing spreads remained elevated. 
Similarly, our wealth and investment management businesses experienced its best quarter ever with respect to net asset flows and also benefited from positive equity market performance over the prior 12 months. Card and payments continue to post strong, consistent growth. Deposit service charges remained below the year ago level as elevated consumer deposit account balances continue to moderate the recovery of this line. 
Total expenses were higher by $141 million or 22% from the year ago quarter. 3 percentage points of this growth can be attributed to the approximately $21 million of significant items related to the TCF acquisition. There were also approximately $45 million of expenses in the quarter, or approximately 7 percentage points of growth, resulting from the pull forward of these 3 expenses that otherwise would have been incurred in the future. The first of which was a $25 million contribution to the Columbus Foundation; second, we moved our annual long-term incentive grants to March from the historical timing in May; third, we retimed some expense related to our colleagues' health savings accounts, which would otherwise have been incurred in the balance of 2021. These 2 compensation-related items together totaled approximately $20 million. The remaining approximately 11.5% underlying expense growth rate was driven primarily by the accelerated investment in strategic growth initiatives, which we have been communicating for the past several quarters.
Turning to Slide 7. FTE net interest income increased 23% as earning asset growth was coupled with year-over-year NIM expansion. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest margin increased 54 basis points to 3.48%. As shown in the reconciliation on the right side of the slide, the linked quarter increase primarily reflected the 49 basis point net change in the interest rate caps. As we've discussed previously, we're taking actions on both sides of the balance sheet to offset the inherent margin pressure caused by the prolonged low interest rate environment, managing the underlying core net interest margin near current levels.
Given the significant impact on NIM from the interest rate caps, Slide 8 provides additional information on this aspect of our comprehensive hedging strategy. As we disclosed in December, we purchased $5  billion of interest rate caps with an average tenor of 7 years to reduce impacts on capital from rising rates. This hedging action performed very well this quarter. In March, we subsequently sold $3 billion of new interest rate caps at a higher strike price to create a collar-like position. This is expected to dampen further mark-to-market impacts and recovered approximately half of the premium paid on the initial caps, while maintaining the majority of the capital protection from the position.
Turning to Slide 9. Average earning assets increased $12 billion or 12% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the $6 billion of PPP loans and the $5 billion increase in deposits of the Fed. Average commercial and industrial loans increased 11% from the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting the PPP loans. On a linked-quarter basis, C&I loans decreased 1%, primarily reflecting the forgiveness of PPP loans and the decline in dealer floorplan utilization. As we indicated at the RBC conference in March, commercial loan pipelines remain up significantly from a year ago, and we're seeing that manifest in new commercial loan production. Residential mortgage, RV and marine, all posted year-over-year growth in new production. Average consumer loan balances declined sequentially as stimulus-related pay downs more than offset strong new production in the quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, average earning asset growth primarily reflected the $2 billion or 9% increase in average securities as we executed our previously announced plan to deploy excess liquidity through the purchase of securities during the quarter.
Turning to Slide 10. We will review deposit growth and funding. Average core deposits increased 20% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven by increased consumer liquidity levels related to the downturn, consumer growth largely related to stimulus, increased account production and reduced attrition.  
Slide 11 provides an update on PPP forgiveness and expectations for the current program. In total, Huntington approved $6.6 billion of PPP loans in the original program and has approved an additional $1.8 billion of loans in the current program. In light of the recent congressional extension of the program, and our current application activity, we now anticipate the total amount for the current round to reach approximately $2 billion. We continue to expect approximately 85% of those balances from the original program and the new program ultimately to be forgiven. Through the end of March, $2.4 billion of loans from the original tranche have been forgiven, and we anticipate approximately $2.3 billion will be forgiven during the second quarter. For the current program, we expect the majority of the forgiveness to occur this year, particularly in the second half of the year.  
Slide 12 illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. The tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, ended the quarter at 7.11%, down 5 basis points sequentially. The common equity Tier 1 ratio, or CET1, ended up the quarter at 10.33%, up 33 basis points from the last quarter. The CET1 ratio was modestly above our 9% to 10% operating guideline, and we feel it's prudent to maintain strong capital levels going into the TCF acquisition. It also positions us well to execute on our growth initiatives and investment opportunities going forward. As we have previously communicated, we've paused share repurchases until we have substantially completed the TCF acquisition and integration.
Slide 13 provides a log of our allowance for credit losses. The first quarter included a $125 million reserve release, primarily from consumer, while the quarter end ACL represents 2.17% of loans and 2.33% of loans, excluding PPP. We believe this is a prudent level to address remaining economic uncertainty while reflecting the improved overall credit metrics and economic outlook.
Slide 14 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our overall credit performance continued to strengthen. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 32 basis points of average loans and leases, slightly below the low end of our average through the cycle target range of 35 to 55 basis points. Our criticized asset and NPA ratios were both relatively stable. As always, we have provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides.
I want to spend a minute on our ongoing investments and progress on digital engagement and origination. Looking at Slide 15, we continue to invest in a focused set of strategic initiatives to drive revenue acceleration and competitive differentiation. In addition to a variety of digital and product investments, we are adding personnel in core revenue-generating roles to support strategic growth in our capital markets, specialty banking, small business administration and vehicle finance businesses. We have also increased marketing expense back to prepandemic levels and to promote new launches related to Fair Play banking.
Slide 16 illustrates several key digital engagement and origination trends showing some of the benefits of our ongoing tech investments. On the left side of the slide, you can see continued growth in monthly digital engagement and usage levels in consumer and business banking. The digital origination trends on the right side of the slide are particularly encouraging as they show strong customer uptake of the new consumer and business digital origination capabilities we introduced over the course of the last year. We are executing robust technology road maps across our business lines that will drive sustainable revenue momentum via improved customer acquisition, retention and deepening.
Finally, Slide 17 provides our updated expectations for the full year 2021 on a Huntington stand-alone basis. We now expect full year average loan growth of 1% to 3%, down slightly from prior expectations as a result of the elevated levels of paydowns and a delayed recovery of commercial and vehicle floorplan line utilization. These expectations reflect flat-to-modestly higher commercial loans inclusive of PPP and low single-digit growth in consumer loans. Excluding PPP, we would expect to see low single-digit growth in both.
For deposits, we now expect full year average balance growth of 9% to 11%, higher than previous expectations given the stronger-than-anticipated deposit inflows in the first quarter and the overall elevated levels of core deposits, which we expect to persist for several more quarters. We are also adjusting our expectations for full year total revenue growth higher to a range of 3% to 5%.
We expect net interest income growth to be in the mid-single digits, while noninterest income is expected to be modestly lower for the full year. Full year growth expectations for noninterest expense are now between 7% and 9%. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding $21 million of significant items I discussed previously, we expect noninterest expense to increase between 6% and 8%. This increase, relative to our prior expectations, is driven by the foundation donation in the first quarter and increases in compensation expenses related to the higher revenue expectation for the year. The large majority of the underlying expense growth continues to be driven by investments in our strategic growth initiatives as we've discussed previously. While expense growth is expected to outstrip revenue growth over the near term, our commitment to positive operating leverage remains over the long term. Our expectation and plan is to bring the expense growth rate back to more normalized levels during the second half of 2021.
Finally, credit remains fundamentally sound. We now expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to be between 30 to 40 basis points, reflecting improving economic conditions and stable charge-offs in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Further reserve releases remain dependent on the economic recovery and related credit performance. As a reminder, all expectations are stand-alone for Huntington and do not include consideration made for the pending acquisition of TCF.

I think -- this is Zach. I'll take that, and Steve may want to tack on as well here. But what we really like about our strategic plan is it's incredibly focused, and it's driven by key initiatives across each of our business lines. So within our consumer business line, which we've talked about for a while, much of the increased investment is around digital with 3 major focus areas as we talked about over the last several years and certainly last year improving our digital point-of-sale and product origination capabilities. We largely completed that last year. And now the teams are working through how to best optimize and incorporate that within the omnichannel client engagement process we have for client origination. Also, a lot of focus around engagement and deepening to personalization and ease of use client account servicing. 
In the commercial business, significant amount of digital investment as well around new client onboarding, relationship manager, digital tool sets as well as focused investment in new people, for example, in specialty banking and in our capital markets business. We're also really pleased with the investments we're putting into our wealth and investment management business, which, again, is sort of a mixture of both technology to improve the client adviser interaction experience and relationship management tools as well as select people hires as we bring on new relationship managers, which is, as I mentioned in my script, really driving substantial sales growth and performance.
And lastly, I would highlight vehicle finance. For the last several years, we've been working to digitize the customer experience as well as continue to expand the geographic footprint of that business in a way that's really constructive. Steve, do you want to tack on to that?"

But kind of an underlying basis, which I know what's the basis of your question, my expectation and goal is that we're growing the top line at or above nominal GDP, with revenue lower than that and driving positive operating leverage. I think over the long term, something like 1.5% to 3.5% sort of inflationary growth is logical. And if revenue is stronger than perhaps expenses are stronger than that.

And the key thing with our plan is that we're front-loading these investments into the first half of the 2021. And so the expectation is really the same as it was before. Elevated expense growth on a kind of core run rate basis in the first half coming down to more normal levels in the second half of the year and of that 6% to 8% underlying core expense, approximately 5 percentage points of that is our long-term strategic investments. And the other 1% to 3% is really sort of a natural expense inflation that you might expect and some normalization of company-wide programs like merit and T&E and medical costs and things of this nature and some additional expenses to support the additional revenue as I noted in my prepared remarks. So front-end loaded, back-end back to historical levels and really no change other than those factors I just talked about."

I think just touching on NIM for a second. Next couple of quarters will likely be in the mid 2.80s in terms of NIM. Biggest impact, just changing our expectations somewhat, is continued elevated levels of Fed cash driven by the elevated level of liquidity across the system that many folks have commented on here in the earnings cycle and, to some degree, the beginning of the roll-off of our hedges, which will be down about 7 basis points into Q2. So Q2 will be a trough to mid-2.80s for the next several quarters. But pulling off, FY '20 still looks at like a NIM of 2.90% or better and long term still forecasting to maintain those levels and with stable to rising NIM over the longer term."

So in the last 4, 5 weeks, I've had about 50 CEOs in small meeting virtual conversations. And the outlook by them is virtually at all very positive about this year, pipelines, their backlogs, very, very encouraging and their overall economic outlook for the next couple of years also very positive. They have -- in a number of situations, have supply chain constraints, some of it from mundane items, some of it for chips. But there's a curtailment that, I think, is being experienced, at least in part by these companies on the supply chain. Universally, they talk about inability to get adequate labor, very high turnover and clear wage inflation at the low end. A consequence of that will be more investment by many of them into automation all the way through, including packaging. So we expect there'll be a fair amount of equipment finance activity this year. And when we combine with TCF, we'll have a seventh, eighth largest equipment finance company in the country, that should position us very well. We have a very good technology finance team that will play well with automation on the factory side. But even in the health care, health care product side, we're seeing a strong uptick. The health care systems are doing better, haven't been able to reopen and sustain activity that was diminished during the peak of the virus. So we -- the people we're talking to, who are the CEOs in that arena, generally very, very confident going forward. So we think the strong pipelines we're seeing, we're up about 40% of the commercial pipeline year-over-year, is reflective of what will be demand as we go through the year, probably more in the second half than first, but this will be in part because many of them had very good years, had liquidity and they're using that liquidity as opposed to line utilizations and other things. 
Inventories are low in many of these companies, and some of it's supply chain, but some of it's  significant demand. Inflation on the commodity side, wood or lumber, just a whole host of areas where there's cost push. And I think that will engender further borrowing as their liquidity gets soaked up. So we're -- from these conversations, we're optimistic about the continuing improvement especially seen in the second half."

Now that may accelerate with climate posture of the Biden administration and for other reasons, including consumer awareness around environmental and change in demand. But combustion engines, we think, are going to be here through the decade in terms of demand and substantially there, if not fully through production. Having said that, in terms of the impact of us, we're a super prime lender. So whether it's a combustion engine or a hybrid or EV, we work with a view of very low default rates. And so marginal loss rates might increase a bit and probably would anyway because we're at record highs in terms of bluebook values for use. So -- but we don't see it as a big event.

Thanks, Janet for the question. This is Zach, I'll take it. Overall, as I mentioned in the comments, the expectation is, excluding PPP, low single-digit growth in commercial loans and approximately 1.5 percentage of that is from some modest line utilization. Overall, the expectation for line utilization is, it has been reset, and I'll come back in a minute and just speak more specifically about the prepandemic comparison as you asked, but just generally characterizing the expectation. What we've seen is relatively flat in general middle market lines. My baseline expectation is a modest improvement. Likewise, what we've seen on the vehicle floorplan side is actually some retrenchment from the end of last year to where we stand now. As we go forward, we're expecting some modest improvement in both of those. Together, those represent just under 1% asset growth expectation with my total asset growth. But even if you [internalize] it, I think the level of strong production we've got across both consumer and commercial, we do expect it to drive accelerated loan growth overall on a net basis as we go forward. 
Just double-clicking into the line utilization expectations, prepandemic, we were running in the middle market line utilization, sort of low 40%. And right now, we're in the high 30%, to give you a sense. It's been roughly flat now for several months in a row. And I would expect it will be flat for a time before it starts to rise later in the year. But I think, as has been well publicized, elevated levels of liquidity across the system are contributing to our clients just not meeting those lines at this point. But everything we're hearing from them is that, ultimately, they expect to go back to a more typical financing posture and those will start to solely normalize probably more in the back half late 2021 and continuing into 2022.
On the vehicle floorplan side, historical levels are sort of just around 80% line utilization. By the end of the year, we have gotten to almost 61% to be precise in December. By the end of this quarter, we were at 51% to give you a sense. So it continues to tick down and has ticked down even a little bit more into April. So we'll have to see. That one is really driven by the point-specific auto manufacturer issues that have been very well documented in the popular press around microchip shortages and other component shortages. Everything we're hearing, though, is that slowly but surely that they are chipping away at that issue, the manufacturers, and the vehicle will begin to flow at a faster rate in the back half of the year. My general expectations are relatively flat in that for the next several months before it starts to normalize and rise more again towards the very late part of '21 with the longer-term expectation based on our client discussions. But they'll go back to historical levels of utilizing that financing, but probably well into the middle of 2022 based on supply."

I'll take the first crack at it and then Derek Meyer, our Treasurer, is in the room as well, may tack on as we go. On the securities side, we feel really good actually about where the yields are and what we were able to deploy with roughly $2 billion of net add during the quarter came on sort of around the 160 basis point level. As we think about other new many yields, generally, some modest pressure, but not overly so. I think in the commercial business around 0.25 point lower as we went into Q1 from Q4. CRE, likewise, around 30 to 35 basis points lower, auto roughly stable. So we're seeing some modest down drops on new money, but not overly material, I would say, at this point. Most of the curve impacts have been brought into the pricing. 
As we take a step back and think about the posture around elevated liquidity, I would say that as we've continued to update our forecast, we've ratcheted higher the expectation for elevated levels of liquidity and deposits as is indicated by our deposit guidance. And likewise, ratcheted out in time the duration that this phenomenon will last until it begins to normalize. So likely it will take several more quarters for that to slowly start to weigh in, and it will go all the way into 2022. So that gives us the cause to really look at the best ways to deploy that. Over time, you've seen us optimize our funding structure, and we'll continue to look for opportunity to do that to bring down funding costs using that. But I think as well, looking at whether it's appropriate over time to investment in rental securities is also part of the discussion. To be clear, liquidity is the primary objective in making sure that we're managing that well. And so we'll leg into and step into in a kind of phased basis any incremental moves on that and still working through it, nothing for us specifically to talk about there. But we'll continue to be dynamic in looking at it and just watching those trends and optimizing. Anything, Derek, you can tack on to what I said?"

We will still have #1 branch share in Michigan by a factor of about 50%. So we'll be quite a bit larger than the next bank with physical distribution. So that provides an enormous set of opportunities for us in terms of retention, and we have had very high retention coming out of FirstMerit and other in-store branch consolidations. Remember, we consolidate about 4% of the franchise every year on average. And so our retention efforts, where we decide to drop remaining ATMs outreach, we have a process we call white glove treatment that's been well defined over the years and developed. Combination of those activities, the uniqueness of the product set, all day deposit, 24-hour grace, Safety Zone now, things like that also give us a distinct retention advantage. So we expect to have very high retention on the TCF side of the consumer, and on the business side, again, better product, more capabilities as we go forward. But it starts with winning minds and hearts of our soon to be new colleagues, and we're actively working that. We would expect that would be successful as it was with FirstMerit. That will set up then this retention of customers through the conversion and beyond. And the product menu has just being substantially different, much bigger and better in many respects, will be to the benefit of the customer base, both consumers, small and medium-sized businesses. So we're very, very optimistic. 
On the specialty finance side, their equipment finance and ours is almost hand in glove. The combination will be extraordinarily effective. And they have a great team, we think we do as well, and this hand in glove will give us opportunities to further grow that business. We're excited about their inventory finance business. Got some great people in these business lines as well as in the company generally, and we're going to be a stronger company as a consequence of the combination. So very bullish about the expectations, both on retention and revenue synergies as we go forward. And we'll get the expense synergies largely complete this year."

Welcome, everyone. Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington. We're now a top 25 bank holding company with $175 billion in total assets. The TCF acquisition expanded our leadership position and density in Michigan, bolst",1020,"Thanks, Mark, and happy birthday. Welcome, everyone. Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington. We're now a top 25 bank holding company with $175 billion in total assets. The TCF acquisition expanded our leadership position and density in Michigan, bolstered scale in markets such as Chicago and added new growth markets in the Twin City, Denver and Milwaukee. Importantly, we have #1 branch share within our footprint, which allows us to leverage our brands, convenience and digital channels to continue to efficiently grow the customer base. 
Huntington brings an expanded capabilities to these markets and to the TCF customer base, including middle market and corporate banking with specialty verticals, treasury management, capital markets, trust and investment and insurance products in addition to our #1 in the nation SK lending program. So we're excited by the opportunity to introduce our Fair Play approach and leading digital offerings to our customers in these markets. 
Over the past several years, we've been pleased by the number of independent affirmations of the superior customer service our colleagues provide and the customer-centric products and services we've introduced. Just last month, [indiscernible] announced Huntington ranked highest in customer satisfaction amongst regional banks for our mobile app for the third consecutive year. Additionally, we were ranked first in our region for consumer banking customer satisfaction. Now these are important affirmations of the considerable investments we've made in our culture and digital technology. 
Slide 4 provides an overview of Huntington's strategy to build the leading people-first, digitally powered bank in the nation. Huntington is a purpose-driven company, and organic growth and sustainable top quartile financial performance remain core tenets of our strategic vision. The acquisition of TCF is additive on both fronts as it supports continued organic growth opportunities and allows us to leverage the incremental scale to drive efficiencies and deliver top-quartile financial returns. We're very well positioned to benefit from the strength of the economic recovery. Our accelerated investments during the past year are driving new customer acquisition and retention, and we expect to continue to capture market share gains and increased share of wallet in the second half of '21 and beyond. 
On a macro basis, labor constraints and wage inflation remain a concern for many of our business customers. However, confidence levels are very high and leading economic indicators are positive. Many of our customers continue to see record cash flows and profitability, driving unprecedented levels of liquidity, which continue to weigh on growth and [indiscernible] rates. We expect borrowers may opt to carry more liquidity than they had previously, given what we all experienced with the pandemic, the supply chain issues and ongoing labor constraints. But nonetheless, our loan pipelines are strong and continue to build. And we remain optimistic that conditions favorable for improved loan growth will strengthen during the second half of '21 and as we move into '22. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'd like to give an update on the TCF integration. We continue to be on track for all key integration activities. We closed the acquisition in early June and completed Phase 1 of branch consolidations, closing 44 Meijer in store branches. We expect to close the required branch divestiture in the third quarter and to complete the majority of the remaining system conversions over Columbus Day weekend. The final 3 phases of branch consolidations are expected to be completed by month end October. 
In addition to our focus on systems, product and customer conversion, we're also focused on fully integrating our new TCF colleagues into Huntington's culture. I think the strategy of building the nation's leading people-first, digitally powered bank begins with our people, our colleagues, both legacy and new TCF colleagues acting together are the key to our success. And I see and appreciate our colleagues and the differences they make in customers' lives and our communities every day. We're very fortunate. We have a tremendous team. 
With Commercial Banking, the businesses we've added from TCF such as inventory finance and vendor finance, to name a few, continue to be complementary and additive to our overall strategy. In Consumer Banking, TCF had progressed on customer experience, but now the opportunity to introduce our digital capabilities, our products, our services, combined with our fair play philosophy, will significantly bolster the customer experience as they convert to Huntington. As we introduce the Huntington brand, our products and services and the commitment of our colleagues to our new markets and expanded customer base, we clearly see opportunity to gain additional market share, to deepen relationships and to drive organic revenue growth. 
Turning to Slide 6, while the TCF acquisition is an important part of our growth plan, we remain focused on the larger organic growth strategies we have been executing. Our investments in digital and technology continue to drive strong returns for our business. Nearly half of new consumer deposit accounts are now open digitally, while consumer checking households as well as business checking relationships have each increased by 8% annualized year-to-date, 8% annualized year-to-date. 
Last month, we launched compelling new digital products, including Standby Cash and Early Pay, which are part of our road map to continue to innovate and advance our customer-centric Fair Play banking philosophy. We are continuing to innovate with initial new products and features to be launched later this year and next. And we're seeing traction in customer acquisition, and we've restored marketing investments to prepandemic levels. So as we continue to build out our specialty banking efforts within commercial, we're seeing strong sales activities, growing pipeline and momentum in originations. 
Before I turn it over to Zack, I want to take a moment to say thank you to Mark for his hard work and dedication to Huntington as he's led our Investor Relationship team for the last 8 years -- 7 years. Mark will be taking on a finance leadership role as CFO of our important vehicle finance division. We're pleased to welcome Tim [indiscernible] as our new Director of IR. Congratulations to Mark on his new role, and welcome to Tim. Zack, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance."

Slide 7 provides the highlights for the second quarter, which included closing the TCF transaction, delivering strong new loan production and maintaining solid credit quality as well as robust liquidity and capit",1817,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides the highlights for the second quarter, which included closing the TCF transaction, delivering strong new loan production and maintaining solid credit quality as well as robust liquidity and capital positions. 
On a fully reported basis, including all impact of the acquisition, we reported a net loss per common share of $0.05 for the second quarter. Earnings were impacted by acquisition expenses of $269 million and the so-called CECL double count provision expense of $294 million. Earnings per common share adjusted for these notable items were positive $0.35 per share. As Steve mentioned, we closed the TCS acquisition in June, and we remain on track for the realization of the deal economics. 
Even as we brought on TCF, our teams did not lose focus on driving organic growth across the bank. We saw underlying loan growth ex GCF and in many of our consumer loan portfolios, namely mortgage, auto and RV Marine. We also saw encouraging new commercial loan production and building pipelines. Fee income was also a bright spot in the quarter as we saw increases in our underlying Huntington business, including treasury management, card and payments, capital markets and our wealth and investment businesses. 
With respect to credit, net charge-offs were 28 basis points. The allowance for credit losses ended the quarter at 2.08% and was driven by provisioning of $294 million from the acquired TCF loan book, offset against $145 million of reserve release from the legacy Huntington book. Detailed loan and credit marks related to TCF are included on Slide 25 of the appendix. 
Liquidity remained elevated as we continue to see growth in deposit balances. This gives us ample opportunity to deploy into incremental lending opportunities and securities to support net interest income growth in the coming quarters. Additionally, we fully exited the capital protection hedging position that utilize interest rate caps, closing out a very useful hedge and replacing them with alternative capital protection tools which have less earnings volatility as they qualify for hedge accounting. Finally, common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.97%. 
Turning to Slide 8. FTE net interest income increased, primarily driven by the addition of TCF in the quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest margin decreased 82 basis points to 2.66%, primarily driven from the net change in the interest rate caps from the prior quarter. 
Looking for a moment at the underlying NIM dynamics, the impact in the second quarter from the mark-to-market on the caps was negative 17 basis points, while we saw 3 basis points benefit from purchase accounting accretion. Therefore, the underlying NIM, excluding the caps in PAA, was approximately 2.8% for the second quarter. This compares to 2.98% on the same basis in the prior quarter. As we have noted in previous calls, we had expected a reduction in NIM into Q2, driven in part by a 9 basis point step down in the benefit of our existing interest rate hedging positions as well as forecasted PPP dynamics and yield curve impacts on spread. 
At the Morgan Stanley conference in June, we guided to a second quarter NIM in the low 280s. The underlying second quarter NIM of 2.80 was a few basis points below expectations due to the additional impact of excess liquidity as deposits yet again increased in the quarter and elevated Fed caps represented an 18 basis point drag on the NIM in the quarter. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect Q2 to be the low point for NIM for the year, driving a positive trend will be the addition of TCF assets that will benefit margin as we get a full quarter impact of those acquired assets in the third quarter. Also the continued execution of our balance sheet optimization program will provide benefits from our ongoing focus on funding cost optimization, asset mix and customer level pricing. And over time, we expect the elevated liquidity levels that I mentioned to normalize, reducing that 18 basis point drag back down to 0 as it does. 
These positive factors will offset some continued spread pressure from competition for high-quality assets and the absolute level of interest rates as well as impacts from the roll-off of hedges, as illustrated on the next slide. All told, these changes are expected to bring us to a net interest margin in the 2 90s next quarter. Our outlook continues to point to NIM stability at approximately those levels for the foreseeable future going forward. 
Turning to Slide 9. In the second quarter, the interest rate caps resulted in a $55 million negative mark-to-market driven by lower rates at quarter end. However, cumulatively, over the life of these caps, the strategy was highly effective and resulted in a $94 million pretax gain, $75 million net of tax, but as we intended, offset approximately 46% of the negative impact on capital from rising rates. 
As the securities portfolio gradually grew during the last 2 quarters and prepayment speeds on that portfolio have reduced, we now have the opportunity to utilize a more traditional hedging structure to accomplish the same capital protection objective. Hence, we fully exited the caps during the second quarter and replaced them with $4 billion of forward starting swaps, which qualify for hedge accounting and reduce earnings volatility while achieving a similar level of capital protection. Additionally, we moved $4.5 billion of securities available for sale into held for maturity during the quarter in order to further minimize volatility in OCI as a result of the changes in interest rates. 
Turning to Slide 10. Average loan balances increased by 9% year-over-year driven by the added TCF balances and continued growth in our consumer loan portfolios. Period-end loan balances ended the second quarter at $112 billion. We continue to have near record origination levels in our consumer portfolios in the second quarter with RV Marine, automobile and residential mortgage all continuing to post sequential quarter growth. Despite the inventory constraints in auto and RV marine, consumer demand remains very high, driving continued strength in originations. The same can be said for Home Lending, where origination activity is quite robust despite ongoing home inventory constraints. 
The calling activity and origination volumes in the commercial portfolios also continued to be robust. However, overall commercial growth is constrained by pressure on utilization rates. Auto dealer floor plan balances remained a headwind in the quarter, driven by inventory supply constraints. But we're optimistic that we're nearing the floor for these balances. The outlook is expected to slowly recover from these levels as OEMs deliver increased inventory to dealers. 
The inventory finance business from TCF has been facing a similar headwind as inventory levels have been depressed and outstandings have been near multiyear lows. Commercial utilization rates for our middle market and corporate portfolios remained relatively stable in the second quarter. Cumulatively, these 3 areas of commercial lending combined represent $5 billion to $6 billion of incremental loan growth opportunity as utilization rates recover. 
With respect to investment securities, we completed a repositioning of the acquired TCF portfolio to improve both yields and to reduce duration. We also deployed an incremental $4 billion of excess liquidity into additional securities. Inclusive of these actions, the securities portfolio ended the quarter at $35 billion. Given the level of excess liquidity we had at quarter end, we would expect to grow the securities portfolio incrementally by approximately $4 billion over the remainder of 2021. 
Slide 11 provides an update on PPP. In total, we originated $11.4 billion of PPP loans, inclusive of TCF's activity. We continue to expect approximately 85% of balances from the programs to ultimately be forgiven. PPP loans totaled $4.2 billion at quarter end, with a significant acceleration in the pace of forgiveness during June. We anticipate forgiveness of the majority of balances to be completed in the second half of the year, with a portion trailing into early 2022. 
Turning to Slide 12. Average total deposits increased 13% sequentially due to the acquisition of TCF and increased customer liquidity levels at Huntington. We continue to leverage excess liquidity to manage wholesale funding balances and costs lower. 
Slide 13 illustrates the strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. As I mentioned, common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.97% and is near the top of our 9% to 10% operating guideline. These strong capital levels, coupled with the ongoing economic recovery and our merger integration proceeding as planned, gave us confidence to relaunch our share buyback program earlier than previously expected. The Board has authorized $800 million of common stock repurchases over the next 4 quarters that will likely be overweighted towards the earlier part of that time. Our capital plan entails managing our CET1 ratio towards the lower half of our 9% to 10% operating range over the medium term. This plan is supported by our finalization of the Mark Sony acquired portfolio and our confidence in the pro forma earnings power and return on capital profile of the company. 
Slide 14 provides a view of our allowance for credit losses. The second quarter ending ACL represents 2.08% of total loans, down from 2.17% at prior quarter end. The allowance includes the previously mentioned TCF credit market, which was partially offset by an 8% reserve release on the legacy Huntington portfolio. 
Slide 15 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our overall credit performance remained strong. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 28 basis points of average loans and leases, below our 35 to 55 basis point through-the-cycle average target range. Consumer charge-offs were quite low this quarter at just 2 basis points as auto and home equity portfolios both reported net recoveries. Year-to-date, consumer net charge-offs have been 9 basis points. 
Our criticized assets and NPA ratios were both modestly higher as a result of the TCF acquired portfolios. These portfolios came over as expected consistent with our detailed due diligence work, and we remain comfortable with the acquired book. The ACL coverage on NPAs is strong at 229%. 
Finally, turning to our outlook on Slide 16. We've provided a set of medium-term financial targets, including a 17% return on tangible common equity, a 56% efficiency ratio while remaining committed to investing in our people-first digitally powered strategy. These metrics, in addition to sustainable top line revenue growth, slightly above nominal GDP will drive earnings per share growth over time. Our efficiency ratio will benefit from expense synergies from the TCF acquisition and incorporates our commitment to continued investment in technology and digital capabilities. 
Annual positive operating leverage remains a core principle of our strategy. We believe these metrics, revenue growth, return on capital and annual positive operating leverage are a compelling set of financial performance indicators and closely aligns with value creation for our shareholders. Now let me turn it back over to Mark, and we'll get to your questions."

This is Zach. I'll take that one. So 2 big messages I would offer to you. One is on an underlying Huntington basis, as you noted, very much executing to our prior plan, which has been elevated levels of expense in the first 2 quarters of the year driven by our investments, bringing that growth rate back down into the low single digits by the second half of the year. Everything that we're completely executing to that plan is everything I've seen in terms of forecast for standalone Huntington and our track up until the close of the acquisition mid-June was very much corroborating that. In fact, Q2 was coming in a bit lower in terms of overall expense growth and the outlook continues to be as we disclosed. And then secondly, the TCF cost synergies are very much on track, and we're executing on that as we speak. The branch rationalization, as Steve noted in his comments [indiscernible] the systems conversion is planned, personnel decisions are finalized. We've completed a lot of the vendor conversion exceedingly progress on real estate consolidation. So the majority of those cost saves from the TCF acquisition will benefit 2022, which was the full run rate of being present in the back half of the year and as we go into '23. Excluding onetime costs, which clearly would be noisy on an organic basis, we expect a step-up into Q3 as we get a full quarter of the TCF expense base. And then from there, beginning in Q4 and over the next 6 quarters, see gradual reductions each quarter as the synergies are realized pretty steady, no major step down to this point in our outlook."

I'll take it. Just a couple of things I would share with you. One, to answer your question about kind of the underlying Huntington growth, and I will caveat to say that we're deeply integrating the businesses at this point. So over time, it will be more and more difficult for us to kind of disaggregate in this way. But generally, what we were seeing was consumer growth kind of close to 1% and commercial growth just slightly less than flat. So overall, it was pretty flat, particularly when you strip out the decline in PPP quarter-to-quarter. Going forward and more importantly, I think the 2 dynamics that we've been seeing and we tried to kind of illustrate in the prepared remarks, continue to be very much the thing to focus on. Firstly, new production is quite strong, at or better than our plan on the consumer side. Surprising continued strength in mortgage and auto. And then on the commercial side, record calling activities driving pipelines, both sequentially from Q1, but I would also say, very, very healthy growth versus 2019. And so it's giving us a lot of confidence in where new production is going. And it's really just a question of watching, therefore, the second factor, which is the impact of the elevated liquidity in the system and supply chain issues on existing line utilization. And so I think the net outcome of this from what we're seeing is probably about 1% additional growth pressure in the back half of this year. Whereas at the beginning of the year, I guided for 1% to 3% loan growth. And then by June, at the Morgan Stanley Conference, we talked about sort of the low end of that range. My expectation now is sort of roughly flat on average in the second half of the year. Growth really starting to rebound as we get out into 2022 and go forward. 
I think there's some pretty clear signs for optimism here. I think on the places where there are supply chains are really pressuring inventory utilization in auto and certainly in the new TCF-acquired inventory finance book. We're seeing OEM production increase and our clients want to use these lines. So I think over the course of '22 into '23, we'll see that $5 billion to $6 billion come back. And the new production really shows no signs of slowing down at this point. So we're bullish about the future, and I think the -- throughout the course of '22, you'll see those conditions improve."

So we're disrupting ourselves against the game plan of trying to be the premier consumer bank in our footprint. And I think we're achieving that. I think in the last 9 years, we've had 6 J.D. Power #1 in Consumer Banking in our footprint. You have the 3 mobile apps in a row. Like what we're seeing, we're not done. We have some really interesting ideas that we'll be working on through this year and well into next to further distinguish and provide growth opportunities for us. 
Now in the context of TCF, I see a fair banking philosophy just as a huge advantage for that customer base. And I think from the early reaction of our new colleagues from TCF and the branches, they're wildly enthusiastic. And I think the customer base will be as well. I see that as a big growth opportunity for us, including our capacity of cross-sell. So the operating processes, procedures, et cetera, we have, complemented by our Fair Play products and this emphasis and focus on customer service, I think is going to make our combination incredibly powerful on the consumer side.

That drag, that as it goes away, will kind of reveal the underlying strength in the new production will, I think, be the driver. That's sort of point one. Point 2 is the NIM, that as we talked about, our expectation is in the 2 90s. I think that will move potentially based on the pace of the deposit runoff and that kind of 18 basis points of elevated liquidity drag coming off. I have confidence in our forecast, with lot of actions and specific plans to drive it. But I think that's the thing I would watch secondly. Third, we haven't talked about it a lot here, but fees are a real bright spot for us in terms of the strategic focus areas for our strategy and the growth that is driving principally in those 4 areas I mentioned in my comments. Carbon payments, just debt in the commercial card, business cards just on fire. Treasury management continued to track forward very, very well. Our Capital Markets business is growing very nicely year-over-year and sequentially. And then wealth and investments, which are seeing record sales activity and really strong revenue growth as well. So I watch those very carefully. And then I think lastly, the expenses. I think we got a question earlier about the trajectory of expenses. I do think it will pop up just from a kind of calendarization perspective into the third quarter as we have a full quarter of TCF. But then you'll see it every quarter tick down on a nominal basis over the next few quarters as our synergies are realized on kind of wave by-way basis. And then getting to that run rate level of performance that are in our medium-term targets as we get into the second half of '22 and as we certainly go into the full year of '23.

And at that point, everybody is going to keep floor plan levels lower in the car companies were going to be more judicious in trying to get pricing versus volume, and that lasted for a couple of quarters, right? There is a volume share gain that history has shown that the OEMs want. And they have the ability to push delivery. It's not just the dealers pulling it. So we believe over time, the floor plan inventories will essentially get back to where there were. A lot of the deals, particularly in the slow rate environment, would love to have a lot more inventory. And they're getting deliveries and in a good percentage of the cases, those are presolved. So they're going to lap very briefly. And there's still a phenomenon where people come in thinking they know what they want, but they're -- once they experience the next version of or the additional features that are available in the car that there's a sales process and generally a selection that still have some physical components to that. So I think the dealers will be essentially in the position they were back in '18 and '19 over time. Now I don't think that's a '21 and it may not even fully be in '22.

Welcome, everyone. Slide 3 provides an overview of Huntington. We're now a top 25 bank holding company with $175 billion in total assets.

We're now a top 25 bank holding company with $175 billion in total assets. The TCF acquisition expanded our leadership position and density in Michigan, bolstered scale in markets such as Chicago and added new growth markets in the Twin Cities, Denver and Milwaukee. Importantly, we have #1 branch share within our footprint, which allows us to leverage our brands, convenience and digital channels to continue to efficiently grow the customer base.
Huntington brings an expanded set of capabilities to these markets and to the TCF customer base, including middle market and corporate banking with specialty verticals, treasury management, capital markets, trust and investment and insurance products in addition to our #1 in the nation SBA lending program. So we're excited by the opportunity to introduce our Fair Play approach and leading digital offerings to our customers in these markets.
Over the past several years, we've been pleased by the number of independent affirmations of the superior customer service our colleagues provide and the customer-centric products and services we've introduced. Just last month, J.D. Power announced Huntington ranked highest in customer satisfaction amongst regional banks for our mobile app for the third consecutive year. Additionally, we were ranked first in our region for consumer banking customer satisfaction. Now these are important affirmations of the considerable investments we've made in our culture and digital technology.
Slide 4 provides an overview of Huntington's strategy to build the leading people-first, digitally powered bank in the nation. Huntington is a purpose-driven company, and organic growth and sustainable top quartile financial performance remain core tenets of our strategic vision. The acquisition of TCF is additive on both fronts as it supports continued organic growth opportunities and allows us to leverage the incremental scale to drive efficiencies and deliver top-quartile financial returns.
We're very well positioned to benefit from the strength of the economic recovery. Our accelerated investments during the past year are driving new customer acquisition and retention, and we expect to continue to capture market share gains and increased share of wallet in the second half of '21 and beyond.
On a macro basis, labor constraints and wage inflation remain a concern for many of our business customers. However, confidence levels are very high and leading economic indicators are positive. Many of our customers continue to see record cash flows and profitability, driving unprecedented levels of liquidity, which continue to weigh in on growth in line utilization rates.
We expect borrowers may opt to carry more liquidity than they had previously given what we all experienced with the pandemic, the supply chain issues and ongoing labor constraints. But nonetheless, our loan pipelines are strong and continue to build. And we remain optimistic that conditions favorable for improved loan growth will strengthen during the second half of '21 and as we move into '22.
Turning to Slide 5. I'd like to give an update on the TCF integration. We continue to be on track for all key integration activities. We closed the acquisition in early June and completed Phase 1 of branch consolidations, closing 44 Meijer in-store branches. We expect to close the required branch divestiture in the third quarter and to complete the majority of the remaining system conversions over Columbus Day weekend. The final 3 phases of branch consolidations are expected to be completed by month end October.
In addition to our focus on systems, product and customer conversion, we're also focused on fully integrating our new TCF colleagues into Huntington's culture. I think the strategy of building the nation's leading people-first, digitally powered bank begins with our people, our colleagues, both legacy and new TCF colleagues acting together are the key to our success. And I see and appreciate our colleagues and the differences they make in customers' lives and our communities every day. We're very fortunate. We have a tremendous team.
With commercial banking, the businesses we've added from TCF such as inventory finance and vendor finance, to name a few, continue to be complementary and additive to our overall strategy. In Consumer Banking, TCF had progressed on customer experience, but now the opportunity to introduce our digital capabilities, our products, our services, combined with our Fair Play philosophy, will significantly bolster the customer experience as they convert to Huntington. As we introduce the Huntington brand, our products and services and the commitment of our colleagues to our new markets and expanded customer base, we clearly see opportunity to gain additional market share, to deepen relationships and to drive organic revenue growth.
Turning to Slide 6, while the TCF acquisition is an important part of our growth plan, we remain focused on the larger organic growth strategies we have been executing. Our investments in digital and technology continue to drive strong returns for our business. Nearly half of new consumer deposit accounts are now open digitally, while consumer checking households as well as business checking relationships have each increased by 8% annualized year-to-date, 8% annualized year-to-date.
Last month, we launched compelling new digital products, including Standby Cash and Early Pay, which are part of our road map to continue to innovate and advance our customer-centric Fair Play banking philosophy. We are continuing to innovate with initial new products and features to be launched later this year and next. And we're seeing traction in customer acquisition, and we've restored marketing investments to pre-pandemic levels. So as we continue to build out our specialty banking efforts within commercial, we're seeing strong sales activities, growing pipeline and momentum in originations.
Before I turn it over to Zach, I want to take a moment to say thank you to Mark for his hard work and dedication to Huntington as he's led our Investor Relationship team for the last 8 years -- 7 years. Mark will be taking on a finance leadership role as CFO of our important vehicle finance division. We're pleased to welcome Tim Sedabres as our new Director of IR. Congratulations to Mark on your new role, and welcome to Tim.
Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance."
278614,1672836271,2354377,"Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Huntington Bancshares Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides the highlights for the second quarter, which included closing the TCF transaction, delivering strong new loan production and maintaining solid credit quality as well as robust liquidity and capit",1812,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides the highlights for the second quarter, which included closing the TCF transaction, delivering strong new loan production and maintaining solid credit quality as well as robust liquidity and capital positions.
On a fully reported basis, including all impact of the acquisition, we reported a net loss per common share of $0.05 for the second quarter. Earnings were impacted by acquisition expenses of $269 million and the so-called CECL double count provision expense of $294 million. Earnings per common share adjusted for these notable items were positive $0.35 per share.
As Steve mentioned, we closed the TCF acquisition in June, and we remain on track for the realization of the deal economics. Even as we brought on TCF, our teams did not lose focus on driving organic growth across the bank. We saw underlying loan growth ex TCF in many of our consumer loan portfolios, namely mortgage, auto and RV/Marine. We also saw encouraging new commercial loan production and building pipelines. Fee income was also a bright spot in the quarter as we saw increases in our underlying Huntington business, including treasury managements, card and payments, capital markets and our wealth and investment businesses.
With respect to credit, net charge-offs were 28 basis points. The allowance for credit losses ended the quarter at 2.08% and was driven by provisioning of $294 million from the acquired TCF loan book, offset against $145 million of reserve release from the legacy Huntington book. Detailed loan and credit marks related to TCF are included on Slide 25 of the appendix.
Liquidity remained elevated as we continue to see growth in deposit balances. This gives us ample opportunity to deploy into incremental lending opportunities and securities to support net interest income growth in the coming quarters. Additionally, we fully exited the capital protection hedging position that utilize interest rate caps, closing out a very useful hedge and replacing them with alternative capital protection tools which have less earnings volatility as they qualify for hedge accounting. Finally, common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.97%.
Turning to Slide 8. FTE net interest income increased, primarily driven by the addition of TCF in the quarter. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest margin decreased 82 basis points to 2.66%, primarily driven from the net change in the interest rate caps from the prior quarter.
Looking for a moment at the underlying NIM dynamics. The impact in the second quarter from the mark-to-market on the caps was negative 17 basis points, while we saw 3 basis points benefit from purchase accounting accretion. Therefore, the underlying NIM, excluding the caps in PAA, was approximately 2.8% for the second quarter. This compares to 2.98% on the same basis in the prior quarter. As we have noted in previous calls, we had expected a reduction in NIM into Q2, driven in part by a 9 basis point step-down in the benefit of our existing interest rate hedging positions as well as forecasted PPP dynamics and yield curve impacts on spread.
At the Morgan Stanley conference in June, we guided to a second quarter NIM in the low 2.80s. The underlying second quarter NIM of 2.80% was a few basis points below expectations due to the additional impact of excess liquidity as deposits yet again increased in the quarter and elevated Fed caps represented an 18 basis point drag on the NIM in the quarter.
Looking ahead, we continue to expect Q2 to be the low point for NIM for the year, driving a positive trend will be the addition of TCF assets that will benefit margin as we get a full quarter impact of those acquired assets in the third quarter. Also the continued execution of our balance sheet optimization program will provide benefits from our ongoing focus on funding cost optimization, asset mix and customer level pricing. And over time, we expect the elevated liquidity levels that I mentioned to normalize, reducing that 18 basis point drag back down to 0 as it does.
These positive factors will offset some continued spread pressure from competition for high-quality assets and the absolute level of interest rates as well as impacts from the roll-off of hedges, as illustrated on the next slide. All told, these changes are expected to bring us to a net interest margin in the 2.90s next quarter. Our outlook continues to point to NIM stability at approximately those levels for the foreseeable future going forward.
Turning to Slide 9. In the second quarter, the interest rate caps resulted in a $55 million negative mark-to-market driven by lower rates at quarter end. However, cumulatively, over the life of these caps, the strategy was highly effective and resulted in a $94 million pretax gain, $75 million net of tax, but as we intended, offset approximately 46% of the negative impact on capital from rising rates. As the securities portfolio gradually grew during the last 2 quarters and prepayment speeds on that portfolio have reduced, we now have the opportunity to utilize a more traditional hedging structure to accomplish the same capital protection objective.
Hence, we fully exited the caps during the second quarter and replaced them with $4 billion of forward starting swaps, which qualify for hedge accounting and reduce earnings volatility while achieving a similar level of capital protection. Additionally, we moved $4.5 billion of securities available for sale into held for maturity during the quarter in order to further minimize volatility in OCI as a result of the changes in interest rates.
Turning to Slide 10. Average loan balances increased by 9% year-over-year driven by the added TCF balances and continued growth in our consumer loan portfolios. Period-end loan balances ended the second quarter at $112 billion. We continue to have near record origination levels in our consumer portfolios in the second quarter with RV/Marine, automobile and residential mortgage all continuing to post sequential quarter growth. Despite the inventory constraints in auto and RV/Marine, consumer demand remains very high, driving continued strength in originations. The same can be said for home lending, where origination activity is quite robust despite ongoing home inventory constraints.
The calling activity and origination volumes in the commercial portfolios also continued to be robust. However, overall commercial growth is constrained by pressure on utilization rates. Auto dealer floor plan balances remained a headwind in the quarter, driven by inventory supply constraints. But we're optimistic that we're nearing the floor for these balances. The outlook is expected to slowly recover from these levels as OEMs deliver increased inventory to dealers.
The inventory finance business from TCF has been facing a similar headwind as inventory levels have been depressed and outstandings have been near multiyear lows. Commercial utilization rates for our middle market and corporate portfolios remained relatively stable in the second quarter. Cumulatively, these 3 areas of commercial lending combined represent $5 billion to $6 billion of incremental loan growth opportunity as utilization rates recover.
With respect to investment securities, we completed a repositioning of the acquired TCF portfolio to improve both yields and to reduce duration. We also deployed an incremental $4 billion of excess liquidity into additional securities. Inclusive of these actions, the securities portfolio ended the quarter at $35 billion. Given the level of excess liquidity we had at quarter end, we would expect to grow the securities portfolio incrementally by approximately $4 billion over the remainder of 2021.
Slide 11 provides an update on PPP. In total, we originated $11.4 billion of PPP loans, inclusive of TCF's activity. We continue to expect approximately 85% of balances from the programs to ultimately be forgiven. PPP loans totaled $4.2 billion at quarter end, with a significant acceleration in the pace of forgiveness during June. We anticipate forgiveness of the majority of balances to be completed in the second half of the year, with a portion trailing into early 2022.
Turning to Slide 12. Average total deposits increased 13% sequentially due to the acquisition of TCF and increased customer liquidity levels at Huntington. We continue to leverage excess liquidity to manage wholesale funding balances and costs lower.
Slide 13 illustrates the strength of our capital and liquidity ratios. As I mentioned, common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.97% and is near the top of our 9% to 10% operating guideline. These strong capital levels, coupled with the ongoing economic recovery and our merger integration proceeding as planned, gave us confidence to relaunch our share buyback program earlier than previously expected. The Board has authorized $800 million of common stock repurchases over the next 4 quarters that will likely be overweighted towards the earlier part of that time.
Our capital plan entails managing our CET1 ratio towards the lower half of our 9% to 10% operating range over the medium term. This plan is supported by our finalization of the marks on the acquired portfolio and our confidence in the pro forma earnings power and return on capital profile of the company.
Slide 14 provides a view of our allowance for credit losses. The second quarter ending ACL represents 2.08% of total loans, down from 2.17% at prior quarter end. The allowance includes the previously mentioned TCF credit mark, which was partially offset by an 8% reserve release on the legacy Huntington portfolio.
Slide 15 provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter. Our overall credit performance remained strong. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 28 basis points of average loans and leases below our 35 to 55 basis point through-the-cycle average target range. Consumer charge-offs were quite low this quarter at just 2 basis points as auto and home equity portfolios both reported net recoveries. Year-to-date, consumer net charge-offs have been 9 basis points.
Our criticized assets and NPA ratios were both modestly higher as a result of the TCF acquired portfolios. These portfolios came over as expected consistent with our detailed due diligence work, and we remain comfortable with the acquired book. The ACL coverage on NPAs is strong at 229%.
Finally, turning to our outlook on Slide 16. We've provided a set of medium-term financial targets, including a 17% return on tangible common equity, a 56% efficiency ratio while remaining committed to investing in our people-first digitally powered strategy. These metrics, in addition to sustainable top line revenue growth, slightly above nominal GDP will drive earnings per share growth over time. Our efficiency ratio will benefit from expense synergies from the TCF acquisition and incorporates our commitment to continued investment in technology and digital capabilities.
Annual positive operating leverage remains a core principle of our strategy. We believe these metrics, revenue growth, return on capital and annual positive operating leverage, are a compelling set of financial performance indicators and closely aligns with value creation for our shareholders.
Now let me turn it back over to Mark, and we'll get to your questions."

This is Zach. I'll take that one. So 2 big messages I would offer to you. One is on an underlying Huntington basis, as you noted, very much executing to our prior plan, which has been elevated levels of expense in the first 2 quarters of the year driven by our investments, bringing that growth rate back down into the low single digits by the second half of the year.
Everything that we're completely executing to that plan is everything I've seen in terms of forecast for standalone Huntington and our track up until the close of the acquisition mid-June was very much corroborating that. In fact, Q2 was coming in a bit lower in terms of overall expense growth, and the outlook continues to be as we disclosed.
And then secondly, the TCF cost synergies are very much on track, and we're executing on that as we speak. The branch rationalization, as Steve noted in his comments throughout the way, the systems conversion is planned, personnel decisions are finalized. We've completed a lot of the vendor conversion exceedingly progress on real estate consolidations.
So the majority of those cost saves from the TCF acquisition will benefit 2022, which was the full run rate of being present in the back half of the year and as we go into '23. Excluding onetime costs, which clearly would be noisy on an organic basis, we expect a step-up into Q3 as we get a full quarter of the TCF expense base. And then from there, beginning in Q4 and over the next 6 quarters, see gradual reductions each quarter as the synergies are realized pretty steady, no major step-down to this point in our outlook."

I'll take it. Just a couple of things I would share with you. One, to answer your question about kind of the underlying Huntington growth, and I will caveat to say that we're deeply integrating the businesses at this point. So over time, it will be more and more difficult for us to kind of disaggregate in this way. But generally, what we were seeing was consumer growth kind of close to 1% and commercial growth just slightly less than flat. So overall, it was pretty flat, particularly when you strip out the decline in PPP quarter-to-quarter.
Going forward and more importantly, I think the 2 dynamics that we've been seeing and we tried to kind of illustrate in the prepared remarks, continue to be very much the thing to focus on. Firstly, new production is quite strong, at or better than our plan on the consumer side. Surprising continued strength in mortgage and auto.
And then on the commercial side, record calling activities driving pipelines, both sequentially from Q1, but I would also say, very, very healthy growth versus 2019. And so it's giving us a lot of confidence in where new production is going. And it's really just a question of watching, therefore, the second factor, which is the impact of the elevated liquidity in the system and supply chain issues on existing line utilization.
And so I think the net outcome of this from what we're seeing is probably about 1% additional growth pressure in the back half of this year. Whereas at the beginning of the year, I guided for 1% to 3% loan growth. And then by June, at the Morgan Stanley conference, we talked about sort of the low end of that range. My expectation now is sort of roughly flat on average in the second half of the year, with growth really starting to rebound as we get out into 2022 and go forward.
I think there's some pretty clear signs for optimism here. I think on the places where there are supply chains are really pressuring inventory utilization in auto and certainly in the new TCF-acquired inventory finance book. We're seeing OEM production increase and our clients want to use these lines. So I think over the course of '22 into '23, we'll see that $5 billion to $6 billion come back. And the new production really shows no signs of slowing down at this point. So we're bullish about the future, and I think the -- throughout the course of '22, you'll see those conditions improve."

We've continued to innovate over the last decade, all-day deposit and more recently, Safety Zone a year ago at this time and different things.
So we're disrupting ourselves against the game plan of trying to be the premier consumer bank in our footprint. And I think we're achieving that. I think in the last 9 years, we've had 6 J.D. Power #1s in Consumer Banking in our footprint. You have the 3 mobile apps in a row. Like what we're seeing, we're not done. We have some really interesting ideas that we'll be working on through this year and well into next to further distinguish and provide growth opportunities for us.
Now in the context of TCF, I see a fair banking philosophy just as a huge advantage for that customer base. And I think from the early reaction of our new colleagues from TCF and the branches, they're wildly enthusiastic. And I think the customer base will be as well. I see that as a big growth opportunity for us, including our capacity to cross-sell.
So the operating processes, procedures, et cetera, we have, complemented by our Fair Play products and this emphasis and focus on customer service, I think is going to make our combination incredibly powerful on the consumer side. I'm very bullish there. And we're competing with -- we've been competing with fintechs and the larger banks in our footprint for years. It's actually made us better. So we're -- we look forward to continuing to adapt and innovate and yet grow on the consumer banking business."

And frankly, internally, what we're very much focused on ensuring we have visibility as well. And what I'm watching is I think the same thing as you should, which is the sequential loan growth from where we stand today, as I mentioned, I think it will be somewhat flattish here in the back half of the year, but I do think the conditions will be improving and we're watching that line utilization. That drag, as it goes away, will kind of reveal the underlying strength in the new production will, I think, be the driver. That's sort of point one.
Point 2 is the NIM, that as we talked about, our expectation is in the 2.90s. I think that will move potentially based on the pace of the deposit runoff and that kind of 18 basis points of elevated liquidity drag coming off. I have confidence in our forecast, with lot of actions and specific plans to drive it. But I think that's the thing I would watch secondly.
Third, we haven't talked about it a lot here, but fees are a real bright spot for us in terms of the strategic focus areas for our strategy and the growth that is driving principally in those 4 areas I mentioned in my comments. Carbon payments just debit in the commercial card, business cards just on fire. Treasury management continued to track forward very, very well. Our capital markets business is growing very nicely year-over-year and sequentially. And then wealth and investments, which are seeing record sales activity and really strong revenue growth as well. So I watch those very carefully.
And then I think lastly, the expenses. I think we got a question earlier about the trajectory of expenses. I do think it will pop up just from a kind of calendarization perspective into the third quarter as we have a full quarter of TCF. But then you'll see it every quarter tick down on a nominal basis over the next few quarters as our synergies are realized on kind of wave-by-wave basis. And then getting to that run rate level of performance that are in our medium-term targets as we get into the second half of '22 and as we certainly go into the full year of '23. So that's our operating plan, and that's certainly what I urge you to take focus on as well."

And I think the credit environment that we're envisioning and taking part is, on credit, we're going to continue tracking forward of benefits. As Rich just noted in his answer just a few moments ago, that probably will represent some incremental reserve releases here, mainly in the back half of '21, I would expect.

And at that point, everybody is going to keep floor plan levels lower. The car companies were going to be more judicious in trying to get pricing versus volume, and that lasted for a couple of quarters, right? There is a volume share gain that history has shown that the OEMs want. And they have the ability to push delivery. It's not just the dealers pulling it.
So we believe over time, the floor plan inventories will essentially get back to where there were. A lot of the deals, particularly in the slow rate environment, would love to have a lot more inventory. And they're getting deliveries and in a good percentage of the cases, those are presolved. So they're going to lap very briefly. And there's still a phenomenon where people come in thinking they know what they want, but they're -- once they experience the next version of or the additional features that are available in the car that there's a sales process and generally a selection that still have some physical components to that.
So I think the dealers will be essentially in the position they were back in '18 and '19 over time. Now I don't think that's a '21 and it may not even fully be in '22. But by '23, we think that, that will be normalized, assuming the pandemic stays under control."

We delivered good core performance and made enormous progress with the TCF integration. Let me begin on Slide 3. Thanks to the hard work of our colleagues. We're on track to complete the TCF integration as planned and delivered the resulting deal economics. This combination adds scale, density, new markets and new specialty businesses. At the core of Huntington, we are a purpose-driven company with a vision to build the leading people-first, digitally powered bank in the nation. We remain focused on our core objectives to drive organic growth and to deliver sustainable top quartile financial performance. 
On Slide 4, our third quarter performance has included a full quarter benefit from TCF and record total revenue. We delivered good growth in fee income, that loan growth, excluding PPP and improving credit metrics. 
Just over a week ago, we successfully completed the conversion of TCF to Huntington Systems and we now offer an integrated set of products, capabilities and experiences to our customers. As a result of the great efforts of our colleagues, we were able to complete the conversion in just 10 months since the announcement of the transaction. We've completed most of the actions to drive our targeted cost synergies and are on track to deliver all of the announced cost reductions. With the conversion behind us, we're now able to focus us on colleagues on new business development activities to close up here strong and carry that momentum into '22. We are investing in these revenue-producing colleagues as well as new capabilities in the expanded markets. We're seeing substantial momentum in many of our initiatives, including targeted areas of fee revenue generation like wealth and capital markets as well as cards and payments. Both consumer and commercial loan production continued to be robust and commercial pipelines are up over 30% from a year ago and new production activity has nearly doubled. 
Additionally, we were pleased to be ranked #1 nationally for the SBA 7(a) lending by volume, marking the fourth consecutive year we've been recognized in the [ top 5 ]. As the recovery continues, we will dynamically manage our overall expense base and look for ways to drive incremental efficiencies across the bank. We intend to self-fund the investment capacity necessary for strategic initiatives that will drive additional revenue growth in the years ahead. Our strategy is centered on supporting customers' banking where and when they want and meeting them through their preferred channel. As part of that strategy, we are continually optimizing our distribution network. We will be consolidating 62 branches in the first quarter of '22, equal to 6% of the combined branch network. And these are in addition to the 188 branch closures announced as part of the TCM transaction. 
Importantly, we will continue to retain the #1 share of branches in both Ohio and Michigan. In addition to branch consolidations, we are continuing to diligently optimize roles and resources within the bank. We're committed to delivering positive operating leverage as we did annually for a decade leading up to '21. 
Finally, on the capital front. We accelerated our share repurchase in the quarter as well as announced an increase to the quarterly dividend. These actions demonstrate our confidence in the performance and outlook for Huntington as well as our commitment to our shareholders to actively manage our capital levels. 
Slide 5 provides an update on the TCF integration. When we announced the transaction, we saw strong potential for expense synergies as we leverage the benefits of scale, but to also drive additional organic growth. And today, I can say that we're even more excited about the revenue opportunities in front of us. 
The combination of new growth markets and increased density, the addition of more than 1.5 million customers and expanded specialty capabilities collectively set up our future revenue growth. Let me share a couple of the most compelling aspects. In middle market and in corporate banking, we're now bringing greater scale in Chicago, Milwaukee in addition to new capabilities in the Twin Cities and Denver. With expanded coverage and product offerings, we're already gaining traction with early wins, including capital markets and treasury management fees. In Consumer and Business Banking, we're deploying Huntington's capabilities, products and services across the entire customer base following conversion. Combined with our fair play philosophy, this will greatly enhance the customer experience, and as we've demonstrated previously, we'll accelerate customer acquisition and improved retention. And with Huntington's digital and competitive product set, we will deepen our customer relationships. 
Additionally, we are bringing award-winning SBA lending platform and growing our wealth and private banking customer base in our newly expanded markets. Our investments are well timed as we're seeing continued robust economic recovery in our footprint. Our regions have seen economic activity expand year-to-date faster than the national average as well as higher labor force participation. We see a unique moment in time to capitalize on these revenue opportunities as our local economies continue to perform very well. We are entering a new era at Huntington with momentum, and we look forward to growth in the years ahead. 
Zach, over you to provide more detail on our financial performance."

Turning to Slide 6. We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.22 for the third quarter, which included acquisition expenses of $234 million. Earnings per common share adjusted for these notable items were",1312,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.22 for the third quarter, which included acquisition expenses of $234 million. Earnings per common share adjusted for these notable items were $0.35. Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came in at 11.5% for the quarter. Adjusted for the acquisition-related notable items, ROTCE was 17.9%. As we expected and consistent with guidance we provided in September, we were pleased to see loan balances ex PPP grow in the third quarter, driven by robust new production. With continued strong liquidity, we are actively managing the balance sheet and have grown the securities portfolio by $3.7 billion from the end of the second quarter.
Deposit balances were reduced by $847 million as a result of the branch divestiture. Excluding the divestiture, deposit balances remained relatively stable on a period-end basis. Loans associated with the divestiture totaled $209 million. 
Fee income was another bright spot, where we continue -- where we saw continued momentum in our capital markets, cards and payments, treasury management and wealth and investment businesses. As Steve noted, we've been actively managing our capital, and we're pleased to complete $500 million of share repurchases in the third quarter. We also announced a $0.05 increase in the common stock dividend in the fourth quarter, which takes us to an annualized dividend rate of $0.62 per share. Finally, credit quality continued to improve with net charge-offs of 20 basis points, while nonperforming assets decreased 12% from the prior quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. In Period-end loan balances totaled $110.6 million. Excluding PPP, loan balances increased by $367 million during the quarter, with underlying growth in C&I, mortgage, auto and RV Marine portfolios. On the commercial side, while PPP and auto dealer floor plan balance lower, all other C&I loans increased by a net $466 million during the quarter, driven by growth in asset finance and core C&I. We're seeing very encouraging trends from new commercial loan production and pipelines that continue to grow both year-over-year and sequentially. Consumer growth was somewhat offset by marginal pressure from the continued runoff of the home equity portfolio. 
Additionally, we continue to observe solid activity levels in our consumer portfolios with residential mortgage, RV Marine and automobile, all continuing to post sequential quarter balance growth. Auto saw its strongest third quarter for production activity to date with -- while mortgage continued to see robust origination activity in the quarter. 
Excluding PPP, we believe the trough for underlying loan balances is behind us, and we expect continued modest growth from these levels in the fourth quarter. With respect to commercial portfolio specifically, we expect to see momentum accelerate as we move through the fourth quarter and throughout 2022. 
Moving on to Slide 8. As noted previously, total deposit balances, excluding the divestiture, were relatively stable. We continue to optimize funding given our strong liquidity levels and reduced higher cost CDs by $395 million. Overall, we continue to see much of the excess liquidity remain fairly sticky as core commercial deposit balances increased during the quarter.
Turning to Slide 9. FTE net interest income increased primarily driven by the full quarter benefit of TCF. Net interest income increased by $323 million, while net interest margin was 2.9%, both driven by the acquired TCF assets. Excess liquidity moderated slightly during the quarter with $8.1 billion of cash at the Fed at quarter end. On an average basis for the quarter, excess liquidity represented a drag on margin of approximately 23 basis points. Core net interest income, excluding PPP and accretion, was $1.085 billion. We expect core net interest income to grow from these levels on an absolute dollar basis in the fourth quarter and throughout 2022. We're positioned to be asset sensitive today, and we are dynamically managing the balance sheet to become increasingly asset-sensitive to capture the benefit from expected future higher interest rates. This includes the hedge roll-offs as well as the addition of pay-fixed swaps. 
On June 30, our modeled net interest income asset sensitivity and an up 100 basis point scenario was 2.9%. Based on the deliberate actions we took during the quarter, we increased our asset sensitivity to 4.0%, and we continue to dynamically manage the balance sheet going forward. Over the course of the quarter, we terminated select downside rate protection hedges and added $6 billion of forward pay fixed swaps.
Turning to Slide 10. Noninterest income increased, primarily driven by the addition of TCF fee income. Several of our businesses performed quite well within the quarter. Cards and payments benefited from higher customer transaction volumes, mortgage banking performed well due to higher production and relatively higher saleable spreads and wealth and investment continued to be driven by positive net asset flows. Capital markets income also grew, driven by solid performance in interest rate derivatives, foreign exchange and syndications. 
Turning to Slide 11. Total noninterest expense came in at approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter, including the $234 million of notable items. Excluding these items, noninterest expense totaled $1.05 billion, primarily driven by the full quarter of TCF expenses. Our overall outlook for the magnitude of expense reductions is unchanged from prior guidance. The timing to read these benefits, however, has accelerated due to our actions to drive realization of cost savings. As a result, we continue to expect that while Q3 was the high watermark for core expenses, they should benefit earlier than we previously thought as they step down into the fourth and first quarters. 
Core expenses on an absolute dollar basis should trail down throughout 2022, as we recognize the benefits of the TCF cost synergies while continuing to invest in the initiatives to drive top line revenue growth.
Slide 12 highlights our well-capitalized balance sheet as well as a few highlights from the recent capital return actions. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.6%, well within our medium-term 9% to 10% operating guideline. Over the past quarter, we focused on returning capital to our shareholders in alignment with our capital priorities. We executed over half of the $800 million share repurchase program following the authorization as they moved in, and we are pleased to have recently announced an increase to the common stock dividend. 
As you can see on Slide 13, our quarter ending allowance for credit losses represented 1.99% of total loans, down from 2.08% at prior quarter end. The improved economic outlook and our stable credit quality resulted in a reserve release of $117 million for the third quarter. Additional key credit quality metrics are shown on Slide 14, further reflecting our improving credit profile. Net charge-offs represented an annualized 20 basis points of average loans and leases, amongst the lowest levels in recent history, well below our target range of 35 to 55 basis points on average through the cycle. Consumer charge-offs remained low in this quarter of 7 basis points with net recoveries in auto, home equity, RV and Marine. Our NPA ratio declined 12% as portfolios continue to perform as expected, and the ACL coverage of NPAs increased to 247%. 
Finally, turning to our outlook on Slide 15. As we operate in a dynamic macro environment, we're focused on managing what we can control. We remain committed to investing in our people-first digitally powered strategy, driving sustained revenue growth while managing expenses within our long-term commitment to positive operating leverage and achieving a 17% return on tangible common equity. We expect a peer group leading efficiency ratio and a normalized effective tax rate of 18% to 19%. We believe these key metrics: revenue growth, return on capital and annual positive operating leverage are a compelling set of financial performance indicators and closely aligned with value creation for our shareholders.

I think it's really driven by the continuation of the factors we've seen for the last several quarters, and we noted a bit in the prepared remarks, that is really strong calling activity and pipelines driving continued robust new production in commercial and quite a bit of momentum in business banking and then in the consumer space, continued strength in residential mortgage and auto and RV Marine continues to perform pretty well also.

We'll see where it goes from here. I do -- if liquidity trends continue as we expect, I also expect that we will add some additional securities in the fourth quarter. We're currently at about 22% securities as a percentage of assets and we'd be comfortable if that rose modestly over time here, given the acceptable returns we're seeing and the fact that it's accretive to NAV versus holding that cash.

The 2 biggest drivers of that were the things we've just talked about in the last question, actually, interestingly, elevated Fed cash contributed several basis points additional drag in the quarter than we had previously expected. And we did accelerate the purchase of our securities, which also impacted the mix and drove yields lower. Generally, spreads were sort of spot on our expectation of relative at a core loan level. 
Look, I think what I would tell you is, going forward, I'm expecting stable from these levels. It will be a function of what happens with the elevated liquidity and Fed cash and the rate environment. but generally stable from these levels is a fair assumption. And our key focus at this point is trying to drive net interest income dollars at $1.85 billion of net interest income, excluding PAA, excluding PPP, given the sequential loan growth that we're projecting, given that rate stability might effectively going to grow those dollars into Q4 and grow them throughout 2022."

And interestingly, inventory finance has similar opportunities where we're creating some very known planned uses of those lines. So expect stability and perhaps even a modest uptick actually into Q4 that the general middle market should continue to be flat here for the time being. 
However, I'm going to pay to answer your question, but I would -- pulling back a second, I would just highlight that it's our planning expectation at this point. That the totality of these lines is going to be relatively flat throughout the course of '22. There could well be an opportunity against that. But at this point, for planning purposes, we're trying to 0 that out. But we still expect pretty good loan growth. And I think that's really just sort of pointing back to the robust new production activity that we're seeing.

And upon conversion that we completed over the Columbus Day weekend, all the TCF customers are now on to the Huntington products, the platform and all of our Fair Play product dynamics. And so we will expect to see a modestly lower trajectory for that line in to Q4. Overall, over the longer term, we feel great about the conversion to the Fair Play business, as we've talked about a lot. And this is a play we have run many times, and we're very confident in the returns that it generated. Typically, the dynamic is sort of a higher degree of fee income reduction in the early periods, offset over time by incremental deepening and incremental acquisition in the market from those products, generally about an 18-month payback. And so sort of the dynamic can you see a bit lower into Q4 and then clawing back and paying back over that kind of roughly 1.5 years period."

And as I think you saw with the Ford GM earnings announcements, expectations that's going to go deep into next year before it gets normalized. So that's why Zach's earlier comment is we're not counting on utilization, normalization and inventory finance or auto to be a tailwind next year. If it happens, that's great. 
Now we do see supply chain issues, getting results are getting to a resolution over time and would expect that to continue again through next year, maybe even a little bit beyond, depending on the industry. But there's a lot of activity in the footprint about tooling and additional manufacturing capabilities in -- with adjacency in North America, including in the footprint states that we're in. 
So we like how this sets up over time in terms of additional opportunity for us, and we're bullish, but we clearly have both the supply chain and a labor issue in virtually every business that's out there today."

Given the labor issues, I think there is a bigger push to automate production to garner that productivity that will offset some of the labor issues. The other thing that we're seeing is just a heightened level of M&A. I think as we're coming out of kind of the COVID fog here with respect to EBITDA levels and things. There's just a greater sense of certainty around cash flows, and I think buyers are aggressively looking to expand if they can, and sellers. I think some of them have just gotten a little tired kind of going through a COVID environment and when their cash flows are picking back up the position where maybe they want to sell.

The decisions around them and the planning and actions necessary to achieve them have essentially all been completed, and now we're in the execution mode of just realizing them.

And we're continuing to do certain things to help our customers. Standby cash is a classic example of that. There's no limit to the use of that, those funds with our customers. We put a bit of $50 in last year for an overdraft, we called that safety zone. So we have been continuously over time working to benefit our customers as part of the fair play banking philosophy. We tend to be very strong on a relative basis in terms of customer acquisition as a constant lense of the different features and functions on our checking products. And that's ameliorated the revenue give up over the last decade or so very, very substantially. As Zach pointed out, there will be a bit of a step down in the fourth quarter for a couple of quarters thereafter for the TCF customers, but they're going to get the same advantage of products and services that all of our previously existing customers have as well. So -- and it will accompany our expectation around both customer retention and customer acquisition. It's hard to -- it's -- I can't speculate on what regulators they do, but we've -- again, we've been trying to do things to help consumers and businesses for quite some time, not just with overdraft fees, but other types of fee eliminations, reductions, notice requirements, we put in new alert system in that regard 1.5 years ago. So there's a lot of tools available to help customers manage their money, budget, et cetera, and avoid overdraft fees."

Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our third quarter. We delivered good core performance and made enormous progress with the TCF integration. Let me begin on Slide 3. Thanks to the hard work of our colleagues. We're on track to com",872,"Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our third quarter. We delivered good core performance and made enormous progress with the TCF integration. Let me begin on Slide 3. Thanks to the hard work of our colleagues. We're on track to complete the TCF integration as planned and delivered the resulting deal economics. This combination adds scale, density, new markets and new specialty businesses. 
At the core of Huntington, we are a purpose-driven company with a vision to build the leading people-first, digitally powered bank in the nation. We remain focused on our core objectives to drive organic growth and to deliver sustainable top quartile financial performance.  
On Slide 4, our third quarter performance has included a full quarter benefit from TCF and a record total revenue. We delivered good growth in fee income, that loan growth, excluding PPP and improving credit metrics.  
Just over a week ago, we successfully completed the conversion of TCF to Huntington Systems and we now offer an integrated set of products, capabilities and experiences to our customers. As a result of the great efforts of our colleagues, we were able to complete the conversion in just 10 months since the announcement of the transaction. We've completed most of the actions to drive our targeted cost synergies and are on track to deliver all of the announced cost reductions. 
With the conversion behind us, we're now able to focus us on colleagues on new business development activities to close up here strong and carry that momentum into '22. We are investing in these revenue-producing colleagues as well as new capabilities in the expanded markets. 
We're seeing substantial momentum in many of our initiatives, including targeted areas of fee revenue generation like wealth and capital markets as well as cards and payments. Both consumer and commercial loan production continued to be robust and commercial pipelines are up over 30% from a year ago and new production activity has nearly doubled.  
Additionally, we were pleased to be ranked #1 nationally for the SBA 7(a) lending by volume, marking the fourth consecutive year we've been recognized in the top 5. As the recovery continues, we will dynamically manage our overall expense base and look for ways to drive incremental efficiencies across the bank. 
We intend to self-fund the investment capacity necessary for strategic initiatives that will drive additional revenue growth in the years ahead. Our strategy is centered on supporting customers' banking where and when they want and meeting them through their preferred channel. 
As part of that strategy, we are continually optimizing our distribution network. We will be consolidating 62 branches in the first quarter of '22, equal to 6% of the combined branch network. And these are in addition to the 188 branch closures announced as part of the TCM transaction.  
Importantly, we will continue to retain the #1 share of branches in both Ohio and Michigan. In addition to branch consolidations, we are continuing to diligently optimize roles and resources within the bank. We're committed to delivering positive operating leverage as we did annually for a decade leading up to '21.  
Finally, on the capital front. We accelerated our share repurchase in the quarter as well as announced an increase to the quarterly dividend. These actions demonstrate our confidence in the performance and outlook for Huntington as well as our commitment to our shareholders to actively manage our capital levels.  
Slide 5 provides an update on the TCF integration. When we announced the transaction, we saw strong potential for expense synergies as we leverage the benefits of scale, but to also drive additional organic growth. And today, I can say that we're even more excited about the revenue opportunities in front of us.  
The combination of new growth markets and increased density, the addition of more than 1.5 million customers and expanded specialty capabilities collectively set up our future revenue growth. Let me share a couple of the most compelling aspects in middle market and in corporate banking, we're now bringing greater scale in Chicago, Milwaukee in addition to new capabilities in the Twin Cities and Denver. 
With expanded coverage and product offerings, we're already gaining traction with early wins, including capital markets and treasury management fees. In Consumer and Business Banking, we're deploying Huntington's capabilities, products and services across the entire customer base following conversion. 
Combined with our fair play philosophy, this will greatly enhance the customer experience, and as we've demonstrated previously, we'll accelerate customer acquisition and improved retention. And with Huntington's digital and competitive product set, we will deepen our customer relationships.  
Additionally, we are bringing award-winning SBA lending platform and growing our wealth and private banking customer base in our newly expanded markets. Our investments are well timed as we're seeing continued robust economic recovery in our footprint. Our regions have seen economic activity expand year-to-date faster than the national average as well as higher labor force participation. 
We see a unique moment in time to capitalize on these revenue opportunities as our local economies continue to perform very well. We are entering a new era at Huntington with momentum, and we look forward to growth in the years ahead.  
Zach, over you to provide more detail on our financial performance."

We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.22 for the third quarter, which included acquisition expenses of $234 million. Earnings per common share adjusted for these notable items were $0.35. Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came in at 11.5% for the quarter. Adjusted for the acquisition-related notable items, ROTCE was 17.9%. As we expected and consistent with guidance we provided in September, we were pleased to see loan balances ex-PPP grow in the third quarter, driven by robust new production. 
With continued strong liquidity, we are actively managing the balance sheet and have grown the securities portfolio by $3.7 billion from the end of the second quarter. 
Deposit balances were reduced by $847 million as a result of the branch divestiture. Excluding the divestiture, deposit balances remained relatively stable on a period-end basis. Loans associated with the divestiture totaled $209 million.  
Fee income was another bright spot, where we continue -- where we saw continued momentum in our capital markets, cards and payments, treasury management and wealth and investment businesses. As Steve noted, we've been actively managing our capital, and we're pleased to complete $500 million of share repurchases in the third quarter. We also announced a $0.05 increase in the common stock dividend in the fourth quarter, which takes us to an annualized dividend rate of $0.62 per share.  
Finally, credit quality continued to improve with net charge-offs of 20 basis points, while nonperforming assets decreased 12% from the prior quarter.  
Turning to Slide 7. Period-end loan balances totaled $110.6 million. Excluding PPP, loan balances increased by $367 million during the quarter, with underlying growth in C&I, mortgage, auto and RV/Marine portfolios. On the commercial side, while PPP and auto dealer floor plan balances were lower, all other C&I loans increased by a net $466 million during the quarter, driven by growth in asset finance and core C&I. 
We're seeing very encouraging trends from new commercial loan production and pipelines that continue to grow both year-over-year and sequentially. Consumer growth was somewhat offset by marginal pressure from the continued runoff of the home equity portfolio.  
Additionally, we continue to observe solid activity levels in our consumer portfolios with residential mortgage, RV/Marine and automobile, all continuing to post sequential quarter balance growth. Auto saw its strongest third quarter for production activity to date with -- while mortgage continued to see robust origination activity in the quarter.  
Excluding PPP, we believe the trough for underlying loan balances is behind us, and we expect continued modest growth from these levels in the fourth quarter. With respect to commercial portfolio specifically, we expect to see momentum accelerate as we move through the fourth quarter and throughout 2022.  
Moving on to Slide 8. As noted previously, total deposit balances, excluding the divestiture, were relatively stable. We continue to optimize funding given our strong liquidity levels and reduced higher cost CDs by $395 million. Overall, we continue to see much of the excess liquidity remain fairly sticky as core commercial deposit balances increased during the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 9. FTE net interest income increased primarily driven by the full quarter benefit of TCF. Net interest income increased by $323 million, while net interest margin was 2.9%, both driven by the acquired TCF assets. Excess liquidity moderated slightly during the quarter with $8.1 billion of cash at the Fed at quarter end. On an average basis for the quarter, excess liquidity represented a drag on margin of approximately 23 basis points. 
Core net interest income, excluding PPP and accretion, was $1.085 billion. We expect core net interest income to grow from these levels on an absolute dollar basis in the fourth quarter and throughout 2022. We're positioned to be asset sensitive today, and we are dynamically managing the balance sheet to become increasingly asset-sensitive to capture the benefit from expected future higher interest rates. This includes the hedge roll-offs as well as the addition of pay-fixed swaps.  
On June 30, our modeled net interest income asset sensitivity and an up 100 basis point scenario was 2.9%. Based on the deliberate actions we took during the quarter, we increased our asset sensitivity to 4.0%, and we continue to dynamically manage the balance sheet going forward. Over the course of the quarter, we terminated select downside rate protection hedges and added $6 billion of forward pay fixed swaps. 
Turning to Slide 10. Noninterest income increased, primarily driven by the addition of TCF fee income. Several of our businesses performed quite well within the quarter. Cards and payments benefited from higher customer transaction volumes, mortgage banking performed well due to higher production and relatively higher saleable spreads and wealth and investment continued to be driven by positive net asset flows. 
Capital markets income also grew, driven by solid performance in interest rate derivatives, foreign exchange and syndications. Turning to Slide 11. Total noninterest expense came in at approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter, including the $234 million of notable items. Excluding these items, noninterest expense totaled $1.05 billion, primarily driven by the full quarter of TCF expenses. Our overall outlook for the magnitude of expense reductions is unchanged from prior guidance. 
The timing to realize these benefits, however, has accelerated due to our actions to drive realization of cost savings. As a result, we continue to expect that while Q3 was the high watermark for core expenses, they should benefit earlier than we previously thought as they step down into the fourth and first quarters.  
Core expenses on an absolute dollar basis should trail down throughout 2022, as we recognize the benefits of the TCF cost synergies while continuing to invest in the initiatives to drive top line revenue growth. 
Slide 12 highlights our well-capitalized balance sheet as well as a few highlights from the recent capital return actions. Common equity Tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.6%, well within our medium-term 9% to 10% operating guideline. Over the past quarter, we focused on returning capital to our shareholders in alignment with our capital priorities.
 We executed over half of the $800 million share repurchase program following the authorization as they moved in, and we are pleased to have recently announced an increase to the common stock dividend.  
As you can see on Slide 13, our quarter ending allowance for credit losses represented 1.99% of total loans, down from 2.08% at prior quarter end. The improved economic outlook and our stable credit quality resulted in a reserve release of $117 million for the third quarter. Additional key credit quality metrics are shown on Slide 14, further reflecting our improving credit profile. 
Net charge-offs represented an annualized 20 basis points of average loans and leases, amongst the lowest levels in recent history, well below our target range of 35 to 55 basis points on average through the cycle.  
Consumer charge-offs remained low in this quarter of 7 basis points with net recoveries in auto, home equity, RV and Marine. Our NPA ratio declined 12% as portfolios continue to perform as expected, and the ACL coverage of NPAs increased to 247%. 
Finally, turning to our outlook on Slide 15. As we operate in a dynamic macro environment, we're focused on managing what we can control. We remain committed to investing in our people-first digitally powered strategy, driving sustained revenue growth while managing expenses within our long-term commitment to positive operating leverage and achieving a 17% return on tangible common equity. 
We expect a peer group leading efficiency ratio and a normalized effective tax rate of 18% to 19%. We believe these key metrics: revenue growth, return on capital and annual positive operating leverage are a compelling set of financial performance indicators and closely aligned with value creation for our shareholders.

I would characterize the growth we're expecting for Q4 as well to be modest. So we do expect growth likely modest. I think it's really driven by the continuation of the factors we've seen for the last several quarters, and we noted a bit in the prepared remarks, that is really strong calling activity and pipelines driving continued robust new production in commercial and quite a bit of momentum in business banking and then in the consumer space, continued strength in residential mortgage and auto and RV/Marine continues to perform pretty well also. 
The only thing I would say is now that we have the conversion behind us, that we've got -- we're able to now focus thousands of colleagues on growth. And so we do expect modest growth as we go into Q4 and then continuing and frankly, accelerating as we go out throughout the course of next year as well."

We'll see where it goes from here. I do -- if liquidity trends continue as we expect, I also expect that we will add some additional securities in the fourth quarter.

The 2 biggest drivers of that were the things we've just talked about in the last question, actually, interestingly, elevated Fed cash contributed several basis points additional drag in the quarter than we had previously expected. And we did accelerate the purchase of our securities, which also impacted the mix and drove yields lower. Generally, spreads were sort of spot on our expectation of relative at a core loan level. 
Look, I think what I would tell you is, going forward, I'm expecting stable from these levels. It will be a function of what happens with the elevated liquidity and Fed cash and the rate environment. but generally stable from these levels is a fair assumption. 
And our key focus at this point is trying to drive net interest income dollars at $1.85 billion of net interest income, excluding PAA, excluding PPP, given the sequential loan growth that we're projecting, given that rate stability, my expectation is we're going to grow those dollars into Q4 and grow them throughout 2022."

The -- I think next year's financials are going to be challenging to look at from a year-over-year growth perspective and to some degree to calculate that metric, just given the continued 2 quarters of grow-over impact of adding the TCF business. 
But we do expect full year positive operating leverage in total. And the big thing that we're very focused on is driving to the point where the momentum coming into the second half of the year and certainly exiting the year is on the levels that we've targeted for those mid-moderate term targets. And so at that point, as we sort of get into a clean year-over-year growth period to be able to see it better. And look, I think what we'll be dynamic as we always have been to ensure that we can modulate the expenses given where revenue is trending while continuing to invest. And my expectation, we'll see some solid positive operating leverage, but not going to characterize the level specifically at this point."

I think as we've talked about a bit over time, interestingly, each of the 3 major kind of line businesses that we've got auto inventory in general middle market, each of them represented roughly $2 billion opportunities when those utilization rates return to normalized pre-COVID levels. That sort of give you an order of magnitude. 
The trends we're seeing at this point in auto. We're down a couple more percentage points of [ 3 ] to be precise between the end of Q2 and the end of Q3 to 25%. At this point, I'm seeing relative stability in the auto floor plan business to some degree, some of the chip issues and other supply chain issues or produce some incremental pressure, but we're also getting some defined and known new commitments and some term debt into those businesses such that my expectation is relatively flat in that space. 
And interestingly, inventory finance has similar opportunities where we're creating some very known planned uses of those lines. So expect stability and perhaps even a modest uptick actually into Q4 that the general middle market should continue to be flat here for the time being. 
However, I'm going to pay to answer your question, but I would -- pulling back a second, I would just highlight that it's our planning expectation at this point. That the totality of these lines is going to be relatively flat throughout the course of '22. There could well be an opportunity against that. But at this point, for planning purposes, we're trying to zero that out. But we still expect pretty good loan growth. And I think that's really just sort of pointing back to the robust new production activity that we're seeing. 
So this could be ultimately the tailwind, and we do expect over time will be and the headwind nature has largely moderated at this point, we expect it generally flat."

Overall, over the longer term, we feel great about the conversion to the Fair Play business, as we've talked about a lot. And this is a play we have run many times, and we're very confident in the returns that it generated.
Typically, the dynamic is sort of a higher degree of fee income reduction in the early periods, offset over time by incremental deepening and incremental acquisition in the market from those products, generally about an 18-month payback. And so sort of the dynamic can you see a bit lower into Q4 and then clawing back and paying back over that kind of roughly 1.5 years period."

And as I think you saw with the Ford GM earnings announcements, expectations that's going to go deep into next year before it gets normalized. So that's why Zach's earlier comment is we're not counting on utilization, normalization and inventory finance or auto to be a tailwind next year. If it happens, that's great. 
Now we do see supply chain issues, getting results are getting to a resolution over time and would expect that to continue again through next year, maybe even a little bit beyond, depending on the industry. But there's a lot of activity in the footprint about tooling and additional manufacturing capabilities in -- with adjacency in North America, including in the footprint states that we're in. 
So we like how this sets up over time in terms of additional opportunity for us, and we're bullish, but we clearly have both the supply chain and a labor issue in virtually every business that's out there today."

Given the labor issues, I think there is a bigger push to automate production to garner that productivity that will offset some of the labor issues. The other thing that we're seeing is just a heightened level of M&A. I think as we're coming out of kind of the COVID fog here with respect to EBITDA levels and things. 
There's just a greater sense of certainty around cash flows, and I think buyers are aggressively looking to expand if they can, and sellers. I think some of them have just gotten a little tired kind of going through a COVID environment and when their cash flows are picking back up the position where maybe they want to sell.

And for the most part, most of those really were beginning to be executed on during the third quarter, with sort of effect more into the fourth and as you go into the first quarter. The decisions around them and the planning and actions necessary to achieve them have essentially all been completed, and now we're in the execution mode of just realizing them.

We put a bit of $50 in last year for an overdraft, we called that safety zone. 
So we have been continuously over time working to benefit our customers as part of this fair play banking philosophy. We tend to be very strong on a relative basis in terms of customer acquisition as a constant lense of the different features and functions on our checking products. 
And that's ameliorated the revenue give up over the last decade or so very, very substantially. As Zach pointed out, there will be a bit of a step down in the fourth quarter for a couple of quarters thereafter for the TCF customers, but they're going to get the same advantage of products and services that all of our previously existing customers have as well. 
So -- and it will accompany our expectation around both customer retention and customer acquisition. It's hard to -- it's -- I can't speculate on what regulators they do, but we've -- again, we've been trying to do things to help consumers and businesses for quite some time, not just with overdraft fees, but other types of fee eliminations, reductions, notice requirements, we put in new alert system in that regard 1.5 years ago.
