I hope everyone and their families remain safe and healthy through the holidays. And it's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll revi",2588,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning and Happy New Year. I hope everyone and their families remain safe and healthy through the holidays. And it's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. 
Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
Throughout BlackRock's history, we have consistently and systematically invested in our business with a commitment to serving clients, employees, shareholders and the communities in which we live and operate. As a result, while the world faced unprecedented challenges in 2020, we were well prepared to provide clients with thought leadership, investment insights and risk management tools to ensure the physical and emotional well-being of our employees and to give back to our communities. BlackRock's strong performance during this challenging year is a testament to our diverse and resilient business model, our steadfast focus on helping clients achieve their long-term goals and the dedication of our incredible people. 
We generated net inflows of $391 billion in 2020, representing 5% organic asset growth and 7% organic base fee growth, meeting our organic growth target for the sixth time in the last 8 years. Importantly, we finished the year with increased momentum, generating $127 billion of total net inflows in the fourth quarter, reflecting record quarterly organic base fee growth of 13%. 
Strong performance from our entire active franchise, along with near-record iShares flows, which benefited from client rerisking and year-end tax planning, contributed to this quarter's robust organic base fee growth. We continue to play offense in 2020 as the strength and stability of our operating model allowed us to invest through volatile markets, both organically and inorganically, expand our full year operating margin and return approximately $3.8 billion of capital to our shareholders. 
Each of our critical growth priorities, including iShares, Aladdin, private markets, alpha generation, whole portfolio solutions and sustainable investing drove significant growth during the year. Full year revenue of $16.2 billion was up 11%. Operating income of $6.3 billion rose 13%, and earnings per share of $33.82 was up 19% versus 2019. 
For the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated revenue of $4.5 billion and operating income of $1.8 billion, up 13% and 20%, respectively, from a year ago. Quarterly earnings per share of $10.18 was up 22% versus 2019 driven by higher nonoperating income and a reduced diluted share count versus a year ago, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter included $153 million of net investment income primarily driven by mark-to-market gains on our unhedged seed and co-investment capital. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 20%, reflecting $61 million of net discrete tax benefits. We currently estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2021, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation during the year. 
Fourth quarter base fees of $3.4 billion were up 10% year-over-year primarily driven by 7% organic growth and the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, but partially offset by lower securities lending revenue and higher discretionary money market fees in the current quarter and strategic pricing investments over the last year. 
In addition, while fourth quarter base fees were up 5% sequentially, the impact of lower securities lending revenue during the quarter driven by a continued tightening of cash spreads was the primary reason we saw a sequential decline of 0.2 basis points in our annualized effective fee rate despite the positive impact of strong organic base fee growth. 
As we look into 2021, based on current market conditions and interest rates, we are planning for the possibility of lower securities lending revenue and higher discretionary money market fee waivers as compared to 2020. In isolation, this could have an additional 0.3 basis point negative impact on our fee rate this year as compared to our fourth quarter annualized base fee rate. 
Bear in mind that a higher interest rate environment and continued strong organic base fee growth could mitigate these headwinds, especially with continued momentum in our higher fee Active Equity and alternative businesses, and then nearly roughly -- and that nearly 40% of gross money market fee waivers are generally shared with distributors, reducing the impact on operating income. 
Fourth quarter performance fees of $419 million were up 75% year-over-year, capping a record year for performance fees that totaled $1.1 billion, more than double 2019 levels. While this year's performance fees reflected strong alpha generation across the entirety of our alternative and long-only investment platforms, approximately 60% of the full year increase was attributable to a single hedge fund strategy that delivered exceptional performance during the year. 
Quarterly technology services revenue was up 11% year-over-year, and full year revenue of $1.1 billion increased 17%, in part reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition. While demand for integrated and resilient investment management technology to support effective risk management and operational efficiency remains strong, growth in 2020 technology services revenue was impacted by extended sales and contracting cycles associated with the pandemic. 
In addition, year-over-year revenue growth also reflected certain eFront clients shifting from an on-premises license model, in which revenue is generally recognized upfront, to a hosted model, which is more consistent with how we service our broader Aladdin community and where revenue is recognized over the life of a contract. As we anticipate more clients embracing eFront's hosted model, which will impact year-over-year revenue comparisons and in an effort to provide greater transparency into Aladdin's business momentum, we intend to begin disclosing growth in ACV or annual contract value. ACV growth represents a point in time year-over-year comparison of our technology services revenue run rate and is more representative of how leading technology companies measure their top line growth. Technology services ACV at year-end 2020 increased 12% versus a year ago, and we remain committed to low to mid-teens growth in ACV over the long term. 
Fourth quarter and full year advisory and other revenue decreased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the absence of PennyMac equity method earnings following the charitable contribution of our remaining equity stake in the first quarter of 2020 and lower advisory and transition management revenue during the year. Total expense increased 10% in 2020 driven primarily by higher compensation and noncore G&A expense. 
For the full year, compensation expense increased $571 million or 13%, primarily reflecting higher base and incentive compensation driven by higher performance fees and operating income. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis. 
Overall G&A expense increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher levels of noncore items primarily related to the net impact of higher product launch costs, legal fees, COVID-19-related costs and fixed asset impairments, offset by lower contingent fair value adjustments, FX remeasurement expense and deal-related costs during the year. Excluding approximately $280 million of noncore G&A expense incurred in 2020, which included $166 million of aggregate fund launch costs, core G&A expense for the year remained essentially flat compared to 2019 as higher technology and portfolio services fees were offset by lower T&D expense. Recall that we exclude the impact of fund launch costs when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin. 
Our full year as-adjusted operating margin of 44.9% was up 120 basis points versus 2019 and benefited from record performance fees and securities lending revenue during the year and a lower level of core G&A expense than anticipated. As we have previously stated, our business has never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us, especially amid industry consolidation and disruption to deliver differentiated organic growth. And we remain deeply committed to investing responsibly and aggressively through market cycles and for the long term in order to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. 
Consequently, our 2021 investment plan currently includes the repurposing of lower T&D expense back into our business to fund incremental investments in technology and market data in support of our sustainability and other growth initiatives. At present, excluding the impact of market beta, taking into account our anticipated level of expense growth and more normalized level of performance fees and the current rate environment, which may impact year-over-year comparisons of set lending revenue and money market fee waivers, we would anticipate a 2021 as-adjusted operating margin generally in line with our 2020 result. 
We're also investing through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success. During 2020, we allocated over $1 billion of new seed and co-investment capital to support our growth, and our year-end portfolio now approximately $3.5 billion. 
We also continue to make strategic minority investments. And as you will hear from Larry shortly, we will announce later today an investment in Clarity AI, a sustainability analytics and data science platform. 
And in the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Aperio, a pioneering customizing tax-optimized index equity SMAs to enhance our wealth platform and provide whole portfolio solutions to ultra-high net worth advisers. Following the close of the Aperio transaction in early February, we will incur additional intangible amortization expense relative to 2020. 
We also remain committed to systematically returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases and returned an aggregate of $3.8 billion to shareholders in 2020. We repurchased approximately $1.5 billion worth of shares in 2020 at an average share price of $439 per share, taking advantage of PNC's decision to exit their ownership position in May. 
Since inception of our current capital management strategy in 2013, we have now repurchased over $10 billion of BlackRock stock, reducing our outstanding total shares by 11% and generating an unlevered compound annual return of 19% for our shareholders. At present, based on capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we are targeting the repurchase of $1.2 billion of shares during 2021, consistent with our guidance a year ago. 
In addition and also subject to market conditions, we expect to see Board approval later this month for an increase to our first quarter 2021 dividend. 
As you will hear more from Larry, BlackRock has never been better positioned to deliver for clients as we leverage our unique insights, guidance and solutions to help them meet their long-term investment needs. Fourth quarter total net inflows of $127 billion, representing 7% annualized organic AUM growth and 13% annualized organic base fee growth, were led by flows into iShares and our top-performing active franchise. 
Full year net inflows of $391 billion were positive across active and index, all asset classes, client types and regions and reflected broad-based strength across iShares and active and cash strategies. Global iShares ETF generated $185 billion of net inflows in 2020, representing 8% organic asset growth and 7% organic base fee growth. 
We saw strong growth in core, in each of our strategic product areas and our precision exposures, which benefited from risk on sentiment during the fourth quarter. Within our strategic products segment, flows were led by fixed income and sustainable. And we also saw inflows into factors despite the industry category seeing outflows. 
The fourth quarter is typically our strongest quarter for iShares due to year-end rebalancing and tax planning. But this quarter was especially strong with net inflows of $79 billion, representing 14% annualized organic asset growth and a record 17% annualized organic base fee growth, reflecting the breadth of our product and client segments. 
BlackRock generated full year retail net inflows of $70 billion, representing 10% annualized organic asset growth and 8% annualized organic base fee growth, significantly outperforming the broader mutual fund industry. Retail flows were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and reflected broad-based strength in active fixed income, equity and liquid alternatives. 
Fourth quarter retail net inflows of $35 billion reflected similar trends but also included the seasonal impact of capital gains and dividend reinvestment. Institutional index net outflows of $29 billion in 2020 reflected equity net outflows, partially offset by fixed income net inflows as several large clients rebalanced portfolios after significant equity market gains or tactically shifted assets to fixed income and cash. 
In addition, a large U.S. public pension client recently announced a diversification of their plan to meet revised guidelines. BlackRock will maintain management of a significant majority of the planned assets, but we do expect to transition approximately $55 billion of low-fee index assets to another investment manager during the first half of 2021. While this transition will result in a significant net asset outflow, it will have a de minimis impact on our organic base fee growth for the year. 
BlackRock's institutional active franchise generated $32 billion of net inflows in 2020, reflecting broad-based strength across all product categories. Active net inflows were led by $14 billion of multi-asset net inflows, reflecting continued growth in our LifePath target date franchise and significant momentum in our OCIO business. We also generated $7 billion of net inflows in active fixed income, primarily from activity among our insurance clients. 
Across retail and institutional client types, we generated a record $30 billion of active net equity net inflows for the year and have now delivered 7 consecutive quarters of positive flows in this category. Flows were led by top-performing franchises in technology, health sciences and U.S. growth equities as well as quantitative strategies. 
We remain well positioned for future growth in our active businesses with over 85% of fundamental active equity, systematic active equity and taxable fixed income assets performing above their respective benchmark's work pure medians for the trailing 5-year period. Overall demand for alternatives also continued with $17 billion of net inflows into our illiquid and liquid alternative strategies during the year driven by infrastructure, private equity solutions, credit and our multi-strat and global event-driven hedge funds. 
Momentum in fundraising remains strong. And we have approximately $24 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. 
BlackRock's cash management platform generated another $9 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter even as the broader industry saw outflows and a record $113 billion of net inflows in 2020. During the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $30 million of discretionary yield support waivers and as previously discussed, expect such fee waivers to increase in 2021. 
Finally, full year advisory net inflows of $20 billion were primarily linked to asset purchases managed by our Financial Markets Advisory group. Recall that revenue linked to these assignments is primarily reflected in the advisory and other revenue line of our income statement. 
This time last year, none of us could have predicted the unprecedented challenges that we and our clients around the world would face during 2020. By remaining true to our purpose, investing ahead of our clients' needs and respecting our One BlackRock culture, we look back on 2020 as a year that included some of the strongest and proudest moments of our 32-year history. 
Our relationship with clients have never been deeper. And we believe in our platform -- we believe our platform is as well positioned as it's ever been to meet the needs of all stakeholders over the coming years. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

I hope you and all your loved ones are staying healthy and safe. 
For decades, BlackRock has built our strategy, platform and culture around staying in front of our client needs. We've deliberately invested in our business so that we are prepared to help clients navigate the most complex challenges of the investment landscape and the world changes all around them. And that is showing up in the results today. 
The hardships experienced by people globally in 2020 and inequality further exasperated by the pandemic have only strengthened BlackRock's sense of responsibility to help millions of people build savings, to make savings easier and more affordable, advance sustainable investing and contribute to a more resilient global economy. The pandemic has taken a dramatic toll on all our lives, disrupting the way we work, the way we live. 
At the same time, it has led to a profound shift in how economies and how societies even operate, creating opportunities to redesign our society for the future. Investors around the world, most of whom are saving for long-term goals like retirement, are experiencing the economic impact of the pandemic, which is leading to rising inequalities within and across nations, continued low interest rates even in the face of rising inflation expectations and a [ tectonic ] shift towards sustainable business practices. 
These trends will require investors to rethink portfolio allocation, and they are increasingly turning to BlackRock for insights and solutions so they can fulfill their purpose on behalf of their stakeholders. Our diverse global investment platform with active and index strategies across all asset classes, integrated technology, data and risk management and global scale and connectivity enables us to deliver strong and consistent investment performance and for more stable outcomes for our clients. 
Our voice, developed over years of managing assets for a diverse set of clients globally, has helped BlackRock partner with our clients and has helped us to advocate on their behalf. We encourage the companies our clients are invested in to operate with a long-term mindset, increased transparency and important sustainability factors and focus on all of their stakeholders. And this is driving BlackRock's performance. 
BlackRock's differentiated approach is resonating with our clients worldwide, leading to deeper partnerships with them and as you could see, driving incredible momentum across our businesses. BlackRock generated $391 billion of total net inflows in 2020, representing 5% organic asset and 7% organic base fee growth. We delivered 11% revenue growth, 13% operating income growth and 19% earnings per share growth. And on top of that, we were able to expand our margins by 120 basis points over a year-over-year basis. 
These results reflect the benefits of our consistent investments and the diversity of our platform. Flows were positive across all major client types, across all asset classes and all geographic regions, including more than $1 billion of net inflows in each of the 19 countries and into 104 different products. 
In strategic growth areas, we saw record client demand for active equities, sustainability, our cash products and our alternative investment strategies. We also generated $185 billion of net inflows into iShares ETFs, and we also delivered a record $1.1 billion in technology services revenues. 
By supporting clients with solutions, no matter their objective or risk preference, BlackRock is positioned to generate differentiating growth and invest for the future. Our long-term strategy remains to focus on accelerating growth in iShares, accelerating our growth in illiquid alternatives, accelerating our growth in technology and making sure that performance and generating alpha is at the heart of BlackRock. 
We're doing this through delivering whole portfolio solutions and becoming the global leader in sustainable investing. These investments will benefit, of course, our shareholders but are benefiting all our stakeholders. 
Sustainable -- sustainability reached an inflection point this past year driven by the convergence of business practices, regulation, technology advancements, and we're seeing it across client preferences. BlackRock generated $68 billion of net inflows in sustainable strategies in 2020, representing over 60% organic growth. And we launched over 100 new products in 2020 to expand investor choice. 
We are seeing strong demand across client segments. Institutional clients are increasingly seeking sustainable strategies to mitigate exposures and to capture opportunities, while clients are using ETF building block, especially our sustainable iShares ETFs in both sustainable and traditional model portfolios. 
We recently surveyed investors representing $25 trillion in assets, who said they plan to double, I underscore double, their allocations to sustainable products over the next 5 years to nearly 40% average from a level of approximately 18%. BlackRock's sustainable investment platform is well positioned to meet this demand, and we will continue to believe the $200 billion we managed today will go to $1 trillion in sustainable investments by the end of this decade. 
Clients worldwide are continuing to adopt ETFs throughout the year, and iShares drove $185 billion of inflows in 2020. In the U.S., iShares ETF crossed $2 trillion last week, doubling our size in just 4 years. Our European iShares generated nearly $60 billion in net inflows, becoming increasingly important to our global growth. Overall, iShares ETFs, particularly in the first quarter, has unlocked new sources of client demand with active managers, insurers and asset owners globally. 
BlackRock's scale, engineering, technology and ecosystem partnerships have enabled us to maintain robust liquidity across iShares ETFs and execute some of the largest rebalances in history, all with tight tracking error and while operating our platform fully remotely in this environment. 
We win these 4 defining moments in our ETF business in 2020: one, iShares outperformed in the face of the most severe market stress test in ETF history; two, fixed income ETFs shined as a modernization force for the $100 trillion bond market; three, sustainable ETFs are making sustainable investing more accessible to investors; and four, we are seeing an increased adaptation of ETFs and wealth portfolios as more wealth management industry shifts towards a more fiduciary commission-free model. 
We believe that these moments and BlackRock's performance in them will continue to support and accelerate the long-term growth of iShares and the broader ETF industry. More than 70% of our annual iShares flows were from strategic product segments led by fixed income and sustainable product categories. 
2020 was a turning point for global client adoption of fixed income ETFs and fixed income iShares, generating $89 billion of inflows. We estimate that over 100 asset managers and asset owners globally were first-time adopters in 2020 in fixed income ETFs. And 80% of our top active managers are now using our fixed income ETFs. 
Fixed income iShares is now a $690 billion business, and we continue to believe it will grow to $1 trillion over the next 2 to 3 years. Sustainable iShares ETF saw a record $47 billion of net inflows in 2020, and AUM has tripled year-over-year to $82 billion. 
We're rapidly expanding our product suite, partnering with index and data providers to expand product choice in this category. With more than 140 iShare ETFs and index funds globally, we have the broadest choice of any firm. And our goal is to continue innovating so that more investors, more people, more savers have greater access to sustainable strategies. 
Shift in the wealth management landscape towards digitization, centralization and outsourcing in both the United States and Europe are increasing ETF usage among these clients. Growth in model portfolios across all platforms is an example of how technology and the transparency of fee-based wealth management are tailwinds for the ETF market. 
Model portfolios are driving approximately 1/4 of iShares globally -- growth globally. And we expect growth in models, especially customized models developed in partnership with clients, to account for more than half of iShares flows in the coming years. 
BlackRock is deepening partnerships with wealth managers and financial advisers globally by offering high-quality insights and solutions across both index and active strategies. And no other firm can link those 2 strategies together. 
We are seeing strong demand from our top-performing active mutual fund franchise even as the broader U.S. active mutual fund industry saw more than $250 billion of outflows in 2020. In November, we announced the acquisition of Aperio, which will accelerate our leadership in the fast-growing U.S. separately managed account space. Wealth managers are increasingly looking for partners who can provide personalization and whole portfolio solutions. And now BlackRock is well positioned to be the partner of choice for the full spectrum of wealth clients. 
We want to make it easy for wealth managers to access our investment strategies across funds, ETFs, SMAs and models and construct a more resilient risk-aware portfolio using our technology. Active strategies and strong performance after fees are critical in building efficient, resilient portfolios. And as public markets, both equities and fixed income, become more efficient, clients are increasingly looking for a differentiated manager who can find differentiating sources of alpha. 
It's not just about beating a benchmark or peer medium but delivering incremental, tangible dollar returns for clients. BlackRock's investments over time in integrated technology, data, risk management, scale, global reach and the interconnectivity is enabling us to generate strong investment performance at a time when clients need this performance the most. 
Our active business generated over $30 billion of alpha returns for clients in 2020, which is leading to more client demand than ever before. BlackRock generated $88 billion of total active inflows for the year, including a record for BlackRock, $30 billion of active inflows in active equities. 
Private markets are also increasingly an important component for alpha in investor portfolios as both growth assets and diversification. BlackRock has built a broad platform across infrastructure, private credit, real estate and private equity to meet client demands. 
We more than doubled our illiquid alternative platform over the last 5 years. And today, we manage $86 billion on behalf of clients. We raised a record $25 billion of client capital in 2020 led by infrastructure, private equity solutions, private credit and the final close of our direct private equity long-term private capital strategy. 
LTPC is one of the largest first-time funds raised to date with a total of $3.4 billion and a great example of BlackRock's ability to innovate and organically develop private market solutions to meet our clients' evolving needs. And in an increasingly competitive environment for deploying capital, we are leveraging the benefits of BlackRock's scale and size to deploy capital on behalf of clients. Our capital markets team gives us a differentiated access to unique deal flow for clients in 2020. And this team alone helped us source 2,100 such opportunities. 
20 years ago, we recognized the important value proposition Aladdin can provide for our clients. Today, our technology is a $1.1 billion revenue business as more clients than ever before are looking for a unified technology platform like Aladdin that can support their whole portfolio across both public and private assets. And we are committed and remain focused on continuously evolving Aladdin for the next 20 years to come. 
As sustainability becomes a critical building block in all portfolios, our ambition is to put Aladdin at the center of sustainable investing and address the challenges that investors are facing and in the future. We launched Aladdin Climate to help clients better access both the physical risk climate change and the transition risk to a low-carbon economy on their portfolios. And we're committed to be providing clients with everything they need for sustainable investing in Aladdin: access to sustainability data and its analytics and tools to seamlessly implement sustainable portfolios. 
In line with this commitment, we made a minority investment in Clarity AI, which provides tools to access environmental and social impact. And we'll be connecting with the capabilities throughout Aladdin. 
Our ability to address client challenges enables us to fulfill our purpose and drive strong long-term performance. Over the last 5 years, clients entrusted us with $1.5 trillion of net new assets, which, in turn, has enabled us to create over 3,500 jobs globally. And on top of all that, we delivered 141% total return for our shareholders. 
I am deeply humbled by how BlackRock's 16,500 employees have supported each other and our clients throughout this challenging year, which is critical to our success in 2020. More than 90% of our employees in our annual employee opinion survey said they are proud to work at BlackRock, and we remain committed to upholding our culture and everyday living our purpose. 
We built BlackRock because we believe in the long-term growth of the capital markets and the importance of being invested in the capital markets. Even today, BlackRock only is 2% of the global financial assets, and we see tremendous opportunities ahead to continue supporting the growth of global capital markets and helping more people invest and save. 
Everything we do is rooted in our culture of focusing on the long term, and we will be continuing to innovate using our scale and contributing to more equitable, resilient future to benefit our clients, to benefit our employees, to benefit our shareholders and the people in the communities where we live, where we work, where we operate. I firmly believe that the efforts of 2020 will position BlackRock to deliver value over the long term for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I'll take the first swipe at that and then let others chime in. 
So look, our performance in 2020 clearly reflects, as we've talked about at length, a strategic commitment to investing responsibly in our business across market cycles. And our margin of the year of 120 basis points improvement over last year benefited from a number of, what I would call, items that we saw in 2020 that will be potentially a little different next year. And of course, we're trying to stare into a crystal ball like everybody else, but Margin last year benefited from record performance fees. We had securities lending revenue that was also a record. And I think as we've talked about, we did have a lower level of core G&A expense than anticipated. So if you think about it, from my perspective, the margin pop we saw this year was probably a little bit higher than we would normally have expected. 
And as we stated previously, we've never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. And we are passionate, as you know, about investing responsibly and aggressively. 
So many have asked, in fact, we were asked at your conference about our plans for next year and whether we would drop some of those reduced core spending levels to the bottom line. In our view at this point is when we look out at the opportunities in front of us and what's happening in the industry that we see a very unique opportunity to continue playing offense maybe even a little harder and to invest that money back into the business to support incremental investments in technology, market data and a variety of other areas to support those growth initiatives. 
So when you say like what those are, I think it's very consistent with what we've talked about. I think we look to invest meaningfully higher next year, again, in terms of really complete all of our investment plans during the year. 
We put a hiring freeze on -- in 2020 in March and didn't really start rehiring until late in the third quarter. So we're a little bit [indiscernible]. So there's a little bit of catch-up, and there's a little bit of incremental that's going to happen. And the strategically think private market, iShares, Aladdin sustainability, whole portfolios, stewardship China, which is obviously starting to ramp up as we're going to get operational there. 
In terms of technology, we are in the midst of our cloud migration. We are seeing opportunities in terms of tech infrastructure as well as health and safety improvements throughout the organization. So I think with that in mind, we feel that this is the right time for us to kind of ramp it up. And given that we saw a little bit of a higher margin this year than we would have anticipated, it results in a little bit of a more moderated margin story for 2021."

I -- we are seeing -- we believe that because even at that rate, that is not going to change the allocation that remarkably because I do believe that, that rate, liability rates are still going to be longer. And as a result, the demand for equities will persist. 
But in terms of fixed income, we have not really seen much change in client preferences. They are consistently looking at products like SIO, which is a specialized fixed income product that is not targeted to -- not targeted [indiscernible] duration. 
We expect to see more global demand in global bonds as a mechanism away from the potential lowering of the U.S. dollar. We will -- we are continuing to see emerging markets beginning to show interest as a macro trade. And we're -- we continue to see more and more interest in private markets and private credit. So I -- and which we are strong in all of these. 
So I don't think you're going to see a persistent large-scale rebalancing out of core fixed income assets. The positive side, I would say if rates go up for the yield curve, it's going to make, obviously, the banking system to be much stronger. It's going to make lending even easier to be had. I think a rising yield curve is a positive sign for the economy. And so all of that, in my mind, leads to probably better equity valuations. Rob, do you have anything you wanted to add to that?"

And as people start to do this reallocation, this is why we've seen, as Larry mentioned in his opening remarks, over 100 new asset managers and asset owner clients come into fixed income, but come in through iShares. And a good statistic is 80% of the top asset managers are now using fixed income ETFs. 
So we think there's still demand, but the demand is going to be shown differently as they come in. And we're very well positioned in our iShare business to take that money in fixed income."

But obviously, as you know, our competitive advantage in terms of what we believe drives a lot of our value proposition is global reach, is best-in-class technology, risk management, diverse investment capabilities across the spectrum of active and passive and then obviously, to be able to bring all of that together. 
We've been at that now for well over a decade in terms of not only trying to identify the pieces that we need, but also integrating those pieces into a distinct and unique One BlackRock culture. And we think that's really critical to our success today, both in terms of being able to reach clients with boots on the ground, as Larry mentioned, 16,000-plus people, over half of those people are outside of the Americas these days, having capabilities to have thoughtful investment discussions by virtue of the fact that we are local in our local markets. And Larry talked about that a lot. And obviously, I don't think that there's really a great opportunity for a number of our competitors to just recreate Aladdin overnight in terms of those capabilities. 
So I think, again, breadth of product, breadth of reach, breadth of insight, all brought together with technology and risk management creates this unique franchise that, frankly, seems to be humming on multiple cylinders today. And I think we -- do we view that as unique? Yes. Do we view it as something that other people could create potentially, but I'll leave that to the challenge. But as I said, we've been doing this for a decade, and it's going to take quite a long time for people to try to replicate, I think, what we have right now."

I believe our distribution platform has been buttressed quite a bit over the last 5 years. It's been a long-term commitment. 
We are providing a uniqueness, as Gary suggested, across the world in terms of providing that  conversation that intersects both active and passive and risk analytics. No firm can do this at this moment. 
I believe the elevation of content by the wealth manager has been one of the giant changes too. As the wealth management industry has moved away from fee-based to an advisory-based, they've really elevated their ability to have deeper, broader conversations. And they're looking for a few partners who could work with them and build that out. 
And we are certainly one of the go-to firms who are helping that. And we're able to help them deliver that global insight, that advice and more importantly, the solutions that are helping them. So it is the combinations of having iShares in our active strategy but now with the overlaying of technology to customize portfolios. And today, the customization of portfolios and personalizing a portfolio is becoming more and more in need in the wealth management space. 
It is not about selling a bond fund or a stock fund anymore. It is not about buying a stock or a bond. It is about a holistic whole solution portfolio. And so our uniqueness is about that and how we deliver it. 
Just as a response to the industry, the industry has been always designed around a specific product, a specific fund. And for the firms who only have a product or in one asset category, they have a difficult time to really respond to whole portfolio solutions. 
And I believe this customization, the personalization of whole portfolio solutions is becoming the driver, the driver in terms of most of the wealth management conversations. Do we need to do more acquisitions for distribution? Not in the United States and not in Europe. Could we do somewhere in another part of the world where we don't have a strong footprint? Sure. That is consistent what I've said over the last 3 to 5 years. 
And importantly, what we are going to do, like we announced today, the Clarity AI minority interest, what we are trying to do is provide in this portfolio customization also uniqueness in data and analytics to drive better decision-making, which will ultimately drive better performance. And I think that is also the uniqueness of BlackRock and why we are so constructive on the opportunities we have working with wealth managers worldwide."

We built BlackRock around the whole foundation of strong global capital markets. I think we have been a big beneficiary over the years by we've believed in global capital markets and the expansion of global capital markets over the last 20",533,"Great question. We built BlackRock around the whole foundation of strong global capital markets. I think we have been a big beneficiary over the years by we've believed in global capital markets and the expansion of global capital markets over the last 20 years. 
And I think the size of our footprint and the size of the AUM that we manage is because of our commitment to building broad-scale capital markets. One of the interesting points, I said this at the end of the -- my speech today, our size relative to the global common markets is almost virtually unchanged to what it was in 2009. So in 2009, we were under 2% of the global capital markets, and today, we're a little bit over 2% of the global capital market. 
So as much as we've grown, the world capital markets have grown. The use of government debt as a mechanism, finance deficits have grown. The use of the equity markets for IPOs and new companies and the expansion of other countries expanding their capital markets, whether the capital markets expansion in the Middle East or parts of Asia have been really quite extraordinary. So we are benefiting from that. 
What we need in our -- in that, and we've always welcomed that, we need to make sure that regulators focus on a well-functioning capital markets to build a more resilient economy. So we have encouraged regulation worldwide to ensure well-functioning capital markets. And that is the key criteria how we look at it. 
I would say the one myth about asset managers, the asset manager industry is highly regulated already. At BlackRock, we are regulated by the SEC. Because we have a trust bank, we're regulated by the OCC. We're regulated by the CFTC, by FINRA. Overseas, we're regulated across the board. 
We are not a bank, and that's why we are not regulated by one regulator, the Federal Reserve. But we're regulated by almost any other organization and regulator. 
The asset management industry is still highly fragmented, and so I believe we welcome a conversation. And we are encouraged about how regulators are focusing on the need of a well-functioning capital market. 
But the concept of that asset management history is not regulated, that must be coming from bankers. We're not a bank. We don't -- all $8.7 trillion of our assets are other people's hard-earned savings and money. 
We have a contract with every one of our clients. In most of our short-term funds, mutual funds, ETFs, they could sell those assets in a day. And our institutional liquid portfolios, they could do it over 30 days and depending on some of the long-term private assets, that depends on the contract that we have with each individual client. 
But the notion that asset managers are not regulator, it's just a myth. It is not true. But as the largest asset manager in the world, as a fiduciary to all our client savings, we want a highly functioning markets. And at the time when markets need more supervision, in almost all cases, we have been systematically in favor of ensuring market safety and soundness. And we will encourage that going forward."

But it comes under a broader picture, and that is we're seeing increased demand for what is called personalization and customization. And that includes tax managed. It also includes ESG and includes factor preferences. 
And as mentioned before, wealth managers are looking to do more with fewer partners. So they want partners who can offer whole portfolio solutions, and that's why we are positioning ourselves to be the partner of choice. 
With our acquisition of Aperio, we are further enhancing our value proposition for whole portfolio SMAs across equity, fixed income, alpha factors and index solutions because ultimately, we want to make it easy for wealth managers to access our investment strategies across funds, ETFs and SMAs, even models and be able to construct more resilient, risk-aware portfolios using our technology. 
So we're seeing as a result of our investment in serving more and more wealth managers, we saw $185 billion of iShare flows. We're seeing strong active flows, including inflows across active mutual funds even as the industry saw outflows. And we're reaching out to more advisers with our adviser center and our partnership with Envestnet. 
Now on the self-indexing part of your question. Look, self index indexing certainly has some advantages and the advantages are cost and flexibility. So we're exploring constantly self-indexing in areas where there aren't well-defined indices. And that would be in smart beta, in fixed income, factors, in ESG. 
And currently, we have 6 self-indexed ETFs. So we also continue to have great relationships with our index providers, and we believe there's often significant value in having a third-party provider. And clients, especially institutions, often value the brands and are benchmarked to those particular indices. 
As well, the major index providers, they provide services more than just the brand. They provide research, IP, tracking, corporate events. So we're also seeing better price competition among the index providers and the sharing of IP. 
And I think you've also seen our recently announced collaboration with Morningstar focused on enhancing style investing for clients to better represent the size and style mandates in the U.S. equity market. So a lot said, but a lot of that has to do with this customization, this personalization. And as you rightfully say, a lot of that is going to be focused on tax going forward, and we want to be positioned well for that."

And it's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020.  
Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.  
Throughout BlackRock's history, we have consistently and systematically invested in our business with a commitment to serving clients, employees, shareholders and the communities in which we live and operate. As a result, while the world faced unprecedented challenges in 2020, we were well prepared to provide clients with thought leadership, investment insights and risk management tools to ensure the physical and emotional well-being of our employees and to give back to our communities. 
BlackRock's strong performance during this challenging year is a testament to our diverse and resilient business model, our steadfast focus on helping clients achieve their long-term goals and the dedication of our incredible people.  
We generated net inflows of $391 billion in 2020, representing 5% organic asset growth and 7% organic base fee growth, meeting our organic growth target for the sixth time in the last 8 years. Importantly, we finished the year with increased momentum, generating $127 billion of total net inflows in the fourth quarter, reflecting record quarterly organic base fee growth of 13%.  
Strong performance from our entire active franchise, along with near-record iShares flows, which benefited from client rerisking and year-end tax planning, contributed to this quarter's robust organic base fee growth. We continue to play offense in 2020 as the strength and stability of our operating model allowed us to invest through volatile markets, both organically and inorganically, expand our full year operating margin and return approximately $3.8 billion of capital to our shareholders.  
Each of our critical growth priorities, including iShares, Aladdin, private markets, alpha generation, whole portfolio solutions and sustainable investing drove significant growth during the year. Full year revenue of $16.2 billion was up 11%. Operating income of $6.3 billion rose 13%, and earnings per share of $33.82 was up 19% versus 2019.  
For the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated revenue of $4.5 billion and operating income of $1.8 billion, up 13% and 20%, respectively, from a year ago. Quarterly earnings per share of $10.18 was up 22% versus 2019 driven by higher nonoperating income and a reduced diluted share count versus a year ago, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter.
Nonoperating results for the quarter included $153 million of net investment income primarily driven by mark-to-market gains on our unhedged seed and co-investment capital. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 20%, reflecting $61 million of net discrete tax benefits. We currently estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2021, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation during the year.  
Fourth quarter base fees of $3.4 billion were up 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by 7% organic growth and the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, but partially offset by lower securities lending revenue and higher discretionary money market fees in the current quarter and strategic pricing investments over the last year.  
In addition, while fourth quarter base fees were up 5% sequentially, the impact of lower securities lending revenue during the quarter driven by a continued tightening of cash spreads was the primary reason we saw a sequential decline of 0.2 basis points in our annualized effective fee rate, despite the positive impact of strong organic base fee growth.  
As we look into 2021, based on current market conditions and interest rates, we are planning for the possibility of lower securities lending revenue and higher discretionary money market fee waivers as compared to 2020. In isolation, this could have an additional 0.3 basis point negative impact on our fee rate this year as compared to our fourth quarter annualized base fee rate.  
Bear in mind that a higher interest rate environment and continued strong organic base fee growth could mitigate these headwinds, especially with continued momentum in our higher fee active equity and alternative businesses, and then nearly roughly -- and that nearly 40% of gross money market fee waivers are generally shared with distributors, reducing the impact on operating income.  
Fourth quarter performance fees of $419 million were up 75% year-over-year, capping a record year for performance fees that totaled $1.1 billion, more than double 2019 levels. While this year's performance fees reflected strong alpha generation across the entirety of our alternative and long-only investment platforms, approximately 60% of the full year increase was attributable to a single hedge fund strategy that delivered exceptional performance during the year.  
Quarterly technology services revenue was up 11% year-over-year, and full year revenue of $1.1 billion increased 17%, in part reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition. While demand for integrated and resilient investment management technology to support effective risk management and operational efficiency remain strong, growth in 2020 technology services revenue was impacted by extended sales and contracting cycles associated with the pandemic.  
In addition, year-over-year revenue growth also reflected certain eFront clients shifting from an on-premises license model, in which revenue is generally recognized upfront, to a hosted model, which is more consistent with how we service our broader Aladdin community and where revenue is recognized over the life of a contract. As we anticipate more clients embracing eFront's hosted model, which will impact year-over-year revenue comparisons and in an effort to provide greater transparency into Aladdin's business momentum, we intend to begin disclosing growth in ACV, or annual contract value. 
ACV growth represents a point in time year-over-year comparison of our technology services revenue run rate and is more representative of how leading technology companies measure their top line growth. Technology services ACV at year-end 2020 increased 12% versus a year ago, and we remain committed to low to mid-teens growth in ACV over the long term.  
Fourth quarter and full year advisory and other revenue decreased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the absence of PennyMac equity method earnings following the charitable contribution of our remaining equity stake in the first quarter of 2020 and lower advisory and transition management revenue during the year. Total expense increased 10% in 2020 driven primarily by higher compensation and noncore G&A expense.  
For the full year, compensation expense increased $571 million or 13%, primarily reflecting higher base and incentive compensation driven by higher performance fees and operating income. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis.  
Overall G&A expense increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher levels of noncore items primarily related to the net impact of higher product launch costs, legal fees, COVID-19-related costs and fixed asset impairments, offset by lower contingent fair value adjustments, FX remeasurement expense and deal-related costs during the year. Excluding approximately $280 million of noncore G&A expense incurred in 2020, which included $166 million of aggregate fund launch costs, core G&A expense for the year remained essentially flat compared to 2019 as higher technology and portfolio services fees were offset by lower T&D expense. Recall that we exclude the impact of fund launch costs when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin.  
Our full year as-adjusted operating margin of 44.9% was up 120 basis points versus 2019 and benefited from record performance fees and securities lending revenue during the year and a lower level of core G&A expense than anticipated. 
As we have previously stated, our business has never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us, especially amid industry consolidation and disruption to deliver differentiated organic growth. And we remain deeply committed to investing responsibly and aggressively through market cycles and for the long term in order to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible.  
Consequently, our 2021 investment plan currently includes the repurposing of lower T&D expense back into our business to fund incremental investments in technology and market data in support of our sustainability and other growth initiatives. At present, excluding the impact of market beta, taking into account our anticipated level of expense growth and more normalized level of performance fees and the current rate environment, which may impact year-over-year comparisons of set lending revenue and money market fee waivers, we would anticipate a 2021 as-adjusted operating margin generally in line with our 2020 result.  
We're also investing through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success. During 2020, we allocated over $1 billion of new seed and co-investment capital to support our growth, and our year-end portfolio now approximately is $3.5 billion.  
We also continue to make strategic minority investments. And as you will hear from Larry shortly, we will announce later today an investment in Clarity AI, a sustainability analytics and data science platform.  
And in the fourth quarter, we announced the acquisition of Aperio, a pioneering customizing tax-optimized index equity SMAs to enhance our wealth platform and provide whole portfolio solutions to ultra-high net worth advisers. Following the close of the Aperio transaction in early February, we will incur additional intangible amortization expense relative to 2020.  
We also remain committed to systematically returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, and returned an aggregate of $3.8 billion to shareholders in 2020. We repurchased approximately $1.5 billion worth of shares in 2020 at an average share price of $439 per share, taking advantage of PNC's decision to exit their ownership position in May. 
Since inception of our current capital management strategy in 2013, we have now repurchased over $10 billion of BlackRock stock, reducing our outstanding total shares by 11% and generating an unlevered compound annual return of 19% for our shareholders. At present, based on capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we are targeting the repurchase of $1.2 billion of shares during 2021, consistent with our guidance a year ago.  
In addition and also subject to market conditions, we expect to seek Board approval later this month for an increase to our first quarter 2021 dividend. As you will hear more from Larry, BlackRock has never been better positioned to deliver for clients as we leverage our unique insights, guidance and solutions to help them meet their long-term investment needs. 
Fourth quarter total net inflows of $127 billion, representing 7% annualized organic AUM growth and 13% annualized organic base fee growth, were led by flows into iShares and our top-performing active franchise. Full year net inflows of $391 billion were positive across active and index, all asset classes, client types and regions and reflected broad-based strength across iShares and active and cash strategies. Global iShares ETF generated $185 billion of net inflows in 2020, representing 8% organic asset growth and 7% organic base fee growth.  
We saw strong growth in core, in each of our strategic product areas and our precision exposures, which benefited from risk on sentiment during the fourth quarter. Within our strategic products segment, flows were led by fixed income and sustainable, and we also saw inflows into factors, despite the industry category seeing outflows.  
The fourth quarter is typically our strongest quarter for iShares due to year-end rebalancing and tax planning, but this quarter was especially strong with net inflows of $79 billion, representing 14% annualized organic asset growth and a record 17% annualized organic base fee growth, reflecting the breadth of our product and client segments.  
BlackRock generated full year retail net inflows of $70 billion, representing 10% annualized organic asset growth and 8% annualized organic base fee growth, significantly outperforming the broader mutual fund industry. Retail flows were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and reflected broad-based strength in active fixed income, equity and liquid alternatives. Fourth quarter retail net inflows of $35 billion reflected similar trends, but also included the seasonal impact of capital gains and dividend reinvestment. 
Institutional index net outflows of $29 billion in 2020 reflected equity net outflows, partially offset by fixed income net inflows as several large clients rebalanced portfolios after significant equity market gains or tactically shifted assets to fixed income and cash.  
In addition, a large U.S. public pension client recently announced a diversification of their plan to meet revised guidelines. BlackRock will maintain management of a significant majority of the planned assets, but we do expect to transition approximately $55 billion of low-fee index assets to another investment manager during the first half of 2021. While this transition will result in a significant net asset outflow, it will have a de minimis impact on our organic base fee growth for the year.  
BlackRock's institutional active franchise generated $32 billion of net inflows in 2020, reflecting broad-based strength across all product categories. Active net inflows were led by $14 billion of multi-asset net inflows, reflecting continued growth in our LifePath target date franchise and significant momentum in our OCIO business. We also generated $7 billion of net inflows in active fixed income, primarily from activity among our insurance clients.  
Across retail and institutional client types, we generated a record $30 billion of active net equity net inflows for the year and have now delivered 7 consecutive quarters of positive flows in this category. Flows were led by top-performing franchises in technology, health sciences and U.S. growth equities as well as quantitative strategies.  
We remain well positioned for future growth in our active businesses with over 85% of fundamental active equity, systematic active equity and taxable fixed income assets performing above their respective benchmark's work peer medians for the trailing 5-year period. 
Overall demand for alternatives also continued, with $17 billion of net inflows into our illiquid and liquid alternative strategies during the year driven by infrastructure, private equity solutions, credit and our multi-strat and global event-driven hedge funds. Momentum in fundraising remains strong, and we have approximately $24 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees.  
BlackRock's cash management platform generated another $9 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter, even as the broader industry saw outflows and a record $113 billion of net inflows in 2020. During the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $30 million of discretionary yield support waivers and, as previously discussed, expect such fee waivers to increase in 2021.  
Finally, full year advisory net inflows of $20 billion were primarily linked to asset purchases managed by our Financial Markets Advisory group. Recall that revenue linked to these assignments is primarily reflected in the advisory and other revenue line of our income statement.  
This time last year, none of us could have predicted the unprecedented challenges that we and our clients around the world would face during 2020. By remaining true to our purpose, investing ahead of our clients' needs and respecting our One BlackRock culture, we look back on 2020 as a year that included some of the strongest and proudest moments of our 32-year history.  
Our relationship with clients have never been deeper. And we believe in our platform -- we believe our platform is as well positioned as it's ever been to meet the needs of all stakeholders over the coming years.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I hope you and all your loved ones are staying healthy and safe.

I hope you and all your loved ones are staying healthy and safe.  
For decades, BlackRock has built our strategy, platform and culture around staying in front of our client needs. We've deliberately invested in our business, so that we are prepared to help clients navigate the most complex challenges of the investment landscape and the world changes all around them, and that is showing up in the results today.  
The hardships experienced by people globally in 2020 and inequalities further exasperated by the pandemic have only strengthened BlackRock's sense of responsibility to help millions of people build savings, to make savings easier and more affordable, advance sustainable investing and contribute to a more resilient global economy. 
The pandemic has taken a dramatic toll on our lives, disrupting the way we work, the way we live. At the same time, it has led to a profound shift in how economies and how societies even operate, creating opportunities to redesign our society for the future. 
Investors around the world, most of whom are saving for long-term goals like retirement, are experiencing the economic impact of the pandemic, which is leading to rising inequalities within and across nations, continued low interest rates even in the face of rising inflation expectations and a tectonic shift towards sustainable business practices. These trends will require investors to rethink portfolio allocation, and they are increasingly turning to BlackRock for insights and solutions, so they can fulfill their purpose on behalf of their stakeholders. 
Our diverse global investment platform with active and index strategies across all asset classes, integrated technology, data and risk management and global scale and connectivity enables us to deliver strong and consistent investment performance and for more stable outcomes for our clients. 
Our voice developed over years of managing assets for a diverse set of clients globally has helped BlackRock partner with our clients and has helped us to advocate on their behalf. We encourage the companies our clients are invested in to operate with a long-term mindset, increased transparency and important sustainability factors and focus on all of their stakeholders, and this is driving BlackRock's performance.  
BlackRock's differentiated approach is resonating with our clients worldwide, leading to deeper partnerships with them and, as you could see, driving incredible momentum across our businesses. BlackRock generated $391 billion of total net inflows in 2020, representing 5% organic asset and 7% organic base fee growth. 
We delivered 11% revenue growth, 13% operating income growth and 19% earnings per share growth. And on top of that, we were able to expand our margins by 120 basis points over a year-over-year basis.  
These results reflect the benefits of our consistent investments and the diversity of our platform. Flows were positive across all major client types, across all asset classes and all geographic regions, including more than $1 billion of net inflows in each of the 19 countries and into 104 different products.  
In strategic growth areas, we saw record client demand for active equities, sustainability, our cash products and our alternative investment strategies. We also generated $185 billion of net inflows into iShares ETFs, and we also delivered a record $1.1 billion in technology services revenues.  
By supporting clients with solutions, no matter their objective or risk preference, BlackRock is positioned to generate differentiating growth and invest for the future. Our long-term strategy remains to focus on accelerating growth in iShares, accelerating our growth in illiquid alternatives, accelerating our growth in technology and making sure that performance and generating alpha is at the heart of BlackRock.  
We're doing this through delivering whole portfolio solutions and becoming the global leader in sustainable investing. These investments will benefit, of course, our shareholders, but are benefiting all our stakeholders.  
Sustainable -- sustainability reached an inflection point this past year driven by the convergence of business practices, regulation, technology advancements, and we're seeing it across client preferences. BlackRock generated $68 billion of net inflows in sustainable strategies in 2020, representing over 60% organic growth. And we launched over 100 new products in 2020 to expand investor choice.  
We are seeing strong demand across client segments. Institutional clients are increasingly seeking sustainable strategies to mitigate exposures and to capture opportunities, while clients are using ETF building block, especially our sustainable iShares ETFs in both sustainable and traditional model portfolios.  
We recently surveyed investors representing $25 trillion in assets, who said they plan to double, I will underscore double, their allocations to sustainable products over the next 5 years to nearly 40% average from a level of approximately 18%. BlackRock's sustainable investment platform is well positioned to meet this demand, and we will continue to believe the $200 billion we manage today will go to $1 trillion in sustainable investments by the end of this decade.  
Clients worldwide are continuing to adopt ETFs throughout the year, and iShares drove $185 billion of inflows in 2020. In the U.S., iShares ETFs crossed $2 trillion last week, doubling our size in just 4 years. Our European iShares generated nearly $60 billion in net inflows, becoming increasingly important to our global growth. Overall, iShares ETFs, particularly in the first quarter, has unlocked new sources of client demand with active managers, insurers and asset owners globally.  
BlackRock's scale, engineering, technology and ecosystem partnerships have enabled us to maintain robust liquidity across iShares ETFs and execute some of the largest rebalances in history, all with tight tracking error and while operating our platform fully remotely in this environment.  
We win these 4 defining moments in our ETF business in 2020. One, iShares outperformed in the face of the most severe market stress test in ETF history. Two, fixed income ETFs shined as a modernization force for the $100 trillion bond market. Three, sustainable ETFs are making sustainable investing more accessible to investors. And four, we are seeing an increased adaptation of ETFs in wealth portfolios as more wealth management industry shifts towards a more fiduciary commission-free model.  
We believe that these moments and BlackRock's performance in them will continue to support and accelerate the long-term growth of iShares and the broader ETF industry. More than 70% of our annual iShares flows were from strategic product segments led by fixed income and sustainable product categories.  
2020 was a turning point for global client adoption of fixed income ETFs and fixed income iShares, generating $89 billion of inflows. We estimate that over 100 asset managers and asset owners globally were first-time adopters in 2020 in fixed income ETFs, and 80% of our top active managers are now using our fixed income ETFs.  
Fixed income iShares is now a $690 billion business, and we continue to believe it will grow to $1 trillion over the next 2 to 3 years. Sustainable iShares ETF saw a record $47 billion of net inflows in 2020, and AUM has tripled year-over-year to $82 billion.  
We're rapidly expanding our product suite, partnering with index and data providers to expand product choice in this category. With more than 140 iShare ETFs and index funds globally, we have the broadest choice of any firm, and our goal is to continue innovating so that more investors, more people, more savers have greater access to sustainable strategies.  
Shift in the wealth management landscape towards digitization, centralization and outsourcing in both the United States and Europe are increasing ETF usage among these clients. Growth in model portfolios across all platforms is an example of how technology and the transparency of fee-based wealth management are tailwinds for the ETF market. Model portfolios are driving approximately 1/4 of iShares globally -- growth globally, and we expect growth in models, especially customized models developed in partnership with clients, to account for more than half of iShares flows in the coming years.  
BlackRock is deepening partnerships with wealth managers and financial advisers globally by offering high-quality insights and solutions across both index and active strategies, and no other firm can link those 2 strategies together. We are seeing strong demand from our top-performing active mutual fund franchise, even as the broader U.S. active mutual fund industry saw more than $250 billion of outflows in 2020. 
In November, we announced the acquisition of Aperio, which will accelerate our leadership in the fast-growing U.S. separately managed account space. Wealth managers are increasingly looking for partners who can provide personalization and whole portfolio solutions. And now BlackRock is well positioned to be the partner of choice for the full spectrum of wealth clients.  
We want to make it easy for wealth managers to access our investment strategies across funds, ETFs, SMAs and models and construct a more resilient risk-aware portfolio using our technology. Active strategies and strong performance after fees are critical in building efficient, resilient portfolios. And as public markets, both equities and fixed income, become more efficient, clients are increasingly looking for a differentiated manager who can find differentiating sources of alpha.  
It's not just about beating a benchmark or peer medium, but delivering incremental, tangible dollar returns for clients. BlackRock's investments over time in integrated technology, data, risk management, scale, global reach and the interconnectivity is enabling us to generate strong investment performance at a time when clients need this performance the most.  
Our active business generated over $30 billion of alpha returns for clients in 2020, which is leading to more client demand than ever before. BlackRock generated $88 billion of total active inflows for the year, including a record for BlackRock, $30 billion of active inflows in active equities.  
Private markets are also increasingly an important component for alpha in investor portfolios, as both growth assets and diversification. BlackRock has built a broad platform across infrastructure, private credit, real estate and private equity to meet client demands.  
We more than doubled our illiquid alternative platform over the last 5 years, and today, we manage $86 billion on behalf of clients. We raised a record $25 billion of client capital in 2020 led by infrastructure, private equity solutions, private credit and the final close of our direct private equity Long Term Private Capital strategy.  
LTPC is one of the largest first-time funds raised to date with a total of $3.4 billion and a great example of BlackRock's ability to innovate and organically develop private market solutions to meet our clients' evolving needs. And in an increasingly competitive environment for deploying capital, we are leveraging the benefits of BlackRock's scale and size to deploy capital on behalf of clients. 
Our capital markets team gives us a differentiated access to unique deal flow for clients in 2020, and this team alone helped us source 2,100 such opportunities.  
20 years ago, we recognized the important value proposition Aladdin can provide for our clients. Today, our technology is a $1.1 billion revenue business, as more clients than ever before are looking for a unified technology platform, like Aladdin, that can support their whole portfolio across both public and private assets. And we are committed and remain focused on continuously evolving Aladdin for the next 20 years to come.  
As sustainability becomes a critical building block in all portfolios, our ambition is to put Aladdin at the center of sustainable investing and address the challenges that investors are facing and in the future. We launched Aladdin Climate to help clients better access both the physical risk climate change and the transition risk to a low-carbon economy on their portfolios. And we're committed to be providing clients with everything they need for sustainable investing in Aladdin: access to sustainability data and its analytics and tools to seamlessly implement sustainable portfolios.  
And in line with this commitment, we made a minority investment in Clarity AI, which provides tools to access environmental and social impact, and we'll be connecting with the capabilities throughout Aladdin.  
Our ability to address client challenges enables us to fulfill our purpose and drive strong long-term performance. Over the last 5 years, clients entrusted us with $1.5 trillion of net new assets, which, in turn, has enabled us to create over 3,500 jobs globally. And on top of all that, we delivered 141% total return for our shareholders. 
I am deeply humbled by how BlackRock's 16,500 employees have supported each other and our clients throughout this challenging year, which is critical to our success in 2020. More than 90% of our employees and our annual employee opinion survey said they are proud to work at BlackRock; and we remain committed to upholding our culture and every day living our purpose. 
We built BlackRock because we believe in the long-term growth of the capital markets and the importance of being invested in the capital markets. Even today, BlackRock only is 2% of the global financial assets, and we see tremendous opportunities ahead to continue supporting the growth of global capital markets and helping more people invest and save.  
Everything we do is rooted in our culture of focusing on the long term, and we will be continuing to innovate using our scale and contributing to more equitable, resilient future to benefit our clients, to benefit our employees, to benefit our shareholders and the people in the communities where we live, where we work, where we operate. I firmly believe that the efforts of 2020 will position BlackRock to deliver value over the long term for all of our stakeholders. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

I know you talked about some specific areas, like technology and market data, but can we maybe get a little more specificity on kind of what are the key areas where you expect to add into '21?

I'll take the first swipe at that and then let others chime in.  So look, our performance in 2020 clearly reflects, as we've talked about at length, a strategic commitment to investing responsibly in our business",511,"Thanks, Alex. It's Gary. Happy New Year. I'll take the first swipe at that and then let others chime in.  
So look, our performance in 2020 clearly reflects, as we've talked about at length, a strategic commitment to investing responsibly in our business across market cycles. And our margin of the year, up 120 basis points improvement over last year benefited from a number of, what I would call, items that we saw in 2020 that will be potentially a little different next year. 
And of course, we're trying to stare into a crystal ball like everybody else, but margin last year benefited from record performance fees. We had securities lending revenue that was also a record. And I think as we've talked about, we did have a lower level of core G&A expense than anticipated. So if you think about it, from my perspective, the margin pop we saw this year was probably a little bit higher than we would normally have expected.  
And as we stated previously, we've never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. And we are passionate, as you know, about investing responsibly and aggressively.  
So many have asked, in fact, we were asked at your conference about our plans for next year and whether we would drop some of those reduced core spending levels to the bottom line. In our view at this point is when we look out at the opportunities in front of us and what's happening in the industry that we see a very unique opportunity to continue playing offense maybe even a little harder and to invest that money back into the business to support incremental investments in technology, market data and a variety of other areas to support those growth initiatives.  
So when you say like what those are, I think it's very consistent with what we've talked about. I think we look to invest meaningfully higher next year, again, in terms of repurposing some of those. Remember, we didn't really complete our -- all of our investment plans during the year. We put a hiring freeze on -- in 2020 in March and didn't really start rehiring until late in the third quarter. 
So we're a little bit behind, so there's a little bit of catch-up, and there's a little bit of incremental that's going to happen. And the -- strategically, think private markets, iShares, Aladdin, sustainability, whole portfolios, stewardship, China, which is obviously starting to ramp up as we're going to get operational there.  
In terms of technology, we are in the midst of our cloud migration. We are seeing opportunities in terms of tech infrastructure as well as health and safety improvements throughout the organization. So I think with that in mind, we feel that this is the right time for us to kind of ramp it up. And given that we saw a little bit of a higher margin this year than we would have anticipated, it results in a little bit of a more moderated margin story for 2021."

I -- we are seeing -- we believe that because, even at that rate, that is not going to change the allocation that remarkably because I do believe that, that rate -- liability rates are still going to be longer. And as a result, the demand for equities will persist.  
But in terms of fixed income, we have not really seen much change in client preferences. They are consistently looking at products like SIO, which is a specialized fixed income product that is not targeted to -- is not targeted normally to duration.  
We expect to see more global demand in global bonds as a mechanism away from the potential lowering of the U.S. dollar. We will -- we are continuing to see emerging markets beginning to show interest as a macro trade. And we're -- we continue to see more and more interest in private markets and private credit. So I -- and which we are strong in all of these.  
So I don't think you're going to see a persistent large-scale rebalancing out of core fixed income assets. The positive side, I would say, if rates go up for the yield curve, it's going to make, obviously, the banking system to be much stronger. It's going to make lending even easier to be had. I think a rising yield curve is a positive sign for the economy. And so all of that, in my mind, leads to probably better equity valuations. 
Rob, do you have anything you wanted to add to that?"

But I think, Glenn, the way we look at it is as people allocate to fixed income, they're going to allocate differently. And the fixed income iShares flows are going to benefit from the low rate environment, as we've already started to see.  
And as people start to do this reallocation, this is why we've seen, as Larry mentioned in his opening remarks, over 100 new asset managers and asset owner clients come into fixed income, but come in through iShares. And a good statistic is 80% of the top asset managers are now using fixed income ETFs.  
So we think there's still demand, but the demand is going to be shown differently as they come in. And we're very well positioned in our iShare business to take that money in fixed income."

But obviously, as you know, our competitive advantage in terms of what we believe drives a lot of our value proposition is global reach, is best-in-class technology, risk management, diverse investment capabilities across the spectrum of active and passive and then, obviously, to be able to bring all of that together.  
We've been at that now for well over a decade in terms of not only trying to identify the pieces that we need, but also integrating those pieces into a distinct and unique One BlackRock culture. And we think that's really critical to our success today, both in terms of being able to reach clients with boots on the ground, as Larry mentioned, 16,000-plus people, over half of those people are outside of the Americas these days, having capabilities to have thoughtful investment discussions by virtue of the fact that we are local in our local markets, and Larry talked about that a lot. And obviously, I don't think that there's really a great opportunity for a number of our competitors to just recreate Aladdin overnight in terms of those capabilities. 
So I think, again, breadth of product, breadth of reach, breadth of insight, all brought together with technology and risk managing creates this unique franchise that, frankly, seems to be humming on multiple cylinders today. 
And I think we -- do we view that as unique? Yes. Do we view it as something that other people could create? Potentially, but I'll leave that to the challenge. But as I said, we've been doing this for a decade, and it's going to take quite a long time for people to try to replicate, I think, what we have right now."

I believe our distribution platform has been buttressed quite a bit over the last 5 years. It's been a long-term commitment. 
We are providing a uniqueness, as Gary suggested, across the world in terms of providing that conversation that intersects both active and passive and the risk analytics. No firm can do this at this moment. 
I believe the elevation of content by the wealth manager has been one of the giant changes, too. As the wealth management industry has moved away from fee-based to advisory-based, they've really elevated their ability to have deeper, broader conversations. And they're looking for a few partners who could work with them and build that out, and we are certainly one of the go-to firms who are helping that.
And we're able to help them deliver that global insight, that advice and, more importantly, the solutions that are helping them. So it is the combinations of having iShares and our active strategy, but now with the overlaying of technology to customize portfolios. And today, the customization of portfolios and personalizing a portfolio is becoming more and more in need in the wealth management space. 
It is not about selling a bond fund or a stock fund anymore. It is not about buying a stock or a bond. It is about a holistic whole solution portfolio, and so our uniqueness is about that and how we deliver it. 
Just as a response to the industry, the industry has been always designed around a specific product, a specific fund. And for the firms who only have a product or in one asset category, they have a difficult time to really respond to whole portfolio solutions. 
And I believe this customization, the personalization of whole portfolio solutions is becoming the driver, the driver in terms of most of the wealth management conversations. Do we need to do more acquisitions for distribution? Not in the United States and not in Europe. Could we do somewhere in another part of the world where we don't have a strong footprint? Sure. That is consistent what I've said over the last 3 to 5 years. 
And importantly, what we are going to do, like we announced today, the Clarity AI minority interest, what we are trying to do is provide in this portfolio customization also uniqueness in data and analytics to drive better decision-making, which will ultimately drive better performance. And I think that is also the uniqueness of BlackRock and why we are so constructive on the opportunities we have working with wealth managers worldwide."

We built BlackRock around the whole foundation of strong global capital markets. I think we have been a big beneficiary over the years by we've believed in global capital markets and the expansion of global capital markets over the last 20",533,"Great question. We built BlackRock around the whole foundation of strong global capital markets. I think we have been a big beneficiary over the years by we've believed in global capital markets and the expansion of global capital markets over the last 20 years. And I think the size of our footprint and the size of the AUM that we manage is because of our commitment to building broad-scale capital markets. 
One of the interesting points, I said this at the end of the -- my speech today, our size relative to the global common markets is almost virtually unchanged to what it was in 2009. So in 2009, we were under 2% of the global capital markets. And today, we're a little bit over 2% of the global capital market. 
So as much as we've grown, the world capital markets have grown. The use of government debt as a mechanism, finance deficits have grown. The use of the equity markets for IPOs and new companies and the expansion of other countries expanding their capital markets, whether the capital markets expansion in the Middle East or parts of Asia have been really quite extraordinary. So we are benefiting from that. 
What we need in our -- in that, and we've always welcomed that, we need to make sure that regulators focus on a well-functioning capital markets to build a more resilient economy. So we have encouraged regulation worldwide to ensure well-functioning capital markets, and that is the key criteria how we look at it. 
I would say the one myth about asset managers, the asset manager industry is highly regulated already. At BlackRock, we are regulated by the SEC. Because we have a trust bank, we're regulated by the OCC. We're regulated by the CFTC, by FINRA. Overseas, we're regulated across the board. We are not a bank, and that's why we are not regulated by one regulator, the Federal Reserve. But we're regulated by almost any other organization and regulator. 
The asset management industry is still highly fragmented, and so I believe we welcome the conversation. And we are encouraged about how regulators are focusing on the need of a well-functioning capital market. But the concept of that asset management history is not regulated, that must be coming from bankers. 
We're not a bank. We don't -- all $8.7 trillion of our assets are other people's hard-earned savings and money. We have a contract with every one of our clients. 
In most of our short-term funds, mutual funds, ETFs, they could sell those assets in a day. And our institutional liquid portfolios, they could do it over 30 days. And depending on some of the long-term private assets, that depends on the contract that we have with each individual client. 
But the notion that asset managers are not regulator, it's just a myth. It is not true. But as the largest asset manager in the world, as a fiduciary to all our client savings, we want a highly functioning markets. And at the time when markets need more supervision, in almost all cases, we have been systematically in favor of ensuring market safety and soundness, and we will encourage that going forward."

And as me",397,"Well, the answer is yes, but it comes under a broader picture, and that is we're seeing increased demand for what is called personalization and customization, and that includes tax managed. It also includes ESG and includes factor preferences. 
And as mentioned before, wealth managers are looking to do more with fewer partners. So they want partners who can offer whole portfolio solutions, and that's why we are positioning ourselves to be the partner of choice. 
With our acquisition of Aperio, we are further enhancing our value proposition for whole portfolio SMAs across equity, fixed income, alpha factors and index solutions because, ultimately, we want to make it easy for wealth managers to access our investment strategies across funds, ETFs, SMAs, even models and be able to construct more resilient, risk-aware portfolios using our technology. 
So we're seeing -- as a result of our investment in serving more and more wealth managers, we saw $185 billion of iShare flows. We're seeing strong active flows, including inflows across active mutual funds, even as the industry saw outflows. And we're reaching out to more advisers with our adviser center and our partnership with Envestnet. 
Now on the self-indexing part of your question, look, self-indexing certainly has some advantages, and the advantages are cost and flexibility. So we're exploring constantly self-indexing in areas where there aren't well-defined indices, and that would be in smart beta, in fixed income, factors, in ESG. And currently, we have 6 self-indexed ETFs. 
So we also continue to have great relationships with our index providers, and we believe there's often significant value in having a third-party provider. And clients, especially institutions, often value the brands and are benchmarked to those particular indices. 
As well, the major index providers, they provide services more than just the brand. They provide research, IP, tracking, corporate events. So we're also seeing better price competition among the index providers and the sharing of IP. And I think you've also seen our recently announced collaboration with Morningstar focused on enhancing style investing for clients to better represent the size and style mandates in the U.S. equity market. 
So a lot said, but a lot of that has to do with this customization, this personalization. And as you rightfully say, a lot of that is going to be focused on tax going forward, and we want to be positioned well for that."

It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2021. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
BlackRock's platform has been built over time to help clients meet their objectives regardless of market environment or risk appetite. We've invested for years to develop industry-leading franchises in high-growth areas such as ETFs, private markets, technology and more recently, sustainable investing, so we can help clients construct resilient whole portfolios that leverage both active and index capabilities. 
While a few of us could have predicted that we would still be confronting the human and economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic a year later, the events of the past year have only strengthened our resolve to continue to invest for future growth in order to evolve our business, live our purpose and meet the needs of all of our stakeholders, including clients, employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate. The investments BlackRock has consistently made to build a best-in-class investment and technology platform centered around a fiduciary mindset, where clients always come first in a collaborative and unifying One BlackRock culture that encourages emotional ownership, are driving incredible momentum across our entire business. 
BlackRock generated record net inflows of $172 billion in the first quarter, our fourth consecutive quarter with over $100 billion in quarterly inflows, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth and 14% annualized organic base fee growth. Strong performance from our entire active franchise once again contributed to this quarter's robust organic fee growth. 
Over the last 12 months, our broad-based platform, pairing diverse investment capabilities with best-in-class technology and rigorous risk management, has now generated over $525 billion of total net inflows, representing 14% organic base fee growth, well in excess of our 5% long-term target. First quarter revenue of $4.4 billion increased 19% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.5 billion rose 21% and reflected the impact of approximately $180 million of costs associated with the launch of the nearly $5 billion BlackRock Innovation and Growth Trust, our largest closed-end fund ever in late March. 
Earnings per share of $7.77 was up 18% compared to a year ago, also reflecting lower nonoperating income and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by a lower diluted share count in the current quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter included $8 million of net investment income as gains in our co-investment portfolio were largely offset by the mark-to-market impact of our minority stake in Envestnet. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 21% and included $39 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vest in the first quarter of each year. We continue to estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2021, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation during the year. 
First quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.6 billion was up 18% year-over-year primarily driven by strong organic base fee growth and the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, partially offset by higher discretionary money market fee waivers, lower securities lending revenue and the effect of 1 less day in the current quarter and strategic pricing investments over the last year. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 6%. On an equivalent day count basis, our effective fee rate was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter as strong organic base fee growth driven by our higher fee active businesses more than offset higher discretionary money market fee waivers and lower securities lending revenue in the current quarter. 
Performance fees of $129 million were up significantly from a year ago, reflecting strong performance in our liquid alternative and long-only investment platforms and the impact of COVID-related market volatility a year ago. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 12% from a year ago. 
Annual contract value or ACV increased 16% year-over-year, reflecting particularly strong growth from the first quarter of 2020, which was impacted by slower sales and contracting disruption in the early days of the pandemic. We remain committed to low to mid-teens growth in ACV over the long term. 
Aladdin's resilience has been a key differentiator throughout the COVID crisis, and client demand remains strong. As Larry will discuss in more detail, we see tremendous opportunity to continue building out Aladdin's climate and sustainability risk analytics and data capabilities, making it central to constructing sustainable portfolios of the future. 
Advisory and other revenue was down $33 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting the absence of PennyMac equity method earnings following the charitable contribution of our remaining equity stake in the first quarter of 2020 as well as lower transition management revenue in the current quarter. Total expense increased 17% versus the year-ago quarter driven primarily by higher compensation, direct fund and noncore G&A expense. 
Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 24%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income and performance fees and higher deferred compensation, reflecting additional grants and the mark-to-market impact of certain deferred compensation programs relative to depressed levels a year ago. Approximately 80% of the increase in our compensation-to-revenue ratio year-over-year was attributable to this mark-to-market impact on certain deferred compensation programs. Direct fund expense increased 16% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average index AUM. 
G&A expense was up $32 million year-over-year and $111 million sequentially, reflecting approximately $180 million of previously disclosed closed-end fund launch costs. Recall that we exclude the impact of these product launch costs when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin. 
Year-over-year G&A comparisons were also impacted by approximately $155 million of noncore G&A expense in the first quarter of 2020, which included closed-end fund launch costs, contingent consideration fair value adjustments and costs related to certain legal matters. On a core basis, quarterly G&A expense was essentially flat year-over-year as higher portfolio services and technology expense was offset by lower T&E, marketing spend and professional fees. Quarterly G&A expense also benefited from a delay in planned spending in a number of areas, which we expect to incur over the remainder of the year. 
Intangible amortization expense increased $9 million year-over-year as a result of the acquisition of Aperio, which closed on February 1. Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.4% was up 270 basis points from a year ago, benefiting in part from significantly lower level of noncore G&A expense versus a year ago and the delayed timing of certain investment spend in the current quarter. 
As we stated in January, our business has never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us, and we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We continue to see numerous opportunities to invest for growth, including sustainable investing, private markets, technology and China and intend to pursue these opportunities responsibly. 
Our capital management strategy remains, first, to invest in our business and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success through seed and co-investments to support organic growth and through tactical M&A and strategic minority investments to accelerate our growth ambitions. 
During the first quarter, we closed our acquisition of Aperio and as Larry will discuss in more detail, announced the partnership with Temasek to co-invest in innovative decarbonization technology. We previously announced a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend to $4.13 per share of common stock and also repurchased $300 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. While we will remain opportunistic with respect to additional share repurchases during the year, there is no change to the minimum repurchase guidance we provided to you earlier this year. 
As you'll also hear from Larry, BlackRock has never been better positioned to deliver for clients as we leverage our unique insights, guidance and solutions to help them meet their long-term investment needs. Record net inflows of $172 billion in the first quarter, including $133 billion of long-term flows, reflect the strength of our broad-based franchise with positive flows across every asset class, investment style, client channel and region. 
Our iShares and BlackRock ETFs generated net inflows of $68 billion, representing 10% annualized organic asset and base fee growth. Results highlight the diversity of the product segments within our ETF franchise with growth led by continued strength in core equity and sustainable ETFs. We also saw strong closing to our higher-fee liquid markets-driven precision exposures as clients continue to re-risk, particularly in international equities, and tactically position their portfolios for the reopening of economies worldwide. 
First quarter fixed income ETF flows of $1.6 billion reflected demand for shorter-term and floating rate bond exposures, which was largely offset by outflows from longer-duration ETFs, especially LQD, as investors reacted to the most significant steepening in the yield curve since 2013. These inflows, even with the drag from longer-duration products, speaks to the diversity of our fixed income ETF franchise, which will continue to benefit from strong, long-term secular growth. 
Record retail net inflows of $37 billion, representing 17% annualized organic asset growth and 25% annualized organic base fee growth, were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and across all major asset classes, including fixed income. Inflows reflected broad-based strength across the entirety of our top-performing active platform, which is well positioned to capture resurging demand for active equities and investor appetite for yield, where our diversified fixed income range, including unconstrained, high yield, international and broad market strategies, are positioned to meet client demand in any rate environment. 
BlackRock's institutional active franchise generated $17 billion of net inflows led by continued growth into our LifePath target date and alternatives platforms. Institutional index net inflows of $11 billion once again reflected equity net outflows, which were more than offset by fixed income net inflows as clients rebalance portfolios after significant equity market gains or sought to immunize portfolios through LDI strategies. 
As previously discussed in January, we expect a large U.S. public pension client to transition approximately $55 billion of low-fee index assets to another investment manager. This transition is likely to occur during the second quarter of 2021 and will have a de minimis impact on our organic base fee growth for the year. 
Across our retail and institutional client businesses, we generated a record $21 billion of active equity net inflows, representing our eighth consecutive quarter of positive flows in this category. Flows were led by top-performing franchises in technology and mid-cap growth, which benefited from the previously mentioned launch of the BlackRock innovation and growth closed-end fund. 
We remain well positioned for future growth in our active businesses with over 80% of fundamental active equity, scientific active equity and taxable fixed income assets performing above their respective benchmarks or peer medians for the trailing 5-year period. Demand for alternatives also continued with nearly $9 billion of net inflows into liquid and illiquid alternative strategies during the quarter driven by infrastructure, private equity solutions and liquid alternatives funds. Fundraising momentum remains strong, and we have approximately $27 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform continued to grow and outperform peers, generating almost $40 billion of net inflows in the first quarter and topping $700 billion in assets under management for the first time. During the first quarter, we incurred approximately $78 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers and expect such discretionary fee waivers to persist for the near term, especially in light of the recent growth in our U.S. government fund franchise and the supply-demand dynamics in the short-dated U.S. treasury and repo markets. Future levels of discretionary fee waivers will be impacted by several factors, including the level of AUM and funds with existing waivers, gross yields and competitive positioning. 
Our strong performance over the last 12 months is a testament to our purpose, the strong execution of our strategy, the confidence our clients place in us and the hard work, commitment and resilience of our employees. Our relationships with clients have never been deeper, and we will continue to invest responsibly from a position of strength to meet the needs of all of our stakeholders over the coming years. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

I hope you and your loved ones are continuing to stay healthy and safe. 
We are reporting earnings today from our headquarters in New York City, and I'm incredibly energized by being all together as a group, as a team, as partners. I'm cautiously optimistic for a return to normalcy in the coming months as vaccinations roll out, and I'm looking forward to seeing all of our stakeholders in person again. 
The strong results BlackRock saw this quarter are the outcome of a multiyear investments we've made in our asset management and technology platform to better serve our clients worldwide. More than ever before, we are seeing the benefits of these long-term investments resonating. 
We have stronger results and deeper relationships with clients across their entire portfolios. We generated $527 billion of net inflows and a record 14% organic base fee growth over the last 12 months, including a very strong 2021. 
Over a decade ago, we acquired iShares based on our conviction in the value proposition of ETFs. Our continuous investments in our platform since then to help more clients use ETFs to build better portfolios have fueled iShares growth from $385 billion during the acquisition to more than $2.8 trillion today. 
We began expanding our alternative platform more than 5 years ago. And today, we manage nearly $200 billion in these strategies for all our clients. Our leadership in alternatives has only just begun, and we're seeing momentum accelerate as we scale our offerings, as we source our capabilities and our integration of data and technology into the management of private market assets. 
We've been investing in all aspects of our Aladdin technology to better serve our clients' needs. We saw demand for a unified whole portfolio technology. And we enhanced Aladdin with eFront to offer portfolio construction and risk analytics capability in one view across all public and all private markets. 
We created an end-to-end platform that enables straight-through processing between the asset owners, the asset managers, the custodians through Aladdin provider. We created Aladdin Wealth to help financial advisers build better portfolios for millions of clients around the world. 
We recognize the growing impact of sustainability risks and the opportunities on our clients' portfolios. And as I will discuss in more detail later on, we are investing to systematically integrate climate and broader sustainable factors across all our investment offerings and risk management processes. 
We manage over $200 billion in long-term sustainable assets today. And more recently, as wealth clients increasingly focus on the importance of after-tax returns in their investment, we acquired Aperio to enhance BlackRock's ability to meet these clients' needs. 
The investments we made and continue to make in our platform enables BlackRock to have a holistic perspective and a voice that resonates with our stakeholders. More clients than ever before are turning to BlackRock for insights and for guidance. 
They want to hear from us on topics such as how to position their portfolio for rising interest rates and inflation. How should they think about the U.S. deficits? How to think about the potential opportunities from new infrastructure policies and how to invest for a net 0 world. 
We're vocal on issues that are important to our stakeholders like cultural issues that impact our employees, that policies that impact our communities. We speak loudly and work for all our stakeholders. 
The benefits of BlackRock's differentiating approach are clear in the strength and consistency of our results. As Gary told you, our total net inflows of $172 billion in the first quarter were diversified across all client types, asset classes, investment styles and regions and represented an 8% annualized organic asset growth and a record 14% annualized organic base fee growth. 
As the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues and restrictions are eased, a significant acceleration of economic activity is anticipated despite the consistently high numbers of cases around the world and now the introduction of many new variants. Investors are navigating their portfolio through uncertainty such as the strength of the reopening, structural changes to the economies and fiscal policy and consequences for growth and inflation when activity is more fully restored. 
Interest rates coming off historically lower levels have put pressure on fixed income assets and led to a rotation within equity from growth to value. Unlike the taper tantrum of 2013, however, the recent rise in rates have been gradual as investors look for greater compensation for holding longer-duration bonds, and investor appetite for risk assets remain very strong. 
There's a lot of money in motion today. The level of fiscal support we have seen over the past year is 4x that of a global financial crisis. But many investors continue to keep significant amounts of cash on the sidelines. To reach their investment goals, we will need to deploy that money in solutions that provide yield and preservation of their assets. 
BlackRock has deliberately built our industry-leading fixed income business to meet clients' needs regardless of the rate environment. Changing rates that manifest and rotating within fixed income and BlackRock's diversified platform and strong active performance with 84% of our taxable fixed assets above benchmark or peer median for a 3-year period was well positioned for the demand. We saw $17 billion of net inflows in active fixed income driven by unconstrained, total return, municipals, international and high-yield bond funds. 
Client demand for active strategies continued to accelerate at BlackRock. BlackRock generated $59 billion of active net inflows across asset classes in the first quarter, including another record quarter for active equities. 
Strong active flows included the nearly $5 billion launch of the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Trust, the second largest ever closed-end fund launch in the United States. By innovating in product structure, generating strong investment performance and offering strategies aligned with the needs of our clients, we are leading the turnaround of the closed-end fund IPO market. 
BlackRock's strong active performance in flows are a direct result of these investments that I spoke about to build a platform with collaborative intelligence, advanced data and technologies in a whole portfolio approach. We have never ever been more better positioned to deliver durable alpha for our clients. And I am confident we will continue to capture more demand for active strategies as we further strengthen our platform and invest in our platform. 
In illiquid alternatives, we are seeing the magnitude of client flows increase every year. In the first quarter, we generated a record $11 billion of inflows and commitments, results spanning from private credit to infrastructure to private equity solutions, including the final close of our inaugural $3 billion private equity secondary fund. 
Infrastructure investments will be a key component of long-term returns in client portfolios as governments launch long-overdue infrastructure products and projects to restart their economies and build for a more resilient future. The $2 trillion infrastructure plan in the United States will create significant opportunities for putting capital to work in this asset class. 
Within infrastructure, renewables represent more than 50% of the transactions globally, and BlackRock is well positioned with one of the industry's largest renewable power franchises. We recently closed the third vintage of our global renewable power fund, raising nearly $5 billion, which is more than the first and second vintage combined.  
iShares and BlackRock ETFs generated $68 billion of net inflows in the first quarter, the strongest start to a year in our history. Importantly, flows reflect the diversity of our ETF platform and the benefits of strategic investments we made over time to support the adaptation of ETFs, the evolution of new uses, the reduction in barriers like commissions and growth in areas such as model portfolios. 
The work we are doing to expand our sustainable iShares business is a great example of how we continue to innovate ahead of our clients' needs. We generated $17 billion of net inflows in the quarter across the sustainable iShares spectrum from screens to thematic strategies. 
We recently crossed $100 billion of AUM in this category, up from $26 billion just a year ago. The global transition to a net 0 economy will impact every company's growth prospects. And BlackRock believes these -- believes that they are adapting and pivoting their strategies and business models ahead of this tectonic shift that will outperform over the long term. 
Every investor will need to position their portfolios accordingly. And BlackRock is investing to provide clients with more choice as we become a leader in sustainable and climate-aware investing. 
We launched 2 low-carbon transition readiness ETFs last week, raising a total of nearly $2 billion, representing the largest ETF launch in U.S. history. Traditionally, climate products have been backward-looking, really focused on reported greenhouse gas emissions. Using advanced data and analytics and research driven by insights, BlackRock developed a forward-looking active climate investment strategy in a transparent active ETF vehicle. These active ETFs are the first of their kind and a great example of how BlackRock is innovating to expand access to sustainable strategies for more investors worldwide. 
In total, BlackRock manages $353 billion in sustainable investments, including cash. And we believe this category will grow to more than $1 trillion by 2030. Sustainable investing presents opportunities for BlackRock, not only in terms of AUM growth, but in the demand for industry-leading technology and data. As sustainability becomes a critical building block in portfolios, investors need a clear understanding of how sustainable-related risk and opportunities impact their portfolio. 
One of the newest opportunities for BlackRock is powering portfolios to a new sustainable standard with Aladdin because climate risk is investment risk. Our ambition to make Aladdin climb as the standard for assessing this risk with investors' portfolio and helping clients navigate and capture investment opportunity presented by the transition to a net 0 economy. 
Investments we have made in [ Aladdin ] over the years is to serve more clients with better risk analytics, end-to-end operating systems. And the benefit of scale drove a 12% year-over-year growth in technology services revenues. We consistently hear from clients that poor quality or availability of ESG data and analytics is the biggest barrier to deeper and broader implementation of sustainable investing. That is why we're evolving Aladdin sustainability to help clients better assess their exposures and their positions across all our portfolios. 
Our minority investment in Clarity AI will integrate analytics and data covering 30,000 companies and nearly 200 companies within Aladdin. And our partnership with [ Rep Risk ] will give clients the ability to identify ESG risk exposures in private investments and create a holistic view of risk across our portfolios. 
Advancing towards a net 0 economy by 2050 will require more than better data and analytics. It will require transformational innovation in carbon reduction and elimination -- eliminating technologies. BlackRock has partnered with Temasek to establish decarbonization partners to invest in innovative decarbonization solutions to help accelerate global efforts. This initiative will provide clients with an opportunity to participate in a net 0 transition by complementing BlackRock's existing renewable power and energy infrastructure investment platform. 
In line with our strategic focus on technology and sustainability, we nominated Hans Vestberg, Chairman and CEO of Verizon, to our Board of Directors for his deep experience in international markets technology and sustainability. At the same time, I want to thank Mathis Cabiallavetta for his passion and his dedication to BlackRock and its shareholders over the last 13 years. He will not stand for reelection at BlackRock's Annual Meeting next month, and he will be missed by our entire Board and by me and the entire leadership team at BlackRock. 
Our results and the speed of our forward momentum underscores the importance of BlackRock's fiduciary approach and culture. I truly believe our culture is what sets BlackRock apart. It drives our performance. It pushes us to innovate. It pushes us to stay ahead of our clients' needs. And it guides our decisions, and it guides our behaviors. 
Critical to our culture is building an environment of inclusivity, belonging, trust and creating a safe environment. More than ever before, BlackRock's leadership team and I are focused on instilling this culture with all of our 16,700 employees around the world and evolving it to ensure that every employee, I want to underscore every employee, feels the sense of belonging. 
The strength of our first quarter results across iShares, private markets, technology and active and sustainable strategies is more broad-based today than any point in our history. But our global scale and our unique client interactions give us greater ability to invest in our clients' future and ultimately, for the benefit of our shareholders. 
I see tremendous opportunities ahead for BlackRock's focus remaining on embracing change, investing for the long term so we could best serve all our stakeholders. And I look forward to executing on our ambitious plans in the years ahead.

I heard $353 billion in sustainable AUM and I also heard -- I thought I heard you say $200 billion. I just wanted to make sure what those 2 numbers were. 
And then in the 1Q close, you had $17 billion of iShares, but what additional flows would be coming into other sustainable products? And then the broader question would be on the Temasek partnership, more broadly for carbon transition. Obviously, a huge evolving field. Have you thought about what the asset management TAM might be in that field and how you might tackle that through not only this partnership, but obviously through the ETFs you launch and other products as well?"

The difference is we have a broad-based cash management space that is becoming more and more sustainable. So if you add the cash side or the short-term cash, it comes up to that $300 billion number. I hope I answered that question properly now. 
Two, I think the opportunity in transition is amazing. It is estimated we need to spend $50 trillion to have a decarbonized world. And to do that is investing in new technologies. And we are very pleased to having a partner in Temasek. And we have had many conversations with them related to how can we bring the world closer to a decarbonized world without a premium or without a green premium. And this is specifically so relevant, not just in the United States, but it's so relevant in the emerging world. 
The emerging world is still growing and still had a greater need for electricity, greater need for building. The emerging world is just at the beginning of their economic growth. And so if we are going to get to a net 0 world, the need for innovation and investing, for green hydrogen to bring that premium down to 0, for biofuels, for sequestering carbon at a very inexpensive price, all of these are going to require new technologies. 
For agriculture, agriculture produces over -- close to 15% of the carbon footprint when you related to that. And so we have many areas where it is going to require new technologies. And I truly believe we are going to have many young people instead of going into data and technology related to the social side of technology. I believe many, many innovations are going to come from young, startup, innovative companies. 
But I would also say I am very bullish on our traditional hydrocarbon and chemical companies as they pivot. And I've had conversations recently with the CEO of a very large oil and gas company. Just yesterday, I had a conversation with a CEO of a very large chemical company. And we're actually talking to them about how can BlackRock invest with them side by side on -- add technologies for decarbonization. 
I mean the science and technology that our existing companies have in terms of the understanding of carbon and understand the science of transforming it to a more decarbonized world is great. And so we are very encouraged about investing in startups, and that's what our Temasek-BlackRock decarbonization funded. But we actually are having many conversations about investing with our infrastructure teams, with our private teams, with our debt teams to finance this. We had numerous conversations with companies related to biofuels. And so when we -- our employees are flying around the world that we could have a footprint that is net 0. And so all of these are great opportunities for us and the investors worldwide."

There's not want consistent conversation going on institutionally. Obviously, the question of inflation, the question of the deficits matter are prominent conversations with our fixed income investors now. 
Some fixed income investors are looking to derisk, but derisking by going into low duration or unconstrained strategies. Some of them are looking to say, ""I need more credit or I need more coupon to take on that duration risk."" And so there's -- we still see demand in high yield evident by our flows. So I don't think there's one specific trend. 
But I would say -- but the narrative around the question of inflation deficits are becoming a very prominent part of our conversation. So obviously, many questions related to equity valuations, the rotation from growth to value. Is that overdone at this moment, especially if the vaccinations are going to take longer and other questions on that. And so those are probably the dominant conversation. 
But if anything, Dan, as we've said in some of the prepared remarks, there's incredible pools of cash on the sidelines. I would say overall, our clients are still sitting with big pools of money. Overall, they're still underinvested. 
Now I would say as the 10-year treasury rises in rates, their liabilities become less burdensome. And so -- and if there is a continuing rising of the 10-year rate, the need for extending duration is no longer as necessary. 
And so -- but the dialogues are very robust now. Many, many clients are putting and allocating more and more to private and alternatives. Many clients now are using ETFs for active exposures. That's accelerating, not decelerating. 
And so I would say there's nothing that's prominent in any one conversation except one thing, that conversation around sustainability. There is not a conversation today with an institutional client on how should they think about climate risk? How should they think about transition risk? And as I just said in the prior question, what we are trying to have our clients focus on not the fear of transition, not the enormous need for transition, but the opportunities that transition will entail to get it right, the investment technologies to make sure that we don't have this green premium or the net 0 world will not happen, especially in the emerging world. 
And so this is the beauty of, I would say, of capitalism. This is the beauty of capital markets, that more and more clients are looking to be more prepared for this long-term trend. And many, many clients are asking the question, what role should their portfolio play in this long-term trend?"

So we are -- we -- I think as we indicated previously, we're definitely accelerating our pace of investment spend into '21. I think it's a combination of a couple of things. 
I mean I think the first thing is that I think it's really critical to note and look back at our results not only for this quarter, but the momentum for the last year. That effectively reflects the fact that we have consistently spent in our business to stay ahead of clients' needs and across the franchise. I mean without that consistent level of investment to try and stay ahead of those needs, we don't generate $525 billion of flows and 14% organic base fee growth with 4 quarters over $100 billion. 
We believe, and you've heard Larry reaffirm it, that our business has never been better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities, whether it's sustainable, Larry has been talking about a lot this morning, private markets, technology, China. And we are going to pursue those opportunities responsibly. 
That being said, we obviously remain margin-aware all the time. We're focusing on managing that entire discretionary expense base as always, and we're committed to optimizing growth in the most efficient way possible. But our accelerated spend this year is really a function of what I just said, which is all the opportunities that we see before us. And the reality that we just didn't spend what we thought we were going to spend in 2020. 
We made a strong commitment to our employees not to reduce our headcount. And I think that was a good thing because we saw the work units and the volumes increased throughout the year. We didn't really turn the hiring spigot back on until the second half and frankly, late in the second half of last year. And so a lot of what we're doing this year is catching up to our business. 
We went into a year with a very specific budget in terms of our discretionary spend, whether that was in hiring or spending on G&A. And we have made no changes to that since we last chatted. Obviously, I think between beta and our organic growth, we're ahead of where we thought in terms of the business. But our intent is to continue to spend throughout the year as to the original budget. We definitely got off to a little bit of a slower start in terms of tech, M&P spend. We're obviously anticipating some pickup in T&E towards the end of the year. And it's full speed ahead in terms of our plans for the year."

We talked about the fact that we did have 12% year-over-year growth in revenue. And I think as always, the large preponderance of our technology services revenue today remains what we would call kind of the institutional Aladdin component. Obviously, we have other parts of that in terms of a variety of different, whether it's Aladdin Wealth or accounting or a bunch of other things. But the majority of that wealth -- the majority of that growth is still year-over-year tied to the institutional business. 
Some of the component adds that we're basically anticipating growth in over time are still at the early stages. And so there's no question that as we begin to grow out things like Aladdin Climate, which is really just getting started, we think that's going to be having a much more significant impact on our year-over-year growth. 
There's no question that we believe that the demand for integrated and resilient investment management technology is increasing. The pandemic has increased awareness on the importance of technology. We're seeing industry consolidation, shifting product usage and regulatory requirements, creating the need for more holistic and flexible solutions. 
And our pipeline for the remainder of the year is strong. So again, continuing to feel very good about that business. As I mentioned, the ACV of 16% is probably a little ahead of where we normally anticipate that just by virtue of the comparison to a year ago. But we are -- we feel really, really good about our positioning in that business, especially given our whole portfolio view across public and private markets."

And then with the need of more information at the financial advisers' fingertip so they could provide deeper, broader risk analytics to their clients. And that's Aladdin Wealth. 
We have built Aladdin around the needs of our clients to offer a better experience, better outcomes. And then I can't think of a better and more important time when Aladdin was necessary when we were all working remotely and still working remotely and having an operating system that is connected worldwide. 
And the -- our clients worldwide have actually become more enthusiastic about how Aladdin shapes and helps their business. We believe Aladdin actually improved their performance. And there's research by third parties that suggest those who have Aladdin have better financial performance. 
Then when you think about climate risk and transition risk that is going to encompass from cash to the most long-dated privates across the entire portfolio, across all products, across all regions, the need for Aladdin climate and having data and analytics to justify the investments. We have to live under the Department of Labor rule of remaining to be a fiduciary. And so we have to justify as a fiduciary that climate risk is investment risk. 
And so more than ever before, I believe Aladdin is as well positioned because of how we navigated it to making it end-to-end through the custodian to the wealth manager, now publics and privates and then importantly now with sustainability really speaks about the resiliency of the operating system and why we continue to have deeper, broader conversations with more clients."

And while we haven't raised $20 billion in one fund, we've raised $2 billion in 10 funds. And then those continue to grow. So we have -- our current focus will be on credit, which is where our clients are looking to invest. 
As Larry mentioned in sustainable, we are looking at renewable energy, which we just raised on very large fund. We will be following very closely the Infrastructure Bill and figure out how we can raise assets that we can deliver to our clients for infrastructure, which for many of our clients who would like long-duration type assets, infrastructure fits very well. So we'll probably go in that direction a bit more. And then simply in seeing how the private equity market evolves and where our clients can earn alpha, drove our secondary and liquidations and as some of the older vintages come due from some of the stable private equity companies that are looking to start new funds, but liquidate what is left in the older funds. 
So what we're trying to do is really have a very careful eye on where we think the next value chain is and can that be described both in a liquid form and an alternatives fund. But what I would tell you is that our general theme is alternatives are going to become less alternative. And so we are following that very carefully.

But -- so in our dialogue with our clients, clients are asking questions related to what is the role of crypto and digital assets related to a part of their portfolio. As you suggested, Robert, it is perceived as a possibly new asset class, similar to maybe commodities or gold. We don't believe it is a substitute for currency, but I do believe we're going to have digitization of currencies. 
So it is just -- it's a conversation. We are investigating and how we can create -- how we could create different products if there's client demand related to crypto. But let me just frame it. And I think one of the reason for our success with our clients over the last 33 years has been our consistency of focusing on long-term investing. It is not about the markets and the behaviors of the markets and the ins and outs of the market. 
Much of the dialogue today related to whether it's a GameStop or which goes out with Reddit, it is about the tick tock and the day trading. And then the activities around Bitcoin and other crypto, we're fascinated about it. We're excited about it as more people are enjoying looking at it. But most of it is about trading and ins and outs of the marketplace. 
And so in our dialogue with our clients worldwide, it is not a major question that is being asked. It is not a major conversation related to how does that fit into their portfolio. With some, it does. Does it fit into their portfolio as a long-term investor? 
And I would just say, overall, the actions around products that are around trading and the navigation of markets and new asset classes, it is not -- it's just not about the whole foundation of our platform about long-term investing. And so if somebody really wanted to build a big, deep dialogue related to this, they're probably going to go to another source. And that is just not a large foundation of the conversation we're having now. 
I mean the conversations we're having with on sustainability is greater today than it was the last time we spoke to you. The conversation we're having about transition opportunities is so much greater than it was a quarter ago. And I believe the momentum there, I believe the opportunity there is so much larger than how is a crypto asset a long-term asset. And so I don't want to diminish anything related to crypto and digital ideas. I'm fascinated about it. I think it is going to be an asset class. We'll see how it performs over a long term. And it may be a great asset class, but let's wait and see."

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.  
BlackRock's platform has been built over time to help clients meet their objectives, regardless of market environment or risk appetite. We've invested for years to develop industry-leading franchises in high-growth areas, such as ETFs, private markets, technology and, more recently, sustainable investing, so we can help clients construct resilient hold portfolios that leverage both active and index capabilities.  
While few of us could have predicted that we would still be confronting the human and economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic a year later, the events of the past year have only strengthened our resolve to continue to invest for future growth in order to evolve our business, live our purpose and meet the needs of all of our stakeholders, including clients, employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate. 
The investments BlackRock has consistently made to build a best-in-class investment and technology platform centered around a fiduciary mindset, where clients always come first in a collaborative and unifying One BlackRock culture that encourages emotional ownership, are driving incredible momentum across our entire business.  
BlackRock generated record net inflows of $172 billion in the first quarter, our fourth consecutive quarter with over $100 billion in quarterly inflows, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth and 14% annualized organic base fee growth. Strong performance from our entire active franchise once again contributed to this quarter's robust organic fee growth.  
Over the last 12 months, our broad-based platform, pairing diverse investment capabilities with best-in-class technology and rigorous risk management, has now generated over $525 billion of total net inflows, representing 14% organic base fee growth, well in excess of our 5% long-term target. 
First quarter revenue of $4.4 billion increased 19% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.5 billion rose 21% and reflected the impact of approximately $180 million of costs associated with the launch of the nearly $5 billion BlackRock Innovation and Growth Trust, our largest closed-end fund ever in late March.  
Earnings per share of $7.77 was up 18% compared to a year ago, also reflecting lower nonoperating income and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by a lower diluted share count in the current quarter. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter included $8 million of net investment income, as gains in our co-investment portfolio were largely offset by the mark-to-market impact of our minority stake in Envestnet.  
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 21% and included $39 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vest in the first quarter of each year. We continue to estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2021, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation during the year.  
First quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.6 billion was up 18% year-over-year primarily driven by strong organic base fee growth and the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, partially offset by higher discretionary money market fee waivers, lower securities lending revenue and the effect of one less day in the current quarter and strategic pricing investments over the last year. 
Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 6%. On an equivalent day count basis, our effective fee rate was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter, as strong organic base fee growth driven by our higher fee active businesses more than offset higher discretionary money market fee waivers and lower securities lending revenue in the current quarter.  
Performance fees of $129 million were up significantly from a year ago, reflecting strong performance in our liquid alternative and long-only investment platforms and the impact of COVID-related market volatility a year ago. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 12% from a year ago.  
Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 16% year-over-year, reflecting particularly strong growth from the first quarter of 2020, which was impacted by slower sales and contracting disruption in the early days of the pandemic. We remain committed to low- to mid-teens growth in ACV over the long term.  
Aladdin's resilience has been a key differentiator throughout the COVID crisis, and client demand remains strong. As Larry will discuss in more detail, we see tremendous opportunity to continue building out Aladdin's climate and sustainability risk analytics and data capabilities, making it central to constructing sustainable portfolios of the future.  
Advisory and other revenue was down $33 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting the absence of PennyMac equity method earnings following the charitable contribution of our remaining equity stake in the first quarter of 2020 as well as lower transition management revenue in the current quarter. 
Total expense increased 17% versus the year-ago quarter driven primarily by higher compensation, direct fund and noncore G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 24%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income and performance fees and higher deferred compensation, reflecting additional grants and the mark-to-market impact of certain deferred compensation programs relative to depressed levels a year ago. Approximately 80% of the increase in our compensation-to-revenue ratio year-over-year was attributable to this mark-to-market impact on certain deferred compensation programs. 
Direct fund expense increased 16% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average index AUM.  
G&A expense was up $32 million year-over-year and $111 million sequentially, reflecting approximately $180 million of previously disclosed closed-end fund launch costs. Recall that we exclude the impact of these product launch costs when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin.  
Year-over-year G&A comparisons were also impacted by approximately $155 million of noncore G&A expense in the first quarter of 2020, which included closed-end fund launch costs, contingent consideration fair value adjustments and costs related to certain legal matters. 
On a core basis, quarterly G&A expense was essentially flat year-over-year, as higher portfolio services and technology expense was offset by lower T&E, marketing spend and professional fees. Quarterly G&A expense also benefited from a delay in planned spending in a number of areas, which we expect to incur over the remainder of the year.  
Intangible amortization expense increased $9 million year-over-year as a result of the acquisition of Aperio, which closed on February 1. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.4% was up 270 basis points from a year ago, benefiting in part from significantly lower level of noncore G&A expense versus a year ago and the delayed timing of certain investment spend in the current quarter.  
As we stated in January, our business has never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us, and we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We continue to see numerous opportunities to invest for growth, including sustainable investing, private markets, technology and China and intend to pursue these opportunities responsibly.  
Our capital management strategy remains, first, to invest in our business and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success through seed and co-investments to support organic growth and through tactical M&A and strategic minority investments to accelerate our growth ambitions.  
During the first quarter, we closed our acquisition of Aperio, and as Larry will discuss in more detail, announced the partnership with Temasek to co-invest in innovative decarbonization technology. 
We previously announced a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend to $4.13 per share of common stock and also repurchased $300 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. While we will remain opportunistic with respect to additional share repurchases during the year, there is no change to the minimum repurchase guidance we provided to you earlier this year.  
As you'll also hear from Larry, BlackRock has never been better positioned to deliver for clients as we leverage our unique insights, guidance and solutions to help them meet their long-term investment needs. Record net inflows of $172 billion in the first quarter, including $133 billion of long-term flows, reflect the strength of our broad-based franchise, with positive flows across every asset class, investment style, client channel and region.  
Our iShares and BlackRock ETFs generated net inflows of $68 billion, representing 10% annualized organic asset and base fee growth. Results highlight the diversity of the product segments within our ETF franchise, with growth led by continued strength in core equity and sustainable ETFs. 
We also saw strong closing to our higher-fee liquid markets-driven precision exposures, as clients continue to re-risk, particularly in international equities, and tactically position their portfolios for the reopening of economies worldwide.  
First quarter fixed income ETF flows of $1.6 billion reflected demand for shorter-term and floating rate bond exposures, which was largely offset by outflows from longer-duration ETFs, especially LQD, as investors reacted to the most significant steepening in the yield curve since 2013. These inflows, even with the drag from longer-duration products, speak to the diversity of our fixed income ETF franchise, which will continue to benefit from strong, long-term secular growth.  
Record retail net inflows of $37 billion, representing 17% annualized organic asset growth and 25% annualized organic base fee growth, were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and across all major asset classes, including fixed income. Inflows reflected broad-based strength across the entirety of our top-performing active platform, which is well positioned to capture resurging demand for active equities and investor appetite for yield, where our diversified fixed income range, including unconstrained, high yield, international and broad market strategies, are positioned to meet client demand in any rate environment.  
BlackRock's institutional active franchise generated $17 billion of net inflows led by continued growth into our LifePath target date and alternatives platforms. Institutional index net inflows of $11 billion once again reflected equity net outflows, which were more than offset by fixed income net inflows, as clients rebalance portfolios after significant equity market gains or sought to immunize portfolios through LDI strategies.  
As previously discussed in January, we expect a large U.S. public pension client to transition approximately $55 billion of low-fee index assets to another investment manager. This transition is likely to occur during the second quarter of 2021 and will have a de minimis impact on our organic base fee growth for the year.
Across our retail and institutional client businesses, we generated a record $21 billion of active equity net inflows, representing our eighth consecutive quarter of positive flows in this category. Flows were led by top-performing franchises in technology and mid-cap growth, which benefited from the previously mentioned launch of the BlackRock Innovation and Growth closed-end fund.  
We remain well positioned for future growth in our active businesses, with over 80% of fundamental active equity, scientific active equity and taxable fixed income assets performing above their respective benchmarks or peer medians for the trailing 5-year period. 
Demand for alternatives also continued, with nearly $9 billion of net inflows into liquid and illiquid alternative strategies during the quarter driven by infrastructure, private equity solutions and liquid alternatives funds. Fundraising momentum remains strong, and we have approximately $27 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees.  
Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform continued to grow and outperform peers, generating almost $40 billion of net inflows in the first quarter and topping $700 billion in assets under management for the first time. 
During the first quarter, we incurred approximately $78 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers and expect such discretionary fee waivers to persist for the near term, especially in light of the recent growth in our U.S. government fund franchise and the supply-demand dynamics in the short-dated U.S. treasury and repo markets. Future levels of discretionary fee waivers will be impacted by several factors, including the level of AUM and funds with existing waivers, gross yields and competitive positioning.  
Our strong performance over the last 12 months is testament to our purpose, the strong execution of our strategy, the confidence our clients place in us and the hard work, commitment and resilience of our employees. Our relationships with clients have never been deeper, and we will continue to invest responsibly from a position of strength to meet the needs of all of our stakeholders over the coming years.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

I hope you and your loved ones are continuing to stay healthy and safe.  
We are reporting earnings today from our headquarters in New York City, and I'm incredibly energized by being all together as a group, as a team, as partners. I'm cautiously optimistic for a return to normalcy in the coming months as vaccinations roll out, and I'm looking forward to seeing all of our stakeholders in person again.  
The strong results BlackRock saw this quarter are the outcome of a multiyear investments we've made in our asset management and technology platform to better serve our clients worldwide. More than ever before, we are seeing the benefits of these long-term investments resonating. We have stronger results and deeper relationships with clients across their entire portfolios. 
We generated $527 billion of net inflows and a record 14% organic base fee growth over the last 12 months, including a very strong 2021.  
Over a decade ago, we acquired iShares based on our conviction in the value proposition of ETFs. Our continuous investments in our platform since then to help more clients use ETFs to build better portfolios have fueled iShares growth of $385 billion during the acquisition to more than $2.8 trillion today.  
We began expanding our alternative platform more than 5 years ago. And today, we manage nearly $200 billion in these strategies for all our clients. Our leadership in alternatives has only just begun, and we're seeing momentum accelerate as we scale our offerings, as we source our capabilities and our integration of data and technology into the management of private market assets.  
We've been investing in all aspects of our Aladdin technology to better serve our clients' needs. We saw demand for a unified whole portfolio technology, and we enhanced Aladdin with eFront to offer portfolio construction and risk analytics capability in one view across all public and all private markets.  
We created an end-to-end platform that enables straight-through processing between the asset owners, the asset managers, the custodians through Aladdin provider. We created Aladdin Wealth to help financial advisers build better portfolios for millions of clients around the world.  
We recognize the growing impact of sustainability risks and the opportunities on our clients' portfolios, and as I will discuss in more detail later on, we are investing to systematically integrate climate and broader sustainable factors across all our investment offerings and risk management processes.  
We manage over $200 billion in long-term sustainable assets today. And more recently, as wealth clients increasingly focus on the importance of after-tax returns in their investment, we acquired Aperio to enhance BlackRock's ability to meet these clients' needs.  
The investments we made and continue to make in our platform enables BlackRock to have a holistic perspective and a voice that resonates with our stakeholders. More clients than ever before are turning to BlackRock for insights and for guidance. They want to hear from us on topics such as how to position their portfolio for rising interest rates and inflation, how should they think about the U.S. deficits, how to think about the potential opportunities from new infrastructure policies and how to invest for a net zero world.  
We're vocal on issues that are important to our stakeholders, like cultural issues that impact our employees, that policies that impact our communities. We speak loudly and work for all our stakeholders.  
The benefits of BlackRock's differentiating approach are clear in the strength and consistency of our results. As Gary told you, our total net inflows of $172 billion in the first quarter were diversified across all client types, asset classes, investment styles and regions, and represented an 8% annualized organic asset growth and a record 14% annualized organic base fee growth.  
As the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues and restrictions are eased, a significant acceleration of economic activity is anticipated, despite the consistently high numbers of cases around the world and now the introduction of many new variants. Investors are navigating their portfolio through uncertainty, such as the strength of the reopening, structural changes to the economies and fiscal policy and consequences for growth and inflation when activity is more fully restored.  
Interest rates coming off historically lower levels have put pressure on fixed income assets and led to a rotation within equity from growth to value. Unlike the taper tantrum of 2013, however, the recent rise in rates have been gradual as investors look for greater compensation for holding longer-duration bonds, and investor appetite for risk assets remain very strong.  
There's a lot of money in motion today. The level of fiscal support we have seen over the past year is 4x that of a global financial crisis, but many investors continue to keep significant amounts of cash to utilize. To reach their investment goals, we will need to deploy that money in solutions that provide yield and preservation of their assets.  
BlackRock has deliberately built our industry-leading fixed income business to meet clients' needs, regardless of the rate environment. Changing rates that manifest and rotating within fixed income and BlackRock's diversified platform and strong active performance, with 84% of our taxable fixed income assets above benchmark or peer median for a 3-year period, was well positioned for the demand. We saw $17 billion of net inflows in active fixed income driven by unconstrained, total return, municipals, international and high-yield bond funds.  
Client demand for active strategies continued to accelerate at BlackRock. BlackRock generated $59 billion of active net inflows across asset classes in the first quarter, including another record quarter for active equities. Strong active flows included the nearly $5 billion launch of the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Trust, the second largest ever closed-end fund launch in the United States. 
By innovating in product structure, generating strong investment performance and offering strategies aligned with the needs of our clients, we are leading the turnaround of the closed-end fund IPO market.  
BlackRock's strong active performance in flows are a direct result of these investments that I spoke about to build a platform with collaborative intelligence, advanced data and technologies in a whole portfolio approach. We have never ever been more better positioned to deliver durable alpha for our clients, and I am confident we will continue to capture more demand for active strategies as we further strengthen our platform and invest in our platform.
In illiquid alternatives, we are seeing the magnitude of client flows increase every year. In the first quarter, we generated a record $11 billion of inflows and commitments, results spanning from private credit to infrastructure to private equity solutions, including the final close of our inaugural $3 billion private equity secondary fund.  
Infrastructure investments will be a key component of long-term returns in client portfolios, as governments launch long overdue infrastructure products and projects to restart their economies and build for a more resilient future. The $2 trillion infrastructure plan in the United States will create significant opportunities for putting capital to work in this asset class.  
Within infrastructure, renewables represent more than 50% of the transactions globally, and BlackRock is well positioned with one of the industry's largest renewable power franchises. We recently closed the third vintage of our global renewable power fund, raising nearly $5 billion, which is more than the first and second vintage combined.   
IShares and BlackRock ETFs generated $68 billion of net inflows in the first quarter, the strongest start to a year in our history. Importantly, flows reflect the diversity of our ETF platform and the benefits of strategic investments we made over time to support the adaptation of ETFs, the evolution of new uses, the reduction in barriers like commissions and growth in areas such as model portfolios.  
The work we are doing to expand our sustainable iShares business is a great example of how we continue to innovate ahead of our clients' needs. We generated $17 billion of net inflows in the quarter across the sustainable iShares spectrum from screens to thematic strategies. We recently crossed $100 billion of AUM in this category, up from $26 billion just a year ago. 
The global transition to a net zero economy will impact every company's growth prospects, and BlackRock believes these -- believes that they are adapting and pivoting their strategies and business models ahead of this tectonic shift that will outperform over the long term. Every investor will need to position their portfolios accordingly, and BlackRock is investing to provide clients with more choice as we become a leader in sustainable and climate-aware investing.  
We launched 2 low-carbon transition readiness ETFs last week, raising a total of nearly $2 billion, representing the largest ETF launch in U.S. history. Traditionally, climate products have been backward-looking, really focused on reported greenhouse gas emissions. Using advanced data and analytics and research driven by insights, BlackRock developed a forward-looking active climate investment strategy in a transparent active ETF vehicle. 
These active ETFs are the first of their kind and a great example of how BlackRock is innovating to expand access to sustainable strategies for more investors worldwide.  
In total, BlackRock manages $353 billion in sustainable investments, including cash, and we believe this category will grow to more than $1 trillion by 2030. Sustainable investing presents opportunities for BlackRock, not only in terms of AUM growth, but in the demand for industry-leading technology and data. As sustainability becomes a critical building block in portfolios, investors need a clear understanding of how sustainable-related risk and opportunities impact their portfolio.  
One of the newest opportunities for BlackRock is powering portfolios to a new sustainable standard with Aladdin because climate risk is investment risk. Our ambition to make Aladdin climb as the standard for assessing this risk with investors' portfolio and helping clients navigate and capture investment opportunity presented by the transition to a net zero economy.  
Investments we have made in Aladdin over the years is to serve more clients with better risk analytics, end-to-end operating systems, and the benefit of scale drove a 12% year-over-year growth in technology services revenues. 
We consistently hear from clients that poor quality or availability of ESG data and analytics is the biggest barrier to deeper and broader implementation of sustainable investing. That is why we're evolving Aladdin's sustainability to help clients better assess their exposures and their positions across all our portfolios.  
Our minority investment in Clarity AI will integrate analytics and data covering 30,000 companies and nearly 200 companies within Aladdin. And our partnership with RepRisk will give clients the ability to identify ESG risk exposures in private investments and create a holistic view of risk across their portfolios.  
Advancing towards a net zero economy by 2050 will require more than better data and analytics. It will require transformational innovation in carbon reduction and elimination -- eliminating technologies. BlackRock has partnered with Temasek to establish decarbonization partners to invest in innovative decarbonization solutions to help accelerate global efforts. This initiative will provide clients with an opportunity to participate in a net zero transition by complementing BlackRock's existing renewable power and energy infrastructure investment platform.  
In line with our strategic focus on technology and sustainability, we nominated Hans Vestberg, Chairman and CEO of Verizon, to our Board of Directors for his deep experience in international markets, technology and sustainability. 
At the same time, I want to thank Mathis Cabiallavetta for his passion and his dedication to BlackRock and its shareholders over the last 13 years. He will not stand for reelection at BlackRock's Annual Meeting next month, and he will be missed by our entire Board and by me and the entire leadership team at BlackRock.  
Our results and the speed of our forward momentum underscores the importance of BlackRock's fiduciary approach and culture. I truly believe our culture is what sets BlackRock apart. It drives our performance. It pushes us to innovate. It pushes us to stay ahead of our clients' needs. And it guides our decisions, and it guides our behaviors.  
Critical to our culture is building an environment of inclusivity, belonging, trust and creating a safe environment. More than ever before, BlackRock's leadership team and I are focused on instilling this culture with all of our 16,700 employees around the world and evolving it to ensure that every employee, I want to underscore every employee, feels the sense of belonging.  
The strength of our first quarter results across iShares, private markets, technology and active and sustainable strategies is more broad based today than any point in our history, but our global scale and our unique client interactions give us greater ability to invest in our clients' future and, ultimately, for the benefit of our shareholders.  
I see tremendous opportunities ahead for BlackRock's focus remaining on embracing change, investing for the long term so we could best serve all our stakeholders, and I look forward to executing on our ambitious plans in the years ahead.

I heard $353 billion in sustainable AUM and I also heard -- I thought I heard you say $200 billion. I just wanted to make sure just what those 2 numbers were. And then in the 1Q close, you had $17 billion of iShares, but what additional flows would be coming into other sustainable products? 
And then the broader question would be on the Temasek partnership, more broadly for carbon transition, obviously, a huge evolving field. Have you thought about what the asset management TAM might be in that field and how you might tackle that through not only this partnership, but obviously through the ETFs you launch and other products as well?"

The difference is we have a broad-based cash management space that is becoming more and more sustainable. So if you add the cash side or the short-term cash, it comes up to that $300 billion number. I hope I answered that question properly now.  
Two, I think the opportunity in transition is amazing. It is estimated we need to spend $50 trillion to have a decarbonized world, and to do that is investing in new technologies. And we are very pleased to having a partner in Temasek. And we have had many conversations with them related to how can we bring the world closer to a decarbonized world without a premium -- or without a green premium. And this is specifically so relevant, not just in the United States, but it's so relevant in the emerging world.  
The emerging world is still growing and still has a greater need for electricity, greater need for building. The emerging world is just at the beginning of their economic growth. And so if we are going to get to a net zero world, the need for innovation and investing for green hydrogen to bring that premium down to 0, for biofuels, for sequestering carbon at a very inexpensive price, all of these are going to require new technologies.  
For agriculture, agriculture produces over -- close to 15% of the carbon footprint when you -- related to that. And so we have many areas where it is going to require new technologies, and I truly believe we are going to have many young people, instead of going into data and technology related to the social side of technology, I believe many, many innovations are going to come from young, startup, innovative companies.  
But I would also say I am very bullish on our traditional hydrocarbon and chemical companies as they pivot, and I've had conversations recently with the CEO of a very large oil and gas company. Just yesterday, I had a conversation with a CEO of a very large chemical company. And we're actually talking to them about how can BlackRock invest with them side by side on technologies for decarbonization.  
I mean, the science and technology that our existing companies have in terms of the understanding of carbon and understand the science of transforming it to a more decarbonized world is great. And so we are very encouraged about investing in startups, that's what our Temasek-BlackRock decarbonization funded, but we actually are having many conversations about investing with our infrastructure teams, with our private teams, with our debt teams to finance this. We had numerous conversations with companies related to biofuels. 
And so when we -- our employees are flying around the world that we could have a footprint that is net 0. And so all of these are great opportunities for us and the investors worldwide."

There's not one consistent conversation going on institutionally. Obviously, the question of inflation, the question of the deficits matter are prominent conversations with our fixed income investors now. 
Some fixed income investors are looking to derisk, but derisking by going into low duration or unconstrained strategies. Some of them are looking to say, ""I need more credit or I need more coupon to take on that duration risk."" And so there's -- we still see demand in high yield evident by our flows. So I don't think there's one specific trend. 
But I would say -- but the narrative around the question of inflation deficits are becoming a very prominent part of our conversation. So obviously, many questions related to equity valuations, the rotation from growth to value is that overdone at this moment, especially if the vaccinations are going to take longer and other questions on that. And so those are probably the dominant conversation. 
But if anything, Dan, as we've said in some of the prepared remarks, there's incredible pools of cash on the sidelines. I would say, overall, our clients are still sitting with big pools of money. Overall, they're still underinvested. 
Now I would say, as the 10-year treasury rises in rates, their liabilities become less burdensome. And so -- and if there is any continuing rising of the 10-year rate, the need for extending duration is no longer as necessary. 
And so -- but the dialogues are very robust now. Many, many clients are putting and allocating more and more to privates and alternatives. Many clients now are using ETFs for active exposures. That's accelerating, not decelerating. 
And so I would say, there's nothing that's prominent in any one conversation except one thing, that conversation around sustainability. There is not a conversation today with an institutional client on how should they think about climate risk, how should they think about transition risk. And as I've just said in the prior question, what we are trying to have our clients focus on not the fear of transition, not the enormous need for transition, but the opportunities that transition will entail to get it right, the investment technologies to make sure that we don't have this green premium or the net zero world will not happen, especially in the emerging world. 
And so this is the beauty, I would say, of capitalism. This is the beauty of capital markets, that more and more clients are looking to be more prepared for this long-term trend. And many, many clients are asking the question, what role should their portfolio play in this long-term trend."

So we are -- we -- I think as we indicated previously, we're definitely accelerating our pace of investment spend into '21. I think it's a combination of a couple of things. 
I mean, I think the first thing is that I think it's really critical to note and look back at our results not only for this quarter, but the momentum for the last year, how that effectively reflects the fact that we have consistently spent in our business to stay ahead of clients' needs and across the franchise. 
I mean, without that consistent level of investment to try and stay ahead of those needs, we don't generate $525 billion of flows and 14% organic base fee growth with 4 quarters over $100 billion. 
We believe, and you've heard Larry reaffirm it, that our business has never been better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities, whether it's sustainable. Larry has been talking about a lot this morning private markets, technology, China, and we are going to pursue those opportunities responsibly. 
That being said, we obviously remain margin aware all the time. We're focusing on managing that entire discretionary expense base as always, and we're committed to optimizing growth in the most efficient way possible. But our accelerated spend this year is really a function of what I just said, which is all the opportunities that we see before us and the reality that we just didn't spend what we thought we were going to spend in 2020. 
We made a strong commitment to our employees not to reduce our headcount, and I think that was a good thing because we saw the work units and the volumes increased throughout the year. We didn't really turn the hiring spigot back on until the second half and, frankly, late in the second half of last year. And so a lot of what we're doing this year is catching up to our business. We went into a year with a very specific budget in terms of our discretionary spend, whether that was in hiring or spending on G&A., and we have made no changes to that since we last chatted. 
Obviously, I think between beta and our organic growth, we're ahead of where we thought in terms of the business, but our intent is to continue to spend throughout the year as to the original budget. We definitely got off to a little bit of a slower start in terms of tech, M&P spend. We're obviously anticipating some pickup in T&E towards the end of the year. And it's full speed ahead in terms of our plans for the year."

We talked about the fact that we did have 12% year-over-year growth in revenue. And I think, as always, the large preponderance of our technology services revenue today remains what we would call kind of the institutional Aladdin component. Obviously, we have other parts of that in terms of a variety of different, whether it's Aladdin Wealth or accounting or a bunch of other things, but the majority of that wealth -- the majority of that growth is still year-over-year tied to the institutional business. 
Some of the component adds that we're basically anticipating growth in over time are still at the early stages, and so there's no question that as we begin to grow out things like Aladdin Climate, which is really just getting started, we think that's going to be having a much more significant impact on our year-over-year growth. 
There's no question that we believe that the demand for integrated and resilient investment management technology is increasing. The pandemic has increased awareness on the importance of technology. We're seeing industry consolidation, shifting product usage and regulatory requirements creating the need for more holistic and flexible solutions. And our pipeline for the remainder of the year is strong. 
So again, continuing to feel very good about that business. As I mentioned, the ACV of 16% is probably a little ahead of where we normally anticipate that just by virtue of the comparison to a year ago, but we are -- we feel really, really good about our positioning in that business, especially given our whole portfolio view across public and private markets."

And then with the need of more information at the financial advisers' fingertip, so they could provide deeper, broader risk analytics to their clients, that's Aladdin Wealth. 
We have built Aladdin around the needs of our clients to offer a better experience, better outcomes. And then I can't think of a better and more important time when we felt Aladdin was necessary when we were all working remotely and still working remotely and having an operating system that is connected worldwide. 
And the -- our clients worldwide have actually become more enthusiastic about how Aladdin shapes and helps their business. We believe Aladdin actually improved their performance, and there's research by third parties that suggest those who have Aladdin have better financial performance. 
Then when you think about climate risk and transition risk that is going to encompass from cash to the most long-dated privates across the entire portfolio, across all products, across all regions, the need for Aladdin Climate and having data and analytics to justify the investments, we have to live under the Department of Labor rule of remaining to be a fiduciary, and so we have to justify as a fiduciary that climate risk is investment risk. 
And so more than ever before, I believe Aladdin is as well positioned because of how we navigated it to making it end to end through the custodian to the wealth manager, now publics and privates and then, importantly, now with sustainability really speaks about the resiliency of the operating system and why we continue to have deeper, broader conversations with more clients."

We will be following very closely the infrastructure bill and figure out how we can raise assets that we can deliver to our clients for infrastructure, which, for many of our clients who would like long-duration type assets, infrastructure fits very well. So we'll probably go in that direction a bit more. 
And then simply seeing how the private equity market evolves and where our clients can earn alpha drove our secondary and liquidations fund, as some of the older vintages come due from some of the stable private equity companies that are looking to start new funds, but liquidate what is left in the older funds. So what we're trying to do is really have a very careful eye on where we think the next value chain is and can that be described both in a liquid form and an alternatives fund.

We don't believe it is a substitute for currency, but I do believe we're going to have digitization of currencies. 
So it is just -- it's a conversation. We are investigating and how we can create -- how we could create different products if there's client demand related to crypto. But let me just frame it. 
And I think one of the reason for our success with our clients over the last 33 years has been our consistency of focusing on long-term investing. It is not about the markets and the behaviors of the markets and the ins and outs of the market. 
Much of the dialogue today related to whether it's a GameStop or which goes out with Reddit. It is about the tick tock and the day trading. And then the activities around Bitcoin and other crypto, we're fascinated about it. We're excited about it as more people are enjoying looking at it. But most of it is about trading and ins and outs of the marketplace.  
And so in our dialogue with our clients worldwide, it is not a major question that is being asked. It is not a major conversation related to how does that fit into their portfolio. With some, it does, does it fit into their portfolio as a long-term investor.
And I would just say, overall, the actions around products that are around trading and the navigation of markets and new asset classes, it is not -- it's just not about the whole foundation of our platform about long-term investing. And so if somebody really wanted to build a big, deep dialogue related to this, they're probably going to go to another source, and that is just not a large foundation of the conversation we're having now. 
I mean, the conversations we're having with -- on sustainability is greater today than it was the last time we spoke to you. The conversation we're having about transition opportunities is so much greater than it was a quarter ago. And I believe the momentum there. I believe the opportunity there is so much larger than how is a crypto asset a long-term asset. 
And so I don't want to diminish anything related to crypto and digital ideas. I'm fascinated about it. I think it is going to be an asset class. We'll see how it performs over the long term, and it may be a great asset class, but let's wait and see."

It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2021. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release",1768,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2021. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
Last month at our 2021 Investor Day, we highlighted how the investments we have consistently made to support growth have enabled us to execute on our framework for shareholder value. We have invested and evolved over time to create a globally integrated investment and technology platform that enables clients to construct resilient whole portfolios that meet their objectives regardless of market environment or risk appetite. 
And we continue to invest in our industry-leading high-growth franchises such as ETFs, private markets and technology and are accelerating investments to drive growth in our ESG, traditional active and solutions capabilities. The combination of our comprehensive and integrated investment platform with global and local distribution capabilities once again delivered strong results for the quarter. And we remain very well positioned to continue delivering differentiated organic growth in the future. 
BlackRock generated total net inflows of $81 billion in the second quarter, representing 4% annualized organic asset growth. As previously disclosed, second quarter net inflows included the full impact of a $58 billion low fee institutional index redemption from a large U.S. public pension client. Strong net inflows from ETFs and our entire active franchise once again contributed to this quarter's robust 10% annualized organic base fee growth. 
Over the last 12 months, our broad-based platform, pairing diverse investment capabilities with best-in-class technology and rigorous risk management, has generated over $500 billion of total net inflows, representing 13% organic base fee growth, well in excess of our 5% long-term target. Second quarter revenue of $4.8 billion increased 32% year-over-year, and operating income of $1.9 billion rose 37%. 
Earnings per share of $10.03 was up 28%, also reflecting lower nonoperating income and a higher effective tax rate compared to a year ago. Strong year-over-year comparisons benefited in part from significant improvements in equity market conditions versus a year ago. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter included $145 million of net investment income primarily driven by mark-to-market gains in our private equity co-investment and unhedged seed capital portfolios. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24%. We now estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2021 primarily reflected an increase in certain state tax rates, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation during the year. 
Second quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.8 billion was up 27% year-over-year primarily driven by the positive impact of market beta on average AUM and strong organic base fee growth, partially offset by higher discretionary money market fee waivers, lower securities lending revenue and strategic pricing investments over the last year. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 5%. However, our effective fee rate was down 0.3 basis points as strong organic base fee growth driven by our higher fee active businesses and the impact of 1 additional day in the current quarter were more than offset by higher discretionary money market fee waivers and the impact of divergent equity beta in the quarter. 
During the second quarter, we incurred approximately $165 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers driven in part by continued strong flows into our U.S. government money market funds. While the Fed's recent technical adjustments to the IOER and RRP have modestly helped, we still expect discretionary fee waivers to persist at or around current levels for the near term. However, future levels of discretionary fee waivers may also be impacted by several additional factors, including the level of AUM and funds with existing waivers, gross yields and competitive positioning. 
Performance fees of $340 million were up significantly from a year ago, reflecting strong performance across our entire investment platform, including liquid and illiquid alternatives and long-only strategies. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 14% from a year ago, while annual contract value or ACV increased 16% year-over-year and continued to reflect strong growth from the second quarter of 2020, which was impacted by slower sales and extended contracting in the early days of the pandemic. We remain committed to low to mid-teens growth in ACV over the long term. 
Total expense increased 29% versus the year-ago quarter driven primarily by higher compensation, direct fund and G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 34%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income and performance fees and higher deferred compensation, reflecting the impact of additional grants associated with prior year compensation and certain compensation arrangements related to a previous acquisition. Direct fund expense increased 30% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average index AUM. 
G&A expense was up $73 million or 19% year-over-year primarily driven by higher technology, portfolio services and marketing spend. Sequentially, G&A expense was down $124 million, reflecting the impact of approximately $180 million of product launch costs incurred in the first quarter, partially offset by higher technology and marketing spend. Intangible amortization expense increased $10 million year-over-year as a result of our Aperio acquisition. 
Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.9% was up 120 basis points from a year ago, benefiting in part from significant equity market improvements over the last year. BlackRock has never been positioned -- has never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us. And we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. 
Our capital management strategy remains first to invest in our business, including through prudent use of our balance sheet and then to return excess cash to shareholders. We see incredible opportunity to make Aladdin the language of all portfolios and are investing to evolve Aladdin for its next leg of growth. 
As Larry will discuss in more detail, during the second quarter, we announced a partnership with Baringa, including the acquisition of their industry-leading climate chain scenario model, which will enhance Aladdin's climate capabilities and set a new standard for climate analytics. 
In addition, yesterday, we announced a minority investment in SpiderRock Advisors, a tech-enabled asset manager focused on providing professionally managed option overlay strategies. This investment adds incremental product capabilities to our recent acquisition of Aperio and extends our market-leading personalized SMA franchise. 
We also repurchased an additional $300 million worth of shares in the second quarter and stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. As we discussed at Investor Day, our strong and resilient platform has never been better positioned to deliver for clients as we leverage our scale, unique insights and solutions orientation to meet their long-term investment needs. 
Quarterly net inflows of $81 billion reflected continued momentum across our entire investment business, especially in our ETF and active platforms. Our ETFs generated net inflows of $75 billion in the second quarter, representing 11% annualized organic asset and base fee growth. We also crossed $3 trillion in assets globally for the first time. 
Core equity and higher fee precision ETFs continue to generate strong inflows, particularly in international equities. However, most of our growth this quarter came from the strategic category, led by continued strength in our sustainable ETFs and renewed strength in fixed income as well as steady positive flows into factor and thematic ETFs. 
Retail net inflows of $21 billion, representing 9% annualized organic asset growth and 10% annualized organic base fee growth, were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and across all major asset classes. Inflows continue to reflect broad-based strength across the entirety of our active platform, and we remain well positioned to capture demand for both active equities and investor appetite for yield where our diversified fixed income range, including unconstrained, high yield, international and broad market strategies, is equipped to meet client demand in any rate environment. 
BlackRock's institutional active net inflows of $43 billion were led by $35 billion of multi-asset net inflows largely driven by a significant outsourced CIO mandate from a U.K. pension client. As Larry will also discuss, BlackRock is uniquely positioned to deliver customized whole portfolio solutions by capitalizing on our global scale, expertise in investment, technology and risk management and focus on sustainability. 
During the second quarter, we also saw continued demand for active fixed income and the liquid alternatives and LifePath target date offerings. Institutional index net outflows of $80 billion were impacted by the previously mentioned single client redemption during the quarter. Outflows from index equities were partially offset by inflows into fixed income as clients rebalance portfolios after significant equity market gains were sought to immunize portfolios through LDI strategies. 
Despite overall asset net outflows across BlackRock's institutional franchise for the quarter, annualized organic base fee growth was 6% as net inflows into higher fee active and alternative strategies more than offset the de minimis base fee impact of low fee index equity outflows. Overall, BlackRock generated approximately $63 billion in quarterly active net flows across the platform, matching our ninth consecutive quarter of positive active equity flows. 
Demand for alternatives also continued with nearly $7 billion of net inflows into liquid and illiquid alternative strategies during the quarter driven by single strategy hedge funds, fund of hedge fund solutions, real assets, private credit and private equity solutions. Fundraising momentum remains strong, and we have approximately $31 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance views. 
Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform continued to grow, generating $23 billion of net inflows in the second quarter driven by both prime and U.S. government money market funds. Despite facing near 0 returns in both the U.S. and Europe, client demand for cash strategies remained strong, given significant liquidity in the financial system. And by helping clients manage their cash, we are building broader and deeper strategic relationships. 
Our continued strong performance is a direct result of a thoughtful growth strategy that has been well-executed by a talented group of purpose-driven employees who live the One BlackRock culture each day. We are thankful for their tremendous effort and contributions to our success for these last 18 months. We will continue to embrace change and invest responsibly for the future so that we can meet the needs of all of our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

We are once again reporting earnings today from our headquarters in New York City. And I'm happy to see more and more of our colleagues in the office in recent weeks, and I remain cautiously optimistic for a gradual return to having people back in the office and a little normalcy. 
After more than a year of virtual meetings, I spent the last few weeks meeting with clients in person again. I also spoke at the G20 in Venice on Sunday about sustainability and climate change, and it was great to be back on the road. 
Our business is built on listening to the people we serve and understanding their needs. And there is no substitute for meeting face-to-face with people to hear directly from them about their investment challenges, their opportunities and what lie ahead for them. 
It is through these conversations that we're able to build a deeper relationship with our clients across their whole portfolio and to ensure BlackRock is always evolving and staying current and stay in front of their needs. This long-standing client-centric approach is powering consistently strong results for the benefit of all our stakeholders. 
Total net inflows of $81 billion in the second quarter, representing a 10% organic base fee growth, were driven by continued momentum in strategic growth areas. We saw client demand in our ETFs and illiquid alternatives, our active and sustainable strategies as well as our scale cash management solutions. And we developed 14% year-over-year growth in technology services revenues as clients increasingly turn to Aladdin. 
We have now delivered organic base fee growth in excess of our 5% target for 5 consecutive quarters, including 13% over the last 12 months from over $500 billion of net inflows. This is driving strong financial performance, and I'm very confident that we have significant room to grow as we are partnering with more clients on larger and more comprehensive mandates than ever before in our history. 
The global economic restart continues to broaden in the second quarter as vaccinations were rolled out, and some countries are gradually reopening. With significant amounts of cash still in the sidelines, markets are anticipating continued growth near term. Despite the potential for various restrictions in certain regions, certain countries due to the variant, we have seen equity markets rally year-to-date with most indexes up over 10% from the first half of the year and hitting record highs. 
We look ahead to the remainder of the year and beyond. Inflation concern's top of mind for investors. We need to assess the potential impact on their portfolios. Debate remains as to whether this inflation will be transitorial or structural, and central banks will need to balance their monetary policy decisions alongside expansive fiscal policy by so many governments. 
In this environment, clients are looking for scaled partners who have a deeper understanding of the global picture and a platform that can construct portfolios tailored for their needs and for their future goals. They are turning to BlackRock to help them navigate uncertainty. They're turning to BlackRock to invest more opportunistically, and they're turning BlackRock to help them plan for their future. And our deliberate investment over many years to build a resilient and scaled asset management and technology platform is helping them in their needs, and we are delivering for them. 
Building on what we laid out at our Investor Day last month, we remain focused on consistently improving and investing ahead of our clients' needs in the biggest growth areas of the future. In ETFs, the benefit of our investments over time are showing up through accelerated momentum across the franchise. In June, client assets in our ETFs passed $3 trillion globally driven by second quarter net inflows of $75 billion. 
It took 15 years for iShares to get to $1 trillion in assets. It took iShares only 5 years to get to $2 trillion in assets, and it just most recently took iShares only 2 years to get to $3 trillion. 
Importantly, the more majority of this growth at each milestone has been organic as more investors are using ETFs in more ways. They are using to build whole portfolios. They are using iShares to invest beyond traditional market cap-weighted indexes. And they're using iShares more than ever before to access the bond market efficiently. 
Our ETFs grew across each of our core, our strategic and precision product categories, with more than half of our net inflows coming from our strategic categories led by fixed income and sustainable ETFs. We saw more than $22 billion of net inflows into our fixed income ETFs as investors sought more efficient ways to access fixed income and turn to us for a more broad rate exposure, including Chinese bonds, multi-sector, municipal bonds, inflation-linked ETFs. And we now manage more than $700 billion in fixed income ETFs and continue to believe that this category will grow to $1 trillion by 2024 as fixed income ETFs modernize the $100 trillion bond market. 
Momentum in sustainable ETFs remained strong with another $14 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, including the launches of our low carbon transition readiness ETF. We have seen [ $30 billion ] of net inflows into sustainable ETFs in the first half of 2021 compared to $46 billion in all of 2020. 
With nearly $120 billion of sustainable ETFs, BlackRock has 4x the size of the next sustainable ETF player. And we are incredibly well positioned for the future for our clients' needs in this fast-growing category. Demand for sustainable strategies is accelerating from investors worldwide in both index and active. 
Within active sustainable strategies, we saw $4 billion of net inflows in the second quarter. Sustainable investments offer significant opportunities to generate alpha for clients, and we are focused on innovating ahead of their needs. 
For example, we announced last week the first close for the climate finance partnership. We'll invest in climate infrastructure across emerging markets. This strategy is a great example of how public and private sectors can come together to deliver positive environmental and social impact for communities and attractive risk-adjusted returns for clients, including global institutional investors, for governments and for philanthropies. 
BlackRock's broader active platform is playing an increasingly important role in our clients' portfolios. And we are seeing the benefits of our investment in our growth and our investment performance. 
We generated $63 billion of active net inflows in the second quarter across equities, fixed income, multi assets and alternative strategies. This growth is outpacing that of the $70 trillion active management industry as we continue to captive active market share. 
Long-term investment performance is strong with over 85% of our fundamental active equities, systematic active equities, taxable fixed income assets outperforming the benchmark or peer medium over the past 5 years. By delivering durable alpha for clients, we remain well positioned to continue to generate growth in active strategies. More clients are looking to outsource their entire portfolio as regulations intensify, operating cost-wise and investing grows more complex. 
They want customized solutions spanning active index, alternatives, powered by sophisticated technology and risk management. The breadth of BlackRock's investment platform, our portfolio construction expertise and our Aladdin technology uniquely positions us to meet these clients' needs. 
We are honored to be entrusted to manage the over $30 billion of pension assets for British Airways in the second quarter through the creation of a bespoke investment and service model. This partnership represents the largest of this kind in the U.K. pension fund, and we believe it will be a catalyst for a more transformational change in the industry. 
We manage over $200 billion in OCIO assets today and believe the trend towards outsourcing will only continue to accelerate. We are also seeing demand for personalization growing more among the financial advisers and our wealth clients. 
And we're continuing to invest behind the democratization of tax-efficient personalized portfolios at scale. BlackRock is partnering with financial intermediaries and providing model portfolios, which utilize our broad range of iShares ETFs and actively managed funds as well as separately managed account strategies across alpha, factor investing and index investing. 
Building on our acquisition of Aperio, we recently announced a minority investment in SpiderRock Advisors, which will further enhance our ability to provide wealth managers and financial advisers with tax-efficient personalized portfolios through risk management solutions. This is another major step we are taking to advance our market-leading franchise in personalizing and personalization of SMAs. 
Alongside ETFs, SMAs continue to see high-growth rates as advisers and personalization and tax management to wealth client portfolios. BlackRock is the second-largest SMA provider today with over $200 billion in assets, including Aperio. And we remain focused on investing in a comprehensive platform of solutions and customization capabilities for the wealth management market. 
BlackRock's commitment to evolve and to meet our clients' needs is reasonably most evident in sustainability. As we adapt to the fundamental restructuring that the energy transition is driving across the economy, we are investing across products, data, technology capabilities so we can help clients address their impact of sustainable factors on their portfolios and help them capture significant client demand for sustainable solutions. 
Last year, we began developing Aladdin Climate to fill a need in climate risk analytics and to help investors better understand and act on climate risk. Aladdin Climate measures at both the asset and portfolio levels the impact of physical risk like extreme weather event and transition risks such as policy changes, new technologies and energy supply. 
In June, we will further -- in June, we further advanced Aladdin Climate through a new partnership with Baringa. The combination of Baringa's climate transition risk models and Aladdin's financial and physical risk models will provide investors with the ability to better understand and customize their risk -- their climate risk exposures. This partnership is a significant milestone in the build-out of Aladdin Climate and will set a new bar in the industry for climate analytics and risk management tools. 
We are also committed to bringing the benefit to our global platform to clients around the world by deepening our local infrastructure. We are investing in people who speak every language to understand local markets and regulations and have insight into how the changing world intersects with each of our clients' goals. This includes investing in the leading -- this is -- excuse me. This includes investing in -- to be the leading global asset manager in China. 
Rapid economic development and wealth accumulation in the world's second-largest economy has propelled the growth of the $9 trillion Chinese domestic asset management industry. Earlier this year, we obtained our wealth management joint venture license. And last month, we received our fund management company license. We are the first global asset manager firm to obtain this type of license. 
We are now well positioned to extend the breadth of our investment solutions and insights to all our client segments across China and help more people transition their savings to investments in China, including in preparation for their retirement. With more than half of BlackRock's assets linked to retirement, we are incredibly focused on innovating and helping our clients address the retirement crisis around the world. 
Client demand for our LifePath target date funds remained strong with $17 billion of net inflows year-to-date, representing a 10% organic growth and outpacing the entire industry. The need for retirement income and retirement is also accelerating. A recent study BlackRock conducted found that nearly 90% of the participants across every generation wants a retirement income solution. And 96% of plan sponsors feels responsibility for helping their participants generate and manage their income in retirement. 
BlackRock is developing LifePath Paycheck to address this growing need. And we are already seeing strong commercial demand with several initial client commitments and support from an institutional and investment consultants. The incredible momentum we are seeing across our entire platform is a direct result of our dedicated employee base. I have never been prouder of BlackRock's nearly 17,000 employees. 
I have seen their commitment to our clients and to each other in incredible ways throughout this pandemic. And in recognition of this hard work and to have them share in BlackRock's growth and success, we are investing in our employees through an 8% raise in base salary compensation for all employees up to and including director levels as of September 1, 2021. We strive to cultivate an environment at BlackRock where employees feel supported and have a diverse and inclusive environment where they can thrive and grow and build a career and life. 
After a period like no other in the firm's history, BlackRock has never been better positioned for the future. My recent trips to Europe and the Middle East to meet with our clients have only further validated our differentiated positioning and our approach to building deeper, broader relationships with our clients. 
We have always led by listening to our clients and hearing what they want, what they need. And through that -- through anticipation and embracing change and innovating and stay in front of our clients' needs, that has what driven us going forward. Our fiduciary focus has guided the deliberate -- our deliberateness in terms of investments we have made to build a more resilient asset manager and a more resilient technology platform by anticipating and stay in front of our clients' needs. And we will continue to deliver industry-leading growth to benefit all our stakeholders for the long term. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

So these are complementary businesses, and they enhance our value proposition for our whole portfolio SMAs across equity and fixed income in alpha factors and index solutions. 
So with over $200 billion in SMAs, including Aperio, BlackRock is a market-leading whole portfolio sponsor. And with the prospect of higher income and capital gains taxes, we've now built a pipeline of over $6 billion in potential new Aperio mandates just since the transaction closed. 
So this is an example of how we are getting more into the personalization and direct indexing. And of course, ETF and direct index complement the tech that we are investing in and building in."

And we see this revolutionizing the 401(k) DB plans -- corporate plans. 
We are in discussion with many, many corporations, and I think we have a lot of future growth and a lot of future announcements in terms of our positioning there. This is actually quite separate from what we're doing in the customized side related to Aperio, but we believe this is going to change the retirement business. And we are -- we have worked with all the consulting firms. We have buy recommendations on this from across many of the consulting firms. We are in dialogue with many, many of the plans. And we hope in the next few quarters to have some very significant announcements related to the success we are seeing in LifePath Paycheck, which will be changing, as I said. 
And this is BlackRock responding the future needs of our clients. I think when we are able to announce this with the clients, this is going to really identify how retirement is going to be reshaped and why the need for more certainty during retirement -- during the deaccumulation period of time, why that is so important, why there's such urgency around that. 
And we are very proud of the R&D work that we did over the many, many years now. And now in these private conversations, it is really resonating more than ever before with our clients across the United States. And hopefully, this could be something that we could expand beyond the United States. But this is going to be some -- a significant part of our whole foundation. 
And the last thing I would just say related to LifePath target date franchise, we're up to now $370 billion alone without even talking about the LifePath Paycheck. And so this is going to continue to accelerate where we're taking market share."

You know that we have said over and over that we see significant room for continued growth in ETFs, and the penetration of the equity and bond markets is still very low. We expect generational shifts to unlock a lot of new growth,",424,"So good question, Craig. You know that we have said over and over that we see significant room for continued growth in ETFs, and the penetration of the equity and bond markets is still very low. We expect generational shifts to unlock a lot of new growth, especially whole portfolios, where ETFs in fee-based are around 11%; new investment capabilities like ESG; and overall capital markets replacements, where we're seeing ETFs that are about 5% of the total market and 1% of the bond market. 
We expect, to give you a number to throw out, by 2025 that ETFs are going to more than double to $15 trillion. And even at that level, we would still be a small part of the markets in which we compete, which is why we think there are decades of growth ahead. And we fully intend to be the market leader in revenue growth and truly organic client-driven flows and in total assets as this evolves. 
And we recognize that we have to offer choice in the vehicles that we show clients. But ETFs, I believe, are going to lead in that. So there are some key client segments. One is Europe, which is adopting very, very quickly. The wealth area through model portfolios of again, of which we are a leader, is showing huge growth. And certainly in institutional clients, primarily in fixed income is showing growth. And then another segment sustainable, which you heard about, which we are the leader, is also showing growth. 
So what makes our ETF platform unique relative to any competitor is its diversity and broad client base. So for example, our global client base is made up of self-directed investors, wealth managers, pensions, insurers and active managers. We have the most diversified platform with $2.3 trillion in the U.S. and $650 billion in Europe and $2.3 trillion in equity and $700 billion in fixed income. So you can see how this matches up against the client segments I talked about. 
And most importantly, which may be overlooked, we provide the most secondary market liquidity. So U.S. iShares traded almost $9 trillion in 2020 versus $7 trillion in 2019. And AMEA's iShares traded $1.2 trillion in 2020 versus $1 trillion in 2019. So this, along with our precision exposures, which are often unique to us, while it has been a drag in prior years are actually a driver of our strong revenue growth this quarter. So we're excited about the growth, specifically in the segments that we are a leader in today."

And you correctly pointed out that incentive compensation i",508,"Thanks, Alex. It's Gary. So let's break it down maybe individually. So in terms of the comp side, we talked about comping up about 34%, and that primarily reflected higher incentive compensation. And you correctly pointed out that incentive compensation is very much tied to both profitability and performance. And so as we saw higher operating income and performance fees, that definitely ticked up. 
But we also saw higher deferred compensation year-over-year. That was up by about $100 million year-over-year. And I'd say there's really 2 things there. One is more ongoing, which is the ongoing impact of additional grants associated with last year's compensation. Obviously, we defer a significant component of current compensation for retention. And last year saw a rather large level of deferrals, especially as it related to performance fees and the level of performance fees last year. That was -- I'd say that's probably about 60 or so percent of that increase. 
But there was also a onetime, what I would call, a crystallization and acceleration of certain compensatory arrangements tied to the success of one of our historical acquisitions. That was probably about $35 million or about 70 basis points on the comp ratio that ultimately should migrate away now that, that has been settled out. So that's it on comp as I would think about it. 
Obviously, Larry mentioned the base salary increases, which is more a function of going forward. And we talked all about recognizing the accomplishments of our tremendous employees over the last 18 months. I don't expect that to have a very significant impact on our financials this year, but it could be, given its effective date of September 1, let's call it, roughly 20 basis points or thereabouts on both comp and margin impact on a purely isolated basis for the rest of the year. 
In terms of G&A, we have -- I think we gave you some guidance at the beginning of the year. We've made no reductions to the discretionary investment spending plans in terms of G&A spend and hiring that we originally budgeted for the year and that we referenced on our call. 
I think much as others are, I think we're probably hiring a little slower than we had anticipated. And we're working on that to make sure we can get the employee support to support our growth plans. But we would, as I think is somewhat customary for us, we anticipate our overall level of G&A spend to be higher in the second half, especially around such areas like marketing technology. 
And then as Larry mentioned, as people get back to traveling, obviously, we haven't had a lot of T&E in the first part of the year, but the potential for that, I think, exists for next year. And I think -- so broadly speaking, that's it on the comp. There was kind of that onetime issue on the G&A side. Again, our plans are generally exact the same as we laid them out to -- at the beginning of the year."

But I think when you think about -- and when I referenced the British Air OECI mandate, we believe this is going to be -- this is just the beginning of more focus on the virtues and the value proposition of -- for these pension funds. We think how it's organized. Should it be done under our platform like BlackRock? And then do we create the efficiencies and most importantly, are we -- can we have a better fiduciary outcome on behalf of their participants? 
All of this is about the participants. And can we provide a better outcome for the participants? And I really do believe we are thinking of that. But we have had some very large wins with a few other clients in the last few quarters. We are in large dialogue with many more. 
But I want to underscore what the transformation of LifePath Paycheck could be, too. These could be some very large opportunities, too, and having the defined contribution business being reimagined and rethought. And that is how we framed it. 
How can we reimagine and provide better certainty to the participants? How can we provide better outcomes? And how can that lead to a better closeness between the employer and the employees? And how can they build deeper bonds when the employees retire during the deaccumulation period of time? 
These are the broad-based solutions that we've been focusing on, no different than the broad-based solutions. We focus on the needs, we're focusing on climate in portfolios across the board. 
And so I believe what we are -- what you're seeing in the past related to above trend line growth, above 5% of organic growth is because of these deepening relationships across the board. And as I concluded in my speech, I do believe we are going to continue to see this type of elevated opportunity. And it's because we are so relentlessly focused on how to think about our clients and help them become better at what they're doing. 
And I truly believe what the outcome of British Air and the other measure that we talked about. And I would say with the strong performance that we've had in our active platform, flows generally follow. And when you can have -- and no firm can have this, when you could have a dialogue where you are agnostic about the role of index assets like ETFs and active assets and then focusing on whether it's tax-efficient portfolio strategies or focusing on a sustainability overlay, we're now focusing on outcomes related to more certainty during deaccumulation periods of time. This is what's driving the flows, and this is what I think is differentiating BlackRock, that we are spending more time. We're investing, as Gary talked about, our investments in the future. 
These are the type of investments we're making, and we're making sure that we are staying in front of the needs of clients and providing something unique and differentiated. And I do believe that is resonating more and more. Let me just leave it at that."

But as you know, growth is also somewhat tied to markets in particular. And I think some of the growth that we're seeing today clearly is a result of the type of environment that we're in. And so we try not to get too focused on a particular environment but really look across cycles. 
And I think if you look at what we've done over the last 5 years, we've actually averaged about a 5% organic base fee growth over the last 5 years. And while we've actually -- I think really the more important piece of this is not how fast we necessarily grow in a more risk-on environment, although I know Larry doesn't like that term. I think the reality is that when we see the markets fall back, we stay positive. 
And so even in tough markets like '16 and '18, where the industry was roundly negative, we were still in positive territory. And I think I would also remind you that, look, the industry is basically right around 3% in terms of where everyone thinks the industry more broadly is going to grow. So at 5%, we're already growing, if you will, at a 60-plus percent premium to where we think the industry is. And we feel very comfortable with that because of our breadth, because of our solutions orientation and our technology platform. 
I think we feel very good about both secular growth, secular growth more broadly, maintaining share in places like ETF. We feel like we have a ton of room to run in places like illiquid, where the market is growing, and we're generally still low single-digit share. 
We think our investment performance positions us well to continue to play a major role in active. So for the moment, until we get through the cycle and see where we come out the other side, 5% is the target. And we feel very good about our performance going forward relative to that."

So again, we're not going to get very specific on pipelines, but we will give you some tonality on our Aladdin growth rate. So I think as we've talked about, there is clearly increased client demand accelerated by COVID for comprehensive whole portfolio solutions that involve greater systemization, fewer vendor relationships as a number of financial service companies and other insurers, asset managers and funds try to minimize their costs and more importantly, trying to basically take down the number of data sources that they're relying on. 
We feel that growth going forward is going to be a function of a number of things, but it's going to be primarily gaining new clients, expanding relationships with existing clients, expanding the platform through enhanced functionality and products and obviously, expanding into under-penetrated geographies, most notably Europe and Asia. With that, what we've said at Investor Day and will continue to be reinforced as given all of that, that our pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. And we continue to reaffirm our low to mid-teens growth rate for technology services revenue. 
As it relates to ACV, ACV was up 16%. And as you correctly note, we do have -- we're migrating a bunch of the eFront business over to Aladdin in terms of its hosted model as opposed to its traditional model. That does, as you say, have different accounting ramifications. And so we decided to put ACV out as a key performance metric because we think it better reflects the overall momentum of the business and takes away some of the timing and accounting changes for migrating models over. 
So ACV was up 16%. And I think as you also correctly note, that's probably a little faster than we would expect the longer term to be given our target. And I think that's a function of some of the business coming through today at a more rapid rate that was delayed from a year ago in the early days of the pandemic as we highlighted, longer sales cycles and contracting period. So we're definitely seeing a little bit of an acceleration there, but again, reaffirming our low to mid-teens growth outlook."

It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2021. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings releas",1769,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2021. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.  
Last month at our 2021 Investor Day, we highlighted how the investments we have consistently made to support growth have enabled us to execute on our framework for shareholder value. We have invested and evolved over time to create a globally integrated investment and technology platform that enables clients to construct resilient whole portfolios that meet their objectives regardless of market environment or risk appetite.  
And we continue to invest in our industry-leading high-growth franchises such as ETFs, private markets and technology and are accelerating investments to drive growth in our ESG, traditional active and solutions capabilities. The combination of our comprehensive and integrated investment platform with global and local distribution capabilities once again delivered strong results for the quarter. And we remain very well positioned to continue delivering differentiated organic growth in the future.  
BlackRock generated total net inflows of $81 billion in the second quarter, representing 4% annualized organic asset growth. As previously disclosed, second quarter net inflows included the full impact of a $58 billion low fee institutional index redemption from a large U.S. public pension client. Strong net inflows from ETFs and our entire active franchise once again contributed to this quarter's robust 10% annualized organic base fee growth.  
Over the last 12 months, our broad-based platform, pairing diverse investment capabilities with best-in-class technology and rigorous risk management, has generated over $500 billion of total net inflows, representing 13% organic base fee growth, well in excess of our 5% long-term target. Second quarter revenue of $4.8 billion increased 32% year-over-year, and operating income of $1.9 billion rose 37%.  
Earnings per share of $10.03 was up 28%, also reflecting lower nonoperating income and a higher effective tax rate compared to a year ago. Strong year-over-year comparisons benefited in part from significant improvements in equity market conditions versus a year ago.  
Nonoperating results for the quarter included $145 million of net investment income primarily driven by mark-to-market gains in our private equity co-investment and unhedged seed capital portfolios. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24%. We now estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2021 primarily reflected an increase in certain state tax rates, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation during the year.  
Second quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.8 billion was up 27% year-over-year primarily driven by the positive impact of market beta on average AUM and strong organic base fee growth, partially offset by higher discretionary money market fee waivers, lower securities lending revenue and strategic pricing investments over the last year. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 5%. However, our effective fee rate was down 0.3 basis points as strong organic base fee growth driven by our higher fee active businesses and the impact of 1 additional day in the current quarter were more than offset by higher discretionary money market fee waivers and the impact of divergent equity beta in the quarter.  
During the second quarter, we incurred approximately $165 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers driven in part by continued strong flows into our U.S. government money market funds. While the Fed's recent technical adjustments to the IOER and RRP have modestly helped, we still expect discretionary fee waivers to persist at or around current levels for the near term. However, future levels of discretionary fee waivers may also be impacted by several additional factors, including the level of AUM and funds with existing waivers, gross yields and competitive positioning.  
Performance fees of $340 million were up significantly from a year ago, reflecting strong performance across our entire investment platform, including liquid and illiquid alternatives and long-only strategies. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 14% from a year ago, while annual contract value or ACV increased 16% year-over-year and continued to reflect strong growth from the second quarter of 2020, which was impacted by slower sales and extended contracting in the early days of the pandemic. We remain committed to low to mid-teens growth in ACV over the long term.  
Total expense increased 29% versus the year-ago quarter driven primarily by higher compensation, direct fund and G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 34%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income and performance fees and higher deferred compensation, reflecting the impact of additional grants associated with prior year compensation and certain compensation arrangements related to a previous acquisition.  
Direct fund expense increased 30% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average index AUM.  
G&A expense was up $73 million or 19% year-over-year primarily driven by higher technology, portfolio services and marketing spend. Sequentially, G&A expense was down $124 million, reflecting the impact of approximately $180 million of product launch costs incurred in the first quarter, partially offset by higher technology and marketing spend. Intangible amortization expense increased $10 million year-over-year as a result of our Aperio acquisition.  
Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.9% was up 120 basis points from a year ago, benefiting in part from significant equity market improvements over the last year. 
BlackRock has never been positioned -- has never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us. And we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. Our capital management strategy remains first to invest in our business, including through prudent use of our balance sheet, and then to return excess cash to shareholders. We see incredible opportunity to make Aladdin the language of all portfolios and are investing to evolve Aladdin for its next leg of growth.  
As Larry will discuss in more detail, during the second quarter, we announced a partnership with Baringa, including the acquisition of their industry-leading climate chain scenario model, which will enhance Aladdin Climate's capabilities and set a new standard for climate analytics.  
In addition, yesterday, we announced a minority investment in SpiderRock Advisors, a tech-enabled asset manager focused on providing professionally managed option overlay strategies. This investment adds incremental product capabilities to our recent acquisition of Aperio and extends our market-leading personalized SMA franchise.  
We also repurchased an additional $300 million worth of shares in the second quarter and stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
As we discussed at Investor Day, our strong and resilient platform has never been better positioned to deliver for clients as we leverage our scale, unique insights and solutions orientation to meet their long-term investment needs.  
Quarterly net inflows of $81 billion reflect a continued momentum across our entire investment business, especially in our ETF and active platforms. Our ETFs generated net inflows of $75 billion in the second quarter, representing 11% annualized organic asset and base fee growth. We also crossed $3 trillion in assets globally for the first time.  
Core equity and higher fee precision ETFs continued to generate strong inflows, particularly in international equities. However, most of our growth this quarter came from the strategic category, led by continued strength in our sustainable ETFs and renewed strength in fixed income as well as steady positive flows into factor and thematic ETFs.  
Retail net inflows of $21 billion, representing 9% annualized organic asset growth and 10% annualized organic base fee growth, were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and across all major asset classes. Inflows continue to reflect broad-based strength across the entirety of our active platform, and we remain well positioned to capture demand for both active equities and investor appetite for yield where our diversified fixed income range, including unconstrained, high-yield, international and broad market strategies, is equipped to meet client demand in any rate environment.  
BlackRock's institutional active net inflows of $43 billion were led by $35 billion of multi-asset net inflows largely driven by a significant outsourced CIO mandate from a U.K. pension client. As Larry will also discuss, BlackRock is uniquely positioned to deliver customized whole portfolio solutions by capitalizing on our global scale, expertise in investment, technology and risk management and focus on sustainability.  
During the second quarter, we also saw a continued demand for active fixed income and the liquid alternatives and LifePath target date offerings. Institutional index net outflows of $80 billion were impacted by the previously mentioned single client redemption during the quarter. Outflows from index equities were partially offset by inflows into fixed income as clients rebalance portfolios after significant equity market gains or sought to immunize portfolios through LDI strategies.  
Despite overall asset net outflows across BlackRock's institutional franchise for the quarter, annualized organic base fee growth was 6% as net inflows into higher fee active and alternative strategies more than offset the de minimis base fee impact of low fee index equity outflows. Overall, BlackRock generated approximately $63 billion in quarterly active net flows across the platform, matching our ninth consecutive quarter of positive active equity flows.  
Demand for alternatives also continued with nearly $7 billion of net inflows into liquid and illiquid alternative strategies during the quarter driven by single strategy hedge funds, fund of hedge fund solutions, real assets, private credit and private equity solutions. Fundraising momentum remains strong, and we have approximately $31 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees.  
Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform continued to grow, generating $23 billion of net inflows in the second quarter driven by both prime and U.S. government money market funds. Despite facing near 0 returns in both the U.S. and Europe, client demand for cash strategies remained strong, given significant liquidity in the financial system. And by helping clients manage their cash, we are building broader and deeper strategic relationships.  
Our continued strong performance is a direct result of a thoughtful growth strategy that has been well-executed by a talented group of purpose-driven employees who live the One BlackRock culture each day. We are thankful for their tremendous effort and contributions to our success for these last 18 months. We will continue to embrace change and invest responsibly for the future so that we can meet the needs of all of our stakeholders.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

We are once again reporting earnings today from our headquarters in New York City. And I'm happy to see more and more of our colleagues in the office in recent weeks, and I remain cautiously optimistic for a gradual return to having people back in the office and a little normalcy.  
After more than a year of virtual meetings, I spent the last few weeks meeting with clients in person again. I also spoke at the G20 in Venice on Sunday about sustainability and climate change, and it was great to be back on the road.  
Our business is built on listening to the people we serve and understanding their needs. And there is no substitute for meeting face to face with people to hear directly from them about their investment challenges, their opportunities and what lie ahead for them.  
It is through these conversations that we're able to build a deeper relationship with our clients across their whole portfolio and to ensure BlackRock is always evolving and staying current and staying in front of their needs. This long-standing client-centric approach is powering consistently strong results for the benefit of all our stakeholders.  
Total net inflows of $81 billion in the second quarter, representing a 10% organic base fee growth, were driven by continued momentum in strategic growth areas. We saw client demand in our ETFs and illiquid alternatives, our active and sustainable strategies as well as our scaled cash management solutions. And we developed 14% year-over-year growth in technology services revenues as clients increasingly turned to Aladdin.  
We have now delivered organic base fee growth in excess of our 5% target for 5 consecutive quarters, including 13% over the last 12 months from over $500 billion of net inflows. This is driving strong financial performance, and I'm very confident that we have significant room to grow as we are partnering with more clients on larger and more comprehensive mandates than ever before in our history.  
The global economic restart continues to broaden in the second quarter as vaccinations were rolled out, and some countries are gradually reopening. With significant amounts of cash still in the sidelines, markets are anticipating continued growth near term. Despite the potential for various restrictions in certain regions, certain countries due to the variant, we have seen equity markets rally year-to-date with most indexes up over 10% from the first half of the year and hitting record highs.  
We look ahead to the remainder of the year and beyond. Inflation concern's top of mind for investors. We need to assess the potential impact on their portfolios. Debate remains as to whether this inflation will be transitorial or structural, and central banks will need to balance their monetary policy decisions alongside expansive fiscal policy by so many governments.  
In this environment, clients are looking for scale partners who have a deeper understanding of the global picture and a platform that can construct portfolios tailored for their needs and for their future goals. They are turning to BlackRock to help them navigate uncertainty. They're turning to BlackRock to invest more opportunistically, and they're turning to BlackRock to help them plan for their future. And our deliberate investment over many years to build a resilient and scaled asset management and technology platform is helping them in their needs, and we are delivering for them.  
Building on what we laid out at our Investor Day last month, we remain focused on consistently improving and investing ahead of our clients' needs in the biggest growth areas of the future. In ETFs, the benefit of our investments over time are showing up through accelerated momentum across the franchise. In June, client assets in our ETFs passed $3 trillion globally driven by second quarter net inflows of $75 billion.  
It took 15 years for iShares to get to $1 trillion in assets. It took iShares only 5 years to get to $2 trillion in assets, and it just most recently took iShares only 2 years to get to $3 trillion.  
Importantly, the more majority of this growth at each milestone has been organic as more investors are using ETFs in more ways. They are using to build whole portfolios. They are using iShares to invest beyond traditional market cap-weighted indexes. And they're using iShares more than ever before to access the bond market efficiently.  
Our ETFs grew across each of our core, our strategic and precision product categories, with more than half of our net inflows coming from our strategic categories led by fixed income and sustainable ETFs. We saw more than $22 billion of net inflows into our fixed income ETFs as investors sought more efficient ways to access fixed income and turn to us for a more broad range exposure, including Chinese bonds, multi-sector, municipal bonds, inflation-linked ETFs. And we now manage more than $700 billion in fixed income ETFs and continue to believe that this category will grow to $1 trillion by 2024 as fixed income ETFs modernize the $100 trillion bond market.  
Momentum in sustainable ETFs remained strong with another $14 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, including the launches of our low carbon transition readiness ETF. We have seen [ $40 billion ] of net inflows into sustainable ETFs in the first half of 2021 compared to $46 billion in all of 2020.  
With nearly $120 billion of sustainable ETFs, BlackRock has 4x the size of the next sustainable ETF player. And we are incredibly well positioned for the future for our clients' needs in this fast-growing category. 
Demand for sustainable strategies is accelerating from investors worldwide in both index and active. Within active sustainable strategies, we saw $4 billion of net inflows in the second quarter. Sustainable investments offer significant opportunities to generate alpha for clients, and we are focused on innovating ahead of their needs.  
For example, we announced last week the first close for the climate finance partnership. We'll invest in climate infrastructure across emerging markets. This strategy is a great example of how public and private sectors can come together to deliver positive environmental and social impact for communities and attractive risk-adjusted returns for clients, including global institutional investors, for governments and for philanthropies.  
BlackRock's broader active platform is playing an increasingly important role in our clients' portfolios. And we are seeing the benefits of our investment in our growth and our investment performance.  
We generated $63 billion of active net inflows in the second quarter across equities, fixed income, multi assets and alternative strategies. This growth is outpacing that of the $70 trillion active management industry as we continue to captive active market share.  
Long-term investment performance is strong with over 85% of our fundamental active equities, systematic active equities, taxable fixed income assets outperforming the benchmark or peer mediums over the past 5 years. By delivering durable alpha for clients, we remain well positioned to continue to generate growth in active strategies. More clients are looking to outsource their entire portfolio as regulations intensify, operating cost-wise and investing grows more complex.  
They want customized solutions spanning active, index, alternatives, powered by sophisticated technology and risk management. The breadth of BlackRock's investment platform, our portfolio of construction expertise and our Aladdin technology uniquely positions us to meet these clients' needs.  
We are honored to be entrusted to manage the over $30 billion of pension assets for British Airways in the second quarter through the creation of a bespoke investment and service model. This partnership represents the largest of this kind in the U.K. pension fund, and we believe it will be a catalyst for more transformational change in the industry.  
We manage over $200 billion in OCIO assets today and believe the trend towards outsourcing will only continue to accelerate. We are also seeing demand for personalization growing more among the financial advisers and our wealth clients. And we're continuing to invest behind the democratization of tax-efficient, personalized portfolios at scale. BlackRock is partnering with financial intermediaries in providing model portfolios, which utilize our broad range of iShares ETFs and actively managed funds as well as separately managed account strategies across alpha, factor investing and index investing.  
Building on our acquisition of Aperio, we recently announced a minority investment in SpiderRock Advisors, which will further enhance our ability to provide wealth managers and financial advisers with tax-efficient, personalized portfolios and risk management solutions. This is another major step we are taking to advance our market-leading franchise in personalizing and personalization of SMAs.  
Alongside ETFS, SMAs continue to see high-growth rates as advisers and personalization and tax management to wealth client portfolios. BlackRock is the second-largest SMA provider today with over $200 billion in assets, including Aperio. And we remain focused on investing in a comprehensive platform of solutions and customization capabilities for the wealth management market.  
BlackRock's commitment to evolve and to meet our clients' needs is recently most evident in sustainability. As we adapt to the fundamental restructuring that the energy transition is driving across the economy, we are investing across products, data, technology capabilities so we can help clients address their impact of sustainable factors on their portfolios and help them capture significant client demand for sustainable solutions.  
Last year, we began developing Aladdin Climate to fill a need in climate risk analytics and to help investors better understand and act on climate risk. Aladdin Climate measures at both the asset and portfolio levels the impact of physical risk like extreme weather event, and transition risks such as policy changes, new technologies and energy supply.  
In June, we will further -- in June, we further advanced Aladdin Climate through a new partnership with Baringa. The combination of Baringa's climate transition risk models and Aladdin's financial and physical risk models will provide investors with the ability to better understand and customize their risk -- their climate risk exposures. This partnership is a significant milestone in the build-out of Aladdin Climate and will set a new bar in the industry for climate analytics and risk management tools.  
We are also committed to bringing the benefit to our global platform to clients around the world by deepening our local infrastructure. We are investing in people who speak every language to understand local markets and regulations and have insight into how the changing world intersects with each of our clients' goals. This includes investing in the leading -- this is -- excuse me. This includes investing in -- to be the leading global asset manager in China.  
Rapid economic development and wealth accumulation in the world's second-largest economy has propelled the growth of the $9 trillion Chinese domestic asset management industry. Earlier this year, we obtained our wealth management joint venture license. And last month, we received our fund management company license. We are the first global asset manager firm to obtain this type of license.  
We are now well positioned to extend the breadth of our investment solutions and insights to all our client segments across China and help more people transition their savings to investments in China, including in preparation for their retirement. 
With more than half of BlackRock's assets linked to retirement, we are incredibly focused on innovating and helping our clients address the retirement crisis around the world. Client demand for our LifePath target date funds remained strong with $17 billion of net inflows year-to-date, representing a 10% organic growth and outpacing the entire industry. 
The need for retirement income and retirement is also accelerating. A recent study BlackRock conducted found that nearly 90% of the participants across every generation wants a retirement income solution. And 96% of plan sponsors feels responsibility for helping their participants generate and manage their income in retirement.  
BlackRock is developing LifePath Paycheck to address this growing need. And we are already seeing strong commercial demand with several initial client commitments and support from an institutional and investment consultants. 
The incredible momentum we are seeing across our entire platform is a direct result of our dedicated employee base. I have never been prouder of BlackRock's nearly 17,000 employees. I have seen their commitment to our clients and to each other in incredible ways throughout this pandemic. 
And in recognition of this hard work and to have them share in BlackRock's growth and success, we are investing in our employees through an 8% raise in base salary compensation for all employees up to and including director levels as of September 1, 2021. We strive to cultivate an environment at BlackRock where employees feel supported and have a diverse and inclusive environment where they can thrive and grow and build a career and life.  
After a period like no other in the firm's history, BlackRock has never been better positioned for the future. My recent trips to Europe and the Middle East to meet with our clients have only further validated our differentiated positioning and our approach to building deeper, broader relationships with our clients.  
We have always led by listening to our clients and hearing what they want, what they need. And through that -- through anticipation and embracing change and innovating and stay in front of our clients' needs, that has what driven us going forward. Our fiduciary focus has guided the deliberate -- our deliberateness in terms of investments we have made to build a more resilient asset manager and a more resilient technology platform by anticipating and staying in front of our clients' needs. And we will continue to deliver industry-leading growth to benefit all our stakeholders for the long term.  
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Aperio brings experience in building index-based, highly custom investment solutions. So these are complementary businesses, and they enhance our value proposition for our whole portfolio SMAs across equity and fixed income in alpha factors and index solutions. 
So with over $200 billion in SMAs, including Aperio, BlackRock is a market-leading whole portfolio sponsor. And with the prospect of higher income and capital gains taxes, we've now built a pipeline of over $6 billion in potential new Aperio mandates just since the transaction closed.

And hopefully, this could be something that we could expand beyond the United States. But this is going to be some -- a significant part of our whole foundation. 
And the last thing I would just say related to LifePath target date franchise, we're up to now $370 billion alone without even talking about the LifePath Paycheck. And so this is going to continue to accelerate where we're taking market share."

You know that we have said over and over that we see significant room for continued growth in ETFs, and the penetration of the equity and bond markets is still very low. We expect generational shifts to unlock a lot of new growth,",424,"So good question, Craig. You know that we have said over and over that we see significant room for continued growth in ETFs, and the penetration of the equity and bond markets is still very low. We expect generational shifts to unlock a lot of new growth, especially whole portfolios, where ETFs in fee-based are around 11%; new investment capabilities like ESG; and overall capital markets replacements, where we're seeing ETFs that are about 5% of the total market and 1% of the bond market. 
We expect, to give you a number to throw out, by 2025 that ETFs are going to more than double to $15 trillion. And even at that level, we would still be a small part of the markets in which we compete, which is why we think there are decades of growth ahead. And we fully intend to be the market leader in revenue growth and truly organic client-driven flows and in total assets as this evolves. 
And we recognize that we have to offer choice in the vehicles that we show clients. But ETFs, I believe, are going to lead in that. 
So there are some key client segments. One is Europe, which is adopting very, very quickly. The wealth area through model portfolios of again, of which we are a leader, is showing huge growth. And certainly in institutional clients, primarily in fixed income, is showing growth. And then another segment, sustainable, which you heard about, which we are the leader, is also showing growth. 
So what makes our ETF platform unique relative to any competitor is its diversity and broad client base. So for example, our global client base is made up of self-directed investors, wealth managers, pensions, insurers and active managers. We have the most diversified platform with $2.3 trillion in the U.S. and $650 billion in Europe and $2.3 trillion in equity and $700 billion in fixed income. So you can see how this matches up against the client segments I talked about. 
And most importantly, which may be overlooked, we provide the most secondary market liquidity. So U.S. iShares traded almost $9 trillion in 2020 versus $7 trillion in 2019. And EMEA's iShares traded $1.2 trillion in 2020 versus $1 trillion in 2019. So this, along with our precision exposures, which are often unique to us, while it has been a drag in prior years, are actually a driver of our strong revenue growth this quarter. So we're excited about the growth, specifically in the segments that we are a leader in today."

So in terms of the comp side, we talked about comping up about 34%, and that primarily reflected higher incentive compensation. And you correctly pointed out that incentive compensation is very much tied to both profitability and performance. And so as we saw higher operating income and performance fees, that definitely ticked up. 
But we also saw higher deferred compensation year-over-year. That was up by about $100 million year-over-year. And I'd say there's really 2 things there. One is more ongoing, which is the ongoing impact of additional grants associated with last year's compensation. Obviously, we defer a significant component of current compensation for retention. And last year saw a rather large level of deferrals, especially as it related to performance fees and the level of performance fees last year. That was -- I'd say that's probably about 60-or-so percent of that increase. 
But there was also a onetime, what I would call, a crystallization and acceleration of certain compensatory arrangements tied to the success of one of our historical acquisitions. That was probably about $35 million or about 70 basis points on the comp ratio that ultimately should migrate away now that, that has been settled out. So that's it on comp as I would think about it. 
Obviously, Larry mentioned the base salary increases, which is more a function of going forward. And he talked all about recognizing the accomplishments of our tremendous employees over the last 18 months. I don't expect that to have a very significant impact on our financials this year, but it could be, given its effective date of September 1, let's call it, roughly 20 basis points or thereabouts on both comp and margin impact on a purely isolated basis for the rest of the year. 
In terms of G&A, we have -- I think we gave you some guidance at the beginning of the year. We've made no reductions to the discretionary investment spending plans in terms of G&A spend and hiring that we originally budgeted for the year and that we referenced on our call. 
I think much as others are, I think we're probably hiring a little slower than we had anticipated. And we're working on that to make sure we can get the employee support to support our growth plans. But we would, as I think is somewhat customary for us, we anticipate our overall level of G&A spend to be higher in the second half, especially around such areas like marketing technology. 
And then as Larry mentioned, as people get back to traveling, obviously, we haven't had a lot of T&E in the first part of the year, but the potential for that, I think, exists for next year. And I think -- so broadly speaking, that's it on the comp. There was kind of that onetime issue. And on the G&A side, again, our plans are generally exactly the same as we laid them out to you at the beginning of the year."

But I think when you think about -- and when I referenced the British Air OCIO mandate, we believe this is going to be -- this is just the beginning of more focus on the virtues and the value proposition of -- for these pension funds. We think how it's organized. Should it be done under a platform like BlackRock? And then do we create the efficiencies? And most importantly, are we -- can we have a better fiduciary outcome on behalf of their participants? 
All of this is about the participants. And can we provide a better outcome for the participants? And I really do believe we are thinking of that. But we have had some very large wins with a few other clients in the last few quarters. We are in large dialogue with many more. 
But I want to underscore what the transformation of LifePath Paycheck could be, too. These could be some very large opportunities, too, and having the defined contribution business being reimagined and rethought. And that is how we framed it. 
How can we reimagine and provide better certainty to the participants? How can we provide better outcomes? And how can that lead to a better closeness between the employer and the employees? And how can they build deeper bonds when the employees retire during the deaccumulation period of time? 
These are the broad-based solutions that we've been focusing on, no different than the broad-based solutions we focus on the needs we're focusing on climate in portfolios across the board. 
And so I believe what we are -- what you're seeing in the past related to above trend line growth, above 5% of organic growth is because of these deepening relationships across the board. And as I concluded in my speech, I do believe we are going to continue to see this type of elevated opportunity. And it's because we are so relentlessly focused on how to think about our clients and help them become better at what they're doing. 
And I truly believe what the outcome of British Air and the other measure that we talked about. And I would say with the strong performance that we've had in our active platform, flows generally follow. And when you can have -- and no firm can have this, when you could have a dialogue where you are agnostic about the role of index assets like ETFs and active assets and then focusing on whether it's tax-efficient portfolio strategies or focusing on a sustainability overlay, we're now focusing on outcomes related to more certainty during deaccumulation periods of time. This is what's driving the flows, and this is what I think is differentiating BlackRock, that we are spending more time. We're investing, as Gary talked about, our investments in the future. 
These are the type of investments we're making, and we're making sure that we are staying in front of the needs of clients and providing something unique and differentiated. And I do believe that is resonating more and more. Let me just leave it at that."

I think we feel very good about our organic growth potential going forward. I think it reflects the platform we've built. I think it reflects global reach, full range of investment capabilities, integrated risk, great performance. 
But as you know, growth is also somewhat tied to markets in particular. And I think some of the growth that we're seeing today clearly is a result of the type of environment that we're in. And so we try not to get too focused on a particular environment but really look across cycles. 
And I think if you look at what we've done over the last 5 years, we've actually averaged about a 5% organic base fee growth over the last 5 years. And while we've actually -- I think really the more important piece of this is not how fast we necessarily grow in a more risk-on environment, although I know Larry doesn't like that term. I think the reality is that when we see the markets fall back, we stay positive. 
And so even in tough markets like '16 and '18, where the industry was roundly negative, we were still in positive territory. And I think I would also remind you that, look, the industry is basically right around 3% in terms of where everyone thinks the industry more broadly is going to grow. So at 5%, we're already growing, if you will, at a 60-plus percent premium to where we think the industry is. And we feel very comfortable with that because of our breadth, because of our solutions orientation and our technology platform. 
I think we feel very good about both secular growth, secular growth more broadly, maintaining share in places like ETF. We feel like we have a ton of room to run in places like illiquid, where the market is growing, and we're generally still low single-digit share. And we think our investment performance positions us well to continue to play a major role in active. 
So for the moment, until we get through the cycle and see where we come out the other side, 5% is the target. And we feel very good about our performance going forward relative to that."

So again, we're not going to get very specific on pipelines, but we will give you some tonality on our Aladdin growth rate. So I think as we've talked about, there is clearly increased client demand accelerated by COVID for comprehensive whole portfolio solutions that involve greater systemization, fewer vendor relationships as a number of financial service companies and other insurers, asset managers and funds try to minimize their costs and more importantly, trying to basically take down the number of data sources that they're relying on. 
We feel that growth going forward is going to be a function of a number of things, but it's going to be primarily gaining new clients, expanding relationships with existing clients, expanding the platform through enhanced functionality and products and obviously, expanding into under-penetrated geographies, most notably Europe and Asia. With that, what we've said at Investor Day and will continue to be reinforced is given all of that, that our pipeline is as strong as it's ever been. And we continue to reaffirm our low to mid-teens growth rate for technology services revenue. 
As it relates to ACV, ACV was up 16%. And as you correctly note, we do have -- we're migrating a bunch of the eFront business over to Aladdin in terms of its hosted model as opposed to its traditional model. That does, as you say, have different accounting ramifications. And so we decided to put ACV out as a key performance metric because we think it better reflects the overall momentum of the business and takes away some of the timing and accounting changes for migrating models over. 
So ACV was up 16%. And I think as you also correctly note, that's probably a little faster than we would expect the longer term to be given our target. And I think that's a function of some of the business coming through today at a more rapid rate that was delayed from a year ago in the early days of the pandemic as we highlighted, longer sales cycles and contracting period. So we're definitely seeing a little bit of an acceleration there, but again, reaffirming our low to mid-teens growth outlook."

It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2021. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release disc",1803,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2021. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
BlackRock's proven track record of delivering for stakeholders reflects our ongoing commitment to anticipate change before it happens and continually invest for the long term. Our globally integrated investment and technology platform enables us to construct resilient whole portfolios for clients. We rely on thought leadership, global investment insights and state-of-the-art risk management tools to help clients navigate ever-changing and increasingly volatile market environments. Our approach is resonating more than ever and is reflected in the continued strong momentum we are seeing across our entire platform. 
BlackRock generated total net inflows of $75 billion in the third quarter. $98 billion of long-term net inflows, representing approximately 4% annualized organic asset growth were partially offset by net outflows from lower fee cash and advisory AUM. In addition, strong net inflows from ETFs and our active franchise once again contributed to this quarter's 9% annualized organic base fee growth. 
Over the last 12 months, our differentiated investment management platform, which pairs active and index capabilities across the entire range of traditional and alternative products, has now generated over $450 billion of total net inflows representing 13% organic base fee growth well in excess of our 5% long-term target. 
Third quarter revenue of $5.1 billion increased 16% year-over-year while operating income of $1.9 billion rose 11% and reflected the impact of approximately $96 million of fund launch costs primarily associated with the successful launch of a $2 billion closed-end fund in late September. 
Earnings per share of $10.95 was up 19% compared to a year ago, also reflecting significantly higher nonoperating income in the current quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter included $298 million of net investment income primarily driven by noncash gains related to our strategic minority investments in iCapital and Scalable Capital as well as mark-to-market gains in our private equity co-investment portfolio. 
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24%. We continue to estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2021, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. 
Third quarter base fees and securities lending revenue of $3.9 billion increased 22% year-over-year reflecting the positive impact of market beta on average AUM and 13% organic base fee growth despite higher discretionary money market fee waivers and strategic pricing investments over the last year. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 5%. 
Our third quarter annualized effective fee rate on a day count equivalent basis increased by 0.2 basis points from the second quarter as the positive impact of strong organic base fee growth driven by our higher fee active businesses, and lower discretionary money market fee waivers more than offset the negative impact of divergent equity beta primarily associated with the accelerating decline in emerging markets during the current quarter. 
During the third quarter, we incurred approximately $130 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers. Lower discretionary yield support waivers in the current quarter were linked to the Fed's technical adjustments to the IOER and RRP in June as well as outflows from U.S. government money market funds during the current quarter. Performance fees of $345 million reflect generally strong performance from our single strategy hedge fund platform over the last year. The decline in year-over-year fees reflected lower revenue from a single hedge fund with an annual performance measurement period that ends in the third quarter and which delivered truly exceptional performance a year ago partially offset by higher revenue from illiquid products. 
Quarterly technology services revenue increased 13% from a year ago. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 16% year-over-year and continued to reflect strong growth from the third quarter of 2020, which was impacted by slower sales and extended contracting in the early months of the pandemic. We remain committed to low to mid-teens growth in ACV over the long term. 
Total expense increased 19% versus the year ago quarter driven primarily by higher G&A, compensation and direct fund expense. G&A expense was up $139 million or 30% year-over-year primarily driven by higher technology and portfolio services expense in the current quarter. Third quarter G&A expense also included $96 million of fund launch costs primarily associated with our first ESG-oriented closed-end fund, the $2 billion BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Trust, and $29 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to the estimated final payment on our successful Citibanamex acquisition in 2018. Recall that we exclude the impact of product launch costs when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin. 
Core G&A expense for the third quarter, which excludes the impact of product launch and transaction-related costs, was up 3% from the second quarter. We have made no changes to the discretionary investment spending plans we have previously outlined and would expect a sequential increase in our fourth quarter core G&A spend to be generally consistent with previous years reflecting seasonal increases in marketing spend, additional costs related to return-to-office planning and ongoing technology costs associated with Aladdin cloud migrations. 
Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $116 million or 8% from a year ago primarily reflecting higher base compensation and higher deferred compensation related to the impact of grants associated with 2020 compensation. Direct fund expense increased 38% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher average index AUM, and intangible amortization expense increased $11 million year-over-year due to our Aperio acquisition. 
Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45.8% was down 120 basis points from a year ago as operating leverage was more than offset by the impact of lower performance fees, higher contingent consideration fair value adjustments and higher intangible amortization expense compared to a year ago. 
We're seeing more opportunities to invest for growth than ever before. We reopened the closed-end fund market in 2019 by making it more efficient for investors to access products at NAV. By synthetically seeding these new funds, we've now raised $14 billion in active AUM, representing over $170 million in new revenue. Our strategic minority investments in iCapital and Scalable Capital are reinforcing our tech-for-flow strategy and simultaneously generating very attractive returns for shareholders. And we continue to build our best-in-class ESG capabilities, most recently by acquiring Rhodium's models related to the physical risks associated with climate change; effective use of our balance sheet to seed new products, co-invest alongside clients or makes strategic minority investments, both supports our growth and drives value for our shareholders. And while our capital management strategy remains, first, to invest in our business, we also remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders and repurchased an additional $300 million worth of shares in the third quarter. 
As we discussed at Investor Day, we continue to invest in our highest growth franchises, such as ETFs, private markets and technology, and we are accelerating investments to drive growth in our sustainable traditional active and solutions capabilities. Each of these areas once again delivered strong results in the third quarter. 
Quarterly long-term net inflows of $98 billion were driven by continued momentum in our ETF and active platforms. Our ETFs generated net inflows of $58 billion in the third quarter, positive across each of our product categories, representing 7% annualized organic base fee growth. ETFs attributable to our strategic category drove over 50% of net inflows in the quarter reflecting continued strength in fixed income and sustainable ETFs, Core equity and higher fee precision exposure ETFs saw net inflows of $16 billion and $9 billion, respectively, led by U.S. equity exposures. 
Retail net inflows of $23 billion, representing 11% annualized organic base fee growth, were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and across all major asset classes. Retail multi-asset results included the impact of the previously mentioned $2 billion closed-end fund raised in late September. 
Inflows continue to reflect broad-based strength across our active platform and we remain well positioned to meet investor needs for risk-adjusted alpha and yield in the current market environment. BlackRock's institutional active net inflows of $26 billion, representing 6% annualized organic base fee growth, were led by $25 billion of multi-asset net inflows. Growth included the impact of a significant outsourced CIO mandate from the Asia Pacific client, continuing our momentum in an important growth area, where we are providing cost-effective whole portfolio solutions to the world's most sophisticated institutional clients. 
We also saw continued demand for our LifePath target date offerings, and Larry will update you about a recent milestone for our new LifePath Paycheck retirement solution. Institutional index net outflows of $8 billion broadly reflected equity net outflows, which were partially offset by fixed income net inflows and as clients continue to rebalance portfolios after significant market -- equity market gains were -- immunize portfolios through LDI strategies. Overall, BlackRock generated approximately $45 billion in quarterly active net inflows across the platform, including our tenth consecutive quarter of positive active equity flows. 
Demand for alternatives also continued with nearly $7 billion of net inflows into liquid and illiquid alternative strategies during the quarter driven by single-strategy hedge funds, private credit, real assets and private equity solutions. Fundraising momentum remains strong, and we have approximately $29 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies representing a significant source of future base and performance fees. 
BlackRock's cash management platform experienced net outflows of $12 billion driven primarily by redemptions from U.S. government and offshore sterling prime money market funds in line with the broader U.S. money market fund industry. BlackRock's diverse cash management offerings position us well to serve clients' needs, and you will hear more from Larry about how we are expanding our ESG cash offerings to enhance our competitive positioning even further. 
Finally, third quarter advisory net outflows of $10 billion were primarily linked to the successful planned wind-downs of portfolios managed by our Financial Markets Advisory group on behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Recall that revenue linked to these assignments is primarily reflected in the advisory and other revenue line item on our income statement. 
BlackRock's continued strong performance reflects our commitment to strategically invest in our business in anticipation of change and to lead the evolution of the asset management industry. Today, we see even greater opportunity to invest in our employees and our clients and in the communities in which we operate to ensure that we will continue to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I truly hope that all of you are staying healthy and safe. Fortunately, I've been traveling again and in recent months to see clients worldwide. It's great to be back in the road. -- meeting face-to-face with our clients, and I found our clients actually more engaged, more interested in our conversations than ever before. 
As investors continue to navigate uncertainty in the markets and in the broader global economic outlook, BlackRock is partnering more closely with our clients to help them achieve long-term -- their long-term goals and helping them seeking new opportunities. BlackRock is providing insights on the global economy, guidance on how to navigate the market volatility and  providing solutions for their entire portfolio. Our comprehensive unified investment and technology platform, combined with our steadfast client-centric approach, is enabling us to deliver constantly and consistently strong results for our stakeholders. 
Long-term net inflows of $98 billion in the third quarter represented 9% organic base fee growth, were driven by continued strength in our strategic growth opportunities that we've spoken to in the past. Our consecutive quarters of strong growth are the direct results of these investments that we've made over time to enhance and evolve our business and to be more prepared for the needs of our clients. 
We have now delivered organic base fee growth in excess of our 5% target for 6 consecutive quarters, including 13% growth over the last 12 months. And we also generated 30% year-over-year growth in technology services revenues as more clients are turning to Aladdin to execute on their growth aspirations and to helping them scale their business. 
After our promising global economic restart earlier this year, we saw certain countries and markets take a step back in recent months as they are confronted with the economic -- with virus variants and economic issues. Concerns around slowing economic growth are increasing while policymakers are evaluating the timing and pace of easing, whether it's rate hikes or reduction in bond purchases. 
And with interest rates still at historically low levels, investors need solutions that can earn a real yield and be resilient in a higher inflationary world. Inflationary trends are appearing more than transitory, reflecting structural changes, including a shift from consumerism to job creation, rising wage growth and the energy transition. 
As I said in a speech to the G20 in July, society needs to rapidly invest in innovation to offset inflationary pressures associated with the transition to a net zero economy. We need to make sure that we are pushing just as hard on the demand side as we are on the supply side. Otherwise, we risk supply issues that drive up the cost for consumers, especially for those who can least afford it. 
Against this backdrop, clients are turning to BlackRock more than ever before, and we are using the full breadth of our capabilities to meet all our clients' needs. BlackRock's top-performing active platform continues to outpace the industry, generating $45 billion of net inflows in the quarter and nearly $200 billion over the last 12 months. Momentum in active equities continue, and BlackRock's #1 in year-to-date asset-gathering in the U.S. active equity mutual fund industry, up from #3 in 2020. 
These results reflect our investments over time to incorporate data science, integrate ESG considerations and enhancing portfolio construction capabilities across the entire active business. And we remain committed to continuous innovation so we can deliver strong and durable alpha for our clients over the long term. 
In addition to our traditional active strategies, we're also seeing clients increase portfolio allocation to private markets. As they reach for yield, institutions are turning to BlackRock for private credit, real estate and private equity solutions. And well, we are seeing advisers access private markets through our record -- our recent closed-end fund vehicle, which have up to 25% allocation to alternatives and our accredited investor solutions. In total, we raised about $5 billion of illiquid alternative flows and commitments in the quarter, and we continue to steadily deploy that capital for our clients. 
Portfolio construction and asset allocation decisions are critical in achieving desired returns, and more clients are adopting our ETFs as a building block in their portfolios. We generated $58 billion of ETF net inflows in the third quarter with growth across each of our core strategic and precision product categories, including strong flows in fixed income as clients sought inflation protection and sources of income. 
We crossed $200 billion in ETF inflows year-to-date, exceeding our 2020 full year flows. We are seeing this momentum across the entire ETF industry as more and more investors discover the convenience, the efficiency and the transparency that the ETF vehicle has. We see opportunities well beyond the 30 million people who use our ETFs today and continue to believe in the long-term growth potential for ETFs. And we will remain confident in our ability to deliver strong organic base fee growth and lead the industry. 
In my conversations with clients, I hear about how they are looking to focus on their core business and partner with select investment managers that have the expertise, the technology, the scale to navigate the increasingly complex markets. We see outsourcing of portfolio management through OCIO for institutions and for model portfolios for the wealth managers, both of which are fast-growing areas of the industry. BlackRock is well positioned to capture this opportunity and partner with our clients across our whole portfolio. Few asset managers have the scale and the diversity of offerings to do this, and the consolidation we have seen in the industry is a further validation of our business model that we've already built here at BlackRock. 
We are also innovating to expand client options for how they participate in proxy voting decisions. Much like asset allocation and portfolio construction, where some clients now can take an active role, while others outsource these decisions to us, more of our clients are interested in voting on their index holdings. This is another great example of One BlackRock effort to further democratize choice for our clients and is in line with our commitment to provide them with the broadest range of options. 
Client demand for more holistic and flexible technology-driven solutions is also increasing. Technology services grew -- revenues grew by 13% year-over-year as Aladdin's capturing opportunity from industry shifts. And we are leveraging our user provider model to further evolve Aladdin. The combination of Aladdin and eFront has been well received by clients, and we now have over 2 dozen clients using both across their entire whole portfolios. 
As we've done throughout our history, we continue to invest ahead of our clients' needs and evolve BlackRock to lead in the biggest long-term opportunities of the future. And we are seeing meaningful progress in executing on these opportunities. In sustainability, momentum remained strong, and we generated another $31 billion of net inflows across all regions. Active sustainable net inflows of $7 billion were led by the launch of our ESG capital allocation trust closed-end fund, which Gary mentioned earlier. As ETFs -- in ETFs, iShares is leading sustainable -- is a leading sustainable provider, capturing nearly 50% of the industry category inflows year-to-date. In Europe, almost half of all industry flows are now going into sustainable ETFs, up from less than 10% just 3 years ago. 
Clients also want impact-oriented strategies that seek to deliver a targeted environmental or social outcome. We recently repurposed one of our money market funds to seek positive social outcomes by supporting a diverse trading ecosystem. BlackRock will also be contributing 5% of our management fees, net revenues from the funds to support students at historically black colleges and universities and predominantly black institutions. This fund has already grown more than 40% -- 20% to $4.5 billion since its conversion in July, and we are proud to work together with our clients to help make a positive impact on the futures of many diverse students, on the futures of many diverse business owners and in their own communities. 
BlackRock is also supporting clean energy solutions that change the demand curve for hydrocarbons, which is actually accelerating today in driving energy prices higher. The gap in cost between clean energy technologies and those that will emit greater amounts of greenhouse gases is still very large for most things, which is why BlackRock is supporting a range of initiatives to help bring down the green premium of clean energy. 
Building on our partnership with Temasek earlier this year to advance a decarbonization solution, the BlackRock Foundation announced last month a $100 million grant to breakthrough energy catalyst program. This grant will help speed the development and commercialization of clean energy technologies. And BlackRock will provide our investment expertise as the program deploys its financing around the world. 
We have a long history of innovating to help millions of people worldwide improve retirement readiness. And today, we are the largest investment-only defined contribution provider in the industry with over $1 trillion of assets under management on behalf of over 7,200 defined contribution plans -- excuse me, 72,000 defined contribution plans. Our target date franchise, LifePath has seen $23 billion of net inflows so far this year representing a 9% organic growth rate far in excess and broader in the target date industry. 
And we continue to innovate ahead of the future needs of our clients. We recently announced a significant milestone in our retirement income solution. LifePath Paycheck. 5 large plan sponsors, whose plan together represents about $7.5 billion in target date investments, have elected to work with BlackRock to implement our LifePath Paycheck solution as a default investment option in their investment retirement plans, subject to necessary approvals and conditions. We remain committed to working alongside our clients and partners to help more people address the challenges of spending and income in retirement. 
We believe that globally integrated financial markets provide people, companies and governments with better and more efficient access to capital that supports economic growth around the world. This conviction drives our long-term strategy in China, and it has in every community in every country where we operate. BlackRock's clients have benefited from our focus on the long term, and we will bring this perspective to help global clients invest in China and, importantly, to deliver investment solutions to Chinese investors. 
After receiving our FMC and WMC license earlier this year, we launched our first 2 products in the third quarter, raising over $1 billion in 2 weeks for more than 110,000 investors. This milestone demonstrates the value proposition of BlackRock's platform and the strength of our partnerships. It also highlights the start of BlackRock's living its purpose in China by helping more people secure in China a better future and investing in the long-term and retiring, hopefully, in dignity. 
Just as we continue to evolve our business to meet client needs, we also evolve our entire organization. A key driver of BlackRock success over the years has been our focus and deliberate talent processes on delivering leaders with a broad range of expertise, a deep commitment to the firm in a One BlackRock mindset. 
This commitment to the evolution also extends to our Board of Directors. We recently elected 2 new directors to our Board: Beth Ford, President and CEO of Land of the Lake; and Kristin Peck, CEO of Zoetis. Beth and Kristin are recognized leaders in their respective industries, and they bring a wide range of valuable perspectives and experiences that will help BlackRock and the Board navigate our future on behalf of all our shareholders. 
Looking ahead, I am confident the investments we are making today will enable us to capture greater opportunities and to deliver industry-leading growth in the years to come. More immediately, I'm very excited to welcome our colleagues back to BlackRock's offices in certain parts of the world where we begin our future work pilot. It's our culture which can't be built or maintained remotely over the long term. That ensures we can never forget who we are, who we serve. It also helps us in our markets, in our industry and, most importantly, helps us continue to evolve and experience the constant change of the world. Having togetherness and connection with all our employees is vital for our culture and vital for serving the needs of our clients. With that, let's open it up for questions."

And our goal has been to access the retail area for alternatives by keeping our promises over a long period of time on performance. 
So to start with the growth in retail alternatives is certainly compelling as part of our strategy to serve advisers' whole portfolios. And what we chose to do is bring a diversified product lineup to the retail alternative investor. So our job is to bring the appropriate wrappers for those products that provide the solutions to help reshape their portfolio at a period of time when rates and returns have been very low. And what we've seen them do is move from 1% to 2% of their portfolio to allocations up to 20%. 
So year-to-date, just in that sector, we've raised over $24 billion of net inflows, and that's at approximately 85 basis point average fee rate across what we'll call our retail liquid alternatives and credit vehicles and our public-private closed-end fund offerings. So our recent launch of alternatives portfolio analytics for financial advisers on the web-based BlackRock Advisor Center and the continued product expansion is going to help us grow with those clients. And in the recent years, as we expanded our retail alternatives to include private credit and private equity, pre-IPO access to growth equity through closed-end funds, and we're working to expand our retail alternatives offerings now across real assets, sustainable and co-investment opportunities. 
So just in the closed-end funds alone, we provide a wrapper that will enable us to provide up to $3 billion and alternatives to them. And just in a summary form, in total, we manage about $180 billion across liquid and illiquid alts of $29 billion right now in dry powder to invest and deploy, approximately $210 million of future annual base fees. And including liquid and liquid credit, our platform is now over $310 billion. We're the top 5 manager in that. And we've built out alternatives platforms and raised another $100 billion of gross capital over the last 5 years, and we expect to raise $100 billion more in the next 3 years. So just for September year-to-date, we have raised $25 billion of gross capital and deployed $10 billion and because there is some expectation that rates can rise. Still, these are longer-term investments that have enough spread in it that I believe that the demand is going to continue for quite a long period of time. And I think Larry's rate scenario, which you said in the beginning, is rates low for longer, will only enhance the ability for people to want more alternatives."

So we're obviously -- we have seen some expense growth, which I think is expected in the context of the outsized organic base fee growth that we're delivering on the top line. For the third quarter, our margin obviously was down about 120 basis points versus a year ago. And I'd say there are a couple of things there that kind of clouded what would have been some operating leverage in the business. 
Really 3 things in particular. One was lower performance fees year-over-year. If you recall, we had this discussion last year that performance fees in general hit the P&L at a much higher marginal margin than the rest of the business because there's only really compensation associated with it and no other operating costs in the business. And so when we see performance fees decline as they did year-over-year, that has an impact on margin. 
Secondly, we had higher contingent consideration fair value adjustments or noncore expense this quarter, which was related to the Citibanamex final payment, and we had higher intangible amortization. So if you look at those 3 things, those 3 things really more than offset our margin on a year-over-year basis, where we would have seen some operating leverage improvement. 
In terms of just looking at those individual costs, I mean, when you look at comp, comp is up about 8% year-over-year, Again, that was highly driven by base salaries but not just the midyear that you saw. Remember, comparing it to a year ago, we'll have normal base salary increases at the beginning of the year. We have the midyear. Head count is a little higher. We obviously have a period this year versus where we didn't have it last year. And FX has basically increased the dollar cost of some of that compensation also. So that's really the main driver was the base salary. But the midyear salary increase really didn't have that much to do on a year-over-year basis. 
On the G&A side, that was up about 30%, but again, a bunch of components there. Technology expense increased year-over-year, and you will still continue to see that going forward. The primary driver there, obviously, is technology infrastructure, primarily the ongoing migration of Aladdin to the cloud, which we're probably about halfway through but we'll be accelerating into next year. 
You're also seeing higher portfolio services costs, which, again, is part of our success story in OCIO. So where you see us winning large outsourced wealth solution mandates, either in Europe or institutional mandates like the BA pension fund or the significant win that we just announced this quarter in APAC and New Zealand, you're going to see higher portfolio of services cost because not all of those mandates are managed in-house. We use third-party advisers. When we use third-party advisers, you're seeing those expenses reflected in that line item of the P&L. It's grossed up on revenues but we also we have to bear the expense. 
And obviously, there's always still some noise that we see year-over-year in our noncore here. We talked about the Citibanamex payment and higher fund launch costs, which again are, in both cases, associated with higher revenue. 
Finally, on the direct fund expense side. I think that is purely variable. That is obviously tied in most part to our growth in our index AUM, which is fundamentally driven by our success in iShares. That number was up roughly 38% year-over-year, but there's always going to be some noise in that number as we try to effectively manage that expense on behalf of the fund shareholders. So in this case, this year, while there are some timing issues, it did reflect some onetime expenses associated with moving indexes from one provider to a next to try and basically get those at lower cost. And when you exclude a little bit of the noise, that number was probably up about 31% year-over-year versus average iShares AUM increase of close to 34%. 
So I would say, yes, there's some expense increase. I would say it's less tied to inflation for us than other players. It's really more tied to continuing to invest for growth. And obviously, if we're able to continue to deliver organic base fee growth well in excess of our 5% target, which we've done for the last 6 quarters in a row to 9% clip, 13% over the last 12 months, we're going to see some elevated expenses to be able to drive that success."

We're having conversations with clients globally where they should be allocating. I do believe you're seeing higher allocation towards equities over the last year across our clients' portfolios. As equities rallied, they did less in terms of rebalancing. The bigger question is how do you allocate across equities. What is the roll-up in emerging markets? 
But I don't think inflation is playing a dominant role in the conversations, even in fixed income where obviously it's very obvious, long-duration assets are going to be the impacted the most. And so those clients in fixed income were worried about their duration risk. It could go down into a low duration product. They could go into various different products with less convexity and less issues. They could go in some type of inflationary protected type of notes, too. That's not going to be that large. 
But the resiliency of our platform really allows us to have that conversation, whether it's in a deflationary world or in an inflationary world. And I do believe the -- if you look at the geographic dispersion of our growth, the conversations worldwide represent these types of conversations, what should we think about inflation; what role should we play; what is the role of alternatives in an inflationary environment; what is the role of equities and across fixed income. So I actually believe it's the volatility of of the global economy is allowing us to have these robust deep conversations. And I don't think there's one global trend going in and out of one product because inflationary fears and some clients don't believe in that. Some people actually believe it's transitory. 
So I mean that's the -- I would look at this -- when there is uncertainty and when we're in a transition period, more clients come to BlackRock than ever before because they're asking those questions. And I think because of the robustness of our platform, whether it's an index-oriented strategies or active strategies across the spectrum, we have the ability to work with them across all economic environments."

Let me give you the context. I think the global capital markets, public institutions are moving very rapidly to adapt more disclosures related to sustainability. More clients, inc",788,"Well, flows in this COVID world that accelerated into sustainable products. Let me give you the context. I think the global capital markets, public institutions are moving very rapidly to adapt more disclosures related to sustainability. More clients, including our hydrocarbon clients, are looking to adapt how to continue to provide hydrocarbons to fit the needs of -- the current needs of our society, but also slowly adapt in a more sustainable platform, too. 
So across the board, we are having very deep and deep conversations. And I must say the conversations we're having that with the hydrocarbon companies and the hydrocarbon, from chemicals to oil, they are more robust than ever. They're deeper, they're broader than any other time. And -- but our flows continue to grow and dominate. We continue to be a dominant leader. Year-to-date, we had about $80 billion of sustainable inflows. We had $32 billion of those inflows in the third quarter. 
When I talked about the shift in finance, we're seeing that. Now specifically on your question related to impact, this is one of the reasons why we wanted to be a partner in breakthrough energy. We want to learn more of the science and the new technologies. This is why we partnered in our decarbonization fund with Temasek. The demand is growing precipitously in terms of clients interested in finding new -- being part of this transition. And so the capital is there. What is not as prevalent or the projects, are the opportunities. 
We are having conversations with universities. We're having conversations with governments across the board on how can we provide capital. And one of the more dynamic conversations we're having with the traditional hydrocarbon companies across the board is how can we partner with them in terms of moving -- helping them move forward on their sustainable strategies, on their decarbonization strategies, on their strategies around sequestering of their own carbons. I mean so many of the big multinational hydrocarbon companies are building new dynamic technology so they can be the leaders in the sequestering of hydrocarbons of carbons at the same time that they may be using that to produce more energy at this time. But these are the types of solutions we're having across the board. 
You've heard the questions with my view is we're not moving fast enough. Yes, I think the movement towards sustainability is very fast and rapid related to public companies. I think regulators worldwide are asking public companies and banks to do more disclosure. My greatest fear, and I spoke about this in my speech 3 months ago, is we're creating a hybrid world, a bifurcated world the pressure on public companies and banks and asset managers are enormous. We're not putting any pressure on private companies. And there was a great story today in one of the newspapers about as hydrocarbon companies divested some of their hydrocarbons, the buyers are private equity firms. Okay. That doesn't change the net zero world, and that's why I'm saying we're never going to get to a net zero world, if we're not moving holistically together public and private. 
And then I spoke about, obviously, in editorial today related about the need to invest in the emerging world. There is huge pools of capital standing by, but there, we are not able to evaluate the first loss piece in so many of the brownfield investing in the emerging world. And it is estimated the emerging world needs $1 trillion a year to become more sustainable. As a backdrop, the emerging world minus China represents 34% of the hydrocarbon output. 
And so if we are going to continue at the pace of $150 billion of investments, when there's a need of $1 trillion, we're fooling ourselves are we going to get to a net zero world. We're going to be fooling ourselves to getting to a net zero world if we're only asking public companies. We are fooling ourselves if we believe by restricting supply with our traditional hydrocarbon companies, that only raises energy costs, which we're witnessing now. And that is creating not a just transition, which I spoke about in my last 2 CEO letters. 
So we have to be vocal. We have to be forceful about it. BlackRock is a leader in this, and we are seeing the flows, and I continue to see this big shift in investor portfolios. As they move away from traditional indexes to more sustainable types of indexes, as they're moving away from different types of strategies and they're moving into these other strategies, we need to accelerate this. We need to accelerate in a way that we're working with our great hydrocarbon companies, not against them."

And we've built a deep relationship with the clients. And I don't believe our 9% growth rate is a onetime thing. I think we continue to be growing our presence in this market. We continue to try to be an innovator, whether it's the LifePath Paycheck or -- which now we LifePath Paycheck about $340 billion. I'm sorry, that's our target date and LifePath Paycheck, our most recent growth. 
So I look -- I think conversations have never been broader, more robust, and we continue to drive these conversations. I believe more and more of the large plans are looking to BlackRock for that type of advice, that type of handholding. And I believe more than ever before, especially in this world of need for more employees, the need to build deeper relationships with our employees, I believe the conversations at every corporation now in how to create better connectivity with their employees is becoming a broader conversation than we've ever seen in the last 20 years. 
I think the companies that have deeper connections, they better -- a better retirement plan, better health care plans, better health care plans are the companies that are driving more consistency with their employees, less higher retention rates. So I truly believe this is going -- this is one of those transitory things that are happening. And I think it's catching a lot of organizations by surprise now, the fluidity of employees moving from one economy to another economy, moving to one business to another business. And I truly believe this refocus on the needs of the employees in retirement is a major component of that refocus is going to be a larger and more dominant theme. 
And I think this is -- when I talk about this, we're in this transition now, I think many corporations are surprised at this. I think COVID and how we work remotely, people -- m any people want to work remotely. They feel differently about their work-life balance. This is all transforming our society in many ways, in a great way, but we're in this transition. And some industries are going to be huge winners in this and some industries are going to be losers of this. 
But most importantly, I think the common thing those companies that are working with their employees with purpose, building a deeper, broader connectivity with their employees, they're retaining their employees with greater regularity, and importantly, they're able to attract the best and the brightest. And we're seeing that more and more. And our conversations about business purpose and stakeholder capitalism, I think it resonates with our corporate clients who have these defined contribution plans, and they're asking us how to create that greater depth of robustness. And then you overlay what we're trying to do related to innovation, I think it really is a compelling story why BlackRock."

But I would direct you towards Page 5 of our supplement. I think, obviously, a lot of things go into the fee rate. And in fact, I'd say that from an organic growth perspective, every month of the third quarter was generally -- was very consistent. So it wasn't like we saw a lot of volatility in terms of our organic growth. But clearly, you do see some differences in the spot rates in terms of markets relative to the average rates. And you'll clearly see there that, as we've talked about in terms of diversion equity beta, we did see an acceleration of in terms of the decline of certain emerging markets as we got to the end of the third quarter. 
And I think you'll see that on the supplement, where some of our higher fee markets in Asia, the emerging markets and commodities in particular, are all down roughly -- somewhere around mid- to high single digits with actually the BlackRock equity index on a spot basis down about 3%. So no question that we did see diversion beta accelerate into the end of the quarter. But again, given some of the other stuff, I think that might have a moderate -- very moderate impact on the fee rate, but I don't think anything significant."

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
BlackRock's proven track record of delivering for stakeholders reflects our ongoing commitment to anticipate change before it happens and continually invest for the long term. Our globally integrated investment and technology platform enables us to construct resilient whole portfolios for clients. We rely on thought leadership, global investment insights and state-of-the-art risk management tools to help clients navigate ever-changing and increasingly volatile market environments. Our approach is resonating more than ever and is reflected in the continued strong momentum we are seeing across our entire platform. 
BlackRock generated total net inflows of $75 billion in the third quarter. $98 billion of long-term net inflows, representing approximately 4% annualized organic asset growth were partially offset by net outflows from lower fee cash and advisory AUM. In addition, strong net inflows from ETFs and our active franchise once again contributed to this quarter's 9% annualized organic base fee growth. 
Over the last 12 months, our differentiated investment management platform, which pairs active and index capabilities across the entire range of traditional and alternative products, has now generated over $450 billion of total net inflows representing 13% organic base fee growth well in excess of our 5% long-term target. 
Third quarter revenue of $5.1 billion increased 16% year-over-year while operating income of $1.9 billion rose 11% and reflected the impact of approximately $96 million of fund launch costs primarily associated with the successful launch of a $2 billion closed-end fund in late September.
Earnings per share of $10.95 was up 19% compared to a year ago, also reflecting significantly higher nonoperating income in the current quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter included $298 million of net investment income primarily driven by noncash gains related to our strategic minority investments in iCapital and Scalable Capital as well as mark-to-market gains in our private equity co-investment portfolio.  
Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24%. We continue to estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2021, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation.  
Third quarter base fees and securities lending revenue of $3.9 billion increased 22% year-over-year reflecting the positive impact of market beta on average AUM and 13% organic base fee growth despite higher discretionary money market fee waivers and strategic pricing investments over the last year. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 5%.  
Our third quarter annualized effective fee rate on a day count equivalent basis increased by 0.2 basis points from the second quarter as the positive impact of strong organic base fee growth driven by our higher fee active businesses, and lower discretionary money market fee waivers more than offset the negative impact of divergent equity beta primarily associated with the accelerating decline in emerging markets during the current quarter.  
During the third quarter, we incurred approximately $130 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers. Lower discretionary yield support waivers in the current quarter were linked to the Fed's technical adjustments to the IOER and RRP in June as well as outflows from U.S. government money market funds during the current quarter. Performance fees of $345 million reflect generally strong performance from our single strategy hedge fund platform over the last year. The decline in year-over-year fees reflected lower revenue from a single hedge fund with an annual performance measurement period that ends in the third quarter and which delivered truly exceptional performance a year ago partially offset by higher revenue from illiquid products.  
Quarterly technology services revenue increased 13% from a year ago. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 16% year-over-year and continued to reflect strong growth from the third quarter of 2020, which was impacted by slower sales and extended contracting in the early months of the pandemic. We remain committed to low to mid-teens growth in ACV over the long term.  
Total expense increased 19% versus the year ago quarter driven primarily by higher G&A, compensation and direct fund expense. G&A expense was up $139 million or 30% year-over-year primarily driven by higher technology and portfolio services expense in the current quarter. Third quarter G&A expense also included $96 million of fund launch costs primarily associated with our first ESG-oriented closed-end fund, the $2 billion BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Trust, and $29 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to the estimated final payment on our successful Citibanamex acquisition in 2018. Recall that we exclude the impact of product launch costs when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin.  
Core G&A expense for the third quarter, which excludes the impact of product launch and transaction-related costs, was up 3% from the second quarter. We have made no changes to the discretionary investment spending plans we have previously outlined and would expect a sequential increase in our fourth quarter core G&A spend to be generally consistent with previous years reflecting seasonal increases in marketing spend, additional costs related to return-to-office planning and ongoing technology costs associated with Aladdin cloud migrations.  
Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $116 million or 8% from a year ago primarily reflecting higher base compensation and higher deferred compensation related to the impact of grants associated with 2020 compensation. Direct fund expense increased 38% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher average index AUM and intangible amortization expense increased $11 million year-over-year due to our Aperio acquisition.  
Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45.8% was down 120 basis points from a year ago as operating leverage was more than offset by the impact of lower performance fees, higher contingent consideration fair value adjustments and higher intangible amortization expense compared to a year ago.  
We're seeing more opportunities to invest for growth than ever before. We reopened the closed-end fund market in 2019 by making it more efficient for investors to access products at NAV. By synthetically seeding these new funds, we've now raised $14 billion in active AUM, representing over $170 million in new revenue. Our strategic minority investments in iCapital and Scalable Capital are reinforcing our tech-for-flow strategy and simultaneously generating very attractive returns for shareholders. And we continue to build our best-in-class ESG capabilities, most recently by acquiring Rhodium's models related to the physical risks associated with climate change; effective use of our balance sheet to seed new products, co-invest alongside clients or makes strategic minority investments, both supports our growth and drives value for our shareholders. And while our capital management strategy remains, first, to invest in our business, we also remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders and repurchased an additional $300 million worth of shares in the third quarter.  
As we discussed at Investor Day, we continue to invest in our highest growth franchises, such as ETFs, private markets and technology, and we are accelerating investments to drive growth in our sustainable traditional active and solutions capabilities. Each of these areas once again delivered strong results in the third quarter.  
Quarterly long-term net inflows of $98 billion were driven by continued momentum in our ETF and active platforms. Our ETFs generated net inflows of $58 billion in the third quarter, positive across each of our product categories, representing 7% annualized organic base fee growth. ETFs attributable to our strategic category drove over 50% of net inflows in the quarter reflecting continued strength in fixed income and sustainable ETFs, Core equity and higher fee precision exposure ETFs saw net inflows of $16 billion and $9 billion, respectively, led by U.S. equity exposures.  
Retail net inflows of $23 billion, representing 11% annualized organic base fee growth, were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and across all major asset classes. Retail multi-asset results included the impact of the previously mentioned $2 billion closed-end fund raised in late September.  
Inflows continue to reflect broad-based strength across our active platform and we remain well-positioned to meet investor needs for risk-adjusted alpha and yield in the current market environment. BlackRock's institutional active net inflows of $26 billion, representing 6% annualized organic base fee growth, were led by $25 billion of multi-asset net inflows. Growth included the impact of a significant outsourced CIO mandate from the Asia Pacific client, continuing our momentum in an important growth area, where we are providing cost-effective whole portfolio solutions to the world's most sophisticated institutional clients.  
We also saw continued demand for our LifePath target date offerings, and Larry will update you about a recent milestone for our new LifePath Paycheck retirement solution. Institutional index net outflows of $8 billion broadly reflected equity net outflows, which were partially offset by fixed income net inflows as clients continue to rebalance portfolios after significant market -- equity market gains were sort to immunize portfolios through LDI strategies. Overall, BlackRock generated approximately $45 billion in quarterly active net inflows across the platform, including our tenth consecutive quarter of positive active equity flows.  
Demand for alternatives also continued with nearly $7 billion of net inflows into liquid and illiquid alternative strategies during the quarter, driven by single-strategy hedge funds, private credit, real assets and private equity solutions. Fundraising momentum remains strong, and we have approximately $29 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees.  
BlackRock's cash management platform experienced net outflows of $12 billion driven primarily by redemptions from U.S. government and offshore sterling prime money market funds in line with the broader U.S. money market fund industry. BlackRock's diverse cash management offerings position us well to serve clients' needs, and you will hear more from Larry about how we are expanding our ESG cash offerings to enhance our competitive positioning even further.  
Finally, third quarter advisory net outflows of $10 billion were primarily linked to the successful planned wind-downs of portfolios managed by our Financial Markets Advisory Group on behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Recall that revenue linked to these assignments is primarily reflected in the advisory and other revenue line item on our income statement.  
BlackRock's continued strong performance reflects our commitment to strategically invest in our business, in anticipation of change and to lead the evolution of the asset management industry. Today, we see even greater opportunity to invest in our employees and our clients and in the communities in which we operate to ensure that we will continue to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I truly hope that all of you are staying healthy and safe. Fortunately, I've been traveling again, and in recent months, to see clients worldwide. It's great to be back in the road.",2078,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I truly hope that all of you are staying healthy and safe. Fortunately, I've been traveling again, and in recent months, to see clients worldwide. It's great to be back in the road. -- meeting face-to-face with our clients, and I found our clients actually more engaged, more interested in our conversations than ever before.  
As investors continue to navigate uncertainty in the markets and in the broader global economic outlook, BlackRock is partnering more closely with our clients to help them achieve long-term -- their long-term goals and helping them seeking new opportunities. BlackRock is providing insights on the global economy, guidance on how to navigate the market volatility and providing solutions for their entire portfolio. Our comprehensive unified investment and technology platform, combined with our steadfast client-centric approach, is enabling us to deliver constantly and consistently strong results for our stakeholders.  
Long-term net inflows of $98 billion in the third quarter represented 9% organic base fee growth, were driven by continued strength in our strategic growth opportunities that we've spoken to in the past. Our consecutive quarters of strong growth are the direct results of these investments that we've made over time to enhance and evolve our business and to be more prepared for the needs of our clients.  
We have now delivered organic base fee growth in excess of our 5% target for 6 consecutive quarters, including 13% growth over the last 12 months. And we also generated 30% year-over-year growth in technology services revenues as more clients are turning to Aladdin to execute on their growth aspirations and to helping them scale their business.  
After our promising global economic restart earlier this year, we saw certain countries and markets take a step back in recent months as they are confronted with the economic -- with virus variants and economic issues. Concerns around slowing economic growth are increasing while policymakers are evaluating the timing and pace of easing, whether it's rate hikes or reduction in bond purchases.  
And with interest rates still at historically low levels, investors need solutions that can earn a real yield and be resilient in a higher inflationary world. Inflationary trends are appearing more than transitory, reflecting structural changes, including a shift from consumerism to job creation, rising wage growth and the energy transition.  
As I said in a speech to the G20 in July, society needs to rapidly invest in innovation to offset inflationary pressures associated with the transition to a net zero economy. We need to make sure that we are pushing just as hard on the demand side as we are on the supply side. Otherwise, we risk supply issues that drive up the cost for consumers, especially for those who can least afford it.  
Against this backdrop, clients are turning to BlackRock more than ever before, and we are using the full breadth of our capabilities to meet all our clients' needs. BlackRock's top-performing active platform continues to outpace the industry, generating $45 billion of net inflows in the quarter and nearly $200 billion over the last 12 months. Momentum in active equities continue, and BlackRock's #1 in year-to-date asset-gathering in the U.S. active equity mutual fund industry, up from #3 in 2020.  
These results reflect our investments over time to incorporate data science, integrate ESG considerations and enhancing portfolio construction capabilities across the entire active business. And we remain committed to continuous innovation so we can deliver strong and durable alpha for our clients over the long term.  
In addition to our traditional active strategies, we're also seeing clients increase portfolio allocation to private markets. As they reach for yield, institutions are turning to BlackRock for private credit, real estate and private equity solutions. And well, we are seeing advisers access private markets through our record -- our recent closed-end fund vehicle, which have up to 25% allocation to alternatives and our accredited investor solutions. In total, we raised about $5 billion of illiquid alternative flows and commitments in the quarter, and we continue to steadily deploy that capital for our clients.  
Portfolio construction and asset allocation decisions are critical in achieving desired returns, and more clients are adopting our ETFs as a building block in their portfolios. We generated $58 billion of ETF net inflows in the third quarter with growth across each of our core strategic and precision product categories, including strong flows in fixed income as clients sought inflation protection and sources of income.  
We crossed $200 billion in ETF inflows year-to-date, exceeding our 2020 full year flows. We are seeing this momentum across the entire ETF industry as more and more investors discover the convenience, the efficiency and the transparency that the ETF vehicle has. We see opportunities well beyond the 30 million people who use our ETFs today and continue to believe in the long-term growth potential for ETFs. And we will remain confident in our ability to deliver strong organic base fee growth and lead the industry.  
In my conversations with clients, I hear about how they are looking to focus on their core business and partner with select investment managers that have the expertise, the technology, the scale to navigate the increasingly complex markets. We see outsourcing of portfolio management through OCIO for institutions and for model portfolios for the wealth managers, both of which are fast-growing areas of the industry. BlackRock is well-positioned to capture this opportunity and partner with our clients across our whole portfolio.  Few asset managers have the scale and the diversity of offerings to do this, and the consolidation we have seen in the industry is a further validation of our business model that we've already built here at BlackRock.  
We are also innovating to expand client options for how they participate in proxy voting decisions. Much like asset allocation and portfolio construction, where some clients now can take an active role, while others outsource these decisions to us. More of our clients are interested in voting on their index holdings. This is another great example of One BlackRock effort to further democratize choice for our clients and is in line with our commitment to provide them with the broadest range of options.  
Client demand for more holistic and flexible technology-driven solutions is also increasing. Technology services grew -- revenues grew by 13% year-over-year as Aladdin's capturing opportunity from industry shifts. And we are leveraging our user provider model to further evolve Aladdin. The combination of Aladdin and eFront has been well-received by clients, and we now have over 2 dozen clients using both across their entire whole portfolios.  
As we've done throughout our history, we continue to invest ahead of our clients' needs and evolve BlackRock to lead in the biggest long-term opportunities of the future. And we are seeing meaningful progress in executing on these opportunities. In sustainability, momentum remained strong, and we generated another $31 billion of net inflows across all regions. Active sustainable net inflows of $7 billion were led by the launch of our ESG capital allocation trust closed-end fund, which Gary mentioned earlier. As ETFs -- in ETFs, iShares is leading sustainable -- is a leading sustainable provider, capturing nearly 50% of the industry category inflows year-to-date. In Europe, almost half of all industry flows are now going into sustainable ETFs, up from less than 10% just 3 years ago.  
Clients also want impact-oriented strategies that seek to deliver a targeted environmental or social outcome. We recently repurposed one of our money market funds to seek positive social outcomes by supporting a diverse trading ecosystem. BlackRock will also be contributing 5% of our management fees, net revenues from the funds to support students at historically black colleges and universities and predominantly black institutions. This fund has already grown more than 40% -- 20% to $4.5 billion since its conversion in July, and we are proud to work together with our clients to help make a positive impact on the futures of many diverse students, on the futures of many diverse business owners and in their own communities.  
BlackRock is also supporting clean energy solutions that change the demand curve for hydrocarbons, which is actually accelerating today in driving energy prices higher. The gap in cost between clean energy technologies and those that will emit greater amounts of greenhouse gases is still very large for most things, which is why BlackRock is supporting a range of initiatives to help bring down the green premium of clean energy.  
Building on our partnership with Temasek earlier this year to advance a decarbonization solution, the BlackRock Foundation announced last month, a $100 million grant to breakthrough energy catalyst program. This grant will help speed the development and commercialization of clean energy technologies. And BlackRock will provide our investment expertise as the program deploys its financing around the world.  
We have a long history of innovating to help millions of people worldwide improve retirement readiness. And today, we are the largest investment-only defined contribution provider in the industry with over $1 trillion of assets under management on behalf of over 7,200 defined contribution plans -- excuse me, 72,000 defined contribution plans. Our target [ aid ] franchise, LifePath, has seen $23 billion of net inflows so far this year representing a 9% organic growth rate far in excess and broader in the target date industry.  
And we continue to innovate ahead of the future needs of our clients. We recently announced a significant milestone in our retirement income solution. LifePath Paycheck. 5 large plan sponsors, whose plan together represents about $7.5 billion in target date investments, have elected to work with BlackRock to implement our LifePath Paycheck solution as a default investment option in their investment retirement plans, subject to necessary approvals and conditions. We remain committed to working alongside our clients and partners to help more people address the challenges of spending and income in retirement.  
We believe that globally integrated financial markets provide people, companies and governments with better and more efficient access to capital that supports economic growth around the world. This conviction drives our long-term strategy in China, and it has in every community in every country where we operate. BlackRock's clients have benefited from our focus on the long term, and we will bring this perspective to help global clients invest in China and, importantly, to deliver investment solutions to Chinese investors.  
After receiving our FMC and WMC license earlier this year, we launched our first 2 products in the third quarter, raising over $1 billion in 2 weeks for more than 110,000 investors. This milestone demonstrates the value proposition of BlackRock's platform and the strength of our partnerships. It also highlights the start of BlackRock's living its purpose in China by helping more people secure in China a better future and investing in the long-term and retiring, hopefully, in dignity.  
Just as we continue to evolve our business to meet client needs, we also evolve our entire organization. A key driver of BlackRock success over the years has been our focus and deliberate talent processes on delivering leaders with a broad range of expertise, a deep commitment to the firm in a One BlackRock mindset. 
This commitment to the evolution also extends to our Board of Directors. We recently elected 2 new directors to our Board: Beth Ford, President and CEO of Land of the Lake; and Kristin Peck, CEO of Zoetis. Beth and Kristin are recognized leaders in their respective industries, and they bring a wide range of valuable perspectives and experiences that will help BlackRock and the Board navigate our future on behalf of all our shareholders. 
Looking ahead, I am confident the investments we are making today will enable us to capture greater opportunities and to deliver industry-leading growth in the years to come. More immediately, I'm very excited to welcome our colleagues back to BlackRock's offices in certain parts of the world where we begin our future work pilot. It's our culture which can't be built or maintained remotely over the long term. That ensures we can never forget who we are, who we serve. It also helps us in our markets, in our industry and, most importantly, helps us continue to evolve and experience the constant change of the world. Having togetherness and connection with all our employees is vital for our culture and vital for serving the needs of our clients. With that, let's open it up for questions."

And our goal has been to access the retail area for alternatives by keeping our promises over a long period of time on performance. 
So to start with the growth in retail alternatives is certainly compelling as part of our strategy to serve advisers' whole portfolios. And what we chose to do is bring a diversified product lineup to the retail alternative investor. So our job is to bring the appropriate wrappers for those products that provide the solutions to help reshape their portfolio at a period of time when rates and returns have been very low. And what we've seen them do is move from 1% to 2% of their portfolio to allocations up to 20%. 
So year-to-date, just in that sector, we've raised over $24 billion of net inflows, and that's at approximately 85 basis point average fee rate across what we'll call our retail liquid alternatives and credit vehicles, and our public-private closed-end fund offerings. So our recent launch of alternatives portfolio analytics for financial advisers on the web-based BlackRock Advisor Center and the continued product expansion is going to help us grow with those clients. And in the recent years, as we expanded our retail alternatives to include private credit and private equity, pre-IPO access to growth equity through closed-end funds, and we're working to expand our retail alternatives offerings now across real assets, sustainable and co-investment opportunities. 
So just in the closed-end funds alone, we provide a wrapper that will enable us to provide up to $3 billion and alternatives to them. And just in a summary form, in total, we manage about $180 billion across liquid and illiquid alts, $29 billion right now in dry powder to invest and deploy, approximately $210 million of future annual base fees. And including liquid and liquid credit, our platform is now over $310 billion. We're the top 5 manager in that. And we've built out alternatives platforms and raised another $100 billion of gross capital over the last 5 years, and we expect to raise $100 billion more in the next 3 years. So just for September year-to-date, we have raised $25 billion of gross capital and deployed $10 billion and because there is some expectation that rates can rise, still, these are longer-term investments that have enough spread in it, that I believe that the demand is going to continue for quite a long period of time. And I think Larry's rate scenario, which you said in the beginning, as rates low for longer, will only enhance the ability for people to want more alternatives."

So we're obviously -- we have seen some expense growth, which I think is expected in the context of the outsized organic base fee growth that we're delivering on the top line. For the third quarter, our margin obviously was down about",754,"Alex, this is Gary. So we're obviously -- we have seen some expense growth, which I think is expected in the context of the outsized organic base fee growth that we're delivering on the top line. For the third quarter, our margin obviously was down about 120 basis points versus a year ago. And I'd say there are a couple of things there that kind of clouded what would have been some operating leverage in the business. 
Really 3 things in particular. One was lower performance fees by year-over-year. If you recall, we had this discussion last year that performance fees in general hit the P&L at a much higher marginal -- margin than the rest of the business because there's only really compensation associated with it and no other operating costs in the business. And so when we see performance fees decline as they did year-over-year, that has an impact on margin. 
Secondly, we had higher contingent consideration fair value adjustments or noncore expense this quarter, which was related to the Citibanamex final payment, and we had higher intangible amortization. So if you look at those 3 things, those 3 things really more than offset our margin on a year-over-year basis, where we would have seen some operating leverage improvement. 
In terms of just looking at those individual costs. I mean, when you look at comp, comp is up about 8% year-over-year, Again, that was highly driven by base salaries but not just the midyear that you saw. Remember, comparing it to a year ago, we'll have normal base salary increases at the beginning of the year. We have the midyear. Head count is a little higher. We obviously have a period this year versus where we didn't have it last year. And FX has basically increased the dollar cost of some of that compensation also. So that's really the main driver with the base salary. But the midyear salary increase really didn't have that much to do on a year-over-year basis. 
On the G&A side, that was up about 30%, but again, a bunch of components there. Technology expense increased year-over-year, and you will still continue to see that going forward. The primary driver there, obviously, is technology infrastructure, primarily the ongoing migration of Aladdin to the cloud, which we're probably about halfway through but we'll be accelerating into next year. 
You're also seeing higher portfolio services costs, which, again, is part of our success story in OCIO. So where you see us winning large outsourced wealth solution mandates, either in Europe or institutional mandates like the BA Pension Fund or the significant win that we just announced this quarter in APAC and New Zealand. You're going to see higher portfolio of services cost because not all of those mandates are managed in-house. We use third-party advisers. When we use third-party advisers, you're seeing those expenses reflected in that line item of the P&L. It's grossed up on revenues but we also we have to bear the expense. 
And obviously, there's always still some noise that we see year-over-year in our noncore here. We talked about the Citibanamex payment and higher fund launch costs, which again are, in both cases, associated with higher revenue. Finally, on the direct fund expense side. I think that is purely variable. That is obviously tied in most part to our growth in our index AUM, which is fundamentally driven by our success in iShares. That number was up roughly 38% year-over-year, but there's always going to be some noise in that number as we try to effectively manage that expense on behalf of the fund shareholders. 
So in this case, this year, while there are some timing issues, it did reflect some onetime expenses associated with moving indexes from one provider to a next to try and basically get those at lower cost. And when you exclude a little bit of the noise, that number was probably up about 31% year-over-year versus average iShares AUM increase of close to 34%. 
So I would say, yes, there's some expense increase. I would say it's less tied to inflation for us than other players. It's really more tied to continuing to invest for growth. And obviously, if we're able to continue to deliver organic base fee growth, well in excess of our 5% target, which we've done for the last 6 quarters in a row to 9% clip, 13% over the last 12 months, we're going to see some elevated expenses to be able to drive that success."

I would just clearly tell you that our platform is large. It's diverse. We're having conversations with clients globally where they should be allocating. I do believe you're seeing higher allocation",363,"And on the products in a more inflationary environment. I would just clearly tell you that our platform is large. It's diverse. We're having conversations with clients globally where they should be allocating. I do believe you're seeing higher allocation towards equities over the last year across our clients' portfolios. As equities rallied, they did less in terms of rebalancing. The bigger question is how do you allocate across equities. What is the roll-up in emerging markets? 
But I don't think inflation is playing a dominant role in the conversations, even in fixed income where obviously it's very obvious, long-duration assets are going to be the impacted the most. And so those clients in fixed income were worried about their duration risk. It could go down into a low duration product. They could go into various different products with less convexity and less issues. They could go in some type of inflationary protected type of notes, too. That's not going to be that large. 
But the resiliency of our platform really allows us to have that conversation, whether it's in a deflationary world or in an inflationary world. And I do believe the -- if you look at the geographic dispersion of our growth, the conversations worldwide represent these types of conversations, what should we think about inflation; what role should we play; what is the role of alternatives in an inflationary environment; what is the role of equities and across fixed income. So I actually believe it's the volatility of the global economy is allowing us to have these robust deep conversations. And I don't think there's one global trend going in and out of one product because inflationary fears and some clients don't believe in that. Some people actually believe it's transitory. 
So I mean that's the -- I would look at this -- when there is uncertainty and when we're in a transition period, more clients come to BlackRock than ever before because they're asking those questions. And I think because of the robustness of our platform, whether it's an index-oriented strategies or active strategies across the spectrum, we have the ability to work with them across all economic environments."

Maybe if you can talk about how you think the demand and the capacity for BlackRock to offer impact fund products, more impact fund products, you already have the carbon readiness and the Temasek JV going forward. And is that going to be -- should we be thinking of that as a pretty strong organic growth path going forward?"

Let me give you the context. I think the global capital markets, public institutions are moving very rapidly to adapt more disclosures related to sustainability. More clients, inc",785,"Well, flows in this COVID world that accelerated into sustainable products. Let me give you the context. I think the global capital markets, public institutions are moving very rapidly to adapt more disclosures related to sustainability. More clients, including our hydrocarbon clients, are looking to adapt how to continue to provide hydrocarbons to fit the needs of -- the current needs of our society, but also slowly adapt in a more sustainable platform, too. 
So across the board, we are having very deep and deep conversations. And I must say the conversations we're having that with the hydrocarbon companies and the hydrocarbon, from chemicals to oil, they are more robust than ever. They're deeper, they're broader than any other time. And -- but our flows continue to grow and dominate. We continue to be a dominant leader. Year-to-date, we had about $80 billion of sustainable inflows. We had $32 billion of those inflows in the third quarter. 
When I talked about the shift in finance, we're seeing that. Now specifically on your question related to impact, this is one of the reasons why we wanted to be a partner in breakthrough energy. We want to learn more of the science and the new technologies. This is why we partnered in our decarbonization fund with Temasek. The demand is growing precipitously in terms of clients interested in finding new -- be part of this transition. And so the capital is there. What is not as prevalent or the projects, are the opportunities. 
We are having conversations with universities. We're having conversations with governments across the board on how can we provide capital. And one of the more dynamic conversations we're having with the traditional hydrocarbon companies across the board is, how can we partner with them in terms of moving -- helping them move forward on their sustainable strategies, on their decarbonization strategies, on their strategies around sequestering of their own carbons? 
I mean so many of the big multinational hydrocarbon companies are building new dynamic technology so they can be the leaders in the sequestering of hydrocarbons of carbons at the same time that they may be using that to produce more energy at this time. But these are the types of solutions we're having across the board. 
You've heard the questions with my view is we're not moving fast enough. Yes, I think the movement towards sustainability is very fast and rapid related to public companies. I think regulators worldwide are asking public companies and banks to do more disclosure. My greatest fear, and I spoke about this in my Venice speech 3 months ago, is we're creating a hybrid world, a bifurcated world the pressure on public companies and banks and asset managers are enormous. 
We're not putting any pressure on private companies. And there was a great story today in one of the newspapers about as hydrocarbon companies divested some of their hydrocarbons, the buyers are private equity firms. Okay. That doesn't change the net-zero world, and that's why I'm saying we're never going to get to a net-zero world, if we're not moving holistically together public and private. 
And then I spoke about, obviously, in editorial today related about the need to invest in the emerging world. There is huge pools of capital standing by, but there, we are not able to evaluate the first loss piece in so many of the brownfield investing in the emerging world. And it is estimated the emerging world needs $1 trillion a year to become more sustainable. As a backdrop, the emerging world minus China represents 34% of the hydrocarbon output. 
And so if we are going to continue at the pace of $150 billion of investments, when there's a need of $1 trillion, we're fooling ourselves are we going to get to a net-zero world. We're going to be fooling ourselves to getting to a net-zero world if we're only asking public companies. We are fooling ourselves if we believe by restricting supply with our traditional hydrocarbon companies, that only raises energy costs, which we're witnessing now. And that is creating not a just transition, which I spoke about in my last 2 CEO letters. 
So we have to be vocal. We have to be forceful about it. BlackRock is a leader in this, and we are seeing the flows, and I continue to see this big shift in investor portfolios. As they move away from traditional indexes to more sustainable types of indexes, as they're moving away from different types of strategies and they're moving into these other strategies, we need to accelerate this. We need to accelerate in a way that we're working with our great hydrocarbon companies, not against them."

We have the scale of products, we have the performance, we have the wrappers. So honestly, it is the focus. A significant portion of all of BlackRock's assets are dedicated to retirement. This is what we do. And when we dovetail that into the analytics that we could provide, we really can fulfill the entire gamut of retirement. So it's product, performance and technology and focus on what we think is the most important business that there is in the world is keeping our promises to clients so they can retire in dignity."

And we've built a deep relationship with the clients. And I don't believe our 9% growth rate is a onetime thing. I think we continue to be growing our presence in this market. We continue to try to be an innovator, whether it's the LifePath Paycheck or -- which now we LifePath Paycheck about $340 billion. I'm sorry, that's our target date and LifePath Paycheck, our most recent growth. 
So I look -- I think conversations have never been broader, more robust, and we continue to drive these conversations. I believe more and more of the large plans are looking to BlackRock for that type of advice, that type of handholding. And I believe more than ever before, especially in this world of need for more employees, the need to build deeper relationships with our employees, I believe the conversations at every corporation now, in how to create better connectivity with their employees, is becoming a broader conversation than we've ever seen in the last 20 years. 
I think the companies that have deeper connections, they better -- a better retirement plan, better health care plans, better health care plans are the companies that are driving more consistency with their employees, less higher retention rates. So I truly believe this is going -- this is one of those transitory things that are happening. And I think it's catching a lot of organizations by surprise now, the fluidity of employees moving from one economy to another economy, moving to one business to another business. And I truly believe this refocus on the needs of the employees in retirement is a major component of that refocus, is going to be a larger and more dominant theme. 
And I think this is -- when I talk about this, we're in this transition now, I think many corporations are surprised at this. I think COVID and how we work remotely, people feel -- many people want to work remotely. They feel differently about their work-life balance. This is all transforming our society in many ways, in a great way, but we're in this transition. And some industries are going to be huge winners in this and some industries are going to be losers of this. 
But most importantly, I think the common thing, those companies that are working with their employees with purpose, building a deeper, broader connectivity with their employees, they're retaining their employees with greater regularity, and importantly, they're able to attract the best and the brightest. And we're seeing that more and more. And our conversations about business purpose and stakeholder capitalism, I think it resonates with our corporate clients who have these defined contribution plans, and they're asking us how to create that greater depth of robustness. And then you overlay what we're trying to do related to innovation. I think it really is a compelling story why BlackRock."

I'll leave that to you guys. But I will say a couple of things on that. Obviously, you'll see that the spot rate entering the fourth quarter was moderately lower but not a big deal in average assets for the third quarter. So I think we're probably about the same. 
But I would direct you towards Page 5 of our supplement. I think, obviously, a lot of things go into the fee rate. And in fact, I'd say that from an organic growth perspective, every month of the third quarter was generally -- was very consistent. So it wasn't like we saw a lot of volatility in terms of our organic growth. But clearly, you do see some differences in the spot rates in terms of markets relative to the average rates. And you'll clearly see there that, as we've talked about in terms of diversion equity beta, we did see an acceleration of in terms of the decline of certain emerging markets as we got to the end of the third quarter. 
And I think you'll see that on the supplement, where some of our higher fee markets in Asia, the emerging markets and commodities in particular, are all down roughly -- somewhere around mid- to high single digits, with actually the BlackRock equity index on a spot basis down about 3%. So no question that we did see diversion beta accelerate into the end of the quarter. But again, given some of the other stuff, I think that might have a moderate -- very moderate impact on the fee rate, but I don't think anything significant."

We're seeing -- the insurance portfolios have always had an allocation to what we're all tolling alternatives. But as the alternative packages have become much more complicated, certainly, the technology and the management of those is not really caught up.

And of course, that's a very, very big part of our platform. 
And we are being called in more and more to be a partner with insurance companies on their portfolio overall. And it's a huge growth area for us with Aladdin because the technology has not kept place. So we're seeing a lot of interest from the insurance companies, and it spans the growth from private credit, especially real estate and infrastructure. And those are 3 areas that we've spent a lot of time developing. And certainly, in Aladdin, our ability there is second to none. So it's become a bigger opportunity for us in the last year or so."
