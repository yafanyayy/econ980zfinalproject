We hope all of you joining us today as well as your families are safe and healthy. Let me start by saying that 2020 was another outstanding year for Duke Realty. Even amidst the global pandemic and a major U.S.",375,"Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. We hope all of you joining us today as well as your families are safe and healthy. 
Let me start by saying that 2020 was another outstanding year for Duke Realty. Even amidst the global pandemic and a major U.S. recession, we exceeded all of our 2020 goals, including our original pre-pandemic operating and financial guidance metrics. We also capped off the year with fourth quarter leasing volume being the strongest quarter of the year. And just after quarter end, executed a significant debt transaction to bolster our balance sheet, which sets us up for a great start to 2021. 
Let me recap the highlights of our outstanding year. When the pandemic hit, we engaged our business continuity plan to ensure the health and safety of our employees, our customers and our construction work sites. This was executed extremely well, and I'm happy to [ resort ] cases at Duke Realty were very minimal. 
We signed nearly 21 million square feet of leases. We maintained the occupancy of our stabilized portfolio between 97% and 98% throughout the year. And our total portfolio, which includes our underdevelopment pipeline, ended the year at 96% leased, the highest level we've ever achieved. 
We renewed 70% of our leases, or 83% when including immediate backfills, and attained 29% GAAP rent growth and 14% cash rent growth on second-generation leases throughout the year. We grew same-property NOI on a cash basis of 5%, which included -- which exceeded our revised guidance expectations. We commenced $795 million in new developments that were 62% pre-leased, 67% of which were in coastal Tier 1 markets. 
We placed $730 million of developments in service that are now 94% leased. We completed $322 million of property dispositions and $411 million of property acquisitions. We raised [ $675 million ] of debt at an average at a weighted average term of 20 years and an average coupon of 2.4%. We  increased our annual common dividend by 9.1%. And finally, we've continued to run our company in the most responsible manner with our ESG culture and numerous ESG achievements. 
Now let me turn it over to Steve Schnur to cover our operations for the quarter and touch on some market fundamentals."
267906,700657778,2184488,"Duke Realty Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Duke Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. I'll first touch on overall market fundamentals. The fourth quarter demand was exceptional in the logistics sector with 104 million square feet of absorption, which was the highest on record. Demand exceeded supply for the quarter by about 30",802,"Thanks, Jim. I'll first touch on overall market fundamentals. The fourth quarter demand was exceptional in the logistics sector with 104 million square feet of absorption, which was the highest on record. Demand exceeded supply for the quarter by about 30 million square feet, which nudged national vacancy rates down to 4.6%, which is still roughly about 200 basis points below long-term historical averages. 
For the full year, demand was 225 million square feet compared to a supply number of 265 million square feet. Even when adjusting for the significant amount of activity we saw from Amazon this year, the full year 2020 net absorption was still 12% higher than 2019. For transactions larger than 100,000 square feet, e-commerce users comprised 22% of total demand and 3PLs about 26%. Comparatively, e-commerce demand in our own portfolio represented about 20% of our total leasing square footage volume for the year. This segment of the demand market, users over 100,000 square feet, continues to be the most active subset. To that end, we signed 29 deals in the fourth quarter, over 100,000 square feet in our portfolio. 
Asking rental rates rose again in the fourth quarter, up 8.3% over this time last year. This rate of growth is about 100 basis points higher than the 5-year historical average of 7.1%. We see this rent trend continuing in 2021 with macro rent growth levels in the mid-single digits. 
In our own portfolio, we had our strongest quarter of the year with 9.7 square feet of leases executed, which is our second highest quarter ever in our company's nearly 50-year history. Our average transaction size was 104,000 square feet. In addition, the average lease term signed during the quarter was 7.5 years. 
On the rent collection side, we averaged 99.9% for the fourth quarter and 99.9% for the full year, arguably best in class in the entire REIT sector. These figures include a very small amount of deferral agreements and credit enhancement collections as detailed in the supplemental package. 
Looking forward, our overall tenant credit quality is very strong. We do have a handful of tenants and industries most acutely impacted by COVID that earn financial difficulty, which Mark will touch on in a moment as to their minor impact on our 2021 financial numbers. We do have a strong prospect list of backfills for most of these spaces, so the longer-term impact in this situation, we believe, will be positive. 
At quarter end, our stabilized in-service portfolio was 98.1%. The lease activity for the quarter, combined with the strong fundamentals I touched on, led to another great quarter of rent growth of 13% cash and 27% GAAP. We also had a very strong quarter in first-generation leasing. 
In our speculative developments under construction, we executed 2 significant leases in the quarter. The first was a 622,000 square foot lease in Northern New Jersey to a leading national home furnishings retailer looking to expand its supply chain network for inventory redundancy, often referred to as safety stock or referred to as increased inventory levels, for them to take 100% of the facility, 100% of the space in that facility. 
The second notable lease transaction in the spec project was a 290,000 square-foot lease we signed in the South Bay submarket of Southern California. This lease was to a major national beverage distributor to take 100% of the space as well. It's important to note both these buildings are still under construction and not scheduled to be completed until the second and third quarters of this year. 
Turning to development. We had a tremendous quarter of starts, breaking ground on 8 projects totaling $420 million in cost and 69% pre-leased. 7 of these new developments were part of our detailed press release that we issued on December 7. And then later in December, we started another project for about 146,000 square feet in the Mid County submarket of Southern California. In total, nearly 70% of our fourth quarter development starts were in coastal Tier 1 markets, and 5 of our 8 projects were redevelopments of existing land and site structures. 
Our development pipeline at year-end totaled $1.1 billion, with 80% of this allocated to coastal Tier 1 markets. This is a larger pipeline than we had a year ago, and the allocation to coastal tier markets is also higher than a year ago. The pipeline is 67% pre-leased and we expect to generate margins in the 30% to 40% range. 
Looking forward, our prospect list for new starts in 2021 is very strong. And our land balance at year-end totaled $297 million with nearly 80% of this allocated to coastal Tier 1 markets, setting us up very well for future growth. 
I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover acquisitions and dispositions for the quarter."

We had a very active quarter on both dispositions and acquisitions. Consistent with our strategy to increase our exposure to coastal Tier 1 markets, we sold $276 million of assets in the fourth quarter, comprised of 2 facilities in the far Northwest submarket of Indianapolis, 1 in the far Northeast south market of Atlanta, 1 facility in the Western portion of the Lehigh Valley and an asset leased to Amazon and Houston. In turn, we used these proceeds to acquire 2 assets in Southern California and a portfolio in Seattle for $305 million, that, in aggregate, are 74% leased with an expected initial stabilized yield in the mid-4s and long-term IRRs -- unlevered IRRs in the mid-6s. The Seattle portfolio encompasses 3 buildings that are 69% leased in aggregate, located in the DuPont submarket and adjacent to an existing facility we developed several years ago. 
For the full year, our capital recycling encompassed $322 million of asset sales and $423 million of acquisitions. Combined with the development previously mentioned by Steve, this activity moves our coastal Tier 1 exposure to 41% of GAV and our overall Tier 1 exposure to 67%. We expect this recycling to continue in 2021 with dispositions primarily from the monetization of some of our Amazon assets, allowing us to manage our [ tenant ] exposure as well as some Midwestern assets to further refine our geography. 
I'll now turn it over to Mark to cover earnings results and balance sheet activities."

I am pleased to report that core FFO for the quarter was $0.41 per share compared to core FFO of $0.40 per share in the third quarter and represented a 7.9% increase over the $0.38 per share reported for the fourth",673,"Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that core FFO for the quarter was $0.41 per share compared to core FFO of $0.40 per share in the third quarter and represented a 7.9% increase over the $0.38 per share reported for the fourth quarter of 2019. Core FFO was $1.52 per share for the full year 2020 compared to $1.44 per share for 2019, which represents a 5.6% annual growth rate. 
FFO as defined by NAREIT was $1.40 per share for the full year 2020, which is lower than the core FFO due mainly to debt extinguishment charges. We grew AFFO by 6.2% on a share adjusted basis compared to 2019. 
Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the 3 months and 12 months ended December 31, 2020, was 3.3% and 5.0%, respectively. Same-property growth for the quarter was driven by continued strong rent growth and a 20 basis point increase in average commencement occupancy within our same-property portfolio from the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Net operating income from the non-same-store properties was 17.3% of total net operating income for the quarter. Same-property NOI growth on a GAAP basis was 3.1% for the fourth quarter and 2.8% for the full year 2020. Bad debt expense for the year was primarily related to noncash straight-line reserves, which negatively impacted GAAP same-property NOI. 
We finished 2020 with $295 million outstanding on our unsecured line of credit, which we refinanced early this month with a $450 million 1.75% 10-year green bond issuance, which will bear interest an effective rate of 1.83%. The pricing on this transaction was very attractive with our effective rate incorporating a 70 basis point spread over treasury rates, which at the time was the lowest credit spread ever on a 10-year REIT bond offering. 
We intend to continue a robust pace of growth in 2021, which we anticipate to fund with a combination of asset dispositions, internally generated cash flow, short-term use of our line of credit and a potential unsecured bond issuance later in the year. Also, if additional growth opportunities arise, it's possible we issue a modest amount of equity through the ATM on an opportunistic basis. 
From a macro outlook perspective, we expect the 2021 environment to be overall relatively strong and improving each quarter in light of the expected federal stimulus and vaccinations. Supply and demand are relatively in balance. The overall fundamentals picture is quite supportive of continued market rent growth and thus a positive setup to pricing power and new development starts. 
With this as a backdrop, yesterday, we announced a range for 2021 core FFO per share of $1.62 to $1.68 per share with the midpoint of $1.65, representing an 8.6% increase over 2020. We also announced growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis to a range between 5.8% and 10.1% with the midpoint at 8.0%. Our average in-service portfolio occupancy range is expected to be 95.7% to 97.7%. Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis is projected in the range of 3.6% to 4.4%. Our guidance for same-property NOI includes the negative impact from a few tenants Steve mentioned that we expect to terminate in early 2021. 
We expect proceeds from building dispositions in the range of $500 million to $700 million, which we will use to fund our highly accretive development pipeline. Acquisitions are projected in the range of $200 million to $400 million with a continued focus on infill coastal markets and facilities with a repositioning or lease-up potential. Development starts are projected in the range of $700 million to $900 million with a continuing target to maintain the pipeline at a healthy level of pre-leasing. Our pipeline of build-to-suit prospects continues to remain robust. And the $800 million midpoint of our 2021 guidance is consistent with our actual development starts for 2020. 
More specific assumptions and components of our guidance are available in the 2021 range of estimates document on the Investor Relations website. Now I'll turn it back over to Jim for some final comments."

As we look ahead into 2021, the demand drivers remain exceptionally strong. Supply and demand remain in balance, and we anticipate another year of strong results. This is evidenced on our 2021 guidance of $700 million to $900 million of expected new development starts, strong occupancy expected to remain elevated and most of all, evident with our expected growth in FFO per share and AFFO of 8.6% and 8% in the midpoints, respectively. 
This level of growth is what we believe should be achievable on a consistent basis going forward. Our performance is a result of a decade of portfolio repositioning with a steadfast focus on quality, investing in selective submarkets and strengthening our balance sheet. We will continue to see the added value created by our dominant development platform, and we believe we can continue this level of growth well into the future. 
Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank all of my colleagues at Duke Realty for all their hard work and dedication that has allowed us to achieve the level of success that we have.

We prefer not to go through the eviction process and work to find a backfill and work out on a arrangement with the tenant to get out of the space.

I think the consensus is whatever gets done, whether it's through budget reconciliation or it gets through both houses, is probably going to take effect in 2022. So we'll have a little bit more clarity. 
I think any conservatism that is baked into our budget for 2021 is just is us being conservative given where we are in the economic recovery and where we are in the pandemic. We all had great expectations in the pandemic that so many more of us would be vaccinated by this time and things would be back to normal sometime in the second quarter. And I think expectation is it's going to drag on a little bit longer. And what last year's last round of stimulus is going to do and is there going to be another round of stimulus. 
So I think the prudent course of action was to bake a little conservatism in there.

Because in the 4% guidance for this year, we've got 30 basis points of bad debt in that number. Our run rate has been well less than 10 basis points So we got a little bit more bad debt baked in the number for some of these tenants, like we talked about.

So that 2.5% continues to grow. And then we're very bullish, like Jim said, on all those factors that will continue to drive rent growth close to where we've been. And if you think about it, like Nick said, we're at 40% of our portfolio right now are in these coastal Tier 1 markets, yes, that was about 20% of our role.

I don't have the exact numbers for each of the categories you talk about. But I would tell you that it's really not cap rate driven. The reason the cap rates came down was just moving properties out of the pipeline, put them in service and moving new projects into the construction, and most of the construction we're doing now are in the coastal Tier 1 markets that have lower cap rates. So it's not really too much related to a methodology change in the cap rate. It's just a mix. 
And then the overall reason that the margins are coming down, you mentioned it's rental rates. Rates are better than we expected, and we're leasing our assets up quicker than our original underwriting. So when we start a project, we always underwrite 12 months of downtime, and that's baked into our basis, the carry cost for that 12 months. And then we're typically, not always, but a lot of these projects that are in there, are getting leased before they even go in service. So you take a full year of carry cost out of that equation and that drives your margin up pretty quickly. So those are the 2 main drivers."

As you heard us talk about, our strategy is really submarket based. So we tend not to be too concerned about macro numbers. We've talked about some of the soft markets around the country and how little exposure we have in them. So that would be first and foremost. And I think beyond that, some of the issues that we have been dealing with, trade tensions that would affect imports and exports, a subsector of that could be trade tensions or tariffs that affect some of the construction materials, create shortages or spikes in prices.

And then the other part of it is most likely to do with some -- the spec space that have been coming online and/or some spec space in some of these acquisitions. So the -- if you look at all the components, the decrease is actually a little bit higher than the 50 basis points, but then we're very bullish on demand to backfill a lot of that space, like I said. So that will get you back up. But part of the problem is, I think you're comparing an end of the year number to an average guidance number for the next year."

The other one is the uncertainty about tax changes. And whether there's a major overhaul of the tax code or there's some smaller things done through a budget reconciliation. The other thing that obviously would be a concern to us is the elimination or further changes to 10 31 tax 3 exchanges. And we monitor that situation, the real estate roundtable and NAREIT consistently does a pretty good job working with the administration in both houses of what the impact would that would be, and that's survived for many, many years.

That's actually conversations and a process that has been going on for virtually almost a year now, 10 months, which is the conversation with any of our clients that are in economic distress. And we have very open and candid conversations. We go over all of the financials, and we decide if we think it's worthy of us giving them a short-term rent deferral to help them through this crisis because we think underlying they have a good solid foundation of a business. And as we reported, I think, in the second quarter last year, we did 85-ish rent deferral agreements with tenants across the country. I think our people have done an outstanding job in terms of making the decisions they did with the people they get because we're getting complete repayment on all those deferrals. We've had a few people come back to us and say, we thought 6 months was going to be enough, and we need a little bit more time, and we're working through that process again. But I don't know if anybody that's in the industries that you outlined that can't pay today that we think is going to come back even stronger.

Let me start by saying that 2020 was another outstanding year for Duke Realty. Even amidst the global pandemic and a major U.S. recession, we exceeded all of our 2020 goals, including our original prepandemic operating and financial guidance metrics. We also capped off the year with fourth quarter leasing volume being the strongest quarter of the year, and just after quarter end, executed a significant debt transaction to bolster our balance sheet, which sets us up for a great start to 2021.  
Let me recap the highlights of our outstanding year. When the pandemic hit, we engaged our business continuity plan to ensure the health and safety of our employees, our customers and our construction work sites. This was executed extremely well, and I'm happy to resort cases at Duke Realty were very minimal.  
We signed nearly 21 million square feet of leases. We maintained the occupancy of our stabilized portfolio between 97% and 98% throughout the year. And our total portfolio, which includes our underdevelopment pipeline, ended the year at 96% leased, the highest level we've ever achieved.  
We renewed 70% of our leases, or 83% when including immediate backfills, and attained 29% GAAP rent growth and 14% cash rent growth on second-generation leases throughout the year. We grew same-property NOI on a cash basis of 5%, which included -- which exceeded our revised guidance expectations. We commenced $795 million in new developments that were 62% preleased, 67% of which were in coastal Tier 1 markets.  
We placed $730 million of developments in service that are now 94% leased. We completed $322 million of property dispositions and $411 million of property acquisitions. We raised $670 million of debt at an average -- at a weighted average term of 20 years and an average coupon of 2.4%. We increased our annual common dividend by 9.1%. And finally, we've continued to run our company in the most responsible manner with our ESG culture and numerous ESG achievements.  
Now let me turn it over to Steve Schnur to cover our operations for the quarter and touch on some market fundamentals."
267906,700657778,2184781,"Duke Realty Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Duke Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. I'll first touch on overall market fundamentals. The fourth quarter demand was exceptional in the logistics sector with 104 million square feet of absorption, which was the highest on record. Demand exceeded supply for the quarter by about 30",805,"Thanks, Jim. I'll first touch on overall market fundamentals. The fourth quarter demand was exceptional in the logistics sector with 104 million square feet of absorption, which was the highest on record. Demand exceeded supply for the quarter by about 30 million square feet, which nudged national vacancy rates down to 4.6%, which is still roughly about 200 basis points below long-term historical averages. For the full year, demand was 225 million square feet compared to a supply number of 265 million square feet. 
Even when adjusting for the significant amount of activity we saw from Amazon this year, the full year 2020 net absorption was still 12% higher than 2019. For transactions larger than 100,000 square feet, e-commerce users comprised 22% of total demand and 3PLs about 26%. Comparatively, e-commerce demand in our own portfolio represented about 20% of our total leasing square footage volume for the year. This segment of the demand market, users over 100,000 square feet continues to be the most active subset. To that end, we signed 29 deals in the fourth quarter, over 100,000 square feet in our portfolio.  
Asking rental rates rose again in the fourth quarter, up 8.3% over this time last year. This rate of growth is about 100 basis points higher than the 5-year historical average of 7.1%. We see this rent trend continuing in 2021 with macro rent growth levels in the mid-single digits.  
In our own portfolio, we had our strongest quarter of the year with 9.7 square feet of leases executed, which is our second highest quarter ever in our company's nearly 50-year history. Our average transaction size was 104,000 square feet. In addition, the average lease term signed during the quarter was 7.5 years.  
On the rent collection side, we averaged 99.9% for the fourth quarter and 99.9% for the full year, arguably best in class in the entire REIT sector. These figures include a very small amount of deferral agreements and credit enhancement collections as detailed in the supplemental package.  
Looking forward, our overall tenant credit quality is very strong. We do have a handful of tenants and industries most acutely impacted by COVID that are in financial difficulty, which Mark will touch on in a moment as to their minor impact on our 2021 financial numbers. We do have a strong prospect list of backfills for most of these spaces, so the longer-term impact in this situation, we believe, will be positive.  
At quarter end, our stabilized in-service portfolio was 98.1%. The lease activity for the quarter, combined with the strong fundamentals I touched on, led to another great quarter of rent growth of 13% cash and 27% GAAP. 
We also had a very strong quarter in first-generation leasing. In our speculative developments under construction, we executed 2 significant leases in the quarter. The first was a 622,000-square-foot lease in Northern New Jersey to a leading national home furnishings retailer looking to expand its supply chain network for inventory redundancy, often referred to as safety stock or referred to as increased inventory levels, for them to take 100% of the facility -- 100% of the space in that facility.  
The second notable lease transaction in the spec project was a 290,000-square-foot lease we signed in the South Bay submarket of Southern California. This lease was a major -- was to a major national beverage distributor to take 100% of the space as well. It's important to note, both these buildings are still under construction and not scheduled to be completed until the second and third quarters of this year.  
Turning to development. We had a tremendous quarter of starts, breaking ground on 8 projects totaling $420 million in cost and 69% preleased. 7 of these new developments were part of our detailed press release that we issued on December 7. And then later in December, we started another project for about 146,000 square feet in the Mid County submarket of Southern California. In total, nearly 70% of our fourth quarter development starts were in coastal Tier 1 markets, and 5 of our 8 projects were redevelopments of existing land and site structures.  
Our development pipeline at year-end totaled $1.1 billion, with 80% of this allocated to coastal Tier 1 markets. This is a larger pipeline than we had a year ago, and the allocation to coastal tier markets is also higher than a year ago. The pipeline is 67% preleased, and we expect to generate margins in the 30% to 40% range.  
Looking forward, our prospect list for new starts in 2021 is very strong. And our land balance at year-end totaled $297 million, with nearly 80% of this allocated to coastal Tier 1 markets, setting us up very well for future growth.  
I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover acquisitions and dispositions for the quarter."

We had a very active quarter on both dispositions and acquisitions. Consistent with our strategy to increase our exposure to coastal Tier 1 markets, we sold $276 million of assets in the fourth quarter, comprised of 2 facilities in the far northwest submarket of Indianapolis, 1 in the far northeast submarket of Atlanta, 1 facility in the western portion of the Lehigh Valley and an asset leased to Amazon and Houston. In turn, we used these proceeds to acquire 2 assets in Southern California and a portfolio in Seattle for $305 million, that, in aggregate, are 74% leased, with an expected initial stabilized yield in the mid-4s and long-term IRRs -- unlevered IRRs in the mid-6s. The Seattle portfolio encompasses 3 buildings that are 69% leased in aggregate, located in the DuPont submarket and adjacent to an existing facility we developed several years ago.  
For the full year, our capital recycling encompassed $322 million of asset sales and $423 million of acquisitions. Combined with the development previously mentioned by Steve, this activity moves our coastal Tier 1 exposure to 41% of GAV and our overall Tier 1 exposure to 67%. We expect this recycling to continue in 2021 with dispositions primarily from the monetization of some of our Amazon assets, allowing us to manage our tenant exposure as well as some Midwestern assets to further refine our geography.  
I'll now turn it over to Mark to cover earnings results and balance sheet activities."

I am pleased to report that core FFO for the quarter was $0.41 per share compared to core FFO of $0.40 per share in the third quarter and represented a 7.9% increase over the $0.38 per share reported for the fourth",673,"Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that core FFO for the quarter was $0.41 per share compared to core FFO of $0.40 per share in the third quarter and represented a 7.9% increase over the $0.38 per share reported for the fourth quarter of 2019. Core FFO was $1.52 per share for the full year 2020 compared to $1.44 per share for 2019, which represents a 5.6% annual growth rate. 
FFO as defined by NAREIT was $1.40 per share for the full year 2020, which is lower than the core FFO due mainly to debt extinguishment charges. We grew AFFO by 6.2% on a share adjusted basis compared to 2019.  
Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the 3 months and 12 months ended December 31, 2020, was 3.3% and 5.0%, respectively. Same-property growth for the quarter was driven by continued strong rent growth and a 20 basis point increase in average commencement occupancy within our same-property portfolio from the fourth quarter of 2019.  
Net operating income from the non-same-store properties was 17.3% of total net operating income for the quarter. Same-property NOI growth on a GAAP basis was 3.1% for the fourth quarter and 2.8% for the full year 2020. Bad debt expense for the year was primarily related to noncash straight-line reserves, which negatively impacted GAAP same-property NOI.  
We finished 2020 with $295 million outstanding on our unsecured line of credit, which we refinanced early this month with a $450 million 1.75% 10-year green bond issuance, which will bear interest an effective rate of 1.83%. The pricing on this transaction was very attractive with our effective rate incorporating a 70 basis point spread over treasury rates, which at the time was the lowest credit spread ever on a 10-year REIT bond offering.  
We intend to continue a robust pace of growth in 2021, which we anticipate to fund with a combination of asset dispositions, internally generated cash flow, short-term use of our line of credit and a potential unsecured bond issuance later in the year. Also, if additional growth opportunities arise, it's possible we issue a modest amount of equity through the ATM on an opportunistic basis.  
From a macro outlook perspective, we expect the 2021 environment to be overall relatively strong and improving each quarter in light of the expected federal stimulus and vaccinations. Supply and demand are relatively in balance. The overall fundamentals picture is quite supportive of continued market rent growth and thus a positive setup for pricing power and new development starts.  
With this as a backdrop, yesterday, we announced a range for 2021 core FFO per share of $1.62 to $1.68 per share, with the midpoint of $1.65, representing an 8.6% increase over 2020. We also announced growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis to a range between 5.8% and 10.1%, with the midpoint at 8.0%. Our average in-service portfolio occupancy range is expected to be 95.7% to 97.7%. Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis is projected in the range of 3.6% to 4.4%. Our guidance for same-property NOI includes the negative impact from a few tenants Steve mentioned that we expect to terminate in early 2021.  
We expect proceeds from building dispositions in the range of $500 million to $700 million, which we will use to fund our highly accretive development pipeline. Acquisitions are projected in the range of $200 million to $400 million, with a continued focus on infill coastal markets and facilities with a repositioning or lease-up potential. Development starts are projected in the range of $700 million to $900 million, with a continuing target to maintain the pipeline at a healthy level of preleasing. Our pipeline of build-to-suit prospects continues to remain robust. And the $800 million midpoint of our 2021 guidance is consistent with our actual development starts for 2020.  
More specific assumptions and components of our guidance are available in the 2021 range of estimates document on the Investor Relations website. Now I'll turn it back over to Jim for some final comments."

As we look ahead into 2021, the demand drivers remain exceptionally strong. Supply and demand remain in balance, and we anticipate another year of strong results. This is evidenced in our 2021 guidance of $700 million to $900 million of expected new development starts, strong occupancy expected to remain elevated, and most of all, evident with our expected growth in FFO per share and AFFO of 8.6% and 8% in the midpoints, respectively. 
This level of growth is what we believe should be achievable on a consistent basis going forward. Our performance is a result of a decade of portfolio repositioning with a steadfast focus on quality, investing in selective submarkets and strengthening our balance sheet. We will continue to see the added value created by our dominant development platform, and we believe we can continue this level of growth well into the future.

We have not factored into our '21 guidance any real thoughts or outcomes on any of the proposed tax changes. I think it's obviously a little bit too early. I think the consensus is whatever gets done, whether it's through budget reconciliation or it gets through both houses, is probably going to take effect in 2022. So we'll have a little bit more clarity. 
I think any conservatism that is baked into our budget for 2021 is just -- is us being conservative given where we are in the economic recovery and where we are in the pandemic. We all had great expectations in the pandemic that so many more of us would be vaccinated by this time and things would be back to normal sometime in the second quarter. And I think expectation is it's going to drag on a little bit longer. And what last year's last round of stimulus is going to do and is there going to be another round of stimulus. 
So I think the prudent course of action was to bake a little conservatism in there. But as I think we've discussed and you've seen, it's consistent with pretty strong performance that we've had in '18, '19 and '20. And so we feel very comfortable we're able to achieve it. And as Steve just said a few minutes ago, I hope to be sitting here in April or July, in the first or second quarter call, telling you that things are off to a really strong start.

We've talked about safety stock, the inventory sales ratio as low as it is, major retailers and consumer products companies out in the last part of last year and the beginning of this year taking significant amounts of space, reverse logistics, handling the returns efficiently from all of this increased e-commerce sales.

I think the 4% guidance for this year is sort of a baseline to think about as we go forward and could go north there. Because in the 4% guidance for this year, we've got 30 basis points of bad debt in that number. Our run rate has been well less than 10 basis points. So we got a little bit more bad debt baked in the number for some of these tenants, like we talked about. But I think that's a higher-than-normal run rate. In that 4% is about a 2.5% average rent bump number that we've been talking about for a few years now. Yes, we're doing all of our new deals at 3%. So that 2.5% continues to grow. 
And then we're very bullish, like Jim said, on all those factors that will continue to drive rent growth close to where we've been. And if you think about it, like Nick said, we're at -- 40% of our portfolio right now are in these coastal Tier 1 markets. Yes, that was about 20% of our role. So that will continue to be a higher piece of the role as we move forward beyond '21, especially. So I think we're very bullish that 4% is kind of a good way to think about a baseline. And we'll give -- we'll adjust guidance from time to time based on other factors, but just to give you some insight as to how we came up with the 4% this year."

I don't have the exact numbers for each of the categories you talk about. But I would tell you that it's really not cap rate driven. The reason the cap rates came down was just moving properties out of the pipeline, put them in service and moving new projects into the construction, and most of the construction we're doing now are in the coastal Tier 1 markets that have lower cap rates. So it's not really too much related to a methodology change in the cap rate. It's just a mix. 
And then the overall reason that the margins are coming down, you mentioned it's rental rates. Rates are better than we expected, and we're leasing our assets up quicker than our original underwriting. So when we start a project, we always underwrite 12 months of downtime, and that's baked into our basis, the carry cost for that 12 months. And then we're typically, not always, but a lot of these projects that are in there are getting leased before they even go in service. So you take a full year of carry cost out of that equation and that drives your margin up pretty quickly. So those are the 2 main drivers."

But I would tell you, first and foremost is the supply side of the equation. If you look back at any of the downturns in our sector, the vast majority of them have been driven by oversupply, which is why we keep such very close eye quarter-to-quarter on the supply-demand metrics and where overall vacancy is. 
As you heard us talk about, our strategy is really submarket-based. So we tend not to be too concerned about macro numbers. We've talked about some of the soft markets around the country and how little exposure we have in them. So that would be first and foremost. 
And I think beyond that, some of the issues that we have been dealing with, trade tensions that would affect imports and exports. A subsector of that could be trade tensions or tariffs that affect some of the construction materials, create shortages or spikes in prices. Labor always is a -- it's a big one for our clients, but it's one that we watch as well. So those are probably the top 3 or 4 that we watch on a regular basis."

As I indicated in my points on the call, a lot of it is redevelopment, which adds -- typically adds environmental and risk like that, that we need to wade through.

But the other thing -- and Steve is absolutely right about the challenges with land today. But every one of the developments that we have slotted in to make up that $800 million budget guidance number, all but one of those is land that we already own.

And if we had -- if we find the right opportunities, we'd be happy to do that. So I think it's a combination of the right opportunities in the marketplace. 
We've always said, if we accelerate development and/or acquisitions, we've got a number of levers that we can pull in order to fund that. We can take on additional debt, we can tap the equity markets and we can accelerate disposition. So we've got the capacity.

That's actually conversations and a process that has been going on for virtually almost a year now, 10 months, which is the conversation with any of our clients that are in economic distress. And we have very open and candid conversations. We go over all of the financials. And we decide if we think it's worthy of us giving them a short-term rent deferral to help them through this crisis because we think, underlying, they have a good solid foundation of a business. 
And as we reported, I think, in the second quarter last year, we did 85-ish rent deferral agreements with tenants across the country. I think our people have done an outstanding job in terms of making the decisions they did with the people they get because we're getting complete repayment on all those deferrals. We've had a few people come back to us and say, ""We thought 6 months was going to be enough, and we need a little bit more time."" And we're working through that process again. 
But I don't know if anybody that's in the industries that you outlined that can't pay today that we think is going to come back even stronger.

I'll first cover overall market fundamentals and review our operational results. Industrial net absorption in the first quarter according to CBRE registered an impressive 100 million square feet, marking the first time that demand has exceeded 100 million square feet in consecutive quarters. This was more than enough to offset new supply as completions dipped to 57 million square feet from about 70 million square feet in the fourth quarter of 2020. This positive net absorption over deliveries for the quarter reduced vacancy down to 4.4%, which is back down near the record levels we saw throughout most of 2019. The strong mix and fundamentals increased asking rents by over 7% compared to the previous year. CBRE now projects demand for the full year to surpass 300 million square feet, perhaps even breaking the 2016 record of 327 million square feet. They project deliveries to be about 300 million square feet as well. The overall sector continues to remain very much in balance, which will produce another year of growth in asking rents of high single digits nationally. 
On the macroeconomic front, the increasing pace of vaccinations, the stimulus being pumped into the U.S. economy and the arrival of spring weather has generated some significant recent data points indicative of a very strong year in our business. The recent March consumer confidence rating is back near the range of 2018 and 2019, and the GDP growth is projected to be in the 6% to 7% range. This bodes very well for demand in logistics real estate. And in addition, we have the secular drivers in our business that remain firmly intact and stronger than pre-pandemic. To that point, the growth in retail sales and e-commerce sales across the 2-month February and March period were up 12% and 28%, respectively. And perhaps more notably, when measured against the 2019 pre -- nonpandemic time frame, the recent February and March figures were up 15% and 43%, respectively. 
In addition, the experience of the supply chain bottlenecks and response for greater business inventory redundancy is expected to push the retail inventory to sales ratio to above historic levels, yet it now sits near record low levels. Demand by occupier type remains broad-based and very active with pure e-commerce, omnichannel retailers, 3PLs, health care supply firms and food and beverage companies leading the way. 
Now I'll turn to our own portfolio. We executed a very solid first quarter by signing 7.4 million square feet of new leases. On first-generation leasing, we signed 3 transactions to stabilize assets that were previously in the unstabilized in-service and spec development pools, including 146,000 square foot lease and a spec development in Southern California Mid-Counties submarket for 100% of the space. The lease activity for the quarter, combined with strong fundamentals, I mentioned, led to continued growth in rents in our portfolio as we reported 11.4% cash, 26.2% on a GAAP basis. The mark-to-market on our portfolio leases is at 17% below market rental rates, which is supportive of continued strong rent growth. 
We also had an exceptional quarter of development starts. As initially reflected in our press release last month, on top of the $373 million of starts we reported in the press release, at quarter end, we signed another $39 million project in the Tampa's market, which is build-to-suit for an e-commerce retailer. In total, we started 11 projects during the quarter, totaling 3.8 million square feet and $412 million in cost. These projects were 60% preleased with value creation estimated near 40%. We're very -- we're also very proud that 3 of the 4 build-to-suits we signed during the quarter with repeat customers. Our development pipeline at quarter end totaled $1.4 billion with 68% allocated to our coastal Tier 1 markets. The pipeline -- this pipeline was 65% preleased as of March 31. 
Looking forward and consistent with the strong fundamentals I discussed and our best-in-class local operating teams, our outlook for new development starts is as strong as it's ever been, as reflected by our revised guidance of over 30% from our original midpoint. I'll also note, we do expect our pipeline preleasing percentage to potentially drop a bit in future quarters as we put fully leased assets in service and start more speculative development projects in high-barrier Tier 1 submarkets where fundamentals are very strong. 
I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover acquisitions of distribution."

For the quarter, we sold $94 million of assets comprised of 2 facilities in Houston as well as 2 facilities in Indianapolis owned in a 50-50 joint venture.

For the quarter, we sold $94 million of assets comprised of 2 facilities in Houston as well as 2 facilities in Indianapolis owned in a 50-50 joint venture. In turn, we used part of these proceeds to acquire 3 buildings totaling 680,000 square feet for $51 million, including 1 asset in Southern California's IE West submarket and 1 in Northern New Jersey's Medline submarket. The third facility acquired was in the Indianapolis Airport submarket and was part of a joint venture liquidation and asset swap. These buildings were all 100% leased within markets where we expect strong market rent growth that will contribute to long-term IRRs, well in access of the assets we sold. 
From a strategic positioning standpoint, the net effect of our development, disposition and acquisition activity this quarter moves our coastal Tier 1 exposure to over 42% of GAV. We've begun marketing a few Midwestern assets leased to Amazon Private sale, while certain assets lease to Amazon and other noncoastal Tier 1 markets may either be sold outright or contributed to a joint venture. In addition, the more recent news on disposition in last night's press release that we are now marketing for sale our entire 5.2 million square foot St. Louis portfolio. The rationale on the sale is threefold. One, we are taking advantage of increased investor demand for logistics assets; two, the portfolio accelerates our strategic objective to increase our exposure to coastal Tier 1 markets; and three, it will provide a source of funds for our increasing development pipeline. As a result, we have raised the midpoint of our full year expected dispositions by $400 million. Altogether, we expect our planned 2021 disposition activity to be weighted towards the middle of the year. 
I will now turn our call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update."

Core FFO for the quarter was $0.39 per share, which represents 18% growth over the first quarter of 2020. We've been saying for the last few quarters that we expected our core FFO growth rates to accelerate and begin to approach our already strong AFFO growth rates. The results from the current quarter and our revised guidance certainly reflects this. AFFO totaled $140 million for the quarter. Our best-in-class low level of capital expenditures, along with the strong NOI growth, continues to generate significant AFFO growth to reinvest into our business. Our best-in-sector rent collections continued in the first quarter of 2021 with more than 99.9% of rents collected. We have also collected more than 99.9% of April rents. And we now only have $52,000 under deferral arrangements remaining to be collected and had effectively no bad debt expense in the first quarter. 
Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 was 6.3%. The growth in same-property NOI was due to increased occupancy and rent growth as well as the burn-off of free rent compared to the first quarter of 2020. We do expect this growth to moderate for the remainder of the year based on tougher occupancy comps and less free rent burn-off, but to remain strong nonetheless. We finished the quarter with no outstanding borrowings around secured line of credit which we renewed in March and extended through March of 2026, including our extension options. We reduced our borrowing rate by 10 basis points compared to the previous facility. As part of our commitment to corporate responsibility, the credit facility also includes an incremental reduction in borrowing costs as certain sustainability-linked metrics are achieved each year. Our future debt maturities are well sequenced with less than 3% of our total outstanding debt being scheduled to mature prior to the end of 2023. 
As a result of our strong start to 2021, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2021 to a range of $1.65 to $1.71 per share compared to the previous range of $1.62 to $1.68 per share. The $1.68 per share midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance represents an over 10% increase over 2020 results. We also announced revised guidance for growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis to range between 8.0% and 12.3%, with a midpoint of 10.1% compared to the previous range of 5.8% to 10.1%. This increased earnings growth expectation is impressive when considering we are increasing current-year disposition expectations by $400 million to fund development projects and will not contribute to earnings until 2022 and beyond. For same-property NOI growth on a cash basis, we've increased our guidance to a range of 4.1% to 4.9% from the previous range of 3.6% to 4.4%. 
We continue to outperform our underwriting assumptions for speculative developments, both in the timing of lease-up and in rental rates achieved and continue to maintain a solid list of build-to-suit projects. Based on this, our revised guidance for development starts is between $950 million and $1.1 billion compared to the previous range of $700 million to $900 million. This increase in development starts will provide a key source of growth in 2022 and beyond. 
As Nick mentioned, we intend to take advantage of the investment sales market pricing to prefund a significant portion of our development pipeline with an increase in dispositions. Our guidance for dispositions has been revised to between $900 million and $1.1 billion compared to the initial range of $500 million to $700 million. We've updated a couple of other components of our guidance based on our more optimistic outlook as detailed in our range of estimates exhibit including our supplemental information on our website. I'll now turn it back to Jim for a few closing remarks."

As far as pricing goes, we continue to see cap rate compression. It's -- the secondary markets have compressed more recently than the coastal markets. But especially some of these Amazon assets, we've been very pleased with the pricing that we're seeing on those transactions as well. So I'd say, over the last 90 days, it's probably been another 25 bps on compression."

And some are in the infill markets that we work really, really hard to get a hold of And those are incredibly valuable assets, and we want to hold those for the long term. So Nick, you can add on."

Our development platform had a record first quarter of starts, and our core portfolio continues to perform at the top of the class. Our liquidity position and sources of capital are very attractively priced to capture opportunities, including our execution of 2 green debt transactions.

Now let me turn it over to Steve to cover our operations."

I'll first cover overall market fundamentals, then review our operational results. Industrial net absorption in the first quarter according to CBRE registered an impressive 100 million square feet, marking the first time that demand has exceeded 100 million square feet in consecutive quarters. This was more than enough to offset new supply as completions dipped to 57 million square feet from about 70 million square feet in the fourth quarter of 2020. This positive net absorption over deliveries for the quarter reduced vacancy down to 4.4%, which is back down near the record levels we saw throughout most of 2019. 
The strong mix and fundamentals increased asking rents by over 7% compared to the previous year. CBRE now projects demand for the full year to surpass 300 million square feet, perhaps even breaking the 2016 record of 327 million square feet. They project deliveries to be about 300 million square feet as well. The overall sector continues to remain very much in balance, which will produce another year of growth in asking rents of high single digits nationally.  
On the macroeconomic front, the increasing pace of vaccinations, the stimulus being pumped into the U.S. economy and the arrival of spring weather has generated some significant recent data points indicative of a very strong year in our business. The recent March consumer confidence rating is back near the range of 2018 and 2019, and the GDP growth is projected to be in the 6% to 7% range. This bodes very well for demand in logistics real estate. And in addition, we have the secular drivers in our business that remain firmly intact and stronger than prepandemic.  
To that point, the growth in retail sales and e-commerce sales across the 2-month February and March period were up 12% and 28%, respectively. And perhaps more notably, when measured against the 2019 pre -- nonpandemic time frame, the recent February and March figures were up 15% and 43%, respectively.  
In addition, the experience of the supply chain bottlenecks and response for greater business inventory redundancy is expected to push the retail inventory to sales ratio to above historic levels, yet it now sits near record low levels. Demand by occupier type remains broad-based and very active, with pure e-commerce, omnichannel retailers, 3PLs, health care supply firms and food and beverage companies leading the way.  
Now I'll turn to our own portfolio. We executed a very solid first quarter by signing 7.4 million square feet of new leases. On first-generation leasing, we signed 3 transactions to stabilize assets that were previously in the unstabilized in-service and spec development pools, including 146,000-square-foot lease on a spec development in Southern California, Mid-Counties submarket for 100% of the space.  
The lease activity for the quarter, combined with strong fundamentals I mentioned, led to continued growth in rents in our portfolio as we reported 11.4% cash, 26.2% on a GAAP basis. The mark-to-market on our portfolio leases is at 17% below market rental rates, which is supportive of continued strong rent growth. 
We also had an exceptional quarter of development starts. As initially reflected in our press release last month, on top of the $373 million of starts we reported in the press release, at quarter end, we signed another $39 million project in the Tampa's market, which is build-to-suit for an e-commerce retailer. In total, we started 11 projects during the quarter, totaling 3.8 million square feet and $412 million in cost. These projects were 60% preleased with value creation estimated near 40%. We're very -- we're also very proud that 3 of the 4 build-to-suits we signed during the quarter was repeat customers. Our development pipeline at quarter end totaled $1.4 billion with 68% allocated to our coastal Tier 1 markets. The pipeline -- this pipeline was 65% preleased as of March 31. 
Looking forward and consistent with the strong fundamentals I discussed and our best-in-class local operating teams, our outlook for new development starts is as strong as it's ever been, as reflected by our revised guidance of over 30% from our original midpoint. I'll also note, we do expect our pipeline preleasing percentage to potentially drop a bit in future quarters as we put fully leased assets in service and start more speculative development projects in high-barrier Tier 1 submarkets where fundamentals are very strong. 
I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover acquisitions and disposition."

For the quarter, we sold $94 million of assets comprised of 2 facilities in Houston as well as 2 facilities in Indianapolis owned in a 50-50 joint venture. In turn, we used part of these proceeds to acquire 3 buildings totaling 680,000 square feet for $51 million, including 1 asset in Southern California's IE West submarket and 1 in Northern New Jersey's Meadowlands submarket. The third facility acquired was in the Indianapolis Airport submarket and was part of a joint venture liquidation and asset swap. These buildings were all 100% leased within markets where we expect strong market rent growth that will contribute to long-term IRRs well in access of the assets we sold. 
From a strategic positioning standpoint, the net effect of our development, disposition and acquisition activity this quarter moves our coastal Tier 1 exposure to over 42% of GAV. We've begun marketing a few Midwestern assets leased to Amazon for outright sale, while certain assets leased to Amazon in other noncoastal Tier 1 markets may either be sold outright or contributed to a joint venture. 
In addition, the more recent news on disposition in last night's press release, that we are now marketing for sale our entire 5.2 million-square-foot St. Louis portfolio. The rationale on the sale is threefold. One, we are taking advantage of increased investor demand for logistics assets; two, the portfolio accelerates our strategic objective to increase our exposure to coastal Tier 1 markets; and three, it will provide a source of funds for our increasing development pipeline. As a result, we have raised the midpoint of our full year expected dispositions by $400 million. Altogether, we expect our planned 2021 disposition activity to be weighted toward the middle of the year. 
I will now turn our call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update."
267906,710055369,2263676,"Duke Realty Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Duke Realty Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.39 per share, which represents 18% growth over the first quarter of 2020.

Core FFO for the quarter was $0.39 per share, which represents 18% growth over the first quarter of 2020. We've been saying for the last few quarters that we expected our core FFO growth rates to accelerate and begin to approach our already strong AFFO growth rates. The results from the current quarter and our revised guidance certainly reflect this. 
AFFO totaled $140 million for the quarter. Our best-in-class low level of capital expenditures, along with the strong NOI growth, continues to generate significant AFFO growth to reinvest into our business. 
Our best-in-sector rent collections continued in the first quarter of 2021 with more than 99.9% of rents collected. We have also collected more than 99.9% of April rents. And we now only have $52,000 under deferral arrangements remaining to be collected and had effectively no bad debt expense in the first quarter. 
Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 was 6.3%. The growth in same-property NOI was due to increased occupancy and rent growth as well as the burn-off of free rent compared to the first quarter of 2020. We do expect this growth to moderate for the remainder of the year based on tougher occupancy comps and less free rent burn-off, but to remain strong nonetheless. 
We finished the quarter with no outstanding borrowings on our own secured line of credit, which we renewed in March and extended through March of 2026, including our extension options. We reduced our borrowing rate by 10 basis points compared to the previous facility. As part of our commitment to corporate responsibility, the credit facility also includes an incremental reduction in borrowing costs as certain sustainability-linked metrics are achieved each year. Our future debt maturities are well sequenced with less than 3% of our total outstanding debt being scheduled to mature prior to the end of 2023. 
As a result of our strong start to 2021, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2021 to a range of $1.65 to $1.71 per share compared to the previous range of $1.62 to $1.68 per share. The $1.68 per share midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance represents an over 10% increase over 2020 results. 
We also announced revised guidance for growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis to range between 8.0% and 12.3%, with a midpoint of 10.1% compared to the previous range of 5.8% to 10.1%. This increased earnings growth expectation is impressive when considering we are increasing current-year disposition expectations by $400 million to fund development projects that will not contribute to earnings until 2022 and beyond. 
For same-property NOI growth on a cash basis, we've increased our guidance to a range of 4.1% to 4.9% from the previous range of 3.6% to 4.4%. 
We continue to outperform our underwriting assumptions for speculative developments, both in the timing of lease-up and in rental rates achieved, and continue to maintain a solid list of build-to-suit projects. Based on this, our revised guidance for development starts is between $950 million and $1.1 billion compared to the previous range of $700 million to $900 million. This increase in development starts will provide a key source of growth in 2022 and beyond. 
As Nick mentioned, we intend to take advantage of the investment sales market pricing to prefund a significant portion of our development pipeline with an increase in dispositions. Our guidance for dispositions has been revised to between $900 million and $1.1 billion compared to the initial range of $500 million to $700 million. 
We've updated a couple of other components of our guidance based on our more optimistic outlook as detailed in our range of estimates exhibit, including our supplemental information on our website. 
I'll now turn it back to Jim for a few closing remarks."

But especially some of these Amazon assets, we've been very pleased with the pricing that we're seeing on those transactions as well. So I'd say, over the last 90 days, there's probably been another 25 bps on compression."

The fundamentals of our business continue to be the best we've ever seen. We've now had 3 successive quarters of demand at or near all-time records, and projected market level rent growth has risen from the 6% to 7% range to the 10% range nationally with some submarkets as high as 25%. During the quarter, we began just under $200 million of new developments with strong value creation, raised our full year guidance starts once again, continued cap rate compression and rent growth have well outpaced material cost increases that allowed us to drive improved margins. Our core portfolio achieved record rent growth on second-generation leasing, and our total in-service portfolio was an all-time high at 97.9% leased. We sold 4 assets in non-Tier 1 markets during the quarter were over $180 million. When coupled with the recently announced joint venture and the St. Louis market disposition, we've raised over $600 million of capital from portfolio management activities that also improved our Tier 1 geographic exposure. These quarterly results and our improved outlook for the balance of the year resulted in our raising key components of our 2021 guidance, including year-over-year core FFO growth now expected to be at 12.5% and growth in AFFO per share of 11.6%. Mark will provide you more details and color in his prepared remarks.

Industrial net absorption registered an impressive 85 million square feet, which is the third highest quarter on record. This was more than enough to offset new supply as completions dipped to 52 million square feet. This positive absorption over deliveries for the quarter reduced vacancy down to 4%. The strong fundamentals increased asking rents during the second quarter by 9.8% compared to the previous year. CBRE now projects demand for the full year to surpass 350 million square feet and break the all-time 2016 record of 327 million square feet. Completions are projected to be around 300 million square feet for the year. With this setup, we expect national asking rents to grow over 10% on average in 2021 with a range of mid-single digits to the mid-20s in the best submarkets. This is consistent with what we're seeing on the ground in our own markets. Growth in retail sales and e-commerce sales across the 2 month, May and June period, were up 20% and 9% year-over-year. And perhaps more notably, when measured against the 2019 pre-pandemic time frame, the recent May and June figures were up 19% and 37%. Continued strains in the supply chain caused the retail inventory to sales ratio to remain at a record low 1.1 level times. Demand by occupier type remains broad-based and very active with 3PLs leading the way. 3PL activity nearly doubled the square feet absorbed year-to-date compared to a year ago. The general retailer and wholesale on categories were also up over 85% from a year ago. Of course, e-commerce is still exceptionally strong. And even with Amazon leasing 33 million square feet, which is down some from a year ago, these data points are a very good indicator that demand is broadening out past pure e-commerce players.
Turning to our own portfolio. We executed a very solid quarter by signing 7.6 million square feet of leases. The strong lease activity for the quarter resulted in continued growth in rents in our portfolio as we reported 19% cash and 36% on a GAAP basis, both of which were all-time records for our portfolio. About 35% of these deals were in coastal markets, which is higher than our historical run rate, but still lower than our current portfolio exposure to these markets of about 40%. As we've been saying, our lower rollover in these coastal markets compared to our portfolio exposure results in outsized future opportunities for rent growth and this quarter certainly demonstrates this concept. We expect rollover in coastal markets for the remainder of the year to moderate to recent historical levels, but we still expect strong overall growth in rents to continue. We started $197 million of new development this quarter that consisted of 5 speculative projects. As we alluded to last quarter, given the strength across our submarkets and strategically located land, we believe these projects offer a great risk-adjusted return for us. In fact, within 2 months after starting construction, we've already signed a lease for 100% of the space at the Columbus project totaling 582,000 square feet with an A-rated global 3PL customer at a rent well above our underwritten levels.
Our development pipeline at quarter end is $1.4 billion, with 84% allocated to Tier 1 markets and expected value creation of almost 50%. This pipeline was 49% pre-leased as of June 30. This 49% moves up to 54% when you include the recently completed lease in Columbus I just mentioned. I'd also add that we have a land bank to continue to support these levels of new development going forward. Our teams have also taken critical steps to mitigate schedule risk related to materials. We believe we're well positioned to continue to lead our sector and grow through new development.
Looking forward, our outlook for new development is as strong as it's ever been and is reflected by our revised guidance of $150 million from the midpoint.
I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover the acquisitions and dispositions."

For the quarter, we sold $183 million of assets comprised of 2 facilities in Raleigh, 1 in St. Louis and 1 in Columbus. The pricing in aggregate was at an in-place cap rate of 4.2%, partly from very strong credit and asset quality, but also from exceptionally strong fundamentals and investor demand even in these non-Tier -- Tier 1 markets. [Technical Difficulty] stores container in the New York submarket of New Jersey. We expect to stabilize yield across both projects is 4.4% with IRRs expected in the mid-6% range. The 766,000 square foot facility acquired is a unique big box asset in IE West and has extra trailer parking and in a market with only 1% vacancy. The lease expires in approximately 2 years with current rents about 75% below market. Containing our facilities an irreplaceable location near the Port of New York, the Newark Airport and the New Jersey Turnpike and leased for 12 years to a local investor and logistics firm. There is also a long-term redevelopment possibility on this site. Yet in the interim, the investment will generate an excellent return as an income-producing logistics asset.
I'll now share an update on 2 other large portfolio management transactions we've been talking about over the last few quarters. First, most of you saw the press release on Tuesday announcing that we formed a joint venture with CBRE Global Investors as part of our previously stated strategy to manage our exposure to Amazon. The initial tranche encompasses 2 facilities totaling 1.3 million square feet and a 17-acre trail lot, which in aggregate, reduces exposure to Amazon from 8% to about 7.3%. It also generates approximately $141 million in capital, including new debt financing placed on the pool of assets. The second tranche consists of 2 facilities in 1 trail lot in Baltimore, expect to close later in the third quarter. The third tranche consists of 3 facilities located in Pennsylvania, Seattle, and South Florida, which are expected to close in early 2022. The JV is expected to employ modest leverage in the 50% to 60% range. Secondly, last quarter, we announced our plan to exit the St. Louis market this year, and we closed on sales during the second quarter and early in the third quarter with a blended cap rate in the mid-5% range. If you include the St. Louis transaction and tranche 1 and 2 of the JV contributions, the NOI from our development pipeline, our Tier 1 market NOI exposure is 67% and and our coastal Tier 1 market exposure is 40%.
I'll now turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update."

Core FFO for the quarter was $0.44 per share, which represents nearly 16% growth over the $0.38 per share from the second quarter of last year. AFFO totaled $150 million for the quarter compared to $135 million in t",544,"Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.44 per share, which represents nearly 16% growth over the $0.38 per share from the second quarter of last year. AFFO totaled $150 million for the quarter compared to $135 million in the second quarter of 2020. We expect this level of high performance to continue through the remainder of 2021 as reflected in our revised guidance. Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the 3 and 6 months ended 2021 compared to the same periods of 2020 was 5.5%, 6.2%, respectively. The growth in same-property NOI for the second quarter of '21 compared to the second quarter of '20, it was mainly due to rent growth and some free rent burn-off, partially offset by a slight decrease in occupancy in our same-property portfolio compared to the previous year.
During the quarter, we generated $156 million of proceeds from the sale of 3.4 million shares under our ATM program. We also redeemed the remaining $84 million of 3.9% unsecured notes that were set to mature in October of next year. We finished the quarter with $265 million of outstanding borrowings on our line. Early in July, we also called for the reduction of $250 million of unsecured notes, which have a scheduled maturity in April of 2023 and bear interest at an effective rate of 3.7%. After this redemption, we do not have any significant debt maturities until late 2024. We'll use the proceeds from the July dispositions, Nick just mentioned, to repay our line of credit and fund this reduction leaving us plenty of dry powder to fund our growing development pipeline.
As a result of our operational execution through the first half of 2021, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2021 and in a range of $1.69 to $1.73 per share compared to the previous range of $1.65 to $1.71 per share. The $1.71 midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance represents a 12.5% increase over 2020 results. We also announced revised guidance for growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis to range between 10.1% and 13.0% with a midpoint of 11.6% compared to our previous range of 8% to 12.3%. For same-property NOI on a cash basis, we've increased our guidance to the range of 4.75% to 5.25%. We continue to outperform underwriting assumptions for speculative developments, both in the timing of lease-up and in the rental rates we're achieving, while we have maintained a solid list of build-to-suit prospects as well as land sites in various stages of due diligence and entitlements. Based on these prospects, our revised guidance for development starts is between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion compared to the previous range of between $950 million and $1.15 billion. Our guidance for dispositions of properties has been revised to between $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion compared to the previous range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This increase in disposition guidance is primarily attributable to favorable pricing rather than additional asset sales. We've updated a few other components of our guidance based on our more optimistic outlook as detailed in our range of estimates exhibit included in our supplemental on our website.
I'll now turn it back to Jim for a few closing remarks."

We were 97.6% in the first half of '20 or 98.0 in the first half of '21. So that's a 40 basis point positive impact. When you look at the back half of the year, our occupancy comp in 2020 was 98.5%. So we think our occupancy will be pretty flat from the first half of '21 to the back half, maybe call it 97.9. But even with occupancy flat from the first half to the back half because of that hard comp, we go from a positive 40 basis points in the first half of the year to a negative 60 in the back half. So if you look at it that way, you really have a 100 basis point change in occupancy solely because of the comp period, not because of anything going bad in our portfolio now. So that's the main driver here. I also think this sets us up for next year because next year won't have that 98.5% comp like we had this year. So I know there were a lot of numbers there, but if you write all that down and follow, hopefully, that makes sense."

The challenge is finding the right opportunities where we value, particularly in the coastal Tier 1 markets and managing the entitlement process, that's gotten a little bit more challenging.

Industrial net absorption registered an impressive 85 million square feet, which is the third highest quarter on record. This was more than enough to offset new supply as completions dipped to 52 million square feet. This positive absorption over deliveries for the quarter reduced vacancy down to 4%. The strong fundamentals increased asking rents during the second quarter by 9.8% compared to the previous year. 
CBRE now projects demand for the full year to surpass 350 million square feet and break the all-time 2016 record of 327 million square feet. Completions are projected to be around 300 million square feet for the year. With this setup, we expect national asking rents to grow over 10% on average in 2021 with a range of mid-single digits to the mid-20s in the best submarkets.

And perhaps more notably, when measured against the 2019 pre-pandemic time frame, the recent May and June figures were up 19% and 37%. Continued strains in the supply chain caused the retail inventory to sales ratio to remain at a record low 1.1 level times. Demand by occupier type remains broad-based and very active with 3PLs leading the way. 3PL activity nearly doubled the square feet absorbed year-to-date compared to a year ago. The general retailer and wholesaler categories were also up over 85% from a year ago. 
Of course, e-commerce is still exceptionally strong. And even with Amazon leasing 33 million square feet, which is down some from a year ago, these data points are a very good indicator that demand is broadening out past pure e-commerce players. 
Turning to our own portfolio. We executed a very solid quarter by signing 7.6 million square feet of leases. The strong lease activity for the quarter resulted in continued growth in rents in our portfolio as we reported 19% cash and 36% on a GAAP basis, both of which were all-time records for our portfolio. About 35% of these deals were in coastal markets, which is higher than our historical run rate, but still lower than our current portfolio exposure to these markets of about 40%. 
As we've been saying, our lower rollover in these coastal markets compared to our portfolio exposure results in outsized future opportunities for rent growth and this quarter certainly demonstrates this concept. We expect rollover in coastal markets for the remainder of the year to moderate to recent historical levels, but we still expect strong overall growth in rents to continue. We started $197 million of new development this quarter that consisted of 5 speculative projects. 
As we alluded to last quarter, given the strength across our submarkets and strategically located land, we believe these projects offer a great risk-adjusted return for us. In fact, within 2 months after starting construction, we've already signed a lease for 100% of the space at the Columbus project totaling 582,000 square feet with an A-rated global 3PL customer at a rent well above our underwritten levels. 
Our development pipeline at quarter end is $1.4 billion, with 84% allocated to Tier 1 markets and expected value creation of almost 50%. This pipeline was 49% pre-leased as of June 30. This 49% moves up to 54% when you include the recently completed lease in Columbus I just mentioned. I'd also add that we have a land bank to continue to support these levels of new development going forward. Our teams have also taken critical steps to mitigate schedule risk related to materials. We believe we're well positioned to continue to lead our sector and grow through new development.
Looking forward, our outlook for new development is as strong as it's ever been and is reflected by our revised guidance of $150 million from the midpoint. I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover the acquisitions and dispositions."

For the quarter, we sold $183 million of assets comprised of 2 facilities in Raleigh, 1 in St. Louis and 1 in Columbus. The pricing in aggregate was at an in-place cap rate of 4.2%, partly from very strong credit and asset quality, but also from exceptionally strong fundamentals and investor demand even in these non-Tier -- Tier 1 markets. [indiscernible] stores container in the New York submarket of New Jersey. We expect to stabilize yield across both projects is 4.4% with IRRs expected in the mid-6% range. The 766,000 square foot facility acquired is a unique big box asset in IE West and has extra trailer parking and in a market with only 1% vacancy. 
The lease expires in approximately 2 years with current rents about 75% below market. The container of our facility is an irreplaceable location near the Port of New York, the Newark Airport and the New Jersey Turnpike and leased for 12 years to a local investor and logistics firm. There is also a long-term redevelopment possibility on this site. Yet in the interim, the investment will generate an excellent return as an income-producing logistics asset. 
I'll now share an update on 2 other large portfolio management transactions we've been talking about over the last few quarters. First, most of you saw the press release on Tuesday announcing that we formed a joint venture with CBRE Global Investors as part of our previously stated strategy to manage our exposure to Amazon. The initial tranche encompasses 2 facilities totaling 1.3 million square feet and a 17-acre trailer lot, which in aggregate, reduces exposure to Amazon from 8% to about 7.3%. It also generates approximately $141 million in capital, including new debt financing placed on the pool of assets. The second tranche consists of 2 facilities and 1 trailer lot in Baltimore, expect to close later in the third quarter. 
The third tranche consists of 3 facilities located in Pennsylvania, Seattle, and South Florida, which are expected to close in early 2022. The JV is expected to employ modest leverage in the 50% to 60% range. Secondly, last quarter, we announced our plan to exit the St. Louis market this year, and we closed on sales during the second quarter and early in the third quarter with a blended cap rate in the mid-5% range. If you include the St. Louis transaction and tranche 1 and 2 of the JV contributions, the NOI from our development pipeline, our Tier 1 market NOI exposure is 67% and our coastal Tier 1 market exposure is 40%. I'll now turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update."

Core FFO for the quarter was $0.44 per share, which represents nearly 16% growth over the $0.38 per share from the second quarter of last year. AFFO totaled $150 million for the quarter compared to $135 million in t",544,"Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.44 per share, which represents nearly 16% growth over the $0.38 per share from the second quarter of last year. AFFO totaled $150 million for the quarter compared to $135 million in the second quarter of 2020. We expect this level of high performance to continue through the remainder of 2021 as reflected in our revised guidance. 
Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the 3 and 6 months ended 2021 compared to the same periods of 2020 was 5.5% and 6.2%, respectively. The growth in same-property NOI for the second quarter of '21 compared to the second quarter of '20 was mainly due to rent growth and some free rent burn-off, partially offset by a slight decrease in occupancy in our same-property portfolio compared to the previous year. 
During the quarter, we generated $156 million of proceeds from the sale of 3.4 million shares under our ATM program. We also redeemed the remaining $84 million of our 3.9% unsecured notes that were set to mature in October of next year. We finished the quarter with $265 million of outstanding borrowings on our line. Early in July, we also called for the reduction of $250 million of unsecured notes, which have a scheduled maturity in April of 2023 and bear interest at an effective rate of 3.7%. 
After this redemption, we do not have any significant debt maturities until late 2024. We'll use the proceeds from the July dispositions, Nick just mentioned, to repay our line of credit and fund this reduction, leaving us plenty of dry powder to fund our growing development pipeline. 
As a result of our operational execution through the first half of 2021, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2021 in a range of $1.69 to $1.73 per share compared to the previous range of $1.65 to $1.71 per share. The $1.71 midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance represents a 12.5% increase over 2020 results. 
We also announced revised guidance for growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis to range between 10.1% and 13.0% with a midpoint of 11.6% compared to our previous range of 8% to 12.3%. For same-property NOI on a cash basis, we've increased our guidance to the range of 4.75% to 5.25%. We continue to outperform underwriting assumptions for speculative developments, both in the timing of lease-up and in the rental rates we're achieving, while we have maintained a solid list of build-to-suits prospects as well as land sites in various stages of due diligence and entitlements. 
Based on these prospects, our revised guidance for development starts is between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion compared to the previous range of between $950 million and $1.15 billion. Our guidance for dispositions of properties has been revised to between $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion compared to the previous range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This increase in disposition guidance is primarily attributable to favorable pricing rather than additional asset sales. We've updated a few other components of our guidance based on our more optimistic outlook as detailed in our range of estimates exhibit included in our supplemental on our website. 
I'll now turn it back to Jim for a few closing remarks."

The back half of the year, I think you'll see it back down in that 15% plus or minus range. And the reason I'm not quoting exact numbers is we don't exactly know how many early renewals will pull forward. That's always the million-dollar question, right? But if we look at what we know that's coming at us plus some slight early renewals, we think we'll have that coastal market rollover will probably be closer to 15%, 20% in the back half of the year like it has been prior. 
So the 2 things I would take out of that is a little bit of the record growth this quarter was driven because we had a little bit more exposure there, but it's still not the exposure that our portfolio is at, at 40%. So I think that gives us some really good comfort going into 2022 and beyond that those numbers could even escalate further. It may moderate a little bit in the back half of this year, but we still think it's going to be very good.

So a little bit of it is less uplift from free rent in the back half of the year compared to the first half of the year. But most of it is occupancy. And when I talk about occupancy, I'm not talking about a decrease in our occupancy from the first half of '21 to the back half. I'm talking about a tougher occupancy comp in '21. 
So for perspective, I have some numbers in front of me. If you look at the first half of this year, we actually had a 40 basis point favorable occupancy uplift from '21 -- from '20 to '21. We were 97.6% in the first half of '20 or 98.0% in the first half of '21. So that's a 40 basis point positive impact. When you look at the back half of the year, our occupancy comp in 2020 was 98.5%. So we think our occupancy will be pretty flat from the first half of '21 to the back half, maybe call it 97.9%. But even with occupancy flat from the first half to the back half because of that hard comp, we go from a positive 40 basis points in the first half of the year to a negative 60 in the back half. So if you look at it that way, you really have a 100 basis point change in occupancy solely because of the comp period, not because of anything going bad in our portfolio now. 
So that's the main driver here. I also think this sets us up for next year because next year won't have that 98.5% comp like we had this year. So I know there were a lot of numbers there, but if you write all that down and follow, hopefully, that makes sense."

That, too, is getting a little bit more challenging, given the constraints of the market out there. But we're pretty efficient processors. And I know there's been some analysis done about the number of years of production or the amount of production you have in land inventory. 
And I'm not worried about our development pipeline for the foreseeable future because we've got plenty of land that we own. We've got plenty of land that we control that we could close on in the coming years. So I think we'll be fine from that perspective."

I'll share a few highlights for the quarter and then turn it over to the rest of the team. We now have had 3 successive quarters of demand at or near all-time records and projected market level rent growth has risen from the 10% range to the mid-teens percent nationally and in some submarkets as high as 35%.
During the quarter, we began roughly $350 million of new developments with expected strong value creation and IRRs, and we raised our full year guidance on starts once again. Cap rate compression and rent growth continued to outpace material cost increases, allowing us to drive improved margins. The margins on our development pipeline are now over 60%, and our core portfolio achieved record rent growth of 22% on a cash basis from second-generation leasing activity.
These quarterly results and our improved outlook for the balance of the year resulted in our raising key components of our 2021 guidance, including year-over-year core FFO growth now expected to be at 13.8% and growth in AFFO per share of 11.6%. Based on these results and our optimism about the balance of the year, we have raised the dividend by almost 10%. Mark will go over these changes in detail momentarily.
Now let me turn it over to Steve to cover the real estate operations in more detail."

I'll first cover market fundamentals and then review our overall operational results. Industrial net absorption registered 121 million square feet, which is only 1 million square feet less than the all-time record. This was more than enough to offset the new supply as completions came in at about 79 million square feet. This positive net absorption over deliveries for the quarter reduced vacancy down to 3.6%, setting yet another record low. The strong fundamentals increased nationwide asking rents during the third quarter by 10% compared to the previous year. CBRE now projects demand for the full year in the mid-300 million square foot range, and likely to break the all-time 2016 record of 327 million square feet.
Completions for the year are projected to be about 270 million square feet. National asking rents for the full year are expected to be in the mid-teens with some markets like Northern New Jersey and Southern California likely to see increases of 30% to 35%. The reaction to supply chain bottlenecks continues to be in the early stages of a long-term boom for our sector, with CBRE reaffirming roughly 1.2 billion square feet of projected aggregate demand over the next 5 years.
Increasing inventory levels, safety stock, consumer spending and online shopping trends are driving much of this demand. Demand by occupier type remains broad-based with e-commerce and logistics services companies continuing to make up roughly 60% of our activity, with the e-commerce contribution about 10% lower compared to 2020 and the 3PL contribution about 10% higher than this time last year. It is also noteworthy that Amazon's share of demand this year is about 10% of overall total demand compared to 18% of demand in 2020.
Turning to our own portfolio, we executed a very strong quarter by signing 9.5 million square feet of leases. The strong lease activity for the quarter resulted in continued growth in rents within our portfolio as we reported 35% on a GAAP basis and 22% cash. Notably, with only 25% of our transactions occurring in coastal Tier 1 markets. We now project our mark-to-market on a GAAP basis within our portfolio to be 28%.
We started $349 million of new development totaling 2 million square feet that consisted of 6 speculative projects and 2 build-to-suits in the quarter. 80% of this volume was in our coastal Tier 1 markets. Our team has continued to lease our speculative projects successfully is evidenced by stabilizing 7 new developments during the quarter and increasing the development pipeline to 60% leased.
To put our track record of leasing speculative projects in context, the $897 million of projects that we placed in service this year through September 30 increased from 39% leased when the construction started to 90% leased when they were placed in service. For all of our speculative developments, we've started since the beginning of 2019, our average lease-up time is less than 2 months from the date the projects were placed in service. Our team's continued ability to quickly lease up speculative development projects will be a key contributor of our future growth.
Sticking with the development pipeline. At quarter end, we totaled $1.1 billion with 86% of this allocated to Tier 1 markets and 60% preleased. We now expect value creation from this pipeline of over 60%, which is primarily due to rapid appreciation of rents and land. We are also very proud to remind everyone that we target only developing the lead certified standards. We expect to lead percent of our total NOI to trend towards 25% by the end of 2022.
On the construction cost side of things, our teams have taken steps to mitigate schedule risk related to materials, such as contracting for steel nearly a year out, and we've only had minor delays in a few of our projects. The outlook for new starts is strong and is reflected in our revised guidance of our midpoint being up $175 million. On a longer-term basis, we either own or control land, primarily in coastal infill markets that can support roughly $1 billion of annual starts over the next 4 years if the supply and demand picture remains robust, which we believe it will.
It is also important to note the market value of the land we own is about 2x our book basis, and on average, we've only owned this land for about 2 years. Land we control and will be closing over the next few quarters is also well below market. The favorable land value, we will continue to support high development margins and very good IRRs long term. And overall, we believe we are very well positioned to continue to lead the sector and grow through new development.
I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover the acquisition of disposition."

For the quarter, disposition proceeds totaled $738 million, including outright sales and contributions to joint ventures. The outright sales comprise our entire remaining portfolio in St. Louis, 3 buildings in Indianapolis and 1 building in Chicago. The activity also included the first 2 tranches of the Amazon property contributions to our newly formed joint venture with CBRE Global Investors. The pricing in aggregate was at an in-place cap rate of 4.8%, which was inflated a bit by a [ high 5 ] cap rate for the St. Louis portfolio in which pricing was impacted by expected rent roll-downs on looming tax abatement expirations.
We acquired 1 facility in the third quarter totaling $24 million, a 63,000 square foot facility in the San Gabriel Valley submarket of Southern California. This third quarter activity has further shifted the geographic position of our portfolio on an NOI basis to approximately 40% in the coastal Tier 1 market. Let me also note that just after quarter end in very early October, we closed on the sale of a 517,000 square foot Amazon facility in Columbus, Ohio. This sale represents our final property disposition for the year.

The growth in the same-property NOI for the third quarter of '21 compared to the third quarter of '20 was mainly due to rent growth, partially offset by an 80 basis point decrease in occupancy in our same-property portfolio due to an extremely high occupancy comp of [ 98.6% ] in 2020.
Our balance sheet is in great shape with plenty of dry powder to fund our growth. We had $273 million of sale proceeds in 1031 escrow accounts at the end of the quarter that will be used to fund near-term building and land acquisitions. We finished the quarter with reduced leverage as a result of the significant disposition activity during the quarter, but intend to return to recent leverage levels by the end of the year as we continue to grow through development.
As a result of our continued strong operating results, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2021 in a range of $1.71 to $1.75 per share compared to the previous range of $1.69 to $1.73 per share. The $1.73 midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance, represents a nearly 14% increase over 2020.
For same-property NOI growth on a cash basis, we have increased our guidance to a range of 5.0% to 5.4% from the previous range of 4.75% to 5.25%. We continue to outperform our underwriting assumptions for speculative developments, both in the timing of lease-up and in the rental rates we're achieving, while we have maintained a solid list of build-to-suit prospects as well as land sites in various stages of due diligence and entitlements. Based on these prospects, our revised guidance for development starts is between $1.3 billion and $1.45 billion compared to the previous range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion.
We've updated a couple of other components of our guidance based on our more optimistic outlook as detailed in our range of estimates exhibit included in our supplemental information on our website. I'll now turn it back to Jim for a few closing remarks."

In closing, I'm incredibly proud of our team's execution in leasing, capital deployment and development starts. We started the year with very solid growth expectations and have exceeded every one of them, resulting in a nearly 14% growth in core FFO at the revised midpoint. Our shareholders should be very pleased with our dividend increase of $0.025 per share. This 9.8% increase marks our seventh straight year of annual dividend increases, representing a growth of over 65% over that period.
Looking out to the next few years, our operating platform is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the numerous growth drivers benefiting the logistics sector. These drivers, combined with the undersupply of new available warehouse product will allow us to maintain our high occupancy rates and rent growth while creating substantial profit margins on our $1 billion-plus development pipeline. The net result of these factors is our belief we can continue to grow earnings at approximately 10% pace for the foreseeable future.
With that, I want to thank you for your interest and your support of Duke Realty. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Sean will now open it up and take our first question."

You're right, we did raise guidance on our occupancy. I think that we've got some momentum going into the rest of the year here that you'll see a little bit of an increase [indiscernible] such that even though we do have that tough occupancy comp in the fourth quarter again.

The other thing I'll just comment is, as Amazon continues to mature in the markets, I think this is probably just a natural progression where they'll start to control some of their larger key facilities. From our perspective, we've really slowed down doing the big build-to-suits for them out in a lot of the secondary markets.
Most of our Amazon activity today is infill. And it's really spec leasing or pre-leasing of land we have controlled and under entitlement that we're not willing to sell to Amazon or to investors. So I don't think it's going to impact our business with Amazon at all."

That's closer to 40%. So we're newer in those coastal markets. So we haven't experienced the level of role in those markets commensurate with our exposure in those markets, if that makes sense. So looking out beyond this year.
Next year, we'll probably look a lot like this year kind of in that 20% to 25% range, rolling in the coastal markets. You got to get up to about 23, 24. That's when we'll start really seeing an uplift in our rollover coming in those coastal markets.

The supply chain has gotten a lot of ink lately, a lot of airtime. I would tell you that's a separate and distinct issue from the growth drivers that we're seeing. We've talked in investor meetings and in our material about the 5 main drivers of our business today, and that has nothing to do with supply chain. That's growth in e-commerce sales, reverse logistics, near-shoring and on-shoring, safety stock. That's what our -- that's what's driving our customers' need for more space.
If you go back and look at the IS ratio today, which has historically been between 1.4 and 1.5, sits at 1.1. So what that means effectively is our customers need to bring in another $1 trillion of inventory into the U.S. Occupancies are at historic highs in the portfolios. Utilization rates within ours and our peers' portfolios are at historic highs. So that's what's driving this projected demand over the next 5 years of a huge, huge amount of space.
So it really doesn't have a whole lot to do with the supply chain disruption. It really is driven by growth in sales, need for a lot of new facilities and a lot of different facilities than the traditional. We've talked in the past about the need for modern buildings for fulfillment centers, for infill development for last-mile facilities, and our customers need a lot more of that."

If it is, I think we're 1 of the better ones position. First of all, we have the balance sheet. We have the ability to commit the dollars to these projects on land that we control so that we can secure the development in the time period that we want to put the project into production. We have the expertise with our construction and development teams to get these projects designed earlier and allow us to secure the construction materials in advance and keep our development pipeline at the high level it is.
We've talked in the past couple of months about having everything in the 2020 pipeline secured. Then Steve's teams moved into the first half of 2022, we've now got all of that secured, and we're working on securing the second half of 2022. So it's an ongoing battle for us.

I'll share a few highlights for the quarter and then turn it over to the rest of the team. We now have had 3 successive quarters of demand at or near all-time records, and projected market level rent growth has risen from the 10% range to the mid-teens percent nationally and in some submarkets as high as 35%.
During the quarter, we began roughly $350 million of new developments with expected strong value creation and IRRs, and we raised our full year guidance on starts once again. Cap rate compression and rent growth continued to outpace material cost increases, allowing us to drive improved margins. The margins on our development pipeline are now over 60%, and our core portfolio achieved record rent growth of 22% on a cash basis from second-generation leasing activity.
These quarterly results and our improved outlook for the balance of the year resulted in our raising key components of our 2021 guidance, including year-over-year core FFO growth now expected to be at 13.8% and growth in AFFO per share of 11.6%. Based on these results and our optimism about the balance of the year, we have raised the dividend by almost 10%. Mark will go over these changes in detail momentarily.
Now let me turn it over to Steve to cover the real estate operations in more detail."

I'll first cover market fundamentals and then review our overall operational results. Industrial net absorption registered 121 million square feet, which is only 1 million square feet less than the all-time record. This was more than enough to offset the new supply as completions came in at about 79 million square feet. This positive net absorption over deliveries for the quarter reduced vacancy down to 3.6%, setting yet another record low. The strong fundamentals increased nationwide asking rents during the third quarter by 10% compared to the previous year. CBRE now projects demand for the full year in the mid-300 million-square-foot range and likely to break the all-time 2016 record of 327 million square feet.
Completions for the year are projected to be about 270 million square feet. National asking rents for the full year are expected to be in the mid-teens with some markets like Northern New Jersey and Southern California likely to see increases of 30% to 35%. The reaction to supply chain bottlenecks continues to be in the early stages of a long-term boom for our sector, with CBRE reaffirming roughly 1.2 billion square feet of projected aggregate demand over the next 5 years.
Increasing inventory levels, safety stock, consumer spending and online shopping trends are driving much of this demand. Demand by occupier type remains broad-based with e-commerce and logistics services companies continuing to make up roughly 60% of our activity, with the e-commerce contribution about 10% lower compared to 2020 and the 3PL contribution about 10% higher than this time last year. It is also noteworthy that Amazon's share of demand this year is about 10% of overall total demand compared to 18% of demand in 2020.
Turning to our own portfolio. We executed a very strong quarter by signing 9.5 million square feet of leases. The strong lease activity for the quarter resulted in continued growth in rents within our portfolio as we reported 35% on a GAAP basis and 22% cash, notably, with only 25% of our transactions occurring in coastal Tier 1 markets. We now project our mark-to-market on a GAAP basis within our portfolio to be 28%.
We started $349 million of new development totaling 2 million square feet that consisted of 6 speculative projects and 2 build-to-suits in the quarter. 80% of this volume was in our coastal Tier 1 markets. Our team has continued to lease our speculative projects successfully as evidenced by stabilizing 7 new developments during the quarter and increasing the development pipeline to 60% leased.
To put our track record of leasing speculative projects in context, the $897 million of projects that we placed in service this year through September 30 increased from 39% leased when the construction started to 90% leased when they were placed in service. For all of our speculative developments we've started since the beginning of 2019, our average lease-up time is less than 2 months from the dates the projects were placed in service. Our team's continued ability to quickly lease up speculative development projects will be a key contributor of our future growth.
Sticking with the development pipeline. At quarter end, we totaled $1.1 billion with 86% of this allocated to Tier 1 markets and 60% preleased. We now expect value creation from this pipeline of over 60%, which is primarily due to rapid appreciation of rents and land. We are also very proud to remind everyone that we target only developing the lead certified standards. We expect the lead percent of our total NOI to trend towards 25% by the end of 2022.
On the construction cost side of things, our teams have taken steps to mitigate schedule risk related to materials such as contracting for steel nearly a year out, and we've only had minor delays in a few of our projects. The outlook for new starts is strong and is reflected in our revised guidance of our midpoint being up $175 million. On a longer-term basis, we either own or control land, primarily in coastal infill markets that can support roughly $1 billion of annual starts over the next 4 years if the supply/demand picture remains robust, which we believe it will.
It is also important to note the market value of the land we own is about 2x our book basis, and on average, we've only owned this land for about 2 years. Land we control and will be closing over the next few quarters is also well below market. The favorable land value, we will continue to support high development margins and very good IRRs long term. And overall, we believe we are very well positioned to continue to lead the sector and grow through new development.
I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover the acquisition of disposition."

For the quarter, disposition proceeds totaled $738 million, including outright sales and contributions to joint ventures. The outright sales comprise our entire remaining portfolio in St. Louis, 3 buildings in Indianapolis and 1 building in Chicago. The activity also included the first 2 tranches of the Amazon property contributions to our newly formed joint venture with CBRE Global Investors. The pricing in aggregate was at an in-place cap rate of 4.8%, which was inflated a bit by a high 5% cap rate for the St. Louis portfolio in which pricing was impacted by expected rent roll-downs on looming tax abatement expirations.
We acquired 1 facility in the third quarter totaling $24 million, a 63,000-square-foot facility in the San Gabriel Valley submarket of Southern California. This third quarter activity has further shifted the geographic position of our portfolio on an NOI basis to approximately 40% in the coastal Tier 1 market. Let me also note that just after quarter end in very early October, we closed on the sale of a 517,000-square-foot Amazon facility in Columbus, Ohio. This sale represents our final property disposition for the year.

Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the 3 and 9 months ended 2021 compared to the same periods of 2020 was 3.8% and 5.3%, respectively. The growth in the same-property NOI for the third quarter of '21 compared to the third quarter of '20 was mainly due to rent growth, partially offset by an 80 basis point decrease in occupancy in our same-property portfolio due to an extremely high occupancy comp of [ 98.6 ] in 2020.
Our balance sheet is in great shape with plenty of dry powder to fund our growth. We had $273 million of sale proceeds in 1031 escrow accounts at the end of the quarter that will be used to fund near-term building and land acquisitions. We finished the quarter with reduced leverage as a result of the significant disposition activity during the quarter, but intend to return to recent leverage levels by the end of the year as we continue to grow through development.
As a result of our continued strong operating results, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2021 in a range of $1.71 to $1.75 per share compared to the previous range of $1.69 to $1.73 per share. The $1.73 midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance represents a nearly 14% increase over 2020.
For same-property NOI growth on a cash basis, we have increased our guidance to a range of 5.0% to 5.4% from the previous range of 4.75% to 5.25%. We continue to outperform our underwriting assumptions for speculative developments, both in the timing of lease-up and in the rental rates we're achieving, while we have maintained a solid list of build-to-suit prospects as well as land sites in various stages of due diligence and entitlements. Based on these prospects, our revised guidance for development starts is between $1.3 billion and $1.45 billion compared to the previous range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion.
We've updated a couple of other components of our guidance based on our more optimistic outlook as detailed in a range of estimates exhibit included in our supplemental information on our website. 
I'll now turn it back to Jim for a few closing remarks."

In closing, I'm incredibly proud of our team's execution in leasing, capital deployment and development starts. We started the year with very solid growth expectations and have exceeded every one of them, resulting in a nearly 14% growth in core FFO at the revised midpoint. Our shareholders should be very pleased with our dividend increase of $0.025 per share. This 9.8% increase marks our seventh straight year of annual dividend increases, representing a growth of over 65% over that period.
Looking out to the next few years, our operating platform is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the numerous growth drivers benefiting the logistics sector. These drivers, combined with the undersupply of new available warehouse product, will allow us to maintain our high occupancy rates and rent growth while creating substantial profit margins on our $1 billion-plus development pipeline. The net result of these factors is our belief we can continue to grow earnings at approximately 10% pace for the foreseeable future.
With that, I want to thank you for your interest and your support of Duke Realty. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Sean will now open it up and take our first question."

You're right, we did raise guidance on our occupancy. I think that we've got some momentum going into the rest of the year here that you'll see a little bit of an increase [indiscernible] such that even though we do have that tough occupancy comp in the fourth quarter again, I think we won't lose the 80 basis points.

The other thing I'll just comment is, as Amazon continues to mature in the markets, I think this is probably just a natural progression where they'll start to control some of their larger key facilities. From our perspective, we've really slowed down doing the big build-to-suits for them out in a lot of the secondary markets.
Most of our Amazon activity today is infill. And it's really spec leasing or preleasing of land we have controlled and under entitlement that we're not willing to sell to Amazon or to investors. So I don't think it's going to impact our business with Amazon at all."

So looking out beyond this year.
Next year, we'll probably look a lot like this year, kind of in that 20% to 25% range rolling in the coastal markets. You got to get up to about 23, 24. That's when we'll start really seeing an uplift in our rollover coming in those coastal markets.

The supply chain has gotten a lot of ink lately, a lot of airtime. I would tell you that's a separate and distinct issue from the growth drivers that we're seeing.

That's growth in e-commerce sales, reverse logistics, near-shoring and on-shoring, safety stock. That's what our -- that's what's driving our customers' need for more space.
If you go back and look at the IS ratio today, which has historically been between 1.4 and 1.5, sits at 1.1. So what that means effectively is our customers need to bring in another $1 trillion of inventory into the U.S. Occupancies are at historic highs in the portfolios. Utilization rates within ours and our peers' portfolios are at historic highs. So that's what's driving this projected demand over the next 5 years of a huge, huge amount of space.
So it really doesn't have a whole lot to do with the supply chain disruption. It really is driven by growth in sales, need for a lot of new facilities and a lot of different facilities than the traditional.

For us, I will tell you that the sweet spot is a larger building in an infill market. Those are really, really hard to find and get through entitlements and produce. So we build everything from 30,000, 40,000 feet up to over 1 million feet and put it in the right place."

I think with the elevated levels of development going on across the country, I think we'd all like to believe that material supply will get caught up, and this is not a challenge that we're going to be dealing with for the next 5 years.
If it is, I think we're one of the better ones positioned. First of all, we have the balance sheet. We have the ability to commit the dollars to these projects on land that we control so that we can secure the development in the time period that we want to put the project into production. We have the expertise with our construction and development teams to get these projects designed earlier and allow us to secure the construction materials in advance and keep our development pipeline at the high level it is.
We've talked in the past couple of months about having everything in the 2020 pipeline secured. Then Steve's teams moved into the first half of 2022, we've now got all of that secured, and we're working on securing the second half of 2022. So it's an ongoing battle for us, one that we'd like to believe that we'll get back to some level of normalization. But in the foreseeable future, it's going to stay high pricing and extended delivery times, and we're managing our way through it."

Obviously, we're still paying commissions in new condition. We've got what I would call very normal amounts of TI to build that space.
