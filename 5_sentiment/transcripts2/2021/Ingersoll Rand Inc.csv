And",1231,"Thanks, Vik, and good morning to everyone. Before we start, I want to take a moment to reflect. Think about it, one year ago today, we were 5 days away from day one as an integrated company of Gardner Denver and the Ingersoll Rand Industrial segment. And what a year we selected to take on a transformational transaction. Our newly combined company committed to a purpose to lean on us to help you make life better and a set of values that include having the confidence to take on the most difficult problems with humility and integrity. And little did we know, we will be tested so quickly. 
Looking back on 2020, the global pandemic was challenging for everyone. We will have to adapt and learn new skill to ensure our essential worker safety as they were to provide issue critical products and services to serve the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we turn to our innovation and creativity to discover new ways to connect with each other with our customers and with our partners. I'm proud of every one of our global employees for their resilience, dedication and determination to think and act like owners and protect and nurture our 1-year old organization. 
Our employees are strong. We adapt quickly and move fast. It's part of our culture, and that's not something you can replicate. It's a competitive advantage and it proved it worked for us this year. The backbone and economic engine is our Ingersoll Rand execution excellence, but it's our employees who trust and lead IRX every single day. And thanks to them, we delivered strong results and stand ready to grow in 2021 and beyond. 
Starting on Slide 3. Today, we're going to concentrate our remarks around 3 things: first, how we accelerated our transformation during 2020; second, how we are unlocking our true potential as a company as we successfully piloted to focus on growth and our portfolio optimization; and third, how our focus on growth is supported through strong business segment performance during Q4 with momentum continuing in Q1. 
Moving to Slide 4. We have seen this before. It's a framework of building a strong foundation, pivoting to growth and optimizing the portfolio, all guided by our 5 strategic imperatives, down on the left-hand side. It is a reminder to what we have been executing against to deliver on our commitment. 
Turning to Slide 5. That framework shows we achieved substantial traction across all of our strategic imperatives and pivoted quickly to offers around growth and portfolio optimization, from completing the Ingersoll Rand industrial transaction and integrating complementary cultures to awarding one of the largest equity brands ever given to employees in an industrial company and establishing diversity, equity and inclusion goals. Our 2020 accomplishments, especially in the area of human capital management, are a differentiator. 
We see a broad-based employee ownership as a game-changer. It takes performance to a new level. We're thinking [indiscernible] and no other. That's one of our core values. It changes the mindset from this is a company I work for to this is my company. It's a massive shift. Employees are highly engaged and active participants in our journey to create long-term value. All of these human capital management priorities are part of why we added operate sustainably as a strategic pillar. And more on that in a minute. 
We enhanced our portfolio through bolt-on acquisitions and also the sale of a majority interest high pressure solutions setting. Looking ahead to 2021 and beyond, we'll focus on several areas. We're ahead of plan on our integration as we enter year 2. We are increasing our integration cost synergy target by $50 million to $300 million. On growth, we're bringing together complementary products across businesses for strategic niche markets such as work. And we're accelerating new product launches into sustainable industrial markets such as packaging, all of these while we continue to focus on our strong balance sheet to support our inorganic growth strategy through accretive M&A transactions. 
Let's turn to Slide 6. As we successfully appeal to growth and our portfolio penetration, we are unlocking our maximum potential as a company. Capital allocation is a huge part of my personal focus. And I'll come back to you with more thoughts on this already, but we're actively discussing this with the Board. We started last week. We signed an agreement to sell a majority interest in our High Pressure Solutions segment. At the time of close, we will receive approximately $300 million while retaining a 45% common equity ownership in the business moving forward. We view the $300 million alone as a good value as it is approximately 24x 2020 adjusted EBITDA and also represents a solid multiple of 2021 expected adjusted EBITDA. 
The remaining terms of the deal are confidential, and we're not going to comment further, but we view our remaining equity as pure upside in the medium to long term. For Ingersoll Rand, the transaction is a meaningful step forward in our transformation. It materially reduces our direct exposure to the cyclical upstream oil and gas market to less than 2% of revenue and result in a much more predictable business performance, and all of these while removing minimal current earnings from the company. 
On the M&A front, at the beginning of this month, we completed the purchase of vacuum and blower systems. The transaction is highly complementary to our vacuum and blower technologies and will operate under the iconic and premium brands of NV Pneumatics and Kine vacuum pumps. As we pivoted to growth, we accelerate investment in IoT, e-commerce and digitalization. Last week, you may have seen our announcement with Google Cloud for a 5-year collaboration to advance connectivity across our portfolio. With real client data and machine learning for smarter and more innovative products, we are strengthening our capabilities to help our customers be successful for the long term. Along with recent new products and wins in strategic end markets we have recently shared with you, like hydrogen, life sciences and oil for compressor products, our work with Google represents one way we are positioning ourselves for accelerated growth in 2021 and beyond. 
Unlocking our key potential means being focused on sustainable technologies in high-growth end markets. And it also means being focused on our commitment to environmental, social and governance principle as we see now on Slide 7. Yesterday, we joined a growing number of companies who are embracing their leadership responsibility to help confront the global threat of climate change. The differentiator is that we're placing some ambitious milestones for our ESG efforts. We were committing to be net zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050, but getting to 60% of this goal in less than 10 years, by 2030. In addition, we have also committed to targets for water and waste reduction. As a corporate, we [indiscernible] lean on us to help you make life better. We want to be an active participant on this important cost for the long-term sustainability of our planet. 
A key advantage for us is using IRX to deliver the performance needed to achieve our environmental goals. We will provide an ongoing cadence of transparency and disclosure in our second annual sustainability report being published at the end of May. 
I will now turnover the call to Vik to provide an update on financials. Vik?"

Q4 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with ongoing signs of improvement across industrial end markets. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in",1206,"Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 8. Q4 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with ongoing signs of improvement across industrial end markets. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q4. Total company orders and revenue increased 12% and 13%, respectively, as compared to Q3 levels, with strong double-digit orders momentum across each of the segments. In addition, the company continued to drive outperformance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst. 
The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $344 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8%. This was 150 basis point improvement from Q3. And on a year-over-year basis, despite mid-single-digit revenue decline, margins increased 300 basis points. And when adjusted to exclude the High Pressure Solutions segment, total company margins improved 350 basis points. 
Given the strong close in Q4, we had our best performance of the year in terms of managing decrementals with adjusted EBITDA increasing by $30 million on a year-over-year basis despite the $78 million decrease in revenue. As we have stated before, quality of earnings has been a key focus, and you can see the continued momentum we had throughout 2020 on this metric. 
Cash flow on the balance sheet was another highlight for the quarter as free cash flow increased to $397 million, yielding total liquidity of $2.7 billion at year-end. 
Moving to Slide 9. For the total company, orders increased 2% and revenue declined 7%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. This is a meaningful improvement from the comparable 8% and 11% declines we saw in the third quarter. IT&S, Precision and Science Technologies and Specialty Vehicle Technology segment all saw positive organic orders growth in the quarter. 
Starting first with IT&S. The total segment saw 2% FX-adjusted orders growth with both the Americas and EMEA regions showing mid-single-digit orders improvement for core compressor, blower and vacuum equipment. Precision and Science saw a 6% adjusted orders growth in the quarter, the highest level reached during the entire year. Continued strength in the product lines like medical and Dosatron, both of which saw double-digit growth, were the major drivers given niche end market exposure in areas like lab, life sciences and water. 
Specialty Vehicles saw continued strong orders performance, up 21% ex FX. Specialty Vehicle showed positive orders growth each quarter in 2020, and Q4 saw a nice balance with continued strong momentum in consumer vehicles as well as double-digit growth in Gulf as well as aftermarket. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.01 for the quarter. This was much better than the prior year level of 0.92. Given the typical seasonality we see in the fourth quarter, with strong shipments and book-to-bill below 1, we are encouraged by the Q4 2020 book-to-bill being above 1 as it sets up a healthy backlog moving into 2021. 
The company delivered $344 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 10% versus prior year. The IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicle segments all saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and had strong triple-digit margin expansion. The HVS segment continued to show profitability despite depressed revenue levels and performed largely in line with expectations. And finally, corporate costs came in at $32 million for the quarter, consistent with prior expectations and relatively flat to prior year. 
Turning to Slide 10. Quickly touching on the total year. FX-adjusted orders and revenue were down 9% and 13%, respectively, due primarily to the impacts of COVID-19 in both the IT&S and Precision and Science segments as well as the known downturn in the upstream energy markets, which impacted the HPS segment. Despite these headwinds, the business delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of 20%, which is up 60 basis points versus the prior year or 180 basis points excluding HPS. This speaks to the team's ability to execute during different business cycles as full year decrementals were limited to only 15% and the 3 core segments of IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles all delivered triple-digit adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. This is only possible to the power of IRX as an execution engine to drive change in every area of the business. 
Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $397 million, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing working capital improvements. Inventory management was a particular highlight with a reduction of nearly $60 million as we're starting to see benefits of many of the operational efficiency projects the team has been deploying as well as the benefit of the improving commercial environment. 
CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million, and free cash flow included $17 million of outflows go into the transaction. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2x, which was a 0.5 time improvement as compared to prior quarter due to both the stronger cash generation in the quarter as well as the improvement in LTM EBITDA due to the strong Q4 finish. We have now reduced leverage the same levels we had prior to the RMT and have line of sight to leverage coming down closer to 1.8x once the HPS sale concludes. 
On the right side of the page, you see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.7 billion based on approximately $1.8 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. In total, liquidity has now increased nearly $1.2 billion from the end of Q1. This gives us considerable flexibility to continue our strategy of M&A, coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. 
Moving to Slide 12. We continue to see strong momentum on our cost synergy delivery efforts. Due to the funnel we have built that stands in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are increasing our overall target by $50 million to $300 million. To date, we have already executed approximately $175 million of annualized synergies, which is approximately 60% of the overall target and a $25 million increase from prior quarter. In total, we delivered approximately 40% of our new $300 million target in 2020, which equaled approximately $115 million of savings. In addition, we expect to deliver an incremental $100 million of savings in 2021, which would bring the cumulative total to approximately 70% at the end of this year. We expect a cumulative 85% to 90% of the $300 million in savings by the end of 2022 with the balance coming in 2023. 
The $50 million increase in the target is largely driven from procurement and direct material-oriented initiatives as the team continues to make good strides both on leveraging the larger spend base of the company as well as executing on the ITV funnel. 
ITV is a particular success story. Over the past 6 months, we have conducted over 20 virtual events with our commercial product management and manufacturing teams to both build the funnel and start executing on tangible savings. On the right of the page, we reported each quarter in terms of our progress on managing decremental margins across the business, and Q4 was no different. 
I will now turn it back over to Vicente to discuss the segments."
334158,703357287,2219290,"Ingersoll Rand Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Ingersoll Rand Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick.

Despite the revenue decline, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up",1701,"Thanks, Rick. Moving to Slide 13 and starting with Industrial Technologies and Services. Overall, organic orders were up 1% and revenue down 8%, leading to a book-to-bill of 0.98x. Despite the revenue decline, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 12% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.1%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. Margins were also up 210 basis points sequentially versus Q3. 
Let me provide more detail on order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up mid-single digits. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows that orders for both were up mid-single digit. Oil-free order rates slightly outperformed those of oil-lubricated and stick to the airports of leveraging the company's expanded oil-free portfolio and taking advantage of new channels. 
Regarding the regional split for orders in compressors. In the Americas, North America performed comparatively better at up low single digits, while Latin America was down high single digits. Mainland Europe was up high single digits, while India, Middle East and Africa saw a nice inflection of high-teens as compared to being down double digits in the past 2 quarters. Asia Pacific continued to perform well with orders up mid-single digits, driven by mid-single-digit growth in China and relatively flattish growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. 
In terms of vacuums and blowers, orders were up mid-teens with strong double-digit growth in the industrial banking and blower portfolio as well as mid-single-digit growth in the longer-cycle Nash Garo vacuum business. 
Moving next to power tools and liftings. The total business was down low teens in orders. The tools part of the business was down high single digits in orders compared to down high teens in Q3. We expect to pivot to positive orders growth in the first half of the year driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities. 
On the right side, you'll see 3 market drivers coming to our go-forward segment: sustainability, digitization and shifting demographics. For each segment, I will comment on how they're stepping forward to address these drivers. For IPS, the Google Cloud announcement I referenced earlier is a prime example of how the business is expanding comprehensive data digitization that will help increase the customers' ability to improve energy efficiency to support them on achieving their own greenhouse gas emission reduction. 
Let me move now to Slide 14 and the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall, organic orders were up 5%, driven by the medical and Dosatron businesses, which were both up double digits as well as healthy growth in the water and general industrial markets from products like Milton Roy. 
The momentum on our Hygiene Solutions continues to build, and we saw some good orders and funnel activity in this rapidly changing end market. Revenue was down 8% organically with a major driver being 2 large projects for a large aerospace and defense company that shipped in Q4 of 2019 within the legacy PFS business. Despite the revenue decline, the PSCT delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 7%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, this segment has already generated a very respectable 27.7% adjusted EBITDA margin back in Q1 of '20. But we're very pleased with how the team continues to transform this businesses now in Q4 with comparable revenue as what we did in Q1. This segment is generating 310 basis points more margin. 
Looking at the market drivers, the position on science team is meeting the demand for more sustainable energy sources and launching in new markets like hydrogen. From a digital perspective, many of our new pump technology can be multicontrolled, leadering and dosing to ensure the safe and reliable dispensing of chemicals for markets around food sanitation and animal health. And the segment's medical business is answering the demand for precise liquid handling technology to help advance personalized medicine research. 
Moving to Slide 15 and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. Overall, Q4 was another strong quarter for the Specialty Vehicle team. Orders were up 21% organically and continue to get stronger throughout the quarter as the consumer offering continues to gain momentum and market share. We also saw an inflection on growth that continued into Q1. We believe our lithium-ion battery launch is clearly a market leader, and we're taking share in the market. Organic revenue was up 8% with improvements across not only vehicles, but also aftermarket parking services. [indiscernible] were in the early stages here and see potential as we expand the info base that can be served ongoing with parts and accessories. Adjusted EBITDA of $46 million increased 40% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.7%, and this represents a 420 basis point improvement versus prior year, again, proving that IRX can be applicable to any business to generate solid improvements. 
We continue to see runway into the future as the team continues to move rapidly on accelerating initiatives like new product launches and end-user life-cycle management. In terms of its market drivers, the segment is recognizing and responding to the sustainability and efficiency demand for zero-emission vehicles to replace gas engine vehicles. For example, in Q4, we saw more than 80% unit growth for lithium cars versus the prior year. Digitization is critical also as owners expect connected cars to provide realtime data on their vehicle. The data can range from maintenance information, location-based data or infotainment services. And from a demographic shift perspective, we're seeing a higher demand for families to own recreation, zero-emission consumer vehicles used for short distance driving at low speeds. 
Moving to Slide 16 and the High Pressure Solutions segment. The business performed largely in line with expectations in the midst of continued lower demand in the oil and gas market. Order and revenue were down 51% and 42%, respectively, which was an improvement over the decline seen both in Q2 and Q3. Nearly 90% of the revenue base continues to come from aftermarket parts and services. And the business delivered positive adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 million and incremental of 40% despite the meaningful revenue decline. 
Beginning with the first quarter of 2021, and due to the recently announced sell, the HPS business will be classified as discontinued operations in all future periods, and we will retroactively adjust the comparable prior periods. Within the income statement, the historical HPS business results will be presented on a single financial statement line below operating income. And upon deal closure, we will account for our 45% interest under the equity method of accounting. This means we will record our proportionate share of the HPS business income or loss for the period through a single financial statement line below operating income. 
Moving to Slide 17. We will review guidance for 2021. Given the pending sale, the HPS segment will not be included in our revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Starting with revenue growth, we expect total Ingersoll Rand revenue to be up high single digits to low double digits on an actual quarter basis. This is comprised of this single-digit organic growth across each of the 3 segments. FX is expected to be a low single-digit tailwind for the business on a total year basis given the weakening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currency like euro and British pound. FX assumption are based on December 2020 exit rates. 
And finally, we expect the M&A impact to be approximately $60 million, driven primarily by the [indiscernible] acquisition in the IPS segment. From a patient perspective, we anticipate the first half of the year to be up low double digits, driven by the prior year impact of COVID-19, particularly in China in Q1 2020 and the rest of the world starting in Q2 of 2020. In addition, the FX tailwinds will be most evident during the first half of 2021. Overall growth in the second half of the year is expected to normalize a bit comparatively, but still be up high single digits. As is typical, we expect Q1 to be comparatively lighter than the remaining 2021 quarters. Based on these revenue assumptions, we're introducing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.23 billion to $1.26 billion. The range includes an expectation for approximately $100 million of incremental transaction-related cost synergies with slight offsets due to 2 factors: first, 35 -- approximately $35 million to $40 million of temporary costs taking out in 2020 returning to the P&L; and second, some expected material and logistics inflation given current dynamic across the global supply chain. We continue to monitor overall inflation and will take appropriate incremental pricing actions if and when warranted. 
In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be greater or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of revenues. And finally, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be between 23% and 24% as compared to the 24.3% rate seen in 2020. 
Moving to Slide 18. As we wrap today's call, I reflect in 2020 as a year that change ourselves. We took every measure to prioritize our employee safety while enabling our essential workers to maintain their livelihood and that is because our employees needed us. We concentrated on delivering our mission-critical products and services to the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic side because our customers needed us. And we even proactively reached out to area health care providers to donate the use of sub-degree triggers to store COVID-19 vaccines because communities also needed us. So we take a role as a sustainably minded and employee-owned industry leader [indiscernible] as can be seen by our clear commitment to reducing our impact on the environment. And I am proud of every several team member in our company for how we came together and deliver to protect the interest of all of our stakeholders this year. 
What a difference a year makes. In the threshold of our 1-year anniversary, it's been a momentous ride, created a differentiated culture and improving the performance of our company. I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A."

I think the good news here is, I'd say 2 things. One, we have always said that we're in the region for the region. So we're really colocated our factories to really support our customers in the regions. And for the most part, a lot of our supply chain is really colocated within kind of close proximity of the factory. So that has not been a material impact to us. 
And I think the second point that it has been good for us is that with the combination of the companies, we have a larger supply chain. And as we have gone through the procurement and the rationalization of suppliers, we're selecting some pretty strong partners that are here to support us from a global perspective and that is kind of leading to having that disruption that perhaps orders are seeing. 
So in terms of ramping the capacity, we just don't foresee that to be an issue. I mean for the most part, most of our factories, they operate under one-shift operations. And if we have to expand, that should be just a matter of expanding capacity from incremental shares."

I think like we said, we had a larger funnel in the course of $350 million. And I think the teams have been executing really well. I think a large part of the, what I call, structural actions that are really behind us. Really, most of those have taken much more closer to the merger. And really, what you've seen the momentum building on here is really execution across really the more direct material-focused components of that funnel. So really, what I'll call, procurement as well as now really getting deep to the ITBs on the equation. So I think a lot of what you're seeing is just good execution. Like we always said, we have a larger funnel. I'd say that, no, not every idea in the funnel is going to necessarily translate straight to the bottom line. But the team is executing really well. We saw really good momentum, including in fourth quarter. Our annualized synergy number actually increased in fourth quarter compared to where we were in Q3. And so it gave us the confidence to be able to increase the synergy target up to $300 million. 
I think in terms of the second part of your question, what would give us kind of increased confidence to increase it further from there. I think it's really continued execution. What's really ahead of us here is items like procurement, ITV and footprint. And we've always been very disciplined in saying that the footprint piece of this equation was always going to come more so towards the back end of the kind of 3-year plan. Nothing has changed in that perspective. But I think now as we're moving into kind of our second year as a combined company, now the teams are really starting to kind of build out that footprint funnel and start to see kind of some of that momentum. So I think that's really, time will tell in terms of being able to kind of increase the number from there, but we're optimistic about where we've gone this far."

So I think in terms of the incrementals that we're expecting on a total year basis, on an all-in basis, I'd say, growth as well as the some of the synergies as well as some of the other cost headwinds, it's probably closer to about a 35% incremental or slightly higher depending on some of the quarters. But it's a little bit closer to 35% is kind of the implied incremental on an all-in basis, which we actually see is pretty healthy given kind of the puts and takes. And it does, of course, include reinvestment back in the business as we're kind of focused on sustainable organic growth as we move forward. 
I think in terms of the -- some of the moving pieces, I think you hit it on the head here. In addition to just kind of the organic growth in the M&A and some of the FX tailwinds that we called out in guidance, a couple of pieces I'd probably include: one, the $100 million that you spoke to in terms of the incremental synergy savings. That's the year 2 of our transaction-related integration savings. The second item then on the headwinds would really be the $35 million to roughly $40 million of temp costs really coming back into the equation, really ramping as we move through the back half of the year. And then we have baked in a nominal amount of inflation. We're not necessarily quantifying the exact dollar amount. But as you would expect, and as Vicente mentioned, we're seeing some of the kind of normal, I'd say, supply chain and logistics-oriented inflation that you would expect. So those are probably the major pieces in terms of the, I'd say, the components that we're seeing. And I think that hopefully kind of characterizes the components."

I don't think that's a bad placeholder to use for 2021 as you look forward. So again, I think the equation still largely holds in terms of the expectations for the savings and the ultimate amount of cash costs going out the door. The only difference is we've really taken up the synergy number. We don't really feel like we need to increase the amount of cash out the door that we're expecting to spend to be able to deliver it. So again, I think we're pretty encouraged by how we've been managed to execute to a higher number in terms of synergies, but continue to keep the kind of cash outflow is pretty disciplined. But remember, we do have the footprint piece of the equation ahead of us, which, again, does tend to be a little bit more on the cost side."

Joe, to answer the question specifically, yes, I mean, we haven't come out with a specific guidance in terms of the medium term of where we see the margin profile to come. But I mean look, ITS, I mean, finishing the fourth quarter at 26% margin. And if you remember batch in the Garner Denver days, we said that industrial segment, we wanted to be in the mid-20s. So -- but we also said that mid-20s is not the cap, and that's just kind of a milestone, and we see more room for improvement from there on. When you kind of open the door inside ITS, I mean, we have -- as you know, we're running P&Ls, and we have definitely P&Ls that are way above that kind of mid-20s. So we know that we have a model on how to -- an impact on how to get to that kind of high 20s. 
In the Precision and Science, you saw -- I've made some commentary, very proud with the team. When we started with that business in Q1 of this year, the business was doing a respectable high 20s, and we finished at above 30 on an exit rate. So do we see a potential on that continuing? I'll make the same analogy back the medical business when we had that with Gardner Denver, we were in maybe the mid-20s and we ended up in the 30s. And again, we see -- we also said that, that was just kind of a milestone, but more room for us to improve on that. So we'll comment here maybe sometime soon in terms of kind of how we think about the medium guidance for some of those segments, but we definitely see continued room for improvement from here and beyond."

In terms of the Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles businesses, the incrementals there will be a little bit more muted just on a year-over-year basis. Frankly, a little bit of balancing in terms of the mix, in terms of the top line. If you remember on the Precision Science, we did see a pretty strong in-swell of COVID-related demand in 2020. On the medical side, that actually came at a pretty good margin premium. That is obviously not expected to recur in 2021, replace it a little bit more what I'll call  general industrial and then obviously, some of the investments back in. And then the SVG business kind of comparable. As the commercial and Gulf businesses tend to kind of normalize, you're not going to necessarily see that mix be quite as what it was in 2020. And we obviously continue to invest for new products and growth. So again, I think its is where you'll see a little bit more pronounced."

And I'll even -- I'll just make that even broader, the direct material equation, whether it be classical procurement from leveraging a larger spend base as well as now the ITV savings funnel. I think the answer is no. You've seen the continued momentum. Obviously, the conviction in raising the synergy target of $300 million. I think that we have a pretty good line of sight and pretty good conviction in being able to deliver those procurement and direct material-oriented numbers. 
And then on the G&A side, again, I'd say there's always room for opportunities. But I think, like we said, the majority of the more structural-related savings and cost take-out really saw that much more executed in 2020. So again, I would say that part is kind of largely behind us. But we'll always look for rooms for optimization."

So we feel that the team has taken some good market share and they're not done yet. I mean was COVID an accelerator or accentuate the decision-making for some consumers to really buy now versus maybe buy later? Yes, it could be. But I think what's exciting is that the momentum has continued. What is also exciting is that the team is getting ready to make some pretty good product launches in 2021, not only the consumer, but also the utility market. That could play very well not only in the U.S. but also in Europe. So I think the team is really hitting in all cylinders. We're supporting with great investments and more to come."

Maybe some that I can highlight on the Precision and Science, the team is making their investments in the hydrogen and really seeing some acceleration in terms of the product launches that they expect to get as well as commercialization by investing on feet on the street throughout the world. 
And on industrial technology, heavy investment on product launches. Now that we have the combined 2 companies, particularly on the compressor side, there's going to be a very good cadence of the execution of what we were planning and delivering and working through 2020 that is getting executed and launched now here to the year. 
And in terms of CapEx, sure, I mean, absolutely. We think 1.5% to 2%. I mean we're typically very light, very light CapEx base. So -- but if the team comes in with a great proposal that provides some very good return on invested capital. We look at ROIC even on a CapEx basis, then we'll do it."

It is -- it's not an area of opportunity for not only Gardner Denver, but also Ingersoll Rand. And now with the combination of the 2, we can actually really go after a better channel and better end market channel. So we're being very selective. The team is really appropriately investing in that region. So it's just a lot of good potential opportunity that we see in the Southeast Asia."

Think about it, one year ago today, we were 5 days away from day one as an integrated company of Gardner Denver and the Ingersoll Rand Industrial segment. And what a year we selected to take on a transformational transaction. Our newly combined company committed to a purpose to lean on us to help you make life better and a set of values that include having the confidence to take on the most difficult problems with humility and integrity. And little did we know, we will be tested so quickly. 
Looking back on 2020, the global pandemic was challenging for everyone. We will have to adapt and learn new skills to ensure our essential workers' safety as they worked to provide issue-critical products and services to serve the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we turned to our innovation and creativity to discover new ways to connect with each other, with our customers and with our partners. I'm proud of every one of our global employees for their resilience, dedication and determination to think and act like owners and protect and nurture our 1-year old organization. 
Our employees are strong. We adapt quickly and move fast. It's part of our culture, and that's not something you can replicate. It's a competitive advantage and we proved it worked for us this year. The backbone and economic engine is our Ingersoll Rand execution excellence, but it's our employees who trust and lead IRX every single day. And thanks to them, we delivered strong results and stand ready to grow in 2021 and beyond. 
Starting on Slide 3. Today, we're going to concentrate our remarks around 3 things: first, how we accelerated our transformation during 2020; second, how we are unlocking our true potential as a company as we successfully pivoted to focus on growth and our portfolio optimization; and third, how our focus on growth is supported through strong business segment performance during Q4 with momentum continuing in Q1. 
Moving to Slide 4. You have seen this before. It's a framework of building a strong foundation, pivoting to growth and optimizing the portfolio, all guided by our 5 strategic imperatives, down on the left-hand side. It is a reminder to what we have been executing against to deliver on our commitment. 
Turning to Slide 5. That framework shows we achieved substantial traction across all of our strategic imperatives and pivoted quickly to offense around growth and portfolio optimization, from completing the Ingersoll Rand Industrial transaction and integrating complementary cultures to awarding one of the largest equity brands ever given to employees in an industrial company and establishing diversity, equity and inclusion goals. Our 2020 accomplishments, especially in the area of human capital management, are a differentiator. 
We see a broad-based employee ownership as a game-changer. It takes performance to a new level. We're thinking and acting like no other. That's one of our core values. It changes the mindset from this is a company I work for to this is my company. It's a massive shift. Employees are highly engaged and active participants in our journey to create long-term value. All of these human capital management priorities are part of why we added operate sustainably as a strategic pillar. And more on that in a minute. 
We enhanced our portfolio through bolt-on acquisitions and also the sale of a majority interest high-pressure solutions setting. Looking ahead to 2021 and beyond, we'll focus on several areas. We're ahead of plan on our integration as we enter year 2. We are increasing our integration cost synergy target by $50 million to $300 million. 
On growth, we're bringing together complementary products across businesses for strategic niche markets such as water. And we're accelerating new product launches into sustainable industrial markets such as hydrogen. All of these while we continue to focus on our strong balance sheet to support our inorganic growth strategy through accretive M&A transactions. 
Let's turn to Slide 6. As we successfully appeal to growth and our portfolio penetration, we are unlocking our maximum potential as a company. Capital allocation is a huge part of my personal focus. And I'll come back to you with more thoughts on this when ready, but we're actively discussing this with the Board. 
To start, last week, we signed an agreement to sell a majority interest in our High Pressure Solutions segment. At the time of close, we will receive approximately $300 million while retaining a 45% common equity ownership in the business moving forward. 
We view the $300 million alone as a good value as it is approximately 24x 2020 adjusted EBITDA and also represents a solid multiple of 2021 expected adjusted EBITDA. The remaining terms of the deal are confidential, and we're not going to comment further, but we view our remaining equity as pure upside in the medium to long term. 
For Ingersoll Rand, the transaction is a meaningful step forward in our transformation. It materially reduces our direct exposure to the cyclical upstream oil and gas market to less than 2% of revenue and results in a much more predictable business performance, and all of these while removing minimal current earnings from the company. 
On the M&A front, at the beginning of this month, we  completed the purchase of Tuthill Vacuum and Blower Systems. The transaction is highly complementary to our vacuum and blower technologies and will operate under the iconic and premium brands of NV Pneumatics and Kinney Vacuum Pumps. As we pivoted to growth, we accelerate investments in IoT, e-commerce and digitization. Last week, you may have seen our announcement with Google Cloud for a 5-year collaboration to advance connectivity across our portfolio. With real time data and machine learning for smarter and more innovative products, we are strengthening our capabilities to help our customers be successful for the long term along with recent new products and wins in strategic end markets we have recently shared with you, like hydrogen, life sciences and oil for compressor products. Our work with Google represents one way we are positioning ourselves for accelerated growth in 2021 and beyond.
Unlocking our true potential means being focused on sustainable technologies in high-growth end markets. And it also means being focused on our commitment to environmental, social and governance principles as we see now on Slide 7. Yesterday, we joined a growing number of companies who are embracing their leadership responsibility to help confront the global threat of climate change. The differentiator is that we're placing some ambitious milestones for our ESG efforts, where were committing to be net zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050, but getting to 60% of this goal in less than 10 years, by 2030. 
In addition, we have also committed to targets for water and waste reduction. As our purpose states, lean on us to help you make life better. We want to be an active participant on this important cause for the long-term sustainability of our planet. 
A key advantage for us is using IRX to deliver the performance needed to achieve our environmental goals. We will provide an ongoing cadence of transparency and disclosure in our second annual sustainability report being published at the end of May. 
I will now turn over the call to Vik to provide an update on financials. Vik?"

Q4 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX, with ongoing signs of improvement across industrial end markets. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in",1208,"Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 8. Q4 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX, with ongoing signs of improvement across industrial end markets. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q4. Total company orders and revenue increased 12% and 13%, respectively, as compared to Q3 levels, with strong double-digit orders momentum across each of the segments. In addition, the company continued to drive outperformance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst.  
The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $344 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8%. This was a 150-basis point improvement from Q3. And on a year-over-year basis, despite mid-single-digit revenue decline, margins increased 300 basis points. And when adjusted to exclude the High Pressure Solutions segment, total company margins improved 350 basis points. 
Given the strong close in Q4, we had our best performance of the year in terms of managing decrementals, with adjusted EBITDA increasing by $30 million on a year-over-year basis despite the $78 million decrease in revenue. As we have stated before, quality of earnings has been a key focus, and you can see the continued momentum we had throughout 2020 on this metric. Cash flow on the balance sheet was another highlight for the quarter as free cash flow increased to $397 million, yielding total liquidity of $2.7 billion at year-end. 
Moving to Slide 9. For the total company, orders increased 2% and revenue declined 7%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. This is a meaningful improvement from the comparable 8% and 11% declines we saw in the third quarter. IT&S, Precision and Science Technologies and Specialty Vehicle Technology segment all saw positive organic orders growth in the quarter.  
Starting first with IT&S. The total segment saw 2% FX-adjusted orders growth with both the Americas and EMEA regions showing mid-single-digit orders improvement for core compressor, blower and vacuum equipment. Precision and Science saw a 6% adjusted orders growth in the quarter, the highest level reached during the entire year. Continued strength in the product lines like medical and Dosatron, both of which saw double-digit growth, were the major drivers given niche end market exposure in areas like lab, life sciences and water.  
Specialty Vehicles saw continued strong orders performance, up 21% ex FX. Specialty Vehicles showed positive orders growth each quarter in 2020, and Q4 saw a nice balance with continued strong momentum in consumer vehicles as well as double-digit growth in golf as well as aftermarket. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.01 for the quarter. This was much better than the prior year level of 0.92. Given the typical seasonality we see in the fourth quarter, with strong shipments and book-to-bill below 1, we are encouraged by the Q4 2020 book-to-bill being above 1 as it sets up a healthy backlog moving into 2021. 
The company delivered $344 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 10% versus prior year. The IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicle segments all saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and had strong triple-digit margin expansion. The HVS segment continued to show profitability despite depressed revenue levels and performed largely in line with expectations. And finally, corporate costs came in at $32 million for the quarter, consistent with prior expectations and relatively flat to prior year. 
Turning to Slide 10. Quickly touching on the total year. FX-adjusted orders and revenue were down 9% and 13%, respectively, due primarily to the impacts of COVID-19 in both the IT&S and Precision and Science segments as well as the known downturn in the upstream energy markets, which impacted the HPS segment. Despite these headwinds, the business delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of 20%, which is up 60 basis points versus the prior year or 180 basis points excluding HPS. This speaks to the team's ability to execute during different business cycles as full year decrementals were limited to only 15% and the 3 core segments of IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles all delivered triple-digit adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. This is only possible to the power of IRX as an execution engine to drive change in every area of the business. 
Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $397 million, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing working capital improvements. Inventory management was a particular highlight, with a reduction of nearly $60 million as we're starting to see benefits of many of the operational efficiency projects the team has been deploying as well as the benefit of the improving commercial environment. 
CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million, and free cash flow included $17 million of outflows related to the transaction. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2x, which was a 0.5x improvement as compared to prior quarter due to both the stronger cash generation in the quarter as well as the improvement in LTM EBITDA due to the strong Q4 finish. We have now reduced leverage to the same levels we had prior to the RMT and have line of sight to leverage coming down closer to 1.8x once the HPS sale concludes. 
On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.7 billion based on approximately $1.8 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. In total, liquidity has now increased nearly $1.2 billion from the end of Q1. This gives us considerable flexibility to continue our strategy of M&A, coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth.  
Moving to Slide 12. We continue to see strong momentum on our cost synergy delivery efforts. Due to the funnel we have built that stands in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are increasing our overall target by $50 million to $300 million. To date, we have already executed approximately $175 million of annualized synergies, which is approximately 60% of the overall target and a $25 million increase from prior quarter. 
In total, we delivered approximately 40% of our new $300 million target in 2020, which equaled approximately $115 million of savings. In addition, we expect to deliver an incremental $100 million of savings in 2021, which would bring the cumulative total to approximately 70% at the end of this year. We expect a cumulative 85% to 90% of the $300 million in savings by the end of 2022 with the balance coming in 2023. 
The $50 million increase in the target is largely driven from procurement and direct material-oriented initiatives as the team continues to make good strides both on leveraging the larger spend base of the company as well as executing on the ITV funnel.  ITV is a particular success story. Over the past 6 months, we have conducted over 20 virtual events with our commercial product management and manufacturing teams to both build the funnel and start executing on tangible savings. On the right side of the page, we reported each quarter in terms of our progress on managing decremental margins across the business, and Q4 was no different. 
I will now turn it back over to Vicente to discuss the segments."
334158,703357287,2219442,"Ingersoll Rand Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Ingersoll Rand Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Vik. Moving to Slide 13 and starting with Industrial Technologies and Services. Overall, organic orders were up 1% and revenue down 8%, leading to a book-to-bill of 0.98x. Despite the revenue decline, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 1",1703,"Thanks, Vik. Moving to Slide 13 and starting with Industrial Technologies and Services. Overall, organic orders were up 1% and revenue down 8%, leading to a book-to-bill of 0.98x. Despite the revenue decline, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 12% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.1%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. Margins were also up 210 basis points sequentially versus Q3. 
Let me provide more detail on order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up mid-single digits. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows that orders for both were up mid-single digits. Oil-free order rates slightly outperformed those of oil-lubricated and speak to the efforts of leveraging the company's expanded oil-free portfolio and taking advantage of new channels. 
Regarding the regional split for orders in compressors. In the Americas, North America performed comparatively better at up low single digits while Latin America was down high single digits. Mainland Europe was up high single digits, while India, Middle East and Africa saw a nice inflection of high-teens as compared to being down double digits in the past 2 quarters. Asia Pacific continued to perform well with orders up mid-single digits, driven by mid-single-digit growth in China and relatively flattish growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. 
In terms of vacuums and blowers, orders were up mid-teens with strong double-digit growth in the industrial banking and blower portfolio as well as mid-single-digit growth in the longer-cycle Nash Garo vacuum business. Moving next to power tools and lifting. The total business was down low-teens in orders. The tools part of the business was down high single digits in orders compared to down high-teens in Q3. We expect to pivot to positive orders growth in the first half of the year driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities. 
On the right side, you'll see 3 market drivers common to our go-forward segments: sustainability, digitization and shifting demographics. For each segment, I will comment on how they're stepping forward to address these drivers. 
For IPS, the Google Cloud announcement I referenced earlier is a prime example of how the business is expanding comprehensive data digitization that will help increase the customers' ability to improve energy efficiency to support them on achieving their own greenhouse gas emission reduction.  
Let me move now to Slide 14 and the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall, organic orders were up 5%, driven by the medical and Dosatron businesses, which were both up double digits as well as healthy growth in the water and general industrial markets from products like Milton Roy. The momentum on our hygiene solutions continues to build, and we saw some good orders and funnel activity in this rapidly changing end market. 
Revenue was down 8% organically with a major driver being 2 large projects for a large aerospace and defense company that shipped in Q4 of 2019 within the legacy PFS business. Despite the revenue decline, the PST delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 7%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, this segment was already generating a very respectable 27.7% adjusted EBITDA margin back in Q1 of '20. But we're very pleased with how the team continues to transform these businesses now in Q4 with comparable revenue as what we did in Q1, this segment is generating 310 basis points more margin.  
Looking at the market drivers, the Precision and Science team is meeting the demand for more sustainable energy sources and launching into markets like hydrogen. From a digital perspective, mainly of our new pump technology can be controlled, metering and dosing to ensure the safe and reliable dispensing of chemicals for markets around food sanitation and animal health. And the segment's medical business is answering the demand for precise liquid handling technology to help advance personalized medicine research. 
Moving to Slide 15 in the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. Overall, Q4 was another strong quarter for the Specialty Vehicle team. Orders were up 21% organically and continue to get stronger throughout the quarter as the consumer offering continues to gain momentum and market share. We also saw an inflection on growth that continued into Q1. We believe our lithium-ion battery launch is clearly a market leader, and we're taking share in the market. 
Organic revenue was up 8% with improvements across not only vehicles, but also aftermarket parking services. We feel we're in the early stages here and see potential as we expand the info base that can be served ongoing with parts and accessories. Adjusted EBITDA of $46 million increased 40% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.7%. And this represents a 420-basis point improvement versus prior year, again, proving that IRX can be applicable to any business to generate solid improvements. 
We continue to see runway into the future as the team continues to move rapidly on accelerating initiatives like new product launches and end-user life-cycle management. In terms of SVT's market drivers, the segment is recognizing and responding to the sustainability and efficiency demand for zero-emission vehicles to replace gas engine vehicles. For example, in Q4, we saw more than 80% unit growth for lithium cars versus the prior year. 
Digitization is critical also as owners expect connected cars to provide real time data on their vehicle. The data can range from maintenance information, location-based data or infotainment services. And from a demographic shift perspective, we're seeing a higher demand for families to own this [ creation ], zero-emission consumer vehicles used for short distance driving at low speeds.
Moving to Slide 16 and the High Pressure Solutions segment. The business performed largely in line with expectations in the midst of continued lower demand in the oil and gas market. Order and revenue were down 51% and 42%, respectively, which was an improvement over the decline seen both in Q2 and Q3. Nearly 90% of the revenue base continues to come from aftermarket parts and services. And the business delivered positive adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 million and incremental of 40% despite the meaningful revenue decline.  
Beginning with the first quarter of 2021, and due to the recently announced sell, the HPS business will be classified as discontinued operations in all future periods, and we will retroactively adjust the comparable prior periods. Within the income statement, the historical HPS business results will be presented on a single financial statement line below operating income. And upon deal closure, we will account for our 45% interest under the equity method of accounting. This means we will record our proportionate share of the HPS business income or loss for the period through a single financial statement line below operating income. 
Moving to Slide 17. We will review guidance for 2021. Given the pending sale, the HPS segment will not be included in our revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Starting with revenue growth, we expect total Ingersoll Rand revenue to be up high single digits to low double digits on an actual quarter basis. This is comprised of mid-single-digit organic growth across each of the 3 segments. FX is expected to be a low single-digit tailwind for the business on a total year basis given the weakening of the U.S. dollar against many a foreign currency like euro and British pound. FX assumption are based on December 2020 exit rates. 
And finally, we expect the M&A impact to be approximately $60 million, driven primarily by the Tuthill acquisition in the IPS segment. From a patient perspective, we anticipate the first half of the year to be up low double digits, driven by the prior year impact of COVID-19, particularly in China in Q1 2020 and the rest of the world starting in Q2 of 2020. In addition, the FX tailwinds will be most evident during the first half of 2021. Overall growth in the second half of the year is expected to normalize a bit comparatively, but still be up high single digits. As is typical, we expect Q1 to be comparatively lighter than the remaining 2021 quarters.
Based on these revenue assumptions, we're introducing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.23 billion to $1.26 billion. The range includes an expectation for approximately $100 million of incremental transaction-related cost synergies with slight offsets due to 2 factors: first, 35 -- approximately $35 million to $40 million of temporary costs taken out in 2020 returning to the P&L; and second, some expected material and logistics inflation given current dynamics across the global supply chain. We continue to monitor overall inflation and will take appropriate incremental pricing actions if and when warranted.  
In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be greater or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of revenues. And finally, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be between 23% and 24% as compared to the 24.3% rate seen in 2020. 
Moving to Slide 18. As we wrap today's call, I reflect on 2020 as a year that changed us all. We took every measure to prioritize our employees' safety while enabling our essential workers to maintain their livelihood and that is because our employees lean on us. We concentrated on delivering our mission-critical products and services to the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic side because our customers lean on us. And we even proactively reached out to area health care providers to donate the use of sub-degree freezers to store COVID-19 vaccines because communities also lean on us. 
So we take a role as a sustainably-minded, employee-owned industry leader seriously as can be seen by our clear commitment to reducing our impact on the environment. And I am proud of every single team member in our company for how we came together and delivered to protect the interest of all of our stakeholders this year. 
What a difference a year makes. In the threshold of our 1-year anniversary, it's been a momentous ride, creating a differentiated culture and improving the performance of our company. I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A."

Nicole, I'll say that, I mean, we're clearly not immune to what is happening out there in the supply chain, whether delivering or kind of the logistics side. I think the good news here is, I'd say 2 things. One, we have always said that we're in the region for the region. So we're really colocated, our factories, to really support our customers in the regions. And for the most part, a lot of our supply chain is really colocated within kind of close proximity of the factory. So that has not been a material impact to us. 
And I think the second point that it has been good for us is that with the combination of the companies, we have a larger supply chain. And as we have gone through the procurement and the rationalization of suppliers, we're selecting some pretty strong partners that are here to support us from a global perspective and that is kind of leading to having that disruption that perhaps orders are seeing. 
So in terms of ramping the capacity, we just don't foresee that to be an issue. I mean, for the most part, most of our factories, they operate under one-shift operations. And if we have to expand that, that should be just a matter of expanding capacity from incremental shares."

I think like we've said, we had a larger funnel in the course of $350 million. And I think the teams have been executing really well. I think a large part of the, what I call, structural actions are really behind us. Really, most of those have taken much more closer to the merger. And really, what you've seen the momentum building on here is really execution across really the more direct material-focused components of that funnel. So really, what I'll call, procurements as well as now really getting deep into the I2V equation. 
So I think a lot of what you're seeing is just good execution. Like we always said, we have a larger funnel. I'd say that, no, not every idea in the funnel is going to necessarily translate straight to the bottom line. But the team is executing really well. We saw really good momentum, including in fourth quarter. Our annualized synergy number actually increased in fourth quarter compared to where we were in Q3. And so it gave us the confidence to be able to increase the synergy target up to $300 million. 
I think in terms of the second part of your question, what would give us kind of increased confidence to increase it further from there. I think it's really continued execution. What's really ahead of us here is items like procurement, I2V and footprint. And we've always been very disciplined in saying that the footprint piece of this equation was always going to come more so towards the back end of the kind of 3-year plan. Nothing has changed in that perspective. 
But I think now as we're moving into kind of our second year as a combined company, now the teams are really starting to kind of build out that footprint funnel and start to see kind of some of that momentum. So I think that's really, time will tell in terms of being able to kind of increase the number from there, but we're optimistic about where we've gone thus far."

Sure, Julian. I'll take that one. So I think in terms of the incrementals that we're expecting on a total year basis, on an all-in basis, I'd say, growth as well as the some of the synergies as well as some of the other cost headwinds, it's probably closer to about a 35% incremental or slightly higher depending on some of the quarters. But it's a little bit closer to 35% is kind of the implied incremental on an all-in basis, which we actually see is pretty healthy given kind of the puts and takes. And it does, of course, include reinvestment back in the business as we're kind of focused on sustainable organic growth as we move forward. 
I think in terms of the -- some of the moving pieces, I think you hit it on the head here. In addition to just kind of the organic growth in the M&A and some of the FX tailwinds that we called out in guidance, a couple of pieces I'd probably include: one, the $100 million that you spoke to in terms of the incremental synergy savings. That's the year 2 of our transaction-related integration savings. The second item then on the headwinds would really be the $35 million to roughly $40 million of temp costs really coming back into the equation, really ramping as we move through the back half of the year. 
And then we have baked in a nominal amount of inflation. We're not necessarily quantifying the exact dollar amount. But as you would expect, and as Vicente mentioned, we're seeing some of the kind of normal, I'd say, supply chain and logistics-oriented inflation that you would expect. So those are probably the major pieces in terms of the, I'd say, the components that we're seeing. And I think that hopefully kind of characterizes the components."

Sure. Julian, I think we can keep it relatively high level. I mean, we still -- we do definitely have, I'd say, a fair amount of, what I'll call, a continued integration of the company as well as synergy delivery, particularly on the footprint side. So again, I think we've been saying, roughly speaking, on average, about $20 million to $30 million per quarter has typically kind of been what you've seen in terms of cash costs going out the door for execution. I don't think that's a bad placeholder to use for 2021 as you look forward. 
So again, I think the equation still largely holds in terms of the expectations for the savings and the ultimate amount of cash costs going out the door. The only difference is we've really taken up the synergy number. We don't really feel like we need to increase the amount of cash out the door that we're expecting to spend to be able to deliver it. 
So again, I think we're pretty encouraged by how we've managed to execute to a higher number in terms of synergies, but continue to keep the kind of cash outflow is pretty disciplined. But remember, we do have the footprint piece of the equation ahead of us, which, again, does tend to be a little bit more on the cost side."

But I mean look, ITS, I mean, finishing the fourth quarter at 26% margin. And if you remember back in the Gardner Denver days, we said that Industrial segment, we wanted to be in the mid-20s. So -- but we also said that mid-20s is not the cap, and that's just kind of a milestone, and we see more room for improvement from there on. 
When you kind of open the door inside ITS, I mean, we have -- as you know, we're running P&Ls, and we have definitely P&Ls that are way above that kind of mid-20s. So we know that we have a model on how to get an impact, on how to get to that kind of high 20s. 
In the Precision and Science, you saw -- I've made some commentary, very proud of the team. When we started with that business in Q1 of this year, the business was doing a respectable high 20s, and we finished at above 30 on an exit rate. So do we see a potential on that continuing? I'll make the same analogy. Back, the medical business when we had that with Gardner Denver, we were in maybe the mid-20s and we ended up in the 30s. And again, we see -- we also said that, that was just kind of a milestone, but more room for us to improve on that.

I think the way to think about it is, I think ITS will probably be, at least from a year-over-year perspective, probably the healthiest overall just because, frankly, a lot of the cost synergies, as we've mentioned before, are much more isolated or centralized, I should say, in the IT&S segment. 
In terms of the Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles businesses, the incrementals there will be a little bit more muted just on a year-over-year basis. Frankly, a little bit of balancing in terms of the mix, in terms of the top line. If you remember on the Precision Science, we did see a pretty strong in-swell of COVID-related demand in 2020. On the medical side, that actually came at a pretty good margin premium. That is obviously not expected to recur in 2021, replace it a little bit with more what I'll call general industrial and then obviously, some of the investments back in. And then the SVT business kind of comparable. 
As the commercial and golf businesses tend to kind of normalize, you're not going to necessarily see that mix be quite as what it was in 2020. And we obviously continue to invest for new products and growth. So again, I think IT&S is where you'll see it a little bit more pronounced."

I think the answer is no. You've seen the continued momentum. Obviously, the conviction in raising the synergy target of $300 million. I think that we have a pretty good line of sight and pretty good conviction in being able to deliver those procurement and direct material-oriented numbers.  
And then on the G&A side, again, I'd say there's always room for opportunities. But I think, like we've said, the majority of the more structural-related savings and cost take-out, you really saw that much more executed in 2020. So again, I would say that part is kind of largely behind us. But we'll always look for rooms for optimization."

So we feel that the team has taken some good market share and they're not done yet. I mean, was COVID maybe an accelerator or accentuate the decision-making for some consumers to really buy now versus maybe buy later? Yes, it could be. But I think what's exciting is that the momentum has continued. What is also exciting is that the team is getting ready to make some pretty good product launches in 2021, not only the consumer, but also the utility market.

And on industrial technology, heavy investment on product launches. Now that we have the combined 2 companies, particularly on the compressor side, there's going to be a very good cadence of the execution of what we were planning and delivering and working through 2020 that is getting executed and launched now here to the year.

Probably a little bit lower than normal CapEx and some pretty good working capital management. But the good news here, as we look into 2021, we see some strong equal opportunities, whether it be cash interest, which is coming down with all of our fixed interest rate swaps having rolled off in the second half of the year, the tax rate expected to be lower and also some good net working capital opportunity.

Let me begin by welcoming Chris to his role as Vice President of Investor Relations. Chris replaces Vik in the role who was appointed to CFO in June of last year. I'm delighted to be working alongside both of t",1344,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin by welcoming Chris to his role as Vice President of Investor Relations. Chris replaces Vik in the role who was appointed to CFO in June of last year. I'm delighted to be working alongside both of them. Chris previously led corporate development for the company and played a critical role in accelerating our growth strategy, most recently with the acquisitions of Tod Hill and Albin Pump, as well as the completed divestitures of HPS and announced divestiture of Club Car. 
I would like to especially thank Chris for his military service in the U.S. Army. During his military career, he served as infantry officer and ranger, including a deployment in support of operation in [ Iraqi ] Freedom, Chris also held leadership roles in the Oil Guard at Arlington National Cemetery and served as an aide to the President of the United States. Following the military, Chris held roles in finance and investment banking before joining us to direct strategy and corporate development efforts. He is proud veteran who continues to help fellow veterans transitioning from military to civilian life, and he is integral to executing our strategic plan to deliver value for our shareholders. 
Chris is one example among our 16,000 employees who lives our company purpose inside and outside the company. And as you see on Slide 3, anchoring to our purpose is working. We're realizing the achievement of our desired targets. You will hear 3 key themes today. First, we're accelerating our transformation. It's amazing to think a year ago, we closed the Ingersoll Rand industrial transaction. And today, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion of value with 2 strategic divestitures, putting us in a great position to continue our portfolio transformation. 
Second, you will hear about how we are over delivering to our expectations. As you will recall, during the down year of 2020, we controlled decremental margins. And now in the upcycle, we're delivering solid incremental margins. We're delivering strong organic growth in orders and revenue. And that illustrates our organic investments in demand generation and new product development are also working. 
And third, you will hear how Ingersoll Rand's execution excellence, what we call IRX, is becoming our economic engine to unlocking our potential. Our processes are only as good as the team that executes them. Culture and human capital management are key differentiators at Ingersoll Rand. We have a highly engaged workforce who act like owners because they are owners. Every day, our employees make decisions that demonstrate thinking and acting like owners with the power of IRX behind them. 
Our employees all around the world deserve sincere thanks for their adaptability, resiliency, dedication and determination. We will continue supporting our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and mental well-being. And on that point, our thoughts are with everyone dealing with pandemic situations, particularly in India right now. 
Moving to Slide 4. You see the road map we highlighted during our Q3 2020 earnings call. And since then, we have achieved substantial traction. Today, I will concentrate remarks around the last 2 strategies, as we have had a lot of recent momentum across these areas. Starting with Operate Sustainably and turning to Slide 5. Operating Sustainability is one of our strategic pillars, because it engages employees, customers and communities while delivering shareholder returns. In February, we committed to some aggressive targets around climate goals. I am proud that our teams continue to deliver and execute on these goals. 
For example, last week was Earth Day. And our employees participated in planting more than 3,000 trees and collecting over 4,000 pounds of waste while recycling almost 20% of that. However, advancing our ESG journey goes beyond our environmental commitments. It is also about our social and governance actions. Last week, you saw we announced our 2025 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals. We set this goal to accelerate and illustrate our commitment to the representation of talent and the career advancement and sense of being of all employees. 
And actually, one of the boldest and most belonging acts we have done in support our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts, a connection that some may not really make, was around our $150 million equity last September to all of our employees worldwide. Broad-based employee ownership has an equity component, not of the next door. Equity grants and blood-based employee ownership, such as what we did, provide employees a tangible financial stake in company performance, and that benefits employees, families, communities and the economy at large. 
Repeatedly, studies show only represented population increased their earnings and wealth if they are employed in organizations that offer equity grants. And that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner that ties into equity and how we directly impact global ESG efforts. As I said last quarter, we see broad-based employee ownership as a game changer. Our human capital management priorities are part of why we added [indiscernible] sustainably as a strategic pillar. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals are the latest advancement. And we will use IRX as our key enabler to the leader on this role as we do every other critical initiative in our company. 
Moving to Slide 6. We have also used IRX to deliver against our capital allocation strategy. And as we see here, the outcome have been extremely effective. On the first of this month, we completed the majority interest sale of the High Pressure Solutions segment. And a little more than a week later, announced an agreement to sell Club Car. IRX enabled us to accelerate this transaction and make them happen. We have solid processes executed by engaged teams to ensure we always maximize value creation in an expedited way. And that's our special and unique economic engine. 
With these divestitures, we're proud that buyers will continue the commitment to employ on ship, which may be a little unusual for this type of transaction, but as I've said before, it is important to us on many fronts. And with these divestitures, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion in value. 
And on Slide 7, we see a visual illustrating the volume and timing of transaction milestones in our evolution over the last 4 years, including the completed and announced divestitures this month. Last quarter, I mentioned capital allocation is a huge part of my personal focus and I have been actively discussing this with our Board. Those discussions continue. And as we have done all along with our capital allocation strategy, we will inform you when there is something significant to share. 
Aligned with this today, I'll give you some additional color on how we have enhanced our inorganic growth strategy. So let's look at Slide 8. I have mentioned IRX discipline a lot this morning. It is an execution engine to drive change in every area of the business. From our environmental goals and net working capital goals to our new product development goals and our diversity, equity and inclusion goals. IRX has been transformational in helping us with the integration of companies like Tuthill and Albin, as well as helping us with divestitures and accelerating our M&A funnel. You can see our funnel has increased 5x since Q2 of last year. 
The average revenue of the companies in the funnel has increased by more than 50%, and we're moving potential acquisitions through the funnel much faster. And we have not only been integrated Ingersoll Rand and Garden Denver over the past year, but we have also completed a bolt-on acquisition with Tuthill vacuum and blower system being the most recent one. And we have already seen solid progress with Tuthill, such as growth outside the U.S. where we highlighted that as a great opportunity and already received the multimillion-dollar order in Asia Pacific during the first quarter. 
The simultaneous execution of funnel growth, acquisitions and divestitures highlights how IRX enables capabilities to drive significant inorganic growth. I will now turn it over to Vik to provide an update on our financials. Vik?"

We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q1. Q1 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued signs of improvement across industrial end markets. 
Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 29% and 17%, respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. In fact, our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company and set us up well as we move into Q2. In addition, the company continued to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as a catalyst and we remain on track to deliver on our $300 million cost synergy commitment. 
The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $293 million, a year-over-year improvement of $107 million, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 21.4%, a 550 basis point improvement year-over-year. Continuing performance from previous quarters, we also achieved incremental margins of 54% in Q1. One item to note, these financial metrics do not include the High Pressure Solutions segment, which was classified as discontinued operations in Q1 with relevant restatements to prior periods. Given the recently completed sale, we will not report on this segment moving forward. Free cash flow for the quarter was $108 million, up $78 million year-over-year, yielding total liquidity of $2.6 billion at quarter end. 
Turning to Slide 10. For the total company, orders increased 25% and revenue increased 13%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. The IT&S, Precision & Science Technologies and SVT segments all saw double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. 
Starting first with IT&S. The total segment saw 13% FX-adjusted orders growth with strong momentum in core compressor technologies with the Americas showing mid-single-digit orders improvement, EMEA with low 20s percent growth and Asia Pacific with high double-digit improvement. Precision & Science saw 14% FX adjusted orders growth in the quarter. Continued double-digit growth in product lines like Medical and Dosatron drove this performance given their niche end market exposure in areas like lab, life sciences, water and animal health, as well as strong performance from the ARO brand, which primarily serves core industrial markets. 
Specialty Vehicles saw exceptionally strong orders performance, up 89% excluding FX. The team has shown positive orders growth for 5 straight quarters, and Q1 saw continued strong growth in consumer vehicles as well as golf offerings and aftermarket. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.24 for the quarter, an improvement from the prior year level of 1.13. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q2. 
The company delivered $293 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 57% year-over-year. The IT&S, Precision Science and SVT segments all saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong triple-digit margin expansion. And finally, corporate costs came in at $34 million for the quarter, consistent with prior expectations. 
Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $118 million on a continuing [ announced ] basis, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. This compares to free cash flow of $30 million in the first quarter of prior year on a continuing loss basis in what is typically our seasonally weakest quarter from a free cash flow perspective. 
CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million and free cash flow included $10 million of outflows related to the transaction. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 1.9x, which was an 0.1 turn improvement as compared to the prior quarter. This included $184 million cash outflow to fund the Tuthill acquisition, which closed in February and did not include the cash received from the HPS divestiture, which closed in April. We have line of sight to leverage coming down materially to below 1x once the SVC sale is completed, which, as mentioned previously, is expected in Q3 of this year. 
On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.6 billion based on approximately $1.64 billion of cash on hand and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. With our current liquidity and the additional cash we expect to receive from the HPS and SVT divestitures, we will have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. 
I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segment performance."

Overall, organic orders were up 11% and revenue up 9%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.14. In addition to orders and revenue growth, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 57% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.1%, up 610 basis points year-over-year with incremental margin of 65%. 
Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low 20%. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil lubricated products show that orders for both were up above 20%. From a regional split for orders and compressors, in the Americas, North America performed comparatively better at up mid-single digits, while Latin America was up low single digits. MENA Europe was up mid-teens, while India, Middle East and Africa saw continued recovery at up high double digits. Asia Pacific continues to perform well with orders up high double digits driven by high double-digit growth in both China and across the rest of Asia Pacific. 
Moving to vacuum and blowers. Orders were up low double digits on a global basis with double-digit growth across each of our regions. Moving next to the power tools and lifting, The total business was up low double digits in orders and pivoted to positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improved execution. On the right side, we're highlighting the impact that our technologies are having on our customers' sustainability efforts. As you may remember, we acquired Runtech in 2017. 
Runtech designs and manufacturers energy-efficient solutions primarily for use in pulp and paper mills. Since the acquisition, we have done several new product launches, as well as expanded commercially in all the regions, and this has led to a 65% increase in the installed base. This has helped achieve an average of 45% energy savings per installation and saved several billions of gallons of water annually across the installed base. 
Moving to Slide 13 and the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall, organic orders were up 12%, driven by the medical and Dosatron businesses, which serve lab, life sciences and water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits And we also saw strong performance in our more industrial end market oriented products like Milton Roy and ARO. 
The momentum on our hydrogen solution continues to build, and we saw some strong funnel activity. Revenue was up 7% organically, producing a book-to-bill of 1.2. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $67 million, which was up 26%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.2%, up 350 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margins of 59%. 
From a sustainability perspective, we're highlighting our YZ brand Zero-emission authorization and YZ Connect. [indiscernible] is an injection system that authorizes natural gas and hydrogen delivered to communities to help safeguard people. As customers replace legacy systems with our new [ ZO, ] this product is expected to dramatically eliminate emissions of methane. Our customers' authorization programs are further enhanced by YZ Connect, which provides remote monitoring capability through its Internet of Things, cloud platform, which is another example on how our customers can lean on us to help make life better. 
Moving to Slide 14 and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. Overall, Q1 was another very strong quarter for the SVT team. Orders and revenue were up organically 89% and 29%, respectively, driven by continued strength in consumer goals and aftermarket programs. Adjusted EBITDA of $48 million increased 162% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.1%. This represents an outstanding 1,020 basis points improvement versus prior year, showcasing the power of IRX and the team's application to its tool to capture value and market share. And while this business continues to perform well, we made a strategic choice to divest the asset to continue aligning our portfolio to our mission-critical flow creation technologies. 
And as mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong economic outcome with the sale of Club Car to Platinum Equity. It was very important to us in this transaction and in our sale of HPS that we honor our commitment to employee ownership. As a result, employee recipients of our 2020 All Employee Equity Grant will have 50% of the world's best at closing and 50% will be replaced by a new equity-linked program implemented by Platinum. We're very pleased with this outcome for the Club Car team. 
Moving to Slide 15. Given the company's performance in Q1 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our initial revenue guidance was up high single digits to low double digits on a reported basis, comprised of mid-single-digit organic growth across each of the 3 segments. After removing SVT, we're now guiding up low double digits with high single-digit organic growth across each of the segments. FX is expected to continue to be a low single-digit tailwind for the business on a total year basis, given the weakening of the U.S. dollar against major foreign currencies like euro and British pound. 
So that is a slight headwind as compared to the initial guidance. From a pacing perspective, we anticipate the first half of the year to be up mid-teens, while the FX tailwinds remained most evident during the first half of 2021. Overall growth in the second half of the year is expected to normalize a bit comparatively, but still be up high single digits. We have received a lot of questions from investors on supply chain, inflationary pressures and the price cost dynamic. When we issued our initial guidance, we took the anticipated inflationary headwinds into consideration. And while we continue to see pressures around certain commodities and logistics, we have implemented our IRX tools to help mitigate the impact and our teams have executed very well, including price and execution and our continued I2V initiative. 
We do see this environment continue in Q2 and likely after, but we're confident that leveraging our IRX process and working with our suppliers will allow us to continue exceeding our customers' expectations. Based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion, which represents approximately a $45 million improvement from original guidance at the midpoint of the range when excluding SVP. 
In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to remain greater or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to remain 1.5% to 2% of revenue And finally, we expect adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. 
Moving to Slide 16. As we wrap up today's call, Ingersoll Rand is in a great place. 2021 is poised to be a great year. The first quarter provided a solid springboard with momentum into Q2. We take our role as a sustainably minded industry leaders very seriously, one who is focused on employee matters like broad-based ownership, belonging and reducing our impact to the environment. I am proud of all of our employees around the world. Thank you for how you come together every day to be there for our customers, so [indiscernible] and lean on each other and collaborate. 
I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A."

And in other kind of the puts and takes, let me just kind of give you a little bit of color here. I mean Q1, as you pointed out, I mean, very strong across segments and regions, and that is really encouraging. A few things to highlight. In Q1, we're seeing kind of an easier comp on a year-over-year basis due to the cost synergy savings as most of our savings really started to show in April of last year and onwards. 
We're also seeing the solid price realization based on the actions that we took in late 2020 and the continued execution of I2V and other initiatives. As we go into Q2 and the second half, if I kind of break it down by segment, overall, we're still expecting that kind of 30% to 35% incrementals, even with the headwinds around not only the inflation but also the discretionary costs coming back which again speaks to the ongoing synergy delivery efforts as well as our focus on kind of quality of earnings. 
On PST, touching first on Q2, as a reminder and as we highlighted in our guidance, Q2 incrementals will be lower than average to the fact that in 2020, we saw outsized demand for our medical compressors and pumps used again to fight COVID. And the majority of these orders came in, in Q1 and Q2 with shipments mostly in Q2 and Q3. And as a reminder, these shipments on the medical products came in at a premium margin. In addition, PST is seeing some of the inflationary headwinds that most companies are seeing. And while the back half of the year will be more normalized to about that kind of 35% and above. 
And so again, having said all this, I mean, as you know, we're very -- we have a pretty strong process in terms of price, I2V, sourcing that our teams are actively executing to offset any of these kind of headwinds coming in."

In terms of kind of long cycle end markets, most of our long cycle business, as all of you know, is in kind of what we call the Nash [ Gera ] business, as well as the very large compressors, which is kind of the centrifugals compressor that the multistage enteric compressors. 
I will categorize the large multistage centrifugal compressors orders were very strong and positive. This is an area where we are seeing very good start with -- when you think about kind of some of the end markets, we're seeing good momentum on kind of reshoring on some companies as well as markets like renewable energy and general industrial. The Nash [ ARO ] in the first quarter was kind of down, primarily due to the timing, we say.

So we've obviously built some solid backlog now moving in the second quarter. And as Vicente said, typically speaking, you tend to see, particularly for some of the longer-cycle businesses, orders stronger in the first half and shipments stronger in the second half. So typically speaking, you tend to see Q1 seasonally a little bit of the weakest, Q4 seasonally strongest and Q2, Q3 in between.

And I think it was part of kind of our original guidance as well and reason why we -- it definitely increased prices by then. And I think the inflation is really coming in fairly in line with what we plan. 
And I would say, in addition, from a margin perspective, we continue to run the I2V procurement work that we're doing with -- that we did with a synergy integration between Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver, and that's kind of working really well. As we move forward, I mean, clearly, we continue to watch carefully this inflation. And the teams, they're kind of lock and loaded to plan for incremental price increases based on what we're seeing permanently, typically like the logistics side of things. But yes, we're looking at doing a proactively positioning of our products here in this inflationary market. 
And in terms of supply chain, I mean, we're definitely not immune to what you're seeing and hearing a lot about logistics. But I think a couple of things to highlight here. First, we're mostly in the region for the region. And this has proven to be a great strategy for us, not only in these difficult times, but also as companies looking to reshoring, it has been very helpful for us. As a second, we're working with a much larger purchasing power than in the past. And many of these are kind of new partnerships that we're creating. And this really has helped in the supply chain as they want to deliver and have very good terms with us. So I'll say that supply chain, not immune, but I think the team really working very well to get it in control."

I think, Josh, it's exciting to see that We're seeing really good traction on some of the commercial kind of product summit activities that we talked about prior quarters in terms of the combination of Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand. Examples like oil-free product like the Ultima, which was a Gardner Denver technology and launched as Ingersoll Rand in Europe. That saw really, really good momentum in Europe, and that is getting launched now here in the U.S. So expect to see that accelerate the momentum, too, as well. So a combination of those kind of multiple things is not only the market but also a lot of good execution from the team based on these initiatives that we're doing."

I think in Asia Pacific, I'll say it is definitely a combination of both. I mean, definitely, some comps in China for sure. But if you recall, Southeast Asia was definitely not an easy comp yet in the first quarter because, I mean, the Southeast Asia really started getting kind of locked down in the second quarter. So I'll say good combination of maybe easy comps, but at the same time, some really good momentum in China and Asia Pacific. I think this is -- we always highlighted when we created the integration of Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver that we said Asia Pacific is definitely an area of growth and opportunity. And we're doing some very good organic investments. I mean, we spent a lot of new capital equipment to be able to have in region for region in areas like that. And I think it's really, really exciting. 
And we put a real new focus also on emerging markets in Southeast Asia, something that before with the scale that we had, it was very difficult to do. But now we have the scale, and these organic investments are definitely showing some good momentum. I think in the Americas, yes, as you said, particularly in the U.S., Andy, we will see better, easier comps here in the U.S. in the second half. Same in Europe. But I'd say as well, you saw that in Europe, at least on the compressor side, orders, we were kind of in the mid-teens up, while Americas or the U.S. mid-single-digit up. And maybe some of that is a little bit of timing in the sense that the Europeans, as I just mentioned before, they kind of went in faster in terms of doing some of these integration of the product lines that we've spoken about. And now we're seeing that getting implemented in the Americas. 
Again, Americas or the U.S. is a more complex environment where you have a combination of direct [indiscernible] distribution. So we just wanted to be careful. But I think everything is going really well now in the U.S. as well, and we'll see some inflection here as we move forward."

No. Andy, I did to hit the now that, obviously, when we -- so the answer to your question is you're completely right. Obviously, the direct material components of our synergy equation, most notably, the procurement side [ 92b ] are frankly a function of volume. And we did note that even in 2020, obviously, volumes were not at kind of that kind of baseline 2019 levels. What we have seen, for example, procurement, I'd say probably better than expected percent realization on savings. So that has kind of been a nice kind of, I'd say, mitigant to lower volumes. 
Clearly, a higher volume equation clearly can materialize into higher savings. But as you said, some of that was definitely dialed in to the raise when we moved the number from $250 million to $300 million. We'd clearly indicated that the majority, if not all, of that really was coming from the direct material equation. Could there be some potential in the medium term over and above? Perhaps. But I think we want to continue to see how things play themselves out. 
But we're very encouraged and I think the momentum we're seeing, frankly, even still today on the procurement and the I2V side is very encouraging in the context of the price realization and the percent realization that the teams are actually recognizing. So quite encouraged, but I'd say a lot of that was factored into the raise from $250 million to $300 million."

Joe, I mean, I think with that question, we continue to see opportunities. I mean we're pretty pleased with, I think, the momentum we've already seen, but we've been very adamant that there are still a number of, I'd say, levers that we have to pull. First and foremost, I'll start with the tax rate. We mentioned that when we started as kind of 1 year ago, putting 2 companies together, we really didn't have what I would consider to be an optimized tax rate. We've done a lot of work, their tax organization, frankly, our whole organization is a lot of work. We've started to implement a lot of those, I'd say, practices here, and you're already starting to see some good momentum on the tax rate. We've said that we're guiding to approximately 23%. And last year, we were 24% plus. We're already starting to see some good momentum there, and we have line of sight to getting that into the lower 20s over time. 
In terms of the working capital side, absolutely. I think the biggest area that is still ahead of us here is on the inventory side. We have mentioned, I think, a few times that inventory is really almost connected in some respects to a lot of our synergy delivery initiatives. We talk about procurement, and we focus a lot on the savings side, but there's also the -- making sure that you're negotiating terms properly and that you're actually making sure that you're pulling inventory only when you need it. And then also with the footprint side of the equation. Footprint is probably one of the biggest areas of the synergy equation. You really haven't started to see delivery in a material manner just yet. But you can be rest assured here when we start to actually optimize our footprint on the manufacturing side, there will be working capital opportunities there. 
So you put that all together and clearly, there are other areas in terms of the payables and receivables equation that we're working. Clearly, I think working capital is a major opportunity ahead that can help drive us to the levels that you're speaking to here over time. So I think we're encouraged. It's definitely, I'd say, a big focal point of the ops and finance and business teams. And we're going to continue to make momentum here as we move through this year and frankly, it's next."

We typically never do peanut butter across price increases is just based on the specific product lines. And I will say that, as you know, our mission-critical products were very low cost relative to the overall system. And that is very good for us and works really well for us in situations of continuing to be able to increase price because the mission criticalness and the low cost relative to the overall system that our products have. 
In terms of the stickiness and the elasticity, I mean, we have done a lot of work on testing pricing elasticity in many of our end markets and many of our products. We have a really great, I'll say, internal process for scoping that out and making sure that we continue to push the boundaries and the envelopes on that as we see that we can. But only we can only do it only as long as we have differentiated products, which is the other big play in terms of how our I2V has been really strong process for being able to continue to create differentiated products, whether it might be tweaks of innovation that is not only -- so it's a process that is not only for driving direct material costs down, but it's also driving some increase in profit -- price and profitability."

Generally speaking, all of our NPDs that we're really looking at have fasten up sustainability, energy savings and efficiency really baked in. 
So I would say it's probably the single biggest criteria, by and large, when we're looking at innovation. And it's also a huge criteria that we're looking at when we're actually looking at the M&A pipeline. So I'd say it's front and center, trying to quantify exact dollars is probably a little bit tricky, but I would tell you it's probably the single biggest factor. And I would also point to we really made a commitment to it in the context of our ESG goals, which said that you can -- we've obviously spoken to quite a bit.

Let me begin by welcoming Chris to his role as Vice President of Investor Relations. Chris replaces Vik in the role who was appointed to CFO in June of last year. I'm delighted to be working alongside both of t",1337,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin by welcoming Chris to his role as Vice President of Investor Relations. Chris replaces Vik in the role who was appointed to CFO in June of last year. I'm delighted to be working alongside both of them. Chris previously led corporate development for the company and played a critical role in accelerating our growth strategy, most recently with the acquisitions of Tuthill and Albin Pump, as well as the completed divestitures of HPS and announced divestiture of Club Car. 
I would like to especially thank Chris for his military service in the U.S. Army. During his military career, he served as infantry officer and ranger, including a deployment in support of operation Iraqi Freedom. Chris also held leadership roles in the Old Guard at Arlington National Cemetery and served as an aide to the President of the United States. Following the military, Chris held roles in finance and investment banking before joining us to direct strategy and corporate development efforts. He is a proud veteran who continues to help fellow veterans transitioning from military to civilian life, and he is integral to executing our strategic plan to deliver value for our shareholders. 
Chris is one example among our 16,000 employees who lives our company purpose inside and outside the company. And as you see on Slide 3, anchoring to our purpose is working. We're realizing the achievement of our desired targets. You will hear 3 key themes today. First, we're accelerating our transformation. It's amazing to think a year ago, we closed the Ingersoll Rand industrial transaction. And today, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion of value with 2 strategic divestitures, putting us in a great position to continue our portfolio transformation. 
Second, you will hear about how we are over delivering to our expectations. As you will recall, during the down year of 2020, we controlled decremental margins. And now in the upcycle, we're delivering solid incremental margins. We're delivering strong organic growth in orders and revenue. And that illustrates our organic investments in demand generation and new product development are also working. 
And third, you will hear how Ingersoll Rand's execution excellence, what we call IRX, is becoming our economic engine to unlocking our potential. Our processes are only as good as the team that executes them. Culture and human capital management are key differentiators at Ingersoll Rand. We have a highly engaged workforce who act like owners because they are owners. Every day, our employees make decisions that demonstrate thinking and acting like owners with the power of IRX behind them. 
Our employees all around the world deserve sincere thanks for their adaptability, resiliency, dedication and determination. We will continue supporting our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and mental well-being. And on that point, our thoughts are with everyone dealing with pandemic situations, particularly in India right now. 
Moving to Slide 4. You see the road map we highlighted during our Q3 2020 earnings call. And since then, we have achieved substantial traction. Today, I will concentrate remarks around the last 2 strategies, as we have had a lot of recent momentum across these areas. Starting with Operate Sustainably and turning to Slide 5. Operating Sustainability is one of our strategic pillars, because it engages employees, customers and communities while delivering shareholder returns. In February, we committed to some aggressive targets around climate goals. I am proud that our teams continue to deliver and execute on these goals. 
For example, last week was Earth Day. And our employees participated in planting more than 3,000 trees and collecting over 4,000 pounds of waste while recycling almost 20% of that. However, advancing our ESG journey goes beyond our environmental commitments. It is also about our social and governance actions. Last week, you saw we announced our 2025 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals. We set this goal to accelerate and illustrate our commitment to the representation of talent and the career advancement and sense of belonging of all employees. 
And actually, one of the boldest and most belonging acts we have done in support our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts, a connection that some may not really make, was around our $150 million equity last September to all of our employees worldwide. Broad-based employee ownership has an equity component, not often explored. Equity grants and broad-based employee ownership, such as what we did, provide employees a tangible financial stake in company performance, and that benefits employees, families, communities and the economy at large. 
Repeatedly, studies show only represented population increased their earnings and wealth if they are employed in organizations that offer equity grants. And that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner that ties into equity and how we directly impact global ESG efforts. As I said last quarter, we see broad-based employee ownership as a game changer. Our human capital management priorities are part of why we added Operate Sustainably as a strategic pillar. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals are the latest advancement. And we will use IRX as our key enabler to deliver on this role as we do every other critical initiative in our company. 
Moving to Slide 6. We have also used IRX to deliver against our capital allocation strategy. And as we see here, the outcome has been extremely effective. On the first of this month, we completed the majority interest sale of the High Pressure Solutions segment. And a little more than a week later, announced an agreement to sell Club Car. IRX enabled us to accelerate these transactions and make them happen. We have solid processes executed by engaged teams to ensure we always maximize value creation in an expedited way. And that's our special and unique economic engine. 
With these divestitures, we're proud that buyers will continue the commitment to employ ownership, which may be a little unusual for this type of transaction, but as I've said before, it is important to us on many fronts. And with these divestitures, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion in value. 
And on Slide 7, we see a visual illustrating the volume and timing of transaction milestones in our evolution over the last 4 years, including the completed and announced divestitures this month. Last quarter, I mentioned capital allocation is a huge part of my personal focus and I have been actively discussing this with our Board. Those discussions continue. And as we have done all along with our capital allocation strategy, we will inform you when there is something significant to share. 
Along with this today, I'll give you some additional color on how we have enhanced our inorganic growth strategy. So let's look at Slide 8. I have mentioned IRX discipline a lot this morning. It is an execution engine to drive change in every area of the business. From our environmental goals and net working capital goals to our new product development goals and our diversity, equity and inclusion goals. IRX has been transformational in helping us with the integration of companies like Tuthill and Albin, as well as helping us with divestitures and accelerating our M&A funnel. You can see our funnel has increased 5x since Q2 of last year. 
The average revenue of the companies in the funnel has increased by more than 50%, and we're moving potential acquisitions through the funnel much faster. And we have not only been integrating Ingersoll Rand and Garden Denver over the past year, but we have also completed a bolt-on acquisition with Tuthill Vacuum and Blower Systems being the most recent one. And we have already seen solid progress with Tuthill, such as growth outside the U.S. where we highlighted that as a great opportunity and already received a multimillion-dollar order in Asia Pacific during the first quarter. 
The simultaneous execution of small growth, acquisitions and divestitures highlights how IRX enables capabilities to drive significant inorganic growth. I will now turn it over to Vik to provide an update on our financials. Vik?"

We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q1. Q1 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued signs of improvement across industrial end markets. 
Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 29% and 17%, respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. In fact, our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company and set us up well as we move into Q2. In addition, the company continued to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as a catalyst and we remain on track to deliver on our $300 million cost synergy commitment. 
The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $293 million, a year-over-year improvement of $107 million, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 21.4%, a 550 basis point improvement year-over-year. Continuing performance from previous quarters, we also achieved incremental margins of 54% in Q1. One item to note, these financial metrics do not include the High Pressure Solutions segment, which was classified as discontinued operations in Q1 with relevant restatements to prior periods. Given the recently completed sale, we will not report on this segment moving forward. Free cash flow for the quarter was $108 million, up $78 million year-over-year, yielding total liquidity of $2.6 billion at quarter end. 
Turning to Slide 10. For the total company, orders increased 25% and revenue increased 13%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. The IT&S, Precision & Science Technologies and SVT segments all saw double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. 
Starting first with IT&S. The total segment saw 13% FX-adjusted orders growth with strong momentum in core compressor technologies with the Americas showing mid-single-digit orders improvement, EMEIA with low 20s percent growth and Asia Pacific with high double-digit improvement. Precision & Science saw 14% FX adjusted orders growth in the quarter. Continued double-digit growth in product lines like Medical and Dosatron drove this performance given their niche end market exposure in areas like lab, life sciences, water and animal health, as well as strong performance from the ARO brand, which primarily serves core industrial markets. 
Specialty Vehicles saw exceptionally strong orders performance, up 89% excluding FX. The team has shown positive orders growth for 5 straight quarters, and Q1 saw continued strong growth in consumer vehicles as well as golf offerings and aftermarket. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.24 for the quarter, an improvement from the prior year level of 1.13. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q2. 
The company delivered $293 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 57% year-over-year. The IT&S, Precision Science and SVT segments all saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong triple-digit margin expansion. And finally, corporate costs came in at $34 million for the quarter, consistent with prior expectations. 
Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $118 million on a continuing ops basis, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. This compares to free cash flow of $30 million in the first quarter of prior year on a continuing ops basis in what is typically our seasonally weakest quarter from a free cash flow perspective. 
CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million and free cash flow included $10 million of outflows related to the transaction. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 1.9x, which was an 0.1 turn improvement as compared to the prior quarter. This included $184 million cash outflow to fund the Tuthill acquisition, which closed in February and did not include the cash received from the HPS divestiture, which closed in April. We have line of sight to leverage coming down materially to below 1x once the SVT sale is completed, which, as mentioned previously, is expected in Q3 of this year. 
On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.6 billion based on approximately $1.64 billion of cash on hand and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. With our current liquidity and the additional cash we expect to receive from the HPS and SVT divestitures, we will have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. 
I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segment performance."

Overall, organic orders were up 11% and revenue up 9%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.14x. In addition to orders and revenue growth, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 57% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.1%, up 610 basis points year-over-year with incremental margin of 65%. 
Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low 20%. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products show that orders for both were up above 20%. From a regional split for orders and compressors, in the Americas, North America performed comparatively better at up mid-single digits, while Latin America was up low single digits. Mainland Europe was up mid-teens, while India, Middle East and Africa saw continued recovery at up high double digits. Asia Pacific continues to perform well with orders up high double digits driven by high double-digit growth in both China and across the rest of Asia Pacific. 
Moving to vacuum and blowers. Orders were up low double digits on a global basis with double-digit growth across each of our regions. Moving next to the power tools and lifting, The total business was up low double digits in orders and pivoted to positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improved execution. On the right side, we're highlighting the impact that our technologies are having on our customers' sustainability efforts. As you may remember, we acquired Runtech in 2017. 
Runtech designs and manufacturers energy-efficient solutions primarily for use in pulp and paper mills. Since the acquisition, we have done several new product launches, as well as expanded commercially in all the regions, and this has led to a 65% increase in the installed base. This has helped achieve an average of 45% energy savings per installation and saved several billions of gallons of water annually across the installed base. 
Moving to Slide 13 and the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall, organic orders were up 12%, driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which serve lab, life sciences and water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits And we also saw strong performance in our more industrial end market oriented products like Milton Roy and ARO. 
The momentum on our hydrogen solution continues to build, and we saw some strong funnel activity. Revenue was up 7% organically, producing a book-to-bill of 1.2x. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $67 million, which was up 26%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.2%, up 350 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margins of 59%. 
From a sustainability perspective, we're highlighting our YZ brand Zero Emission Odorization and YZ Connect. ZEO is an injection system that odorizes natural gas and hydrogen delivered to communities to help safeguard people. As customers replace legacy systems with our new ZEO, this product is expected to dramatically eliminate emissions of methane. Our customers' odorization programs are further enhanced by YZ Connect, which provides remote monitoring capability through its Internet of Things, cloud platform, which is another example on how our customers can lean on us to help make life better. 
Moving to Slide 14 and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. Overall, Q1 was another very strong quarter for the SVT team. Orders and revenue were up organically 89% and 29%, respectively, driven by continued strength in consumer, golf and aftermarket programs. Adjusted EBITDA of $48 million increased 162% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.1%. This represents an outstanding 1,020 basis points improvement versus prior year, showcasing the power of IRX and the team's application to its tool to capture value and market share. And while this business continues to perform well, we made a strategic choice to divest the asset to continue aligning our portfolio to our mission-critical flow creation technologies. 
And as mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong economic outcome with the sale of Club Car to Platinum Equity. It was very important to us in this transaction and in our sale of HPS that we honor our commitment to employee ownership. As a result, employee recipients of our 2020 all-employee equity grant will have 50% of the award vest at closing and 50% will be replaced by a new equity-linked program implemented by Platinum. We're very pleased with this outcome for the Club Car team. 
Moving to Slide 15. Given the company's performance in Q1 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our initial revenue guidance was up high single digits to low double digits on a reported basis, comprised of mid-single-digit organic growth across each of the 3 segments. After removing SVT, we're now guiding up low double digits with high single-digit organic growth across each of the segments. FX is expected to continue to be a low single-digit tailwind for the business on a total year basis, given the weakening of the U.S. dollar against major foreign currencies like euro and British pound. 
So that is a slight headwind as compared to the initial guidance. From a phasing perspective, we anticipate the first half of the year to be up mid-teens, while the FX tailwinds remained most evident during the first half of 2021. Overall growth in the second half of the year is expected to normalize a bit comparatively, but still be up high single digits. We have received a lot of questions from investors on supply chain, inflationary pressures and the price cost dynamic. When we issued our initial guidance, we took the anticipated inflationary headwinds into consideration. And while we continue to see pressures around certain commodities and logistics, we have implemented our IRX tools to help mitigate the impact and our teams have executed very well, including price and execution and our continued I2V initiative. 
We do see this environment continue in Q2 and likely after, but we're confident that leveraging our IRX process and working with our suppliers will allow us to continue exceeding our customers' expectations. Based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion, which represents approximately a $45 million improvement from original guidance at the midpoint of the range when excluding SVT. 
In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to remain greater or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to remain 1.5% to 2% of revenue And finally, we expect adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. 
Moving to Slide 16. As we wrap up today's call, Ingersoll Rand is in a great place. 2021 is poised to be a great year. The first quarter provided a solid springboard with momentum into Q2. We take our role as a sustainably minded industry leader very seriously, one who is focused on employee matters like broad-based ownership, belonging and reducing our impact to the environment. I am proud of all of our employees around the world. Thank you for how you come together every day to be there for our customers, solve problems and lean on each other and collaborate. 
I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A."

And in other kind of the puts and takes, let me just kind of give you a little bit of color here. I mean Q1, as you pointed out, I mean, very strong across segments and regions, and that is really encouraging. A few things to highlight. In Q1, we're seeing kind of an easier comp on a year-over-year basis due to the cost synergy savings as most of our savings really started to show in April of last year and onwards. 
We're also seeing the solid price realization based on the actions that we took in late 2020 and the continued execution of I2V and other initiatives. As we go into Q2 and the second half, if I kind of break it down by segment, ITS, overall, we're still expecting that kind of 30% to 35% incrementals, even with the headwinds around not only the inflation but also the discretionary costs coming back which again speaks to the ongoing synergy delivery efforts as well as our focus on kind of quality of earnings. 
On PST, touching first on Q2, as a reminder and as we highlighted in our guidance, Q2 incrementals will be lower than average to the fact that in 2020, we saw outsized demand for our medical compressors and pumps used again to fight COVID. And the majority of these orders came in, in Q1 and Q2 with shipments mostly in Q2 and Q3. And as a reminder, these shipments on the medical products came in at a premium margin. In addition, PST is seeing some of the inflationary headwinds that most companies are seeing. And while the back half of the year will be more normalized to about that kind of 35% and above. 
And so again, having said all this, I mean, as you know, we're very -- we have a pretty strong process in terms of price, I2V, sourcing that our teams are actively executing to offset any of these kind of headwinds coming in."

Again, we're not going to go crazy on the market. We'll continue to stay very disciplined in this environment. We buy companies that are a strategic fit.

In terms of kind of long cycle end markets, most of our long cycle business, as all of you know, is in kind of what we call the Nash/Garo business, as well as the very large compressors, which is kind of the centrifugal compressor that the multistage centrifugal compressors. 
I will categorize the large multistage centrifugal compressors,  orders were very strong and positive. This is an area where we are seeing very good start with -- when you think about kind of some of the end markets, we're seeing good momentum on kind of reshoring on some companies as well as markets like renewable energy and general industrial. The Nash/Garo in the first quarter was kind of down, primarily due to the timing, we say. If you think about the Nash/Garo is one business that changes quarter-to-quarter, so we kind of think to look at it a bit more from a first half compare year-on-year. And the funnel still continues to be highly active. And just as a reminder, that business in the fourth quarter saw very positive orders in kind of the mid to high single-digit order cycle."

And Mike, I think on your first part of your question with regards to kind of seasonality and kind of how we're thinking about the backdrop. I don't think we're thinking about it much differently than you've seen from a historical perspective. Obviously, strong first quarter. I think we're very encouraged by the orders profile where in IT&S and Precision & Science, you had book-to-bill of, I think, 1.14, 1.20, respectively. So we've obviously built some solid backlog now moving in the second quarter. And as Vicente said, typically speaking, you tend to see, particularly for some of the longer-cycle businesses, orders stronger in the first half and shipments stronger in the second half. So typically speaking, you tend to see Q1 seasonally a little bit of the weakest, Q4 seasonally strongest and Q2, Q3 in between. I don't think you're going to see anything dramatically different in the context of the phasing or how we think about seasonality here in the context of 2021."

And I think it was part of kind of our original guidance as well and reason why we -- it definitely increased prices by then. And I think the inflation is really coming in fairly in line with what we planned. 
And I would say, in addition, from a margin perspective, we continue to run the I2V procurement work that we're doing with -- that we did with the synergy integration between Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver, and that's kind of working really well. As we move forward, I mean, clearly, we continue to watch carefully this inflation. And the teams, they're kind of lock and loaded to plan for incremental price increases based on what we're seeing permanently, typically like the logistics side of things. But yes, we're looking at doing a proactively positioning of our products here in this inflationary market. 
And in terms of supply chain, I mean, we're definitely not immune to what you're seeing and hearing a lot about logistics. But I think a couple of things to highlight here. First, we're mostly in the region for the region. And this has proven to be a great strategy for us, not only in these difficult times, but also as companies looking to reshoring, it has been very helpful for us. As a second, we're working with a much larger purchasing power than in the past. And many of these are kind of new partnerships that we're creating. And this really has helped in the supply chain as they want to deliver and have very good terms with us. So I'll say that supply chain, not immune, but I think the team really working very well to get it in control."

I think on the timing, as kind of alluded, I think we've been very thoughtful on the timing. We said that we want to create stability, but at the same time, we want to improve some of these companies so we can maximize the value that we could generate. And at the same time, we did it in a way that we want to have some sort of visibility to the funnel. So in parallel, we've been working on all these aspects, not only the divestitures, but also accelerating the funnel. And you can see how some of the statistics on the funnel. And we're excited that the funnel is 5x what we had even last year. The average revenue size per company is more than 50% and the velocity, which is really important, has been cut by half.

I would tell you, all of the regions as well as the power tools business inclusive continuing to show good momentum. And I think some of the commercial initiatives that we also have. Vicente just spoke to, continuing to see good aftermarket traction. We're seeing a little bit outsized OE right now, which we think is a good thing as we kind of start to show more of that shift into aftermarket and build from that 40% kind of baseline we have right now of aftermarket sales, that will obviously help as well.

And that was basically up in the kind of 20s range, the industrial vacuum. 
Our industrial vacuum is really collocated within kind of large OEMs and OEMs. We always said that industrial vacuum was always a leading -- a good leading indicator for industrial recovery. And it is very exciting to continue to see that momentum happening on that industrial vacuum side of the business. So I think that's very good news for what the industrial recovery market is seeing. 
In terms of some of the other things, it's actually also good momentum based on a lot of the self-help initiatives on the commercial side. I think, Josh, it's exciting to see that we're seeing really good traction on some of the commercial kind of product summit activities that we talked about prior quarters in terms of the combination of Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand. Examples like oil-free product like the Ultima, which was a Gardner Denver technology and launched as Ingersoll Rand in Europe. That saw really, really good momentum in Europe, and that is getting launched now here in the U.S. So expect to see that accelerate the momentum, too, as well.

I think this is -- we always highlighted when we created the integration of Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver that we said Asia Pacific is definitely an area of growth and opportunity. And we're doing some very good organic investments. I mean, we spent a lot of new capital equipment to be able to have in region for region in areas like that. And I think it's really, really exciting. 
And we put a real new focus also on emerging markets in Southeast Asia, something that before with the scale that we had, it was very difficult to do. But now we have the scale, and these organic investments are definitely showing some good momentum. I think in the Americas, yes, as you said, particularly in the U.S., Andy, we will see better, easier comps here in the U.S. in the second half. Same in Europe. But I'd say as well, you saw that in Europe, at least on the compressor side, orders, we were kind of in the mid-teens up, while Americas or the U.S. mid-single-digit up. And maybe some of that is a little bit of timing in the sense that the Europeans, as I just mentioned before, they kind of went in faster in terms of doing some of these integration of the product lines that we've spoken about. And now we're seeing that getting implemented in the Americas. 
Again, Americas or the U.S. is a more complex environment where you have a combination of direct purchase with distribution. So we just wanted to be careful. But I think everything is going really well now in the U.S. as well, and we'll see some inflection here as we move forward."

No. Andy, I think you hit the nail on the head obviously when we -- so the answer to your question is you're completely right. Obviously, the direct material components of our synergy equation, most notably, the procurement side in I2V are frankly a function of volume. And we did note that even in 2020, obviously, volumes were not at kind of that kind of baseline 2019 level. What we have seen, for example, in procurement, I'd say probably better than expected percent realization on savings. So that has kind of been a nice kind of, I'd say, mitigant to lower volumes. 
Clearly, a higher volume equation clearly can materialize into higher savings. But as you said, some of that was definitely dialed in to the raise when we moved the number from $250 million to $300 million. We'd clearly indicated that the majority, if not all, of that really was coming from the direct material equation. Could there be some potential in the medium term over and above? Perhaps. But I think we want to continue to see how things play themselves out. 
But we're very encouraged and I think the momentum we're seeing, frankly, even still today on the procurement and the I2V side is very encouraging in the context of the price realization and the percent realization that the teams are actually recognizing.

Joe, I mean, I think with that question, we continue to see opportunities. I mean we're pretty pleased with, I think, the momentum we've already seen, but we've been very adamant that there are still a number of, I'd say, levers that we have to pull.",408,"Yes. Joe, I mean, I think with that question, we continue to see opportunities. I mean we're pretty pleased with, I think, the momentum we've already seen, but we've been very adamant that there are still a number of, I'd say, levers that we have to pull. First and foremost, I'll start with the tax rate. We mentioned that when we started as kind of 1 year ago, putting 2 companies together, we really didn't have what I would consider to be an optimized tax rate. We've done a lot of work, their tax organization, frankly, our whole organization has done a lot of work. We've started to implement a lot of those, I'd say, practices here, and you're already starting to see some good momentum on the tax rate. We've said that we're guiding to approximately 23%. And last year, we were 24% plus. We're already starting to see some good momentum there, and we have line of sight to getting that into the lower 20s over time. 
In terms of the working capital side, absolutely. I think the biggest area that is still ahead of us here is on the inventory side. We have mentioned, I think, a few times that inventory is really almost connected in some respects to a lot of our synergy delivery initiatives. We talk about procurement, and we focus a lot on the savings side, but there's also the -- making sure that you're negotiating terms properly and that you're actually making sure that you're pulling inventory only when you need it. And then also with the footprint side of the equation. Footprint is probably one of the biggest areas of the synergy equation. You really haven't started to see delivery in a material manner just yet. But you can be rest assured here when we start to actually optimize our footprint on the manufacturing side, there will be working capital opportunities there. 
So you put that all together and clearly, there are other areas in terms of the payables and receivables equation that we're working. Clearly, I think working capital is a major opportunity ahead that can help drive us to the levels that you're speaking to here over time. So I think we're encouraged. It's definitely, I'd say, a big focal point of the ops and finance and business teams. And we're going to continue to make momentum here as we move through this year and frankly, in next."

We typically never do peanut butter across price increases, it's just based on the specific product lines. And I will say that, as you know, our mission-critical products were very low cost relative to the overall system. And that is very good for us and works really well for us in situations of continuing to be able to increase price because of the mission criticalness and the low cost relative to the overall system that our products have. 
In terms of the stickiness and the elasticity, I mean, we have done a lot of work on testing pricing elasticity in many of our end markets and many of our products. We have a really great, I'll say, internal process for scoping that out and making sure that we continue to push the boundaries and the envelopes on that as we see that we can. But only we can only do it only as long as we have differentiated products, which is the other big play in terms of how our I2V has been really strong process for being able to continue to create differentiated products, whether it might be tweaks of innovation that is not only -- so it's a process that is not only for driving direct material costs down, but it's also driving some increase in profit -- price and profitability."

Yes.

Generally speaking, all of our NPDs that we're really looking at have facet of sustainability, energy savings and efficiency really baked in. 
So I would say it's probably the single biggest criteria, by and large, when we're looking at innovation. And it's also a huge criteria that we're looking at when we're actually looking at the M&A pipeline. So I'd say it's front and center. Trying to quantify exact dollars is probably a little bit tricky, but I would tell you it's probably the single biggest factor. And I would also point to we really made a commitment to it in the context of our ESG goals, which you can -- we've obviously spoken to quite a bit. So again, I think it's kind of permeating the culture and now we're actually putting distinct targets and goals that are associated with it as well."

Let me begin by welcoming Chris to his role as Vice President of Investor Relations. Chris replaces Vik in the role who was appointed to CFO in June of last year. I'm delighted to be working alongside both of t",1336,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin by welcoming Chris to his role as Vice President of Investor Relations. Chris replaces Vik in the role who was appointed to CFO in June of last year. I'm delighted to be working alongside both of them. Chris previously led corporate development for the company and played a critical role in accelerating our growth strategy, most recently with the acquisitions of Tuthill and Albin Pump, as well as the completed divestitures of HPS and announced divestiture of Club Car. 
I would like to especially thank Chris for his military service in the U.S. Army. During his military career, he served as infantry officer and ranger, including a deployment in support of operation Iraqi Freedom. Chris also held leadership roles in the Old Guard at Arlington National Cemetery and served as an aide to the President of the United States. Following the military, Chris held roles in finance and investment banking before joining us to direct strategy and corporate development efforts. He is a proud veteran who continues to help fellow veterans transitioning from military to civilian life, and he is integral to executing our strategic plan to deliver value for our shareholders. 
Chris is one example among our 16,000 employees who lives our company purpose inside and outside the company. And as you see on Slide 3, anchoring to our purpose is working. We're realizing the achievement of our desired targets. You will hear 3 key themes today. First, we're accelerating our transformation. It's amazing to think a year ago, we closed the Ingersoll Rand industrial transaction. And today, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion of value with 2 strategic divestitures, putting us in a great position to continue our portfolio transformation. 
Second, you will hear about how we are over-delivering to our expectations. As you will recall, during the down year of 2020, we controlled decremental margins. And now in the upcycle, we're delivering solid incremental margins. We're delivering strong organic growth in orders and revenue. And that illustrates our organic investments in demand generation and new product development are also working. 
And third, you will hear how Ingersoll Rand's execution excellence, what we call IRX, is becoming our economic engine to unlocking our potential. Our processes are only as good as the team that executes them. Culture and human capital management are key differentiators at Ingersoll Rand. We have a highly engaged workforce who act like owners because they are owners. Every day, our employees make decisions that demonstrate thinking and acting like owners with the power of IRX behind them. 
Our employees all around the world deserve sincere thanks for their adaptability, resiliency, dedication and determination. We will continue supporting our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and mental well-being. And on that point, our thoughts are with everyone dealing with pandemic situations, particularly in India right now. 
Moving to Slide 4. You see the road map we highlighted during our Q3 2020 earnings call. And since then, we have achieved substantial traction. Today, I will concentrate remarks around the last 2 strategies, as we have had a lot of recent momentum across these areas. Starting with Operate Sustainably and turning to Slide 5. Operating Sustainability is one of our strategic pillars, because it engages employees, customers and communities while delivering shareholder returns. In February, we committed to some aggressive targets around climate goals. I am proud that our teams continue to deliver and execute on these goals. 
For example, last week was Earth Day. And our employees participated in planting more than 3,000 trees and collecting over 4,000 pounds of waste while recycling almost 20% of that. However, advancing our ESG journey goes beyond our environmental commitments. It is also about our social and governance actions. Last week, you saw we announced our 2025 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals. We set this goal to accelerate and illustrate our commitment to the representation of talent and the career advancement and sense of belonging of all employees. 
And actually, one of the boldest and most belonging acts we have done in support our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts, a connection that some may not really make, was around our $150 million equity last September to all of our employees worldwide. Broad-based employee ownership has an equity component, not often explored. Equity grants and broad-based employee ownership, such as what we did, provide employees a tangible financial stake in company performance, and that benefits employees, families, communities and the economy at large. 
Repeatedly, studies show only represented population increased their earnings and wealth if they are employed in organizations that offer equity grants. And that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner that ties into equity and how we directly impact global ESG efforts. As I said last quarter, we see broad-based employee ownership as a game changer. Our human capital management priorities are part of why we added Operate Sustainably as a strategic pillar. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals are the latest advancement. And we will use IRX as our key enabler to deliver on this role as we do every other critical initiative in our company. 
Moving to Slide 6. We have also used IRX to deliver against our capital allocation strategy. And as we see here, the outcome has been extremely effective. On the first of this month, we completed the majority interest sale of the High Pressure Solutions segment. And a little more than a week later, announced an agreement to sell Club Car. IRX enabled us to accelerate these transactions and make them happen. We have solid processes executed by engaged teams to ensure we always maximize value creation in an expedited way. And that's our special and unique economic engine. 
With these divestitures, we're proud that buyers will continue the commitment to employ ownership, which may be a little unusual for this type of transaction, but as I've said before, it is important to us on many fronts. And with these divestitures, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion in value. 
And on Slide 7, we see a visual illustrating the volume and timing of transaction milestones in our evolution over the last 4 years, including the completed and announced divestitures this month. Last quarter, I mentioned capital allocation is a huge part of my personal focus and I have been actively discussing this with our Board. Those discussions continue. And as we have done all along with our capital allocation strategy, we will inform you when there is something significant to share. 
Along with this today, I'll give you some additional color on how we have enhanced our inorganic growth strategy. So let's look at Slide 8. I have mentioned IRX discipline a lot this morning. It is an execution engine to drive change in every area of the business. From our environmental goals and net working capital goals to our new product development goals and our diversity, equity and inclusion goals. IRX has been transformational in helping us with the integration of companies like Tuthill and Albin, as well as helping us with divestitures and accelerating our M&A funnel. You can see our funnel has increased 5x since Q2 of last year. 
The average revenue of the companies in the funnel has increased by more than 50%, and we're moving potential acquisitions through the funnel much faster. And we have not only been integrating Ingersoll Rand and Garden Denver over the past year, but we have also completed a bolt-on acquisition with Tuthill Vacuum and Blower Systems being the most recent one. And we have already seen solid progress with Tuthill, such as growth outside the U.S. where we highlighted that as a great opportunity and already received a multimillion-dollar order in Asia Pacific during the first quarter. 
The simultaneous execution of small growth, acquisitions and divestitures highlights how IRX enables capabilities to drive significant inorganic growth. I will now turn it over to Vik to provide an update on our financials. Vik?"

We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q1. Q1 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued signs of improvement across industrial end markets. 
Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 29% and 17%, respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. In fact, our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company and set us up well as we move into Q2. In addition, the company continued to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as a catalyst and we remain on track to deliver on our $300 million cost synergy commitment. 
The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $293 million, a year-over-year improvement of $107 million, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 21.4%, a 550 basis point improvement year-over-year. Continuing performance from previous quarters, we also achieved incremental margins of 54% in Q1. One item to note, these financial metrics do not include the High Pressure Solutions segment, which was classified as discontinued operations in Q1 with relevant restatements to prior periods. Given the recently completed sale, we will not report on this segment moving forward. Free cash flow for the quarter was $108 million, up $78 million year-over-year, yielding total liquidity of $2.6 billion at quarter end. 
Turning to Slide 10. For the total company, orders increased 25% and revenue increased 13%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. The IT&S, Precision & Science Technologies and SVT segments all saw double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. 
Starting first with IT&S. The total segment saw 13% FX-adjusted orders growth with strong momentum in core compressor technologies with the Americas showing mid-single-digit orders improvement, EMEIA with low 20s percent growth and Asia Pacific with high double-digit improvement. Precision & Science saw 14% FX adjusted orders growth in the quarter. Continued double-digit growth in product lines like Medical and Dosatron drove this performance given their niche end market exposure in areas like lab, life sciences, water and animal health, as well as strong performance from the ARO brand, which primarily serves core industrial markets. 
Specialty Vehicles saw exceptionally strong orders performance, up 89% excluding FX. The team has shown positive orders growth for 5 straight quarters, and Q1 saw continued strong growth in consumer vehicles as well as golf offerings and aftermarket. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.24 for the quarter, an improvement from the prior year level of 1.13. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q2. 
The company delivered $293 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 57% year-over-year. The IT&S, Precision Science and SVT segments all saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong triple-digit margin expansion. And finally, corporate costs came in at $34 million for the quarter, consistent with prior expectations. 
Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $118 million on a continuing ops basis, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. This compares to free cash flow of $30 million in the first quarter of prior year on a continuing ops basis in what is typically our seasonally weakest quarter from a free cash flow perspective. 
CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million and free cash flow included $10 million of outflows related to the transaction. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 1.9x, which was an 0.1 turn improvement as compared to the prior quarter. This included $184 million cash outflow to fund the Tuthill acquisition, which closed in February and did not include the cash received from the HPS divestiture, which closed in April. We have line of sight to leverage coming down materially to below 1x once the SVT sale is completed, which, as mentioned previously, is expected in Q3 of this year. 
On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.6 billion based on approximately $1.64 billion of cash on hand and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. With our current liquidity and the additional cash we expect to receive from the HPS and SVT divestitures, we will have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. 
I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segment performance."

Overall, organic orders were up 11% and revenue up 9%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.14x. In addition to orders and revenue growth, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 57% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.1%, up 610 basis points year-over-year with incremental margin of 65%. 
Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low 20%. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products show that orders for both were up above 20%. From a regional split for orders and compressors, in the Americas, North America performed comparatively better at up mid-single digits, while Latin America was up low single digits. Mainland Europe was up mid-teens, while India, Middle East and Africa saw continued recovery at up high double digits. Asia Pacific continues to perform well with orders up high double digits driven by high double-digit growth in both China and across the rest of Asia Pacific. 
Moving to vacuum and blowers. Orders were up low double digits on a global basis with double-digit growth across each of our regions. Moving next to the power tools and lifting, The total business was up low double digits in orders and pivoted to positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improved execution. On the right side, we're highlighting the impact that our technologies are having on our customers' sustainability efforts. As you may remember, we acquired Runtech in 2017. 
Runtech designs and manufacturers energy-efficient solutions primarily for use in pulp and paper mills. Since the acquisition, we have done several new product launches, as well as expanded commercially in all the regions, and this has led to a 65% increase in the installed base. This has helped achieve an average of 45% energy savings per installation and saved several billions of gallons of water annually across the installed base. 
Moving to Slide 13 and the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall, organic orders were up 12%, driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which serve lab, life sciences and water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits And we also saw strong performance in our more industrial end market-oriented products like Milton Roy and ARO. 
The momentum on our hydrogen solution continues to build, and we saw some strong funnel activity. Revenue was up 7% organically, producing a book-to-bill of 1.2x. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $67 million, which was up 26%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.2%, up 350 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margins of 59%. 
From a sustainability perspective, we're highlighting our YZ brand Zero Emission Odorization and YZ Connect. ZEO is an injection system that odorizes natural gas and hydrogen delivered to communities to help safeguard people. As customers replace legacy systems with our new ZEO, this product is expected to dramatically eliminate emissions of methane. Our customers' odorization programs are further enhanced by YZ Connect, which provides remote monitoring capability through its Internet of Things, cloud platform, which is another example on how our customers can lean on us to help make life better. 
Moving to Slide 14 and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. Overall, Q1 was another very strong quarter for the SVT team. Orders and revenue were up organically 89% and 29%, respectively, driven by continued strength in consumer, golf and aftermarket programs. Adjusted EBITDA of $48 million increased 162% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.1%. This represents an outstanding 1,020 basis points improvement versus prior year, showcasing the power of IRX and the team's application to its tool to capture value and market share. And while this business continues to perform well, we made a strategic choice to divest the asset to continue aligning our portfolio to our mission-critical flow creation technologies. 
And as mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong economic outcome with the sale of Club Car to Platinum Equity. It was very important to us in this transaction and in our sale of HPS that we honor our commitment to employee ownership. As a result, employee recipients of our 2020 all-employee equity grant will have 50% of the award vest at closing and 50% will be replaced by a new equity-linked program implemented by Platinum. We're very pleased with this outcome for the Club Car team. 
Moving to Slide 15. Given the company's performance in Q1 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our initial revenue guidance was up high single digits to low double digits on a reported basis, comprised of mid-single-digit organic growth across each of the 3 segments. After removing SVT, we're now guiding up low double digits with high single-digit organic growth across each of the segments. FX is expected to continue to be a low single-digit tailwind for the business on a total year basis, given the weakening of the U.S. dollar against major foreign currencies like euro and British pound. 
So that is a slight headwind as compared to the initial guidance. From a phasing perspective, we anticipate the first half of the year to be up mid-teens, while the FX tailwinds remained most evident during the first half of 2021. Overall growth in the second half of the year is expected to normalize a bit comparatively, but still be up high single digits. We have received a lot of questions from investors on supply chain, inflationary pressures and the price cost dynamic. When we issued our initial guidance, we took the anticipated inflationary headwinds into consideration. And while we continue to see pressures around certain commodities and logistics, we have implemented our IRX tools to help mitigate the impact and our teams have executed very well, including price and execution and our continued I2V initiative. 
We do see this environment continue in Q2 and likely after, but we're confident that leveraging our IRX process and working with our suppliers will allow us to continue exceeding our customers' expectations. Based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion, which represents approximately a $45 million improvement from original guidance at the midpoint of the range when excluding SVT. 
In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to remain greater or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to remain 1.5% to 2% of revenue And finally, we expect adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. 
Moving to Slide 16. As we wrap up today's call, Ingersoll Rand is in a great place. 2021 is poised to be a great year. The first quarter provided a solid springboard with momentum into Q2. We take our role as a sustainably minded industry leader very seriously, one who is focused on employee matters like broad-based ownership, belonging and reducing our impact to the environment. I am proud of all of our employees around the world. Thank you for how you come together every day to be there for our customers, solve problems and lean on each other and collaborate. 
I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A."

And in other kind of the puts and takes, let me just kind of give you a little bit of color here. I mean Q1, as you pointed out, I mean, very strong across segments and regions, and that is really encouraging. A few things to highlight. In Q1, we're seeing kind of an easier comp on a year-over-year basis due to the cost synergy savings as most of our savings really started to show in April of last year and onwards. 
We're also seeing the solid price realization based on the actions that we took in late 2020 and the continued execution of I2V and other initiatives. As we go into Q2 and the second half, if I kind of break it down by segment, ITS, overall, we're still expecting that kind of 30% to 35% incrementals, even with the headwinds around not only the inflation but also the discretionary costs coming back which again speaks to the ongoing synergy delivery efforts as well as our focus on kind of quality of earnings. 
On PST, touching first on Q2, as a reminder and as we highlighted in our guidance, Q2 incrementals will be lower than average to the fact that in 2020, we saw outsized demand for our medical compressors and pumps used again to fight COVID. And the majority of these orders came in, in Q1 and Q2 with shipments mostly in Q2 and Q3. And as a reminder, these shipments on the medical products came in at a premium margin. In addition, PST is seeing some of the inflationary headwinds that most companies are seeing. And while the back half of the year will be more normalized to about that kind of 35% and above. 
And so again, having said all this, I mean, as you know, we're very -- we have a pretty strong process in terms of price, I2V, sourcing that our teams are actively executing to offset any of these kind of headwinds coming in."

Again, we're not going to go crazy on the market. We'll continue to stay very disciplined in this environment. We buy companies that are a strategic fit.

So I think that continues to be the exciting piece. 
In terms of kind of how we look at -- we're still going to be this mission-critical high aftermarket. We like the recurring aftermarket side of these rotating components and devices that we have.

Pharma, food and beverage and water and wastewater. In terms of kind of long cycle end markets, most of our long cycle business, as all of you know, is in kind of what we call the Nash/Garo business, as well as the very large compressors, which is kind of the centrifugal compressor that the multistage centrifugal compressors. 
I will categorize the large multistage centrifugal compressors, orders were very strong and positive. This is an area where we are seeing very good start with -- when you think about kind of some of the end markets, we're seeing good momentum on kind of reshoring on some companies as well as markets like renewable energy and general industrial. The Nash/Garo in the first quarter was kind of down, primarily due to the timing, we say. If you think about the Nash/Garo is one business that changes quarter-to-quarter, so we kind of think to look at it a bit more from a first half compare year-on-year.

And as Vicente said, typically speaking, you tend to see, particularly for some of the longer-cycle businesses, orders stronger in the first half and shipments stronger in the second half.

And I think it was part of kind of our original guidance as well and reason why we -- it definitely increased prices by then. And I think the inflation is really coming in fairly in line with what we planned. 
And I would say, in addition, from a margin perspective, we continue to run the I2V procurement work that we're doing with -- that we did with the synergy integration between Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver, and that's kind of working really well. As we move forward, I mean, clearly, we continue to watch carefully this inflation. And the teams, they're kind of lock and loaded to plan for incremental price increases based on what we're seeing permanently, typically like the logistics side of things. But yes, we're looking at doing a proactively positioning of our products here in this inflationary market. 
And in terms of supply chain, I mean, we're definitely not immune to what you're seeing and hearing a lot about logistics. But I think a couple of things to highlight here. First, we're mostly in the region for the region. And this has proven to be a great strategy for us, not only in these difficult times, but also as companies looking to reshoring, it has been very helpful for us. As a second, we're working with a much larger purchasing power than in the past. And many of these are kind of new partnerships that we're creating. And this really has helped in the supply chain as they want to deliver and have very good terms with us. So I'll say that supply chain, not immune, but I think the team really working very well to get it in control."

So I think the answer is a mid-20s percent EBITDA margin kind of on the ITS segment is, without question, I think where we are targeting this business to be from a more medium-term perspective. 
And I think one thing to add would be really encouraged by the momentum we're seeing, frankly, across all the parts of that business. It's really not coming from one distinct area. I would tell you, all of the regions as well as the power tools business inclusive continuing to show good momentum. And I think some of the commercial initiatives that we also have. Vicente just spoke to, continuing to see good aftermarket traction. We're seeing a little bit outsized OE right now, which we think is a good thing as we kind of start to show more of that shift into aftermarket and build from that 40% kind of baseline we have right now of aftermarket sales, that will obviously help as well. So all good signs and things that we would say, yes, should point to 25% margins definitely being the target here as we think ahead."

I mean, we spoke about this industrial vacuum and blower business to be kind of up low double digits. And when you cannot decompose that, that has the industrial side, kind of brands like Elmo Rietschle and Robuschi and things like that. But included in there is also the vacuum business like Nash, which is kind of more the longer cycle. And as I just mentioned, I mean, Nash was down in the first quarter, which obviously implies that industrial vacuum business was really high. And that was basically up in the kind of 20s range, the industrial vacuum. 
Our industrial vacuum is really collocated within kind of large OEMs and OEMs. We always said that industrial vacuum was always a leading -- a good leading indicator for industrial recovery. And it is very exciting to continue to see that momentum happening on that industrial vacuum side of the business. So I think that's very good news for what the industrial recovery market is seeing. 
In terms of some of the other things, it's actually also good momentum based on a lot of the self-help initiatives on the commercial side. I think, Josh, it's exciting to see that we're seeing really good traction on some of the commercial kind of product summit activities that we talked about prior quarters in terms of the combination of Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand. Examples like oil-free product like the Ultima, which was a Gardner Denver technology and launched as Ingersoll Rand in Europe. That saw really, really good momentum in Europe, and that is getting launched now here in the U.S. So expect to see that accelerate the momentum, too, as well. So a combination of those kind of multiple things is not only the market but also a lot of good execution from the team based on these initiatives that we're doing."

So I'll say good combination of maybe easy comps, but at the same time, some really good momentum in China and Asia Pacific. I think this is -- we always highlighted when we created the integration of Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver that we said Asia Pacific is definitely an area of growth and opportunity. And we're doing some very good organic investments. I mean, we spent a lot of new capital equipment to be able to have in region for region in areas like that. And I think it's really, really exciting. 
And we put a real new focus also on emerging markets in Southeast Asia, something that before with the scale that we had, it was very difficult to do. But now we have the scale, and these organic investments are definitely showing some good momentum. I think in the Americas, yes, as you said, particularly in the U.S., Andy, we will see better, easier comps here in the U.S. in the second half. Same in Europe. But I'd say as well, you saw that in Europe, at least on the compressor side, orders, we were kind of in the mid-teens up, while Americas or the U.S. mid-single-digit up. And maybe some of that is a little bit of timing in the sense that the Europeans, as I just mentioned before, they kind of went in faster in terms of doing some of these integration of the product lines that we've spoken about. And now we're seeing that getting implemented in the Americas. 
Again, Americas or the U.S. is a more complex environment where you have a combination of direct purchase with distribution. So we just wanted to be careful. But I think everything is going really well now in the U.S. as well, and we'll see some inflection here as we move forward."

No. Andy, I think you hit the nail on the head obviously when we -- so the answer to your question is you're completely right. Obviously, the direct material components of our synergy equation, most notably, the procurement side in I2V are frankly a function of volume. And we did note that even in 2020, obviously, volumes were not at kind of that kind of baseline 2019 level. What we have seen, for example, in procurement, I'd say probably better than expected percent realization on savings. So that has kind of been a nice kind of, I'd say, mitigant to lower volumes. 
Clearly, a higher volume equation clearly can materialize into higher savings. But as you said, some of that was definitely dialed in to the raise when we moved the number from $250 million to $300 million. We'd clearly indicated that the majority, if not all, of that really was coming from the direct material equation. Could there be some potential in the medium term over and above? Perhaps. But I think we want to continue to see how things play themselves out. 
But we're very encouraged and I think the momentum we're seeing, frankly, even still today on the procurement and the I2V side is very encouraging in the context of the price realization and the percent realization that the teams are actually recognizing. So quite encouraged, but I'd say a lot of that was factored into the raise from $250 million to $300 million."

Joe, I mean, I think with that question, we continue to see opportunities. I mean we're pretty pleased with, I think, the momentum we've already seen, but we've been very adamant that there are still a number of, I'd say, levers that we have to pull. First and foremost, I'll start with the tax rate. We mentioned that when we started as kind of 1 year ago, putting 2 companies together, we really didn't have what I would consider to be an optimized tax rate. We've done a lot of work, their tax organization, frankly, our whole organization has done a lot of work. We've started to implement a lot of those, I'd say, practices here, and you're already starting to see some good momentum on the tax rate. We've said that we're guiding to approximately 23%. And last year, we were 24% plus. We're already starting to see some good momentum there, and we have line of sight to getting that into the lower 20s over time. 
In terms of the working capital side, absolutely. I think the biggest area that is still ahead of us here is on the inventory side. We have mentioned, I think, a few times that inventory is really almost connected in some respects to a lot of our synergy delivery initiatives. We talk about procurement, and we focus a lot on the savings side, but there's also the -- making sure that you're negotiating terms properly and that you're actually making sure that you're pulling inventory only when you need it. And then also with the footprint side of the equation. Footprint is probably one of the biggest areas of the synergy equation. You really haven't started to see delivery in a material manner just yet. But you can be rest assured here when we start to actually optimize our footprint on the manufacturing side, there will be working capital opportunities there. 
So you put that all together and clearly, there are other areas in terms of the payables and receivables equation that we're working. Clearly, I think working capital is a major opportunity ahead that can help drive us to the levels that you're speaking to here over time. So I think we're encouraged. It's definitely, I'd say, a big focal point of the ops and finance and business teams. And we're going to continue to make momentum here as we move through this year and frankly, in next."

And that is very good for us and works really well for us in situations of continuing to be able to increase price because of the mission criticalness and the low cost relative to the overall system that our products have. 
In terms of the stickiness and the elasticity, I mean, we have done a lot of work on testing pricing elasticity in many of our end markets and many of our products. We have a really great, I'll say, internal process for scoping that out and making sure that we continue to push the boundaries and the envelopes on that as we see that we can. But only we can only do it only as long as we have differentiated products, which is the other big play in terms of how our I2V has been really strong process for being able to continue to create differentiated products, whether it might be tweaks of innovation that is not only -- so it's a process that is not only for driving direct material costs down, but it's also driving some increase in profit -- price and profitability."

Generally speaking, all of our NPDs that we're really looking at have facet of sustainability, energy savings and efficiency really baked in. 
So I would say it's probably the single biggest criteria, by and large, when we're looking at innovation. And it's also a huge criteria that we're looking at when we're actually looking at the M&A pipeline. So I'd say it's front and center. Trying to quantify exact dollars is probably a little bit tricky, but I would tell you it's probably the single biggest factor. And I would also point to we really made a commitment to it in the context of our ESG goals, which you can -- we've obviously spoken to quite a bit.

And",1232,"Thanks, Vik, and good morning to everyone. Before we start, I want to take a moment to reflect. Think about it, one year ago today, we were 5 days away from day one as an integrated company of Gardner Denver and the Ingersoll Rand Industrial segment. And what a year we selected to take on a transformational transaction. Our newly combined company committed to a purpose to lean on us to help you make life better and a set of values that include having the confidence to take on the most difficult problems with humility and integrity. And little did we know, we would be tested so quickly. 
Looking back on 2020, the global pandemic was challenging for everyone. We will have to adapt and learn new skills to ensure our essential workers' safety as they worked to provide issue-critical products and services to serve the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we turned to our innovation and creativity to discover new ways to connect with each other, with our customers and with our partners. I'm proud of every one of our global employees for their resilience, dedication and determination to think and act like owners and protect and nurture our 1-year old organization. 
Our employees are strong. We adapt quickly and move fast. It's part of our culture, and that's not something you can replicate. It's a competitive advantage and we proved it worked for us this year. The backbone and economic engine is our Ingersoll Rand execution excellence, but it's our employees who trust and lead IRX every single day. And thanks to them, we delivered strong results and stand ready to grow in 2021 and beyond. 
Starting on Slide 3. Today, we're going to concentrate our remarks around 3 things: first, how we accelerated our transformation during 2020; second, how we are unlocking our true potential as a company as we successfully pivoted to focus on growth and our portfolio optimization; and third, how our focus on growth is supported through strong business segment performance during Q4 with momentum continuing in Q1. 
Moving to Slide 4. You have seen this before. It's a framework of building a strong foundation, pivoting to growth and optimizing the portfolio, all guided by our 5 strategic imperatives, down on the left-hand side. It is a reminder to what we have been executing against to deliver on our commitment. 
Turning to Slide 5. That framework shows we achieved substantial traction across all 5 strategic imperatives and pivoted quickly to offense around growth and portfolio optimization, from completing the Ingersoll Rand Industrial transaction and integrating complementary cultures to awarding one of the largest equity grants ever given to employees in an industrial company and establishing diversity, equity and inclusion goals. Our 2020 accomplishments, especially in the area of human capital management, are a differentiator. 
We see broad-based employee ownership as a game-changer. It takes performance to a new level. We're thinking and acting like no other. That's one of our core values. It changes the mindset from this is a company I work for to this is my company. It's a massive shift. Employees are highly engaged and active participants in our journey to create long-term value. All of these human capital management priorities are part of why we added operate sustainably as a strategic pillar. And more on that in a minute. 
We enhanced our portfolio through bolt-on acquisitions and also the sale of a majority interest in a High Pressure Solutions segment. Looking ahead to 2021 and beyond, we'll focus on several areas. We're ahead of plan on our integration as we enter year 2. We are increasing our integration cost synergy target by $50 million to $300 million. 
On growth, we're bringing together complementary products across businesses for strategic niche markets such as water. And we're accelerating new product launches into sustainable industrial markets such as hydrogen. All of these while we continue to focus on our strong balance sheet to support our inorganic growth strategy through accretive M&A transactions. 
Let's turn to Slide 6. As we successfully appeal to growth and our portfolio penetration, we are unlocking our maximum potential as a company. Capital allocation is a huge part of my personal focus. And I'll come back to you with more thoughts on this when ready, but we're actively discussing this with the Board. 
To start, last week, we signed an agreement to sell a majority interest in our High Pressure Solutions segment. At the time of close, we will receive approximately $300 million while retaining a 45% common equity ownership in the business moving forward. 
We view the $300 million alone as a good value as it is approximately 24x 2020 adjusted EBITDA and also represents a solid multiple of 2021 expected adjusted EBITDA. The remaining terms of the deal are confidential, and we're not going to comment further, but we view our remaining equity as pure upside in the medium to long term. 
For Ingersoll Rand, the transaction is a meaningful step forward in our transformation. It materially reduces our direct exposure to the cyclical upstream oil and gas market to less than 2% of revenue and results in a much more predictable business performance, and all of these while removing minimal current earnings from the company. 
On the M&A front, at the beginning of this month, we  completed the purchase of Tuthill Vacuum and Blower Systems. The transaction is highly complementary to our vacuum and blower technologies and will operate under the iconic and premium brands of NV Pneumatics and Kinney Vacuum Pumps. As we pivoted to growth, we accelerate investments in IoT, e-commerce and digitization. Last week, you may have seen our announcement with Google Cloud for a 5-year collaboration to advance connectivity across our portfolio. 
With real time data and machine learning for smarter and more innovative products, we are strengthening our capabilities to help our customers be successful for the long term along with recent new products and wins in strategic end markets we have recently shared with you, like hydrogen, life sciences and oil for compressor products. Our work with Google represents one way we are positioning ourselves for accelerated growth in 2021 and beyond.
Unlocking our true potential means being focused on sustainable technologies in high-growth end markets. And it also means being focused on our commitment to environmental, social and governance principles as we see now on Slide 7. Yesterday, we joined a growing number of companies who are embracing their leadership responsibility to help confront the global threat of climate change. The differentiator is that we're placing some ambitious milestones for our ESG efforts, where we're committing to be net zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050, but getting to 60% of this goal in less than 10 years, by 2030. 
In addition, we have also committed to targets for water and waste reduction. As our purpose states, lean on us to help you make life better. We want to be an active participant on this important cause for the long-term sustainability of our planet. 
A key advantage for us is using IRX to deliver the performance needed to achieve our environmental goals. We will provide an ongoing cadence of transparency and disclosure in our second annual sustainability report being published at the end of May. 
I will now turn over the call to Vik to provide an update on financials. Vik?"

Q4 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX, with ongoing signs of improvement across industrial end markets. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in",1209,"Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 8. Q4 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX, with ongoing signs of improvement across industrial end markets. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q4. Total company orders and revenue increased 12% and 13%, respectively, as compared to Q3 levels, with strong double-digit orders momentum across each of the segments. In addition, the company continued to drive outperformance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst.  
The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $344 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8%. This was a 150-basis point improvement from Q3. And on a year-over-year basis, despite mid-single-digit revenue decline, margins increased 300 basis points. And when adjusted to exclude the High Pressure Solutions segment, total company margins improved 350 basis points. 
Given the strong close in Q4, we had our best performance of the year in terms of managing decrementals, with adjusted EBITDA increasing by $30 million on a year-over-year basis despite the $78 million decrease in revenue. As we have stated before, quality of earnings has been a key focus, and you can see the continued momentum we had throughout 2020 on this metric. Cash flow on the balance sheet was another highlight for the quarter as free cash flow increased to $397 million, yielding total liquidity of $2.7 billion at year-end. 
Moving to Slide 9. For the total company, orders increased 2% and revenue declined 7%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. This is a meaningful improvement from the comparable 8% and 11% declines we saw in the third quarter. IT&S, Precision and Science Technologies and Specialty Vehicle Technology segment all saw positive organic orders growth in the quarter.  
Starting first with IT&S. The total segment saw 2% FX-adjusted orders growth with both the Americas and EMEA regions showing mid-single-digit orders improvement for core compressor, blower and vacuum equipment. Precision and Science saw a 6% adjusted orders growth in the quarter, the highest level reached during the entire year. Continued strength in the product lines like Medical and Dosatron, both of which saw double-digit growth, were the major drivers given niche end market exposure in areas like lab, life sciences and water.  
Specialty Vehicles saw continued strong orders performance, up 21% ex FX. Specialty Vehicles showed positive orders growth each quarter in 2020, and Q4 saw a nice balance with continued strong momentum in consumer vehicles as well as double-digit growth in golf as well as aftermarket. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.01 for the quarter. This was much better than the prior year level of 0.92. Given the typical seasonality we see in the fourth quarter, with strong shipments and book-to-bill below 1, we are encouraged by the Q4 2020 book-to-bill being above 1 as it sets up a healthy backlog moving into 2021. 
The company delivered $344 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 10% versus prior year. The IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicle segments all saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and had strong triple-digit margin expansion. The HPS segment continued to show profitability despite depressed revenue levels and performed largely in line with expectations. And finally, corporate costs came in at $32 million for the quarter, consistent with prior expectations and relatively flat to prior year. 
Turning to Slide 10. Quickly touching on the total year. FX-adjusted orders and revenue were down 9% and 13%, respectively, due primarily to the impacts of COVID-19 in both the IT&S and Precision and Science segments as well as the known downturn in the upstream energy markets, which impacted the HPS segment. Despite these headwinds, the business delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of 20%, which is up 60 basis points versus the prior year or 180 basis points excluding HPS. This speaks to the team's ability to execute during differing business cycles as full year decrementals were limited to only 15% and the 3 core segments of IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles all delivered triple-digit adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. This is only possible through the power of IRX as an execution engine to drive change in every area of the business. 
Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $397 million, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing working capital improvements. Inventory management was a particular highlight, with a reduction of nearly $60 million as we were starting to see benefits of many of the operational efficiency projects the team has been deploying as well as the benefit of the improving commercial environment. 
CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million, and free cash flow included $17 million of outflows related to the transaction. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2x, which was a 0.5x improvement as compared to prior quarter due to both the stronger cash generation in the quarter as well as the improvement in LTM EBITDA due to the strong Q4 finish. We have now reduced leverage to the same levels we had prior to the RMT and have line of sight to leverage coming down closer to 1.8x once the HPS sale concludes. 
On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.7 billion based on approximately $1.8 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. In total, liquidity has now increased nearly $1.2 billion from the end of Q1. This gives us considerable flexibility to continue our strategy of M&A, coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth.  
Moving to Slide 12. We continue to see strong momentum on our cost synergy delivery efforts. Due to the funnel we have built that stands in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are increasing our overall target by $50 million to $300 million. To date, we have already executed approximately $175 million of annualized synergies, which is approximately 60% of the overall target and a $25 million increase from prior quarter. 
In total, we delivered approximately 40% of our new $300 million target in 2020, which equaled approximately $115 million of savings. In addition, we expect to deliver an incremental $100 million of savings in 2021, which would bring the cumulative total to approximately 70% at the end of this year. We expect a cumulative 85% to 90% of the $300 million in savings by the end of 2022 with the balance coming in 2023. 
The $50 million increase in the target is largely driven from procurement and direct material-oriented initiatives as the team continues to make good strides both on leveraging the larger spend base of the company as well as executing on the I2V funnel.  I2V is a particular success story. Over the past 6 months, we have conducted over 20 virtual events with our commercial product management and manufacturing teams to both build the funnel and start executing on tangible savings. On the right side of the page, we reported each quarter in terms of our progress on managing decremental margins across the business, and Q4 was no different. 
I will now turn it back over to Vicente to discuss the segments."
334158,703357287,2269498,"Ingersoll Rand Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","Ingersoll Rand Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Vik. Moving to Slide 13 and starting with Industrial Technologies and Services. Overall, organic orders were up 1% and revenue down 8%, leading to a book-to-bill of 0.98x. Despite the revenue decline, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 1",1711,"Thanks, Vik. Moving to Slide 13 and starting with Industrial Technologies and Services. Overall, organic orders were up 1% and revenue down 8%, leading to a book-to-bill of 0.98x. Despite the revenue decline, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 12% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.1%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. Margins were also up 210 basis points sequentially versus Q3. 
Let me provide more detail on order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up mid-single digits. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows that orders for both were up mid-single digits. Oil-free order rates slightly outperformed those of oil-lubricated and speak to the efforts of leveraging the company's expanded oil-free portfolio and taking advantage of these channels. 
Regarding the regional split for orders in compressors. In the Americas, North America performed comparatively better at up low single digits while Latin America was down high single digits. Mainland Europe was up high single digits, while India, Middle East and Africa saw a nice inflection at up high-teens as compared to being down double digits in the past 2 quarters. Asia Pacific continued to perform well with orders up mid-single digits, driven by mid-single-digit growth in China and relatively flattish growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. 
In terms of vacuums and blowers, orders were up mid-teens with strong double-digit growth in the industrial banking and blower portfolio as well as mid-single-digit growth in the longer-cycle Nash Garo vacuum business. Moving next to power tools and lifting. The total business was down low-teens in orders. The tools part of the business was down high single digits in orders compared to down high-teens in Q3. We expect to pivot back to positive orders growth in the first half of the year driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities. 
On the right side, you'll see 3 market drivers common to our go-forward segments: sustainability, digitization and shift in demographics. For each segment, I will comment on how they're stepping forward to address these drivers. 
For ITS, the Google Cloud announcement I referenced earlier is a prime example of how the business is expanding comprehensive data digitization that will help increase the customers' ability to improve energy efficiency to support them on achieving their own greenhouse gas emission reduction.  
Let me move now to Slide 14 and the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall, organic orders were up 5%, driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which were both up double digits as well as healthy growth in the water and general industrial markets from products like Milton Roy. The momentum on our hygiene solutions continues to build, and we saw some good orders and funnel activity in these rapidly changing end markets. 
Revenue was down 8% organically with a major driver being 2 large projects for a large aerospace and defense company that shipped in Q4 of 2019 within the legacy PFS business. Despite the revenue decline, the PST delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 7%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, this segment was already generating a very respectable 27.7% adjusted EBITDA margin back in Q1 of 2020. But we're very pleased with how the team continues to transform these businesses now in Q4 with comparable revenue as what we did in Q1, this segment is generating 310 basis points more margin.  
Looking at the market drivers, the Precision and Science team is meeting the demand for more sustainable energy sources and launching into markets like hydrogen. From a digital perspective, many of our new pump technology can be remotely controlled, metering and dosing to ensure the safe and reliable dispensing of chemicals for markets around food sanitation and animal health. And the segment's Medical business is answering the demand for precise liquid handling technology to help advance personalized medicine research. 
Moving to Slide 15 and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. Overall, Q4 was another strong quarter for the Specialty Vehicle team. Orders were up 21% organically and continue to get stronger throughout the quarter as the consumer offering continues to gain momentum and market share. We also saw an inflection on growth that continued into Q1. We believe our lithium-ion battery launch is clearly a market leader, and we're taking share in the market. 
Organic revenue was up 8% with improvements across not only vehicles, but also aftermarket parking services. We feel we're in the early stages here and see potential as we expand the info base that can be served ongoing with parts and accessories. Adjusted EBITDA of $46 million increased 40% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.7%. And this represents a 420-basis point improvement versus prior year, again, proving that IRX can be applicable to any business to generate solid improvements. 
We continue to see runway into the future as the team continues to move rapidly on accelerating initiatives like new product launches and end-user life-cycle management. In terms of SVT's market drivers, the segment is recognizing and responding to the sustainability and efficiency demand for zero-emission vehicles to replace gas engine vehicles. For example, in Q4, we saw more than 80% unit growth for lithium cars versus the prior year. 
Digitization is critical also as owners expect connected cars to provide real time data on their vehicle. The data can range from maintenance information, location-based data or infotainment services. And from a demographic shift perspective, we're seeing a higher demand for families to own the [ creation ], zero-emission consumer vehicles used for short distance driving at low speeds.
Moving to Slide 16 and the High Pressure Solutions segment. The business performed largely in line with expectations in the midst of continued lower demand in the oil and gas market. Order and revenue were down 51% and 42%, respectively, which was an improvement over the decline seen both in Q2 and Q3. Nearly 90% of the revenue base continues to come from aftermarket parts and services. And the business delivered positive adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 million and incremental of 40% despite the meaningful revenue decline.  
Beginning with the first quarter of 2021, and due to the recently announced sale, the HPS business will be classified as discontinued operations in all future periods, and we will retroactively adjust the comparable prior periods. Within the income statement, the historical HPS business results will be presented on a single financial statement line below operating income. And upon deal closure, we will account for our 45% interest under the equity method of accounting. This means we will record our proportionate share of the HPS business income or loss for the period through a single financial statement line below operating income. 
Moving to Slide 17. We will review guidance for 2021. Given the pending sale, the HPS segment will not be included in our revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Starting with revenue growth, we expect total Ingersoll Rand revenue to be up high single digits to low double digits on an [ actual quarter ] basis. This is comprised of mid-single-digit organic growth across each of the 3 segments. FX is expected to be a low single-digit tailwind for the business on a total year basis given the weakening of the U.S. dollar against many a foreign currency like euro and British pound. FX assumption are based on December 2020 exit rates. 
And finally, we expect the M&A impact to be approximately $60 million, driven primarily by the Tuthill acquisition in the ITS segment. From a patient perspective, we anticipate the first half of the year to be up low double digits, driven by the prior year impact of COVID-19, particularly in China in Q1 2020 and the rest of the world starting in Q2 of 2020. In addition, the FX tailwinds will be most evident during the first half of 2021. Overall growth in the second half of the year is expected to [ mobilize ] a bit comparatively, but still be up high single digits. As is typical, we expect Q1 to be comparatively lighter than the remaining 2021 quarters.
Based on these revenue assumptions, we're introducing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.23 billion to $1.26 billion. The range includes an expectation for approximately $100 million of incremental transaction-related cost synergies with slight offsets due to 2 factors: first, 35 -- approximately $35 million to $40 million of temporary costs taken out in 2020 returning to the P&L; and second, some expected material and logistics inflation given current dynamics across the global supply chain. We continue to monitor overall inflation and will take appropriate incremental pricing actions if and when warranted.  
In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be greater or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of revenues. And finally, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be between 23% and 24% as compared to the 24.3% rate seen in 2020. 
Moving to Slide 18. As we wrap today's call, I reflect on 2020 as a year that changed us all. We took every measure to prioritize our employees' safety while enabling our essential workers to maintain their livelihood and that is because our employees lean on us. We concentrated on delivering our mission-critical products and services to the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic side because our customers lean on us. And we even proactively reached out to area health care providers to donate the use of sub-degree freezers to store COVID-19 vaccines because communities also lean on us. 
So we take our role as a sustainably-minded, employee-owned industry leader seriously as can be seen by our clear commitment to reducing our impact on the environment. And I am proud of every single team member in our company for how we came together and delivered to protect the interest of all of our stakeholders this year. 
What a difference a year makes. In the threshold of our 1-year anniversary, it's been a momentous ride, creating a differentiated culture and improving the performance of our company. I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders.

Nicole, I'll say that, I mean, we're clearly not immune to what is happening out there in the supply chain, whether delivering or kind of the logistics side. I think the good news here is, I'd say 2 things. One, we have always said that we're in the region for the region. So we're really collocated, our factories, to really support our customers in the regions. And for the most part, a lot of our supply chain is really collocated within kind of close proximity of the factory. So that has not been a material impact to us. 
And I think the second point that it has been good for us is that with the combination of the companies, we have a larger supply chain. And as we have gone through the procurement and the rationalization of suppliers, we're selecting some pretty strong partners that are here to support us from a global perspective and that is kind of leading to having that disruption that perhaps others are seeing. 
So in terms of ramping the capacity, we just don't foresee that to be an issue. I mean, for the most part, most of our factories, they operate under one-shift operations. And if we have to expand, that should be just a matter of expanding capacity from incremental shifts."

I think like we've said, we had a larger funnel in the course of $350 million. And I think the teams have been executing really well. I think a large part of the, what I'll call, structural actions are really behind us. Really, most of those have taken much more closer to the merger. And really, what you've seen the momentum building on here is really execution across really the more direct material-focused components of that funnel. So really, what I'll call, procurements as well as now really getting deep into the I2V side of the equation. 
So I think a lot of what you're seeing is just good execution. Like we always said, we have a larger funnel. I'd say that, no, not every idea in the funnel is going to necessarily translate straight to the bottom line. But the team is executing really well. We saw really good momentum, including in fourth quarter. Our annualized synergy number actually increased in fourth quarter compared to where we were in Q3. And so it gave us the confidence to be able to increase the synergy target up to $300 million. 
I think in terms of the second part of your question, what would give us kind of increased confidence to increase it further from there. I think it's really continued execution. What's really ahead of us here is items like procurement, I2V and footprint. And we've always been very disciplined in saying that the footprint piece of this equation was always going to come more so towards the back end of the kind of 3-year plan. Nothing has changed in that perspective. 
But I think now as we're moving into kind of our second year as a combined company, now the teams are really starting to kind of build out that footprint funnel and start to see kind of some of that momentum. So I think that's really, time will tell in terms of being able to kind of increase the number from there, but we're optimistic about where we've gone thus far."

So I think in terms of the incrementals that we're expecting on a total year basis, on an all-in basis, I'd say, growth as well as the some of the synergies as well as some of the other cost headwinds, it's probably closer to about a 35% incremental or slightly higher depending on some of the quarters. But it's a little bit closer to 35% is kind of the implied incremental on an all-in basis, which we actually see is pretty healthy given kind of the puts and takes. And it does, of course, include reinvestment back in the business as we're kind of focused on sustainable organic growth as we move forward. 
I think in terms of the -- some of the moving pieces, I think you hit it on the head here. In addition to just kind of the organic growth in the M&A and some of the FX tailwinds that we called out in guidance, a couple of pieces I'd probably include: one, the $100 million that you spoke to in terms of the incremental synergy savings. That's the year 2 of our transaction-related integration savings. The second item then on the headwinds would really be the $35 million to roughly $40 million of temp costs really coming back into the equation, really ramping as we move through the back half of the year. 
And then we have baked in I'd say a nominal amount of inflation. We're not necessarily quantifying the exact dollar amount. But as you would expect, and as Vicente mentioned, we're seeing some of the kind of normal, I'd say, supply chain and logistics-oriented inflation that you would expect. So those are probably the major pieces in terms of the, I'd say, the components that we're seeing. And I think that hopefully kind of characterizes the components."

Sure. Julian, I think we can keep it relatively high level. I mean, we still -- we do definitely have, I'd say, a fair amount of, what I'll call, a continued integration of the company as well as synergy delivery, particularly on the footprint side. So again, I think we've been saying, roughly speaking, on average, about $20 million to $30 million per quarter has typically kind of been what you've seen in terms of cash costs going out the door for execution. I don't think that's a bad placeholder to use for 2021 as you look forward. 
So again, I think the equation still largely holds in terms of the expectations or the savings and the ultimate amount of cash costs going out the door. The only difference is we've really taken up the synergy number. We don't really feel like we need to increase the amount of cash out the door that we're expecting to spend to be able to deliver it. 
So again, I think we're pretty encouraged by how we've managed to execute to a higher number in terms of synergies, but continue to keep the kind of cash outflow is pretty disciplined. But remember, we do have the footprint piece of the equation ahead of us, which, again, does tend to be a little bit more on the cost side."

But I mean look, ITS, I mean, finishing the fourth quarter at 26% margin. And if you remember back in the Gardner Denver days, we said that Industrial segment, we wanted to be in the mid-20s. So -- but we also said that mid-20s is not the cap, and that's just kind of a milestone, and we see more room for improvement from there on. 
When you kind of open the door inside IT&S, I mean, we have -- as you know, we're running P&Ls, and we have definitely P&Ls that are way above that kind of mid-20s. So we know that we have a model on how to get an impact, on how to get to that kind of high 20s. 
In the Precision and Science, you saw -- I've made some commentary, very proud of the team. When we started with that business in Q1 of this year, the business was doing a respectable high 20s, and we finished at above 30 on an exit rate. So do we see a potential on that continuing? I'll make the same analogy. Back, the Medical business when we had that with Gardner Denver, we were in maybe the mid-20s and we ended up in the 30s. And again, we see -- we also said that, that was just kind of a milestone, but more room for us to improve on that. So we'll comment here maybe sometime soon in terms of kind of how we think about the medium guidance for some of those segments, but we definitely see continued room for improvement from here and beyond."

I'll take that one. I think the way to think about it is, I think ITS will probably be, at least from a year-over-year perspective, probably the healthiest overall just because, frankly, a lot of the cost synergies, as we mentioned before, are much more isolated or centralized, I should say, in the IT&S segment. 
In terms of the Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles businesses, the incrementals there will be a little bit more muted just frankly on a year-over-year basis. Frankly, a little bit of balancing in terms of the mix, in terms of the top line. If you remember on the Precision and Science, we did see a pretty strong in-swell of COVID-related demand in 2020. On the medical side, that actually came at a pretty good margin premium. That is obviously not expected to recur in 2021, replace it a little bit with more what I'll call general industrial and then obviously, some of the investments back in. And then the SVT business kind of comparable. 
As the commercial and golf businesses tend to kind of normalize, you're not going to necessarily see that mix be quite as what it was in 2020. And we obviously continue to invest for new products and growth. So again, I think IT&S is where you'll see it a little bit more pronounced."

I think the answer is no. You've seen the continued momentum. Obviously, the conviction in raising the synergy target to $300 million. I think that we have a pretty good line of sight and pretty good conviction being able to deliver those procurement and direct material-oriented numbers.  
And then on the G&A side, again, I'd say there's always room for opportunities. But I think, like we've said, the majority of the more structural-related savings and cost take-out, you really saw that much more executed in 2020. So again, I would say that part is kind of largely behind us. But we'll always look for room for optimization."

So we feel that the team has taken some good market share and they're not done yet. I mean, was COVID maybe an accelerator or accentuate the decision-making for some consumers to really buy now versus maybe buy later? Yes, it could be. But I think what's exciting is that the momentum has continued. What is also exciting is that the team is getting ready to make some pretty good product launches in 2021, not only the consumer, but also the utility market.

And on industrial technology, heavy investment on product launches. Now that we have the combined 2 companies, particularly on the compressor side, there's going to be a very good cadence of the execution of what we were planning and delivering and working through 2020 that is getting executed and launched now here to the year.

Probably a little bit lower than normal CapEx and some pretty good working capital management. But the good news here, as we look into 2021, we see some strong equal opportunities, whether it be cash interest, which is coming down with all of our fixed interest rate swaps having rolled off in the second half of the year, the tax rate expected to be lower and also some good net working capital opportunity.

And as you can see on Slide 3, anchoring to our purpose, we're realizing the achievement of our desired targets. You will hear 3 key themes today: First, we're effectively allocating capital to advance our portfolio transformation to generate significant value for our shareholders; second, you will hear about how we are outperforming and raising guidance, which illustrates our organic investments in new product development and demand generation are also working; and third, we will touch on our ESG journey. 
I have never been more excited Ingersoll Rand. The combination of a highly engaged workforce who sank and [indiscernible] like owners, and the use of IRX is what makes us highly unique. I want to thank our employees all around the world for their dedication and determination. We continue to support our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and method well-being. 
Moving to Slide 4, our 5 strategic imperatives are how we stay grounded on priorities and areas of focus. You will see on the right-hand side, during Q2, we have achieved substantial traction in all 5 imperatives. Within our sustainably and strategic imperative, we achieved another major milestone that I'll touch on the next slide. 
Moving to Slide 5. A couple of weeks ago, we published our 2020 sustainability report. The report reflects our 2020 ESG data, celebrates our progress and details our further goals with a high focus on measurable targets and accountability. We'll spend more time on this next Friday, during our scheduled ESG and sustainability report investor update. What I want to emphasize right now is the team's strong bias for action over the last year, as you can see on this page. We have focused and deliver on diversity within our Board and extended leadership team, which is now 50% and 43%, respectively. 
We have launched aggressive 2030 and 2050 goals and improve our new product development process to address this growth. We expanded a stockholder [indiscernible] corporate governance changes. And 1 of the things I am most proud of on behalf of our employees is granting $150 million in equity to our employees, which we believe is the largest employee equity grant ever provided by an industrial company. 
We see broad-based employee ownership as a game changer. We know underrepresented populations increase our earnings on wealth if they're employed in organizations that offer equity grants. And that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner that even ties into how directly impact global ESG efforts. And I look forward to sharing more with you next week. 
Moving to Slide 6. The signing of definitive agreements to acquire Seepex and Maximus Solutions, both of which will be compart of the Precision and Science Technology segment, a representative of the key characteristics we're targeting to drive our inorganic growth strategy. Seepex is our estimation, the #2 global progressive cavity pump manufacturer, and it is a highly recognized brand as a premium player in the market that adds a new positive displacement pump technology to our portfolio. Maximus Solutions is a leader player in the agritech software and controls market. With technology, we intend to pull through to other markets and leverage across the Ingersoll Rand portfolio. Both of these companies have shown strong high single-digit to double-digit organic growth since [indiscernible] 2017, and our focus on sustainable end markets that grow well above GDP rates. 
In addition, both have strong aftermarket profiles enhanced by digital revenue streams, including software as a service. We anticipate both acquisitions to yield single-digit post-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiples by year 3 of ownership. With these 2 acquisitions, we're expecting to add approximately $3.8 billion to PST addressable market, which is an impressive 40% expansion. The profile and characteristics of this high-quality, high return on capital and highly strategic acquisitions are indicative of how we're structuring our M&A funnel, which leads us to Slide 7. 
We continue to execute our M&A funnel using IRX at its backbone. Our funnel is comprised of 6 stages and its probability weighted according to likelihood of closing when we calculate our funnel [indiscernible]. For instance, Seepex has been in our funnel for some time. And it was not until the owner became actively engaged, and we were in active [indiscernible] that it was moved from 0% weighted revenue contribution to 50% and then 100% assigning. And now it is out of our funnel calculation. 
Last quarter, we described how our M&A funnel has grown materially since the Ingersoll Rand Gardner demo transaction was completed. At its current state, the funnel size remains approximately 5x the size it was versus Q2 of 2020, with average revenue larger and velocity accelerating minutely. And to be clear, this describes the funnel even after removing the 32 targets we passed on in the second quarter as well as our signed deals of Seepex and Maximus, and it also excludes SPX FLOW. As you can see, we have significant momentum in the funnel on our flywheel is in full motion. 
Regarding SPX FLOW, we saw that they issued a press release this Monday stating that they will pursue strategic alternatives. Our $85 per share offer was preemptive, and fully accounted for SPX FLOW's Investor Day plan, which is ahead of consensus estimates. In terms of SPX FLOW's strategic alternative process, if we participate, we intend to remain disciplined in our approach as we do with all of our M&A transactions, and there can be no assurances that we will confirm our preemptive offer as part of any such process. It is important -- it is very important also to note that when we receive the second rejection from SPX FLOW more than a month ago, we pivoted to executing on other funnel opportunities. 
We have always demonstrated a very decisive and highly disciplined approach with everything we do. And we believe it is much more important now in this current environment. As stated, even with SPX FLOW excluded, our funnel remains as robust as it did last quarter, which exemplifies the volume and quality of our future potential opportunities. And we have sufficient cash on hand to execute on these opportunities with $4.7 billion in liquidity. However, as noted, we intend to remain very disciplined in this environment. 
It is also important to know that we continue to review our capital allocation priorities with our Board and plan to communicate more formally on this topic later in the year. 
I'll now turn the call to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance."

We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q2. Q2 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued performance across industrial end markets. 
Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 48% and 25%, respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. Given the comparisons to 2020 are materially impacted by the prior year impact of COVID, we think comparing this performance in 2019 is a better representation of how the business is improving. And we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing as organic orders in Q2 were up 9% and 6% on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis, respectively, as compared to 2019. Our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company, eclipsing Q1 and setting us up well as we move into Q3. 
Our commitment to delivering $300 million in cost synergies attributable to the Ingersoll Rand Industrial segment acquisition remains intact as we continue to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst. 
The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $292 million, a year-over-year improvement of $75 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8%, a 160 basis point improvement year-over-year. One item to note, these financial metrics do not include the High Pressure Solutions segment or the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment, both of which were classified as discontinued operations as of Q2 with relevant prior periods restated to conform to the current presentation. We will not report on either segment moving forward. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million, yielding total liquidity of $4.7 billion at quarter end, up approximately $2 billion from Q1 as we received the gross proceeds from both divestitures in Q2. This takes our net leverage to 0.2x, a 1.7x improvement from Q1. 
Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, orders increased 40% and revenue increased 19%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. The IT&S and P&ST segments both saw strong double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.14 for the quarter, an improvement from the prior year level of 0.96. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q3 and beyond. 
The company delivered $292 million of adjusted EBITDA, which was an increase of 34% versus prior year. IT&S and P&ST segments both saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong margin expansion. Finally, corporate costs came in at $38 million for the quarter, up year-over-year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs as well as targeted commercial growth investments in areas like demand generation and other targeted strategic investments. We expect corporate costs to remain elevated at comparable levels in both Q3 and Q4 due to the same drivers. 
Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million on a continuing ops basis, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. CapEx during the quarter totaled $12 million and free cash flow included $12 million of outflows related to the transaction. In addition, free cash flow also included $36 million in cash tax payments related to the historical earnings profile of the HPS and SVT segments. 
As is customary in these types of divestitures, cash tax payments are included in flows from continuing operations due to the complexities involved in specific attribution with consolidated returns. However, the $36 million represents our best quantification of the impact. Given our reported financials, including revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow are shown on a continuing no basis, we are calling out the $36 million in cash tax outflows to provide a better representation of the underlying cash flow of the ongoing business. 
From a leverage perspective, we finished at 0.2x, which is a 1.7x improvement as compared to prior quarter, and this included the gross cash proceeds received from both the HPS and SVT divestitures. We expect to pay the cash taxes for both divestitures later in 2021, and if you were to pro forma the Q2 leverage to account for these tax outflows, leverage would have been closer to 0.6x. 
On the right side of the page, we give you the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $4.7 billion based on approximately $3.7 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. We have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. 
Moving to Slide 11. We continue to see strong momentum on our cost synergy delivery efforts. Due to the funnel we have built that stands in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are reaffirming our stated $300 million cost savings target. To date, approximately $250 million of annualized synergies have already been executed or are in motion, which is slightly higher than 80% of the overall target. 
As a reminder and consistent with previous guidance, we delivered approximately 40% of our $300 million target in 2020, which equaled approximately $115 million of savings. In addition, we expect to deliver an incremental $100 million of savings in 2021, which would bring the cumulative total to approximately 70% at the end of this year. We expect a cumulative 85% to 90% up to $300 million in savings by the end of 2022 with the balance coming in 2023. 
The bottom of the page shows the progress we've made across the different areas of synergy delivery, with the most notable progress coming from direct material initiatives in procurement as well as I2V. In addition, we're starting to see some of the initial wave of savings from our footprint actions, and we expect these savings to ramp into 2022. 
On the right side of the page, we did want to highlight that despite the headwinds we have seen on the cost side, largely coming from direct material and logistics as well as some of the expected return of onetime and discretionary costs and strategic growth investments, we do continue to expect to be positive from a price versus cost perspective on a total year basis. This is entirely due to the team's use of IRX to proactively implement and deploy targeted pricing actions in the first half of the year. In addition, we continue to evaluate the overall landscape, particularly with regards to inflation, and are evaluating potential incremental pricing actions for the second half of the year. 
Overall, we expect to achieve further adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the total company in the second half of the year, although not at the same levels we delivered in the first half. 
I will now turn it back over to Vicente to discuss the segments."

In addition, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 41% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margin of 34%. 
Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the mid-40%. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows that orders for both were up above 40%. From a regional split for orders on compressors, in the Americas, North America performed strong at up low 40%, while Latin America was up in the mid-70%. Mainland Europe was up low 50%, while India, Middle East, saw continued strong recovery with order rates up in excess of 100%. Asia Pacific continues to perform well with areas up low 30% driven by low 30% growth in both China and high 20% across the rest of Asia Pacific. 
From a vacuum and blower perspective, orders were up in mid-40s, on a global basis with long double-digit growth across each of our regions. And Power Tools & Lifting, the total business was up high 50% in orders and so continued positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improve execution on new product launches. 
On the right-hand side, we're highlighting 1 of our new exciting products, which is a result of our continued commitment to organic investments in our portfolio. In this case, during Q2, we completed the launch of our new line of refrigerated drive portfolio. That's a bit of a background. The basic function of the air dryer is to remove moisture from the air by cooling it with a refrigerant. Those water vapor is condensed and the air can be easily compressed. 
The result is dry compressed air, which can be used in compressed air equipment without causing any damage. Air dryer technology is sold as an accessory to all rotary oil-lubricated and oil-free air compression technology. So it is a great adjacent technology that increases the total quality of air provided to the customer. This is a very important requirement, especially in oil-free compression where customer demand high air quality in terms of dryness and particulate. 
It is also good to note that it is a great aftermarket generator of the filters or desiccant need to be changed often. In this case, we leverage a technology developed at [indiscernible], which was accompanied owned by legacy Ingersoll Rand. Since the merger of Gardner Denver and IR, not only we have accelerated our organic investments in new products [indiscernible], but we're now leveraging the technology in order to serve Gardner Denver, Ingersoll Rand and in the future, even our champion compressor customers. 
The even more exciting piece here is that we're doing this while helping the environment. This new driver portfolio is 20% more energy efficient and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by over 50%. 
Moving to Slide 13 and the Precision and Science Technology segment, overall, organic orders were up 20%. The driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which serve lab, life science, water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits. And we also saw strong moments in our ARO and [indiscernible] product lines. The momentum in our Haskel Hydrogen Solution business continues to build, and we saw some strong funnel activity. 
Revenue was up 12% organically, which is encouraging, as we have some tough comps due to COVID-related orders and revenue in Q2 2020 for the Medical business. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $71 million, which was up 20%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.7%, up 40 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margins of 33%. 
Today, we want to highlight our hydrogen refueling business to give you an update on where we are and investments we're making. As we have discussed before during our Q4 earnings call, we made investments in developing a hydrogen dispensing unit leveraging our Haskel high-pressure technology, and we're now ready to capture the growth in this business. 
We have line of sight to about $45 million in organic investments over the next 5 years to both build our [indiscernible] capacity and fund ongoing product development in the hydrogen refueling space, with approximately $10 million of this investment expected in the next 12 months. Since our [indiscernible] oil, we have seen our funnel growth 3x to over $250 million in potential projects. And we still feel confident that this is a business where we will see meaningful growth for years to come, driving our decision to expand 2 of our factories in Europe to support anticipated growth. 
In addition, we want to highlight that Ingersoll Rand is designing [indiscernible] a state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling stations to support the power and remote joint venture. 
Moving to Slide 14. Given the comp performance in Q2 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our guidance excludes both the High Pressure Solutions and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment as well as the pending acquisition of Seepex and Maximus. Our prior revenue guidance was up low double digits on a reported basis, comprised of high single-digit organic growth across both of our segments. And we're now open guiding up to be mid-teens in total with low double-digit organic growth across both segments. 
This reflects approximately 250 to 300 basis point growth in organic growth for the total company as compared to prior guidance. FX is expected to continue to be a low single-digit tailwind, and based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion, which represents approximately a $30 million improvement from power guidance at the midpoint of the range. 
We also highlight that these also includes the increased corporate cost of approximately $6 million per quarter for both Q3 and Q4 as compared to prior guidance, as mentioned on the right-hand side of the slide. In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion to remain greater than or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% of revenue. 
And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be approximately 20%, and this does include a $35 million benefit due to a tax restructuring plan that was recently completed, that is reflected approximately 40% in the Q2 rate with the balance in the second half of the year. 
Moving now to Slide 15. As we wrap today's call, Ingersoll Rand brand is in an outstanding place. 2021 is poised to be a great year. To our employees, I want to say thank you for how we come together every day to be there for our customers solve problems, lean on each other and collaborate. We take our role as sustainably minded industry leader seriously, and our employees eagerly embrace IRX to put us in that leadership position. I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A."

As you might recall, during the last earnings, we mentioned that. We were seeing the inflation creeping up in Q4 of 2020, and we acted on that when building the budget for 2021. Since the end of Q1 of 2021 of the year, we have seen inflation, and we call inflation here direct material and logistics continue to increase, which is the reason why we acted on additional pricing actions I'll say those pricing actions are offsetting the incremental inflation that we're expecting to see in the second half. 
With that, we're also continuing to focus on mitigating these headwinds with a very heavy focus on I2V initiatives. So I think in terms of kind of moving forward, I will also categorize direct material inflation as continue to be a headwind, but generally stabilizing. While logistics side we do expect to see continued pressure in the second half of the year compared to the first half, but this is kind of consistently with how we model our business and we are clearly working on a daily basis to ensure that our supply chain team is finding ways to mitigate the potential pressures. And then there beyond as things materialize, and we see good fruit of these continued price increases. Obviously, we expect margin profile to continue to improve."

So maybe that's a good indicator in terms of the feedback that we're seeing from customers that they're kind of feel confident and comfortable about releasing OpEx for some of these large projects. And so at least in our view, that's kind of good news. We also see as I mentioned, good funnel momentum building on some of these kind of hydrogen refueling networks, which obviously that tends to create some good solid investments here that turn into revenue for our business."

And as you would expect, this is our initial view, and we have already launched an IDM part of the IRX with Seepex as part of our integration planning process. as we kind of move now into the next phase of closing the deal and moving into the integration. 
So far, what we see is that we don't see any barrier to get Seepex margins to the to the Precision and Science level. I think it's a business that it is solid with over 40% recurring aftermarket. It has already launched a very meaningful for what we consider to be really strong digital platform, where they've been able to kind of crack the code on creating edge devices for tested pumps, which tend to be highly cost-effective. So we're excited with what we're seeing here with Seepex.

I'll take that one. So yes, I mean, I think, first and foremost, in terms of the second half of the year, as we mentioned, and I think actually even the left side of that page kind of highlights despite some of the inflationary pressures and headwinds that we have been seeing. You've seen I'd say a couple of distinct actions really taken by the team. First, is the proactive kind of pricing measures that we spoke to. I'd say we've talked about this historically from a legacy Gardner number perspective, having a distinct pricing team that's able to be pretty nimble and take actions pretty quickly, particularly in an environment like this and obviously, the first half of the year was no different. 
So I think between some of the proactive pricing measures you saw us taking towards the back half of last year as well as some of the actions we've taken in the first half of this year. I think that's obviously continued to allow us to keep the price cost equation on the positive side. And then the other piece is, obviously, we 100% still committed to the $100 million of incremental synergies that we're expecting to be delivering this year. And interestingly enough, some of those distinct actions are really coming from the direct material side, particularly now starting to see a good influx on the I2V side. 
So you are correct that, yes, we are seeing some of those inflationary headwinds in the back half of the year. I think some of the pricing measures as well as the productivity actions are definitely helping to offset as well as some of those corporate cost headwinds. We do believe that we will continue to see EBITDA margin expansion in the back half of the year, albeit, to your point, not necessarily at the levels that we saw in first half, obviously, given some of the headwinds we're talking about."

And -- but nothing that I will describe as kind of transformational in nature. 
I will also describe them as great companies. And by that, I mean highly recognized brands, market leader, good gross margin, but that we can see a path to improve and we continue to be prudent and seeing that ROIC can be achieved in the mid-teens by year 3. 
So with that in mind, yes, I mean, you're absolutely right in terms of the -- 1 of the common themes of passing is valuation. But I'll say that it kind of varies. Valuation is an important threshold in how we screen deals against our financial metrics. But we're also very focused on future growth profiles of these businesses. And in some cases, we have seen expectations of inflated future growth due to expectation of ongoing COVID-related demand, which we tend to be very disciplined by discounting it. 
So I think it just speaks a lot about the solid process that we have in terms of our diligence that it's not only looking at businesses, but we do a lot of market work, including voice of customer and interviews to ensure that we understand market trends and commercial possibilities."

So these are devices that are highly mission-critical, low cost to the overall process when you put in perspective when a purchase when you buy the product. But they can be high energy users. Same thing with compressors. And a lot of our compressor -- new compressor technology is just massively much better from an efficiency perspective than the old compression technology. 
So in many cases, we have trained our sales teams, our commercial teams to really sell on that value proposition. And this is what we see as 1 of the main drivers when customers want to replace product, they say, but as well help the environment in terms of having a much more energy efficient and with energy continue to increase in countries like -- or areas like Europe and even Asia, there's a larger propensity for customers to go after products that can reduce that energy consumption."

I'll say that also, the team has done some really great product launches. The team overall, they have now relaunched the Gardner Denver brand line of compressors. It is getting really well positioned in the China market. I will also say that before our blower and vacuum business was actually fairly small in a big market, now that we have a larger scale team with the Ingersoll Rand acquisition. We're leveraging the channel and the knowledge of that team into the market to really accelerate the growth on the vacuum and blower business. 
And 1 example that I show even here today with these air treatment -- air treatment revenue right now in China is very low.

So yes, we are seeing inflation, but we're still very much committed to the $100 million of total synergies, of which, obviously, the -- I'd say the procurement direct material component comprises a big component of it. So it's no different than how we've messaged it [indiscernible]. Even coming into the year, we were seeing, I would say, $100 million expectation of synergies and smaller degree of inflation. Clearly, inflationary pressures have probably grown a bit. But those 2 numbers are somewhat distinct, and that's the way we're kind of managing it. 
Clearly, our teams have done a really great job. When you think about the procurement and supply chain organizations, they've now really, I'd say, been able to, I would say, use Rx and use a lot of our internal processes to be able to balance I'd say their attention between both synergy delivery as well as managing a lot of the supply chain and logistics constraints that, frankly, the general market has seen. 
So I think right now, we're extremely pleased. Are we seeing any dramatic push out of savings or anything of that nature compared to our original expectations? No, not in any material manner. I think for us, what we've been seeing here has probably given us a bit of an acceleration in the context of looking at more I2V initiatives as a means to mitigate. So like we said, we're not immune to what's going on, but I think that right now, we're kind of keeping that synergy equation quite balanced to what we originally thought and also opening, I'd say, the team up to, frankly, looking at more I2V initiatives and things like that as cost mitigants."

And how do you think about transforming that opportunity via acquisition versus what you're also doing through your installed base? 
And the second one, if I may just do them both at once, is just, obviously, if you do a large deal, you replaced some of the revenue disappearance from specialty vehicle more quickly. I just wanted to ask you about your comfort with doing smaller deals and how long it takes and whether you think about it that way?"

Thanks, Rob. On the Maximus IoT growth, that is a phenomenal find in terms of an acquisition, and that came from looking at the market from a different kind of sort of angle and perspective in the sense that we had a good pump business called Dosatron that plays really well in the animal health and agricultural market. It is the market-leading nonelectrical pumps. So it basically creates dosing and movement of water just by the flow itself. So it's kind of really unique technology. 
And in most of these kind of highly specialized applications, you can think about those applications like hydroponics. I mean we know demand of the rain, the acreage that is available in the world to continue to grow vegetables and feed animals is kind of shrinking really fast. So more and more, you're moving to indoor farming and hydroponics, which is obviously the way of growing vegetables with the use of water. And here, we have a really great leadership position. 
So when you go to 1 of these indoor farms this, Maximus is the leader in this agritech controlling aspect of being able to control the entire ecosystem of that and where we see a lot of very good place of not only our pumps, but other devices that are inside that we can now actually bundle and kind of complete together the entire package. 
And when you think about that type of process, could we take it and replicate that into a wastewater treatment facility or into any of these other air markets? That is what [ our thesis ] also goes into is that how do you take that Maximus software IoT comprehensive solution and then utilize it and leverage it for other end markets. And that's where we just get super excited. 
I mean, in terms of doing a large deal, I mean, obviously, you could argue that the smaller deals take as much time as large deals. That's what many say. I will say that with the use of IRX right now, we'll be building some incredible processes and muscle, whereas integrating a small or bolt-on deal -- it goes actually quite well. I mean Tuthill or [indiscernible] is a great example where the team in the Americas was able to integrate that pretty much by themselves and in a very rapid way, including the integration of the entire ERP system and in a very highly cost-effective way. 
So do we think that larger deals can give us a bigger, faster scale? Yes, but we also know that larger deals come in with, what I call, a bit of hair in the things that not all larger deals are 100% perfect. And sometimes you need to divest and kind of the couple of businesses that you may not like from those systems from those businesses. So we continue to be excited about our bolt-on and medium-size business acquisitions that we have in our funnel. And we think that the processes that we have will continue to lever how we do deals."

And by that, it has to be strategic deals that make a lot of sense to our product portfolio that makes a lot of sense to how we look at margin expansion and top line growth for the future value of the company. 
Seepex and Maximus are kind of 2, I would say, great businesses that, for example, are growing double-digit growth, great technologies. Maximus already at the margin profile of Precision & Science. Seepex has room to improve, but it's a technology that we like. So I think it's just 1 of those that, in some cases, we look at both. But more important is not the size, it's kind of just the margin expansion that we can generate and make the total company a better so we can continue to see multiple accretion in our overall business."

You're not typically booking those for months out in most regions. But we've also seen a nice tailwind in some of the kind of the larger side, whether that be the centrifugal compressor side, whether that be the [indiscernible] business. So I'd say those are the types of orders that tend to have a 6 to 12 in certain cases, even longer than that kind of order to sale kind of lead time. So the good news here is we've seen a bit of a balance. So I think in the context of orders to revenue. 
Yes, obviously, we have a stronger backlog. I think we have more backlog visibility today than we've had in probably any quarter coming in. Backlogs are up strong double digits and, frankly, even better in certain parts of the business. And yes, we have strong visibility into Q3 at this point in time, pretty much across most of the portfolio. But the good news here is we've also taken some really nice longer cycle orders as we would call them, that kind of now even extend into 2022. So giving us even a little bit more visibility into 2022 than we had, frankly, over the course of the last few months. So I think we're seeing a good balance of both is the answer, Joe."

One is, one, the revenue and earnings profile of the business does tend to be a little bit more back-end weighted in the context of just kind of our earnings profile. 
You've seen that in most years. I would also say the working capital side of the equation tends to allow a pretty seasonal path. This year will probably be no exception here where -- as you can see in the numbers, we have seen some inventory build prudently, frankly, in the back and the front half of the year. A lot of that is positioned quite frankly, for the second half execution, second half orders. 
And so we do expect to see a nice tailwind in capital in the back half of the year. That tends to be, I would say, the kind of the 2 of the biggest contributors. I would also tell you that we've been working really hard steadily on the tax rate. We continue to see good momentum there on the tax position and the cash tax rate for the overall company and 1 that we would expect to continue to see moving into '22 as well. 
So I think there's multiple different levers that we're looking at, and we're pulling. I think we're being very prudent, continued in this environment in terms of deploying cash.

And as you can see on Slide 3, anchoring to our purpose, we're realizing the achievement of our desired targets. You will hear 3 key themes today: First, we're effectively allocating capital to advance our portfolio transformation to generate significant value for our shareholders; second, you will hear about how we are outperforming and raising guidance, which illustrates our organic investments in new product development and demand generation are also working; and third, we will touch on our ESG journey. 
I have never been more excited about the state of Ingersoll Rand. The combination of a highly engaged workforce who think and act like owners, and the use of IRX is what makes us highly unique. I want to thank our employees all around the world for their dedication and determination. We continue to support our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and mental well-being. 
Moving to Slide 4. Our 5 strategic imperatives are how we stay grounded on priorities and areas of focus. You will see on the right-hand side, during Q2, we have achieved substantial traction in all 5 imperatives. Within our operate sustainably strategic imperative, we achieved another major milestone that I'll touch on the next slide. 
Moving to Slide 5. A couple of weeks ago, we published our 2020 sustainability report. The report reflects our 2020 ESG data, celebrates our progress and details our further goals with a high focus on measurable targets and accountability. We'll spend more time on this next Friday, during our scheduled ESG and sustainability report investor update. What I want to emphasize right now is the team's strong bias for action over the last year, as you can see on this page. We have focus and deliver on diversity within our Board and extended leadership team, which is now 50% and 43%, respectively. 
We have launched aggressive 2030 and 2050 goals and improve our new product development process to address these goals. We expanded a stockholder rights through corporate governance changes. And one of the things I am most proud of on behalf of our employees is granting $150 million in equity to our employees, which we believe is the largest employee equity grant ever provided by an industrial company. 
We see broad-based employee ownership as a game changer. We know underrepresented populations increase our earnings on wealth if they're employed in organizations that offer equity grants. And that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner that even ties into how directly impact global ESG efforts. And I look forward to sharing more with you next week. 
Moving to Slide 6. The signing of definitive agreements to acquire Seepex and Maximus Solutions, both of which will become part of the Precision and Science Technologies segment, a representative of the key characteristics we're targeting to drive our inorganic growth strategy. 
Seepex is, by our estimation, the #2 global progressive cavity pump manufacturer, and it is a highly recognized brand as a premium player in the market that adds a new positive displacement pump technology to our portfolio. Maximus Solutions is a leader, player in the agritech software and controls market. With technology, we intend to pull through to other markets and leverage across the Ingersoll Rand portfolio. Both of these companies have shown strong high single-digit to double-digit organic growth since at least lease 2017, and our focus on sustainable end markets that tend to grow well above GDP rates. 
In addition, both have strong aftermarket profiles enhanced by digital revenue streams, including software as a service. We anticipate both acquisitions to yield single-digit post-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiples by year 3 of ownership. With these 2 acquisitions, we're expecting to add approximately $3.8 billion to PST addressable market, which is an impressive 40% expansion. The profiles and characteristics of this high-quality, high return on capital and highly strategic acquisitions are indicative of how we're structuring our M&A funnel, which leads us to Slide 7. 
We continue to execute our M&A funnel using IRX at its backbone. Our funnel is comprised of 6 stages and its probability-weighted according to likelihood of closing when we calculate our funnel size. For instance, Seepex has been in our funnel for some time. And it was not until the owner became actively engaged, and we were in active negotiation that it was moved from 0% weighted revenue contribution to 50% and then 100% assigning. And now it is out of our funnel calculation. 
Last quarter, we described how our M&A funnel has grown materially since the Ingersoll Rand Gardner Denver transaction was completed. At its current state, the funnel size remains approximately 5x the size it was versus Q2 of 2020, with average revenue larger and velocity accelerating minutely. And to be clear, this describes the funnel even after removing the 32 targets we passed on in the second quarter as well as our signed deals of Seepex and Maximus, and it also excludes SPX Flow. As you can see, we have significant momentum in the funnel but our flywheel is in full motion. 
Regarding SPX Flow, we saw that they issued a press release this Monday stating that they will pursue strategic alternatives. Our $85 per share offer was preemptive, and fully accounted for SPX Flow's Investor Day plan, which is ahead of consensus estimates. In terms of SPX Flow's strategic alternative presence, if we participate, we intend to remain disciplined in our approach as we do with all of our M&A transactions, and there can be no assurances that we will confirm our preemptive offer as part of any such process. It is important -- it is very important also to note that when we received the second rejection from SPX Flow more than a month ago, we pivoted to executing on other funnel opportunities. 
We have always demonstrated a very decisive and highly disciplined approach with everything we do. And we believe it is much more important now in this current environment. As stated, even with SPX Flow excluded, our funnel remains as robust as it did last quarter, which exemplifies the volume and quality of our future potential opportunities. And we have sufficient cash on hand to execute on these opportunities with $4.7 billion in liquidity. However, as noted, we intend to remain very disciplined in this environment. 
It is also important to know that we continue to review our capital allocation priorities with our Board and plan to communicate more formally on this topic later in the year. 
I'll now turn the call to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance."

We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q2. Q2 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued performance across industrial end markets. 
Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 48% and 25%, respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. Given the comparisons to 2020 are materially impacted by the prior year impact of COVID, we think comparing this performance in 2019 is a better representation of how the business is improving. And we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing as organic orders in Q2 were up 9% and 6% on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis, respectively, as compared to 2019. Our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company, eclipsing Q1 and setting us up well as we move into Q3. 
Our commitment to delivering $300 million in cost synergies attributable to the Ingersoll Rand Industrial segment acquisition remains intact as we continue to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst. 
The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $292 million, a year-over-year improvement of $75 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8%, a 160 basis point improvement year-over-year. One item to note, these financial metrics do not include the High Pressure Solutions segment or the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment, both of which were classified as discontinued operations as of Q2 with relevant prior periods restated to conform to the current presentation. We will not report on either segment moving forward. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million, yielding total liquidity of $4.7 billion at quarter end, up approximately $2 billion from Q1 as we received the gross proceeds from both divestitures in Q2. This takes our net leverage to 0.2x, a 1.7x improvement from Q1. 
Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, orders increased 40% and revenue increased 19%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. The IT&S and P&ST segments both saw strong double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.14 for the quarter, an improvement from the prior year level of 0.96. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q3 and beyond. 
The company delivered $292 million of adjusted EBITDA, which was an increase of 34% versus prior year. And the IT&S and P&ST segments both saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong margin expansion. Finally, corporate costs came in at $38 million for the quarter, up year-over-year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs as well as targeted commercial growth investments in areas like demand generation and other targeted strategic investments. We expect corporate costs to remain elevated at comparable levels in both Q3 and Q4 due to the same drivers. 
Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million on a continuing ops basis, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. CapEx during the quarter totaled $12 million and free cash flow included $12 million of outflows related to the transaction. In addition, free cash flow also included $36 million in cash tax payments related to the historical earnings profile of the HPS and SVT segments. 
As is customary in these types of divestitures, cash tax payments are included in flows from continuing operations due to the complexities involved in specific attribution with consolidated returns. However, the $36 million represents our best quantification of the impact. Given our reported financials, including revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow are shown on a continuing ops basis, we are calling out the $36 million in cash tax outflows to provide a better representation of the underlying cash flow of the ongoing business. 
From a leverage perspective, we finished at 0.2x, which is a 1.7x improvement as compared to prior quarter, and this included the gross cash proceeds received from both the HPS and SVT divestitures. We expect to pay the cash taxes for both divestitures later in 2021, and if you were to pro forma the Q2 leverage to account for these tax outflows, leverage would have been closer to 0.6x. 
On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $4.7 billion based on approximately $3.7 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. We have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. 
Moving to Slide 11. We continue to see strong momentum on our cost synergy delivery efforts. Due to the funnel we have built that stands in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are reaffirming our stated $300 million cost savings target. To date, approximately $250 million of annualized synergies have already been executed or are in motion, which is slightly higher than 80% of the overall target. 
As a reminder and consistent with previous guidance, we delivered approximately 40% of our $300 million target in 2020, which equaled approximately $115 million of savings. In addition, we expect to deliver an incremental $100 million of savings in 2021, which would bring the cumulative total to approximately 70% at the end of this year. We expect a cumulative 85% to 90% up to $300 million in savings by the end of 2022 with the balance coming in 2023. 
The bottom of the page shows the progress we've made across the different areas of synergy delivery, with the most notable progress coming from direct material initiatives in procurement as well as I2V. In addition, we're starting to see some of the initial wave of savings from our footprint actions, and we expect these savings to ramp into 2022. 
On the right side of the page, we did want to highlight that despite the headwinds we have seen on the cost side, largely coming from direct material and logistics as well as some of the expected return of onetime and discretionary costs and strategic growth investments, we do continue to expect to be positive from a price versus cost perspective on a total year basis. This is entirely due to the team's use of IRX to proactively implement and deploy targeted pricing actions in the first half of the year. In addition, we continue to evaluate the overall landscape, particularly with regards to inflation, and are evaluating potential incremental pricing actions for the second half of the year. 
Overall, we expect to achieve further adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the total company in the second half of the year, although not at the same levels we delivered in the first half. 
I will now turn it back over to Vicente to discuss the segments."

Overall, organic orders were up 41% and revenue up 17%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.15. In addition, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 41% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margin of 34%. 
Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the mid-40%. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows that orders for both were up above 40%. From a regional split for orders on compressors, in the Americas, North America performed strong at up low 40%, while Latin America was up in the mid-70%. Mainland Europe was up low 50%, while India, Middle East, saw continued strong recovery with order rates up in excess of 100%. Asia Pacific continues to perform well with orders up low 30% driven by low 30% growth in both China and high 20% across the rest of Asia Pacific. 
From a vacuum and blower perspective, orders were up in mid-40s, on a global basis with strong double-digit growth across each of our regions. In power tools and lifting, the total business was up high 50% in orders and so continued positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improve execution on new product launches. 
On the right-hand side, we're highlighting one of our new exciting products, which is a result of our continued commitment to organic investments in our portfolio. In this case, during Q2, we completed the launch of our new line of refrigerated drive portfolio. That's a bit of a background. The basic function of the air dryer is to remove moisture from the air by cooling it with a refrigerant. Does the water vapor is condensed and the air can be easily compressed. 
The result is dry compressed air, which can be used in compressed air equipment without causing any damage. Air dryer technology is sold as an accessory to all rotary oil-lubricated and oil-free air compression technology. So it is a great adjacent technology that increases the total quality of air provided to the customer. This is a very important requirement, especially in oil-free compression where customers demand high air quality in terms of dryness and particulate. 
It is also good to note that it is a great aftermarket generator as the filters or desiccant need to be changed often. In this case, we leverage a technology developed at [indiscernible], which was accompanied owned by legacy Ingersoll Rand. Since the merger of Gardner Denver and IR, not only we have accelerated our organic investments in new products [indiscernible], but we're now leveraging the technology in order to serve Gardner Denver, Ingersoll Rand and in the future, even our champion compressor customers. 
The even more exciting piece here is that we're doing this while helping the environment. This new driver portfolio is 20% more energy-efficient and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by over 50%. 
Moving to Slide 13 and the Precision and Science Technology segment, overall, organic orders were up 20% driven by, i.e., the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which serve lab, life science, water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits. And we also saw strong performance in our ARO and Milton Roy product lines. The momentum in our Haskel Hydrogen Solution business continues to build, and we saw some strong funnel activity. 
Revenue was up 12% (sic) [ 13% ] organically, which is encouraging, as we have some tough comps due to COVID-related orders and revenue in Q2 2020 for the Medical business. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $71 million, which was up 20%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.7%, up 40 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margins of 33%. 
Today, we want to highlight our hydrogen refueling business to give you an update on where we are and investments we're making. As we have discussed before during our Q4 earnings call, we made investments in developing a hydrogen dispensing unit leveraging our Haskel high-pressure technology, and we're now ready to capture the growth in this business. 
We have line of sight to about $45 million in organic investments over the next 5 years to both build out our capacity and fund ongoing product development in the hydrogen refueling space, with approximately $10 million of this investment expected in the next 12 months. Since our last call, we have seen our funnel grow 3x to over $250 million in potential projects. And we still feel confident that this is a business where we will see meaningful growth for years to come, driving our decision to expand 2 of our factories in Europe to support anticipated growth. 
In addition, we want to highlight that Ingersoll Rand is designing and developing a state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling stations to support the power and remote joint venture. 
Moving to Slide 14. Given the comp performance in Q2 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our guidance excludes both the High Pressure Solutions and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segments as well as the pending acquisition of Seepex and Maximus. Our prior revenue guidance was up low double digits on a reported basis, comprised of high single-digit organic growth across both of our segments. And we're now open guiding up to be mid-teens in total with low double-digit organic growth across both segments. 
This reflects approximately 250 to 300 basis point growth in organic growth for the total company as compared to prior guidance. FX is expected to continue to be a low single-digit tailwind, and based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion, which represents approximately a $30 million improvement from power guidance at the midpoint of the range. 
We also highlight that these also includes the increased corporate cost of approximately $6 million per quarter for both Q3 and Q4 as compared to prior guidance, as mentioned on the right-hand side of the slide. In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion to remain greater than or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% of revenue. 
And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be approximately 20%, and this does include a $35 million benefit due to a tax restructuring plan that was recently completed, that is reflected approximately 40% in the Q2 rate with the balance in the second half of the year. 
Moving now to Slide 15. As we wrap today's call, Ingersoll Rand brand is in an outstanding place. 2021 is poised to be a great year. To our employees, I want to say thank you for how we come together every day to be there for our customers, solve problems, lean on each other and collaborate. We take our role as sustainably-minded industry leader seriously, and our employees eagerly embrace IRX to put us in that leadership position. I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A."

As you might recall, during the last earnings, we mentioned that we were seeing the inflation creeping up in Q4 of 2020, and we acted on that when building the budget for 2021. Since the end of Q1 of 2021 of the year, we have seen inflation, and we call inflation here direct material and logistics continue to increase, which is the reason why we acted on additional pricing actions. I'll say those pricing actions are offsetting the incremental inflation that we're expecting to see in the second half. 
With that, we're also continuing to focus on mitigating these headwinds with a very heavy focus on I2V initiatives. So I think in terms of kind of moving forward, I will also categorize direct material inflation and continue to be a headwind, but generally stabilizing. While logistics side we do expect to see continued pressure in the second half of the year compared to the first half, but this is kind of consistently with how we model our business and we are clearly working on a daily basis to ensure that our supply chain team is finding ways to mitigate the potential cost pressures. 
And then there beyond as things materialize, and we see good fruit of these continued price increases, obviously, we expect margin profile to continue to improve."

So maybe that's a good indicator in terms of the feedback that we're seeing from customers that they're kind of feeling more confident and comfortable about releasing CapEx for some of these large projects. And so at least in our view, that's kind of good news.

So far, what we see is that we don't see any barrier to get Seepex margins to the Precision and Science level. I think it's a business that it is solid with over 40% recurring aftermarket. It has already launched a very meaningful, or what we consider to be really strong digital platform, where they've been able to kind of crack the code on creating edge devices for these type of pumps, which tend to be highly cost-effective. So we're excited with what we're seeing here with Seepex. I mean as it brings to the table not only a great new product portfolio with progressive cavity pumps but also a great IoT technology.

So yes, I mean, I think, first and foremost, in terms of the second half of the year, as we mentioned, and I think actually even the left side of that page kind of highlights. Despite some of the inflationary pressures and headwinds that we have been seeing, you've seen, I'd say, a couple of distinct actions really taken by the team. First, is the proactive kind of pricing measures that we spoke to. I'd say, we've talked about this historically from a legacy Gardner Denver perspective, having a distinct pricing team that's able to be pretty nimble and take actions pretty quickly, particularly in an environment like this and obviously, the first half of the year was no different. 
So I think between some of the proactive pricing measures you saw us taking towards the back half of last year as well as some of the actions we've taken in the first half of this year, I think that, obviously, continued to allow us to keep the price-cost equation on the positive side. 
And then the other piece is, obviously, we 100% still committed to the $100 million of incremental synergies that we're expecting to be delivered this year. And interestingly enough, some of those distinct actions are really coming from the direct material side, particularly now starting to see a good influx on the I2V side. 
So you are correct that, yes, we are seeing some of those inflationary headwinds in the back half of the year. I think some of the pricing measures as well as the productivity actions are definitely helping to offset as well as some of those corporate cost headwinds. We do believe that we will continue to see EBITDA margin expansion in the back half of the year, albeit, to your point, not necessarily at the levels that we saw in first half, obviously, given some of the headwinds we're talking about."

I will also describe them as great companies. And by that, I mean highly recognized brands, market leader, good gross margin, but that we can see a path to improve and we continue to be prudent and seeing that ROIC can be achieved in the mid-teens by year 3. 
So with that in mind, yes, I mean, you're absolutely right in terms of the -- one of the common themes of passing is valuation. But I'll say that it kind of varies. Valuation is an important threshold in how we screen deals against our financial metrics. But we're also very focused on future growth profiles of these businesses. And in some cases, we have seen expectations of inflated future growth due to expectations of ongoing COVID-related demand, which we tend to be very disciplined by [ discounting ] it.

So these are devices that are highly mission-critical, low cost to the overall process when you put in perspective when a purchase -- when you buy the product. But they can be high energy users. Same thing with compressors. And a lot of our compressor -- new compressor technology is just massively much better from an efficiency perspective than the old compression technology. 
So in many cases, we have trained our sales teams, our commercial teams to really sell on that value proposition. And this is what we see as one of the main drivers when customers want to replace product, they say, might as well help the environment in terms of having a much more energy efficient. And with energy continue to increase in countries like -- or areas like Europe and even Asia, there's a larger propensity for customers to go after products that can reduce that energy consumption."

I'll say that also, the team has done some really great product launches. The team overall, they have now relaunched the Gardner Denver brand line of compressors. It is getting really well positioned in the China market. I will also say that before our blower and vacuum business was actually fairly small in a big market. Now that we have a larger scale team with the Ingersoll Rand acquisition, we're leveraging the channel and the knowledge of that team into the market to really accelerate the growth on the vacuum and blower business.

So yes, we are seeing inflation, but we're still very much committed to the $100 million of total synergies, of which, obviously, the -- I'd say",300,"Yes. I'll answer probably backwards, frankly, so to start with your second question. They're kind of distinct. So yes, we are seeing inflation, but we're still very much committed to the $100 million of total synergies, of which, obviously, the -- I'd say, the procurement direct material component comprises a big component of. So it's no different than how we've messaged it before. Even coming into the year, we were seeing, I would say, $100 million expectation of synergies and frankly, a smaller degree of inflation. Clearly, inflationary pressures have probably grown a bit. But those 2 numbers are somewhat distinct, and that's the way we're kind of managing it. 
Clearly, our teams have done a really great job. When you think about the procurement and supply chain organizations, they've now really, I'd say, been able to, I would say, use IRX and use a lot of our internal processes to be able to balance, I'd say, their attention between both synergy delivery as well as managing a lot of the supply chain and logistics constraints that, frankly, the general market has seen. 
So I think right now, we're extremely pleased. Are we seeing any dramatic pushout of savings or anything of that nature compared to our original expectations? No, not in any material manner. I think for us, what we've been seeing here has probably given us a bit of an acceleration in the context of looking at more I2V initiatives as a means to mitigate. So like we said, we're not immune to what's going on, but I think that right now, we're kind of keeping that synergy equation quite balanced to what we originally thought and also opening, I'd say, the team up to, frankly, looking at more I2V initiatives and things like that as cost mitigants."

And then one is just on Maximus. I'm curious if the IoT aspect and the growth are a little bit different in that asset and whether the connectivity IoT or finding the way into the backlog or in the acquisition funnel in a more meaningful way? And how do you think about transforming that opportunity via acquisition versus what you're also doing through your installed base? 
And the second one, if I may just do them both at once, is just, obviously, if you do a large deal, you replaced some of the revenue disappearance from Specialty Vehicle more quickly. I just wanted to ask you about your comfort with doing smaller deals and how long it takes and whether you think about it that way."

On the Maximus IoT growth, that is a phenomenal find in terms of an acquisition, and that came from looking at the market from a different kind of sort of angle and perspective in the sense that we had a good pump business called Dosatro",514,"Yes. Thanks, Rob. On the Maximus IoT growth, that is a phenomenal find in terms of an acquisition, and that came from looking at the market from a different kind of sort of angle and perspective in the sense that we had a good pump business called Dosatron that plays really well in the animal health and agricultural market. It is the market-leading nonelectrical pumps. So it basically creates dosing and movement of water just by the flow itself. So it's kind of really unique technology. 
And in most of these kind of highly specialized applications, you can think about those applications like hydroponics. I mean we know demand after the rain, the acreage that is available in the world to continue to grow vegetables and feed animals is kind of shrinking really fast. So more and more, you're moving to indoor farming and hydroponics, which is, obviously, the way of growing vegetables with the use of water. And here, we have a really great leadership position. 
So when you go to one of these indoor farms, this is -- Maximus is the leader in this agritech controlling aspects of being able to control the entire ecosystem of that and where we see a lot of very good place of not only our pumps, but other devices that are inside that we can now actually bundle and kind of complete together the entire package. 
And when you think about that type of process, could we take it and replicate that into a wastewater treatment facility or into any of these other air markets? That is what our thesis also goes into is that how do you take that Maximus software IoT comprehensive solution and then utilize it and leverage it for other end markets. And that's where we just get super excited. 
And in terms of doing a large deal, I mean, obviously, you could argue that the smaller deals take as much time as large deals. That's what many say. I will say that with the use of IRX right now, we'll be building some incredible processes and muscle, whereas integrating a small or bolt-on deal, it goes actually quite well. I mean Tuthill or -- and the Kenny is a great example where the team in the Americas was able to integrate that pretty much by themselves and in a very rapid way, including the integration of the entire ERP system and in a very highly cost-effective way. 
So do we think that larger deals can give us a bigger, faster scale? Yes, but we also know that larger deals come in with, what I call, a bit of hair in the sense that not all larger deals are 100% perfect. And sometimes you need to divest and kind of the couple of businesses that you may not like from those systems -- from those businesses. So we continue to be excited about our bolt-on and medium-size business acquisitions that we have in our funnel. And we think that the processes that we have will continue to accelerate how we do deals."

And by that, it has to be strategic deals that make a lot of sense to our product portfolio, that makes a lot of sense to how we look at margin expansion and top line growth for the future value of the company. 
Seepex and Maximus are kind of 2, I would say, great businesses that, for example, are growing double-digit growth, great technologies. Maximus already at the margin profile of Precision and Science. Seepex has room to improve, but it's a technology that we like. So I think it's just one of those that, in some cases, we look at both. But more important is not the size, it's kind of just the margin expansion that we can generate and make the total company a better so we can continue to see multiple accretion in our overall business."

So I think, first and almost, yes, I mean, we've, obviously, been really pleased with the orders performance. I think the good thing here that we've talked about and Vicente mentioned is, in the second quarter, we actually saw a good mix of what we'll call kind of core compressor blower, vacuum-type orders, which, yes, typically ship out within kind of the next quarter thereafter. 
You're not typically booking those for 5, 6 months out in most regions. But we've also seen a nice tailwind in some of the kind of the larger project side, whether that be the centrifugal compressor side, whether that be the Nash/Garo business. So I'd say those are the types of orders that tend to have a 6 to 12 in certain cases, even longer than that kind of order-to-sale kind of lead time. So the good news here is we've seen a bit of a balance. 
So I think in the context of orders to revenue, yes, obviously, we have a stronger backlog. I think we have more backlog visibility today than we've had in probably any quarter coming in. Backlogs are up strong double digits and, frankly, even better in certain parts of the business. And yes, we have strong visibility into Q3 at this point in time, pretty much across most of the portfolio. But the good news here is we've also taken some really nice longer cycle orders as we would call them, that kind of now even extend into 2022. So giving us even a little bit more visibility into 2022 than we had, frankly, over the course of the last few months. So I think we're seeing a good balance of both is the answer, Joe."

One is, one, the revenue and earnings profile of the business does tend to be a little bit more back-end weighted in the context of just kind of our earnings profile. 
You've seen that in most years. I would also say the working capital side of the equation tends to follow a pretty seasonal path. This year will probably be no exception here where -- as you can see in the numbers, we have seen some inventory build prudently, frankly, in the back -- in the front half of the year. A lot of that is positioned quite frankly, for the second half execution, second half orders. 
And so we do expect to see a nice tailwind on working capital in the back half of the year. That tends to be, I would say, the kind of the 2 of the biggest contributors. I would also tell you that we've been working really hard steadily on the tax rate. We continue to see good momentum there on the tax position and the cash tax rate for the overall company and one that we would expect to continue to see moving into '22 as well. 
So I think there's multiple different levers that we're looking at and we're pulling. I think we're being very prudent, continued in this environment in terms of deploying cash. But again, we'd expect to see a second -- strong second half of the year, not too dissimilar to what you saw last year."

And as you can see on Slide 3, anchoring to our purpose, we're realizing the achievement of our desired targets.

I have never been more excited about the state of Ingersoll Rand. The combination of a highly engaged workforce who think and act like owners, and the use of IRX is what makes us highly unique. I want to thank our employees all around the world for their dedication and determination. We continue to support our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and mental well-being. 
Moving to Slide 4. Our 5 strategic imperatives are how we stay grounded on priorities and areas of focus. You will see on the right-hand side, during Q2, we have achieved substantial traction in all 5 imperatives. Within our operate sustainably strategic imperative, we achieved another major milestone that I'll touch on the next slide. 
Moving to Slide 5. A couple of weeks ago, we published our 2020 sustainability report. The report reflects our 2020 ESG data, celebrates our progress and details our further goals with a high focus on measurable targets and accountability. We'll spend more time on this next Friday, during our scheduled ESG and sustainability report investor update. What I want to emphasize right now is the team's strong bias for action over the last year, as you can see on this page. We have focus and deliver on diversity within our Board and extended leadership team, which is now 50% and 43%, respectively. 
We have launched aggressive 2030 and 2050 goals and improve our new product development process to address these goals. We expanded a stockholder rights through corporate governance changes. And one of the things I am most proud of on behalf of our employees is granting $150 million in equity to our employees, which we believe is the largest employee equity grant ever provided by an industrial company. 
We see broad-based employee ownership as a game changer. We know underrepresented populations increase their earnings and wealth if they're employed in organizations that offer equity grants. And that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner that even ties into how directly impact global ESG efforts. And I look forward to sharing more with you next week. 
Moving to Slide 6. The signing of definitive agreements to acquire Seepex and Maximus Solutions, both of which will become part of the Precision and Science Technologies segment, a representative of the key characteristics we're targeting to drive our inorganic growth strategy. 
Seepex is, by our estimation, the #2 global progressive cavity pump manufacturer, and it is a highly recognized brand as a premium player in the market that adds a new positive displacement pump technology to our portfolio. Maximus Solutions is a leader, player in the agritech software and controls market. With technology, we intend to pull through to other markets and leverage across the Ingersoll Rand portfolio. Both of these companies have shown strong high single-digit to double-digit organic growth since at least 2017, and our focus on sustainable end markets that tend to grow well above GDP rates. 
In addition, both have strong aftermarket profiles enhanced by digital revenue streams, including software as a service. We anticipate both acquisitions to yield single-digit post-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiples by year 3 of ownership. With these 2 acquisitions, we're expecting to add approximately $3.8 billion to PST addressable market, which is an impressive 40% expansion. The profiles and characteristics of this high-quality, high return on capital and highly strategic acquisitions are indicative of how we're structuring our M&A funnel, which leads us to Slide 7. 
We continue to execute our M&A funnel using IRX as its backbone. Our funnel is comprised of 6 stages and its probability-weighted according to likelihood of closing when we calculate our funnel size. For instance, Seepex has been in our funnel for some time. And it was not until the owner became actively engaged, and we were in active negotiation that it was moved from 0% weighted revenue contribution to 50% and then 100% assigning. And now it is out of our funnel calculation. 
Last quarter, we described how our M&A funnel has grown materially since the Ingersoll Rand Gardner Denver transaction was completed. At its current state, the funnel size remains approximately 5x the size it was versus Q2 of 2020, with average revenue larger and velocity accelerating minutely. And to be clear, this describes the funnel even after removing the 32 targets we passed on in the second quarter as well as our signed deals of Seepex and Maximus, and it also excludes SPX Flow. As you can see, we have significant momentum in the funnel but our flywheel is in full motion. 
Regarding SPX Flow, we saw that they issued a press release this Monday stating that they will pursue strategic alternatives. Our $85 per share offer was preemptive, and fully accounted for SPX Flow's Investor Day plan, which is ahead of consensus estimates. In terms of SPX Flow's strategic alternative presence, if we participate, we intend to remain disciplined in our approach as we do with all of our M&A transactions, and there can be no assurances that we will confirm our preemptive offer as part of any such process. It is important -- it is very important also to note that when we received the second rejection from SPX Flow more than a month ago, we pivoted to executing on other funnel opportunities. 
We have always demonstrated a very decisive and highly disciplined approach with everything we do. And we believe it is much more important now in this current environment. As stated, even with SPX Flow excluded, our funnel remains as robust as it did last quarter, which exemplifies the volume and quality of our future potential opportunities. And we have sufficient cash on hand to execute on these opportunities with $4.7 billion in liquidity. However, as noted, we intend to remain very disciplined in this environment. 
It is also important to know that we continue to review our capital allocation priorities with our Board and plan to communicate more formally on this topic later in the year. 
I'll now turn the call to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance."

We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q2. Q2 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued performance across industrial end markets. 
Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 48% and 25%, respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. Given the comparisons to 2020 are materially impacted by the prior year impact of COVID, we think comparing this performance to 2019 is a better representation of how the business is improving. And we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing as organic orders in Q2 were up 9% and 6% on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis, respectively, as compared to 2019. Our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company, eclipsing Q1 and setting us up well as we move into Q3. 
Our commitment to delivering $300 million in cost synergies attributable to the Ingersoll Rand Industrial segment acquisition remains intact as we continue to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst. 
The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $292 million, a year-over-year improvement of $75 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8%, a 160 basis point improvement year-over-year. One item to note, these financial metrics do not include the High Pressure Solutions segment or the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment, both of which were classified as discontinued operations as of Q2 with relevant prior periods restated to conform to the current presentation. We will not report on either segment moving forward. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million, yielding total liquidity of $4.7 billion at quarter end, up approximately $2 billion from Q1 as we received the gross proceeds from both divestitures in Q2. This takes our net leverage to 0.2x, a 1.7x improvement from Q1. 
Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, orders increased 40% and revenue increased 19%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. The IT&S and P&ST segments both saw strong double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.14 for the quarter, an improvement from the prior year level of 0.96. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q3 and beyond. 
The company delivered $292 million of adjusted EBITDA, which was an increase of 34% versus prior year. And the IT&S and P&ST segments both saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong margin expansion. Finally, corporate costs came in at $38 million for the quarter, up year-over-year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs as well as targeted commercial growth investments in areas like demand generation and other targeted strategic investments. We expect corporate costs to remain elevated at comparable levels in both Q3 and Q4 due to the same drivers. 
Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million on a continuing ops basis, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. CapEx during the quarter totaled $12 million and free cash flow included $12 million of outflows related to the transaction. In addition, free cash flow also included $36 million in cash tax payments related to the historical earnings profile of the HPS and SVT segments. 
As is customary in these types of divestitures, cash tax payments are included in cash flows from continuing operations due to the complexities involved in specific attribution with consolidated returns. However, the $36 million represents our best quantification of the impact. Given our reported financials, including revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow are shown on a continuing ops basis, we are calling out the $36 million in cash tax outflows to provide a better representation of the underlying cash flow of the ongoing business. 
From a leverage perspective, we finished at 0.2x, which is a 1.7x improvement as compared to prior quarter, and this included the gross cash proceeds received from both the HPS and SVT divestitures. We expect to pay the cash taxes for both divestitures later in 2021, and if you were to pro forma the Q2 leverage to account for these tax outflows, leverage would have been closer to 0.6x. 
On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $4.7 billion based on approximately $3.7 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. We have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. 
Moving to Slide 11. We continue to see strong momentum on our cost synergy delivery efforts. Due to the funnel we have built that stands in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are reaffirming our stated $300 million cost savings target. To date, approximately $250 million of annualized synergies have already been executed or are in motion, which is slightly higher than 80% of the overall target. 
As a reminder and consistent with previous guidance, we delivered approximately 40% of our $300 million target in 2020, which equaled approximately $115 million of savings. In addition, we expect to deliver an incremental $100 million of savings in 2021, which would bring the cumulative total to approximately 70% at the end of this year. We expect a cumulative 85% to 90% up to $300 million in savings by the end of 2022 with the balance coming in 2023. 
The bottom of the page shows the progress we've made across the different areas of synergy delivery, with the most notable progress coming from direct material initiatives in procurement as well as I2V. In addition, we're starting to see some of the initial wave of savings from our footprint actions, and we expect these savings to ramp into 2022. 
On the right side of the page, we did want to highlight that despite the headwinds we have seen on the cost side, largely coming from direct material and logistics as well as some of the expected return of onetime and discretionary costs and strategic growth investments, we do continue to expect to be positive from a price versus cost perspective on a total year basis. This is entirely due to the team's use of IRX to proactively implement and deploy targeted pricing actions in the first half of the year. In addition, we continue to evaluate the overall landscape, particularly with regards to inflation, and are evaluating potential incremental pricing actions for the second half of the year. 
Overall, we expect to achieve further adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the total company in the second half of the year, although not at the same levels we delivered in the first half. 
I will now turn it back over to Vicente to discuss the segments."

Overall, organic orders were up 41% and revenue up 17%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.15. In addition, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 41% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margin of 34%. 
Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the mid-40%. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows that orders for both were up above 40%. From a regional split for orders on compressors, in the Americas, North America performed strong at up low 40%, while Latin America was up in the mid-70%. Mainland Europe was up low 50%, while India, Middle East, saw continued strong recovery with order rates up in excess of 100%. Asia Pacific continues to perform well with orders up low 30% driven by low 30% growth in both China and high 20% across the rest of Asia Pacific. 
From a vacuum and blower perspective, orders were up in mid-40s, on a global basis with strong double-digit growth across each of our regions. In power tools and lifting, the total business was up high 50% in orders and so continued positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improved execution on new product launches. 
On the right-hand side, we're highlighting one of our new exciting products, which is a result of our continued commitment to organic investments in our portfolio. In this case, during Q2, we completed the launch of our new line of refrigerated drive portfolio. That's a bit of a background. The basic function of the air dryer is to remove moisture from the air by cooling it with a refrigerant, thus the water vapor is condensed and the air can be easily compressed. 
The result is dry compressed air, which can be used in compressed air equipment without causing any damage. Air dryer technology is sold as an accessory to all rotary oil-lubricated and oil-free air compression technology. So it is a great adjacent technology that increases the total quality of air provided to the customer. This is a very important requirement, especially in oil-free compression where customers demand high air quality in terms of dryness and particulate. 
It is also good to note that it is a great aftermarket generator as the filters or desiccant need to be changed often. In this case, we leverage a technology developed at ZEKS, which was accompanied owned by legacy Ingersoll Rand. Since the merger of Gardner Denver and IR, not only we have accelerated our organic investments in new products for ZEKS, but we're now leveraging the technology in order to serve Gardner Denver, Ingersoll Rand and in the future, even our champion compressor customers. 
The even more exciting piece here is that we're doing this while helping the environment. This new dryer portfolio is 20% more energy-efficient and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by over 50%. 
Moving to Slide 13 and the Precision and Science Technology segment, overall, organic orders were up 20% driven by, i.e., the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which serve lab, life science, water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits. And we also saw strong performance in our ARO and Milton Roy product lines. The momentum in our Haskel Hydrogen Solution business continues to build, and we saw some strong funnel activity. 
Revenue was up 12% organically, which is encouraging, as we have some tough comps due to COVID-related orders and revenue in Q2 2020 for the Medical business. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $71 million, which was up 20%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.7%, up 40 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margins of 33%. 
Today, we want to highlight our hydrogen refueling business to give you an update on where we are and investments we're making. As we have discussed before during our Q4 earnings call, we made investments in developing a hydrogen dispensing unit leveraging our Haskel high-pressure technology, and we're now ready to capture the growth in this business. 
We have line of sight to about $45 million in organic investments over the next 5 years to both build out our capacity and fund ongoing product development in the hydrogen refueling space, with approximately $10 million of this investment expected in the next 12 months. Since our last call, we have seen our funnel grow 3x to over $250 million in potential projects. And we still feel confident that this is a business where we will see meaningful growth for years to come, driving our decision to expand 2 of our factories in Europe to support anticipated growth. 
In addition, we want to highlight that Ingersoll Rand is designing and developing a state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling stations to support the power and remote joint venture. 
Moving to Slide 14. Given the company's performance in Q2 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our guidance excludes both the High Pressure Solutions and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segments as well as the pending acquisition of Seepex and Maximus. Our prior revenue guidance was up low double digits on a reported basis, comprised of high single-digit organic growth across both of our segments. And we're now upping, guiding up to be mid-teens in total with low double-digit organic growth across both segments. 
This reflects approximately 250 to 300 basis point growth in organic growth for the total company as compared to prior guidance. FX is expected to continue to be a low single-digit tailwind, and based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion, which represents approximately a $30 million improvement from power guidance at the midpoint of the range. 
We also highlight that these also includes the increased corporate cost of approximately $6 million per quarter for both Q3 and Q4 as compared to prior guidance, as mentioned on the right-hand side of the slide. In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion to remain greater than or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% of revenue. 
And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be approximately 20%, and this does include a $35 million benefit due to a tax restructuring plan that was recently completed, that is reflected approximately 40% in the Q2 rate with the balance in the second half of the year. 
Moving now to Slide 15. As we wrap today's call, Ingersoll Rand brand is in an outstanding place. 2021 is poised to be a great year. To our employees, I want to say thank you for how we come together every day to be there for our customers, solve problems, lean on each other and collaborate. We take our role as sustainably-minded industry leader seriously, and our employees eagerly embrace IRX to put us in that leadership position. I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A."

As you might recall, during the last earnings, we mentioned that we were seeing the inflation creeping up in Q4 of 2020, and we acted on that when building the budget for 2021. Since the end of Q1 of 2021 of this year, we have seen inflation, and we call inflation here direct material and logistics continue to increase, which is the reason why we acted on additional pricing actions. I'll say those pricing actions are offsetting the incremental inflation that we're expecting to see in the second half. 
With that, we're also continuing to focus on mitigating these headwinds with a very heavy focus on I2V initiatives. So I think in terms of kind of moving forward, I will also categorize direct material inflation and continue to be a headwind, but generally stabilizing. While logistics side we do expect to see continued pressure in the second half of the year compared to the first half, but this is kind of consistently with how we model our business and we are clearly working on a daily basis to ensure that our supply chain team is finding ways to mitigate the potential cost pressures. 
And then there beyond as things materialize, and we see good fruit of these continued price increases, obviously, we expect margin profile to continue to improve."

And as you would expect, this is our initial view, and we have already launched an IDM part of the IRX with Seepex as part of our integration planning process as we kind of move now into the next phase of closing the deal and moving into the integration. 
So far, what we see is that we don't see any barrier to get Seepex margins to the Precision and Science level. I think it's a business that it is solid with over 40% recurring aftermarket. It has already launched a very meaningful, or what we consider to be really strong digital platform, where they've been able to kind of crack the code on creating edge devices for these type of pumps, which tend to be highly cost-effective. So we're excited with what we're seeing here with Seepex. I mean as it brings to the table not only a great new product portfolio with progressive cavity pumps but also a great IoT technology.

So yes, I mean, I think, first and foremost, in terms of the second half of the year, as we mentioned, and I think actually in the left side of that page kind of highlights. Despite some of the inflationary pressures and headwinds that we have been seeing, you've seen, I'd say, a couple of distinct actions really taken by the team. First, is the proactive kind of pricing measures that we spoke to. I'd say, we've talked about this historically from a legacy Gardner Denver perspective, having a distinct pricing team that's able to be pretty nimble and take actions pretty quickly, particularly in an environment like this and obviously, the first half of the year was no different. 
So I think between some of the proactive pricing measures you saw us taking towards the back half of last year as well as some of the actions we've taken in the first half of this year, I think that, obviously, continued to allow us to keep the price-cost equation on the positive side. 
And then the other piece is, obviously, we 100% still committed to the $100 million of incremental synergies that we're expecting to be delivered this year. And interestingly enough, some of those distinct actions are really coming from the direct material side, particularly now starting to see a good influx on the I2V side. 
So you are correct that, yes, we are seeing some of those inflationary headwinds in the back half of the year. I think some of the pricing measures as well as the productivity actions are definitely helping to offset as well as some of those corporate cost headwinds. We do believe that we will continue to see EBITDA margin expansion in the back half of the year, albeit, to your point, not necessarily at the levels that we saw in first half, obviously, given some of the headwinds we're talking about."

Valuation is an important threshold in how we screen deals against our financial metrics. But we're also very focused on future growth profiles of these businesses. And in some cases, we have seen expectations of inflated future growth due to expectations of ongoing COVID-related demand, which we tend to be very disciplined by discounting it.

Or should we really just think about the energy efficiency new products is really just the basis of competition on new business or kind of regular replacement business?"

I will say that we see a lot of retrofitting driver because in many instances -- and we have said some of this before, when you look at a blower that goes into a wastewater treatment facility, the energy consumed by a blower is close to like 60% of the energy consumer at that total facility. 
So these are devices that are highly mission-critical, low cost to the overall process when you put in perspective when a purchase -- when you buy the product. But they can be high energy users. Same thing with compressors. And a lot of our compressor -- new compressor technology is just massively much better from an efficiency perspective than the old compression technology. 
So in many cases, we have trained our sales teams, our commercial teams to really sell on that value proposition. And this is what we see as one of the main drivers when customers want to replace product, they say, might as well help the environment in terms of having a much more energy efficient. And with energy continue to increase in countries like -- or areas like Europe and even Asia, there's a larger propensity for customers to go after products that can reduce that energy consumption."

I can say that even about a year ago, when COVID hit really hard in China, the team immediately started to pivot into end markets where they could see meaningful growth as the recovery from the China economy will come. And we're seeing a lot of that now, that pivoting into better end markets that are end markets where government is putting some good investments. 
I'll say that also, the team has done some really great product launches. The team overall, they have now relaunched the Gardner Denver brand line of compressors. It is getting really well positioned in the China market. I will also say that before our blower and vacuum business was actually fairly small in a big market. Now that we have a larger scale team with the Ingersoll Rand acquisition, we're leveraging the channel and the knowledge of that team into the market to really accelerate the growth on the vacuum and blower business. 
And one example that I show even here today with these air treatment, air treatment revenue right now in China is very low. So this is a really meaningful opportunity for the team in China as we kind of take this new product line of dryer solutions and launched that -- and kind of launch that in China. So a really good combination of the teams executing really well, commercially selling what we have in different end markets, while at the same time, launching new products that are really getting good traction in the market."

So yes, we are seeing inflation, but we're still very much committed to the $100 million of total synergies, of which, obviously, the -- I'd say, the procurement direct material component comprises a big component of. So it's no different than how we've messaged it before. Even coming into the year, we were seeing, I would say, $100 million expectation of synergies and frankly, a smaller degree of inflation. Clearly, inflationary pressures have probably grown a bit. But those 2 numbers are somewhat distinct, and that's the way we're kind of managing it. 
Clearly, our teams have done a really great job. When you think about the procurement and supply chain organizations, they've now really, I'd say, been able to, I would say, use IRX and use a lot of our internal processes to be able to balance, I'd say, their attention between both synergy delivery as well as managing a lot of the supply chain and logistics constraints that, frankly, the general market has seen. 
So I think right now, we're extremely pleased. Are we seeing any dramatic pushout of savings or anything of that nature compared to our original expectations? No, not in any material manner. I think for us, what we've been seeing here has probably given us a bit of an acceleration in the context of looking at more I2V initiatives as a means to mitigate. So like we said, we're not immune to what's going on, but I think that right now, we're kind of keeping that synergy equation quite balanced to what we originally thought and also opening, I'd say, the team up to, frankly, looking at more I2V initiatives and things like that as cost mitigants."

And how do you think about transforming that opportunity via acquisition versus what you're also doing through your installed base? 
And the second one, if I may just do them both at once, is just, obviously, if you do a large deal, you replaced some of the revenue disappearance from Specialty Vehicle more quickly. I just wanted to ask you about your comfort with doing smaller deals and how long it takes and whether you think about it that way."

Thanks, Rob. On the Maximus IoT growth, that is a phenomenal find in terms of an acquisition, and that came from looking at the market from a different kind of sort of angle and perspective in the sense that we had a good pump business called Dosatron that plays really well in the animal health and agricultural market. It is the market-leading nonelectrical pumps. So it basically creates dosing and movement of water just by the flow itself. So it's kind of really unique technology. 
And in most of these kind of highly specialized applications, you can think about those applications like hydroponics. I mean we know demand after the rain, the acreage that is available in the world to continue to grow vegetables and feed animals is kind of shrinking really fast. So more and more, you're moving to indoor farming and hydroponics, which is, obviously, the way of growing vegetables with the use of water. And here, we have a really great leadership position. 
So when you go to one of these indoor farms, this is -- Maximus is the leader in this agritech controlling aspects of being able to control the entire ecosystem of that and where we see a lot of very good place of not only our pumps, but other devices that are inside that we can now actually bundle and kind of complete together the entire package. 
And when you think about that type of process, could we take it and replicate that into a wastewater treatment facility or into any of these other air markets? That is what our thesis also goes into is that how do you take that Maximus software IoT comprehensive solution and then utilize it and leverage it for other end markets. And that's where we just get super excited. 
And in terms of doing a large deal, I mean, obviously, you could argue that the smaller deals take as much time as large deals. That's what many say. I will say that with the use of IRX right now, we'll be building some incredible processes and muscle, whereas integrating a small or bolt-on deal, it goes actually quite well. I mean Tuthill or -- and the Kenny is a great example where the team in the Americas was able to integrate that pretty much by themselves and in a very rapid way, including the integration of the entire ERP system and in a very highly cost-effective way. 
So do we think that larger deals can give us a bigger, faster scale? Yes, but we also know that larger deals come in with, what I call, a bit of hair in the sense that not all larger deals are 100% perfect. And sometimes you need to divest and kind of decouple businesses that you may not like from those systems -- from those businesses. So we continue to be excited about our bolt-on and medium-size business acquisitions that we have in our funnel. And we think that the processes that we have will continue to accelerate how we do deals."

Seepex and Maximus are kind of 2, I would say, great businesses that, for example, are growing double-digit growth, great technologies. Maximus already at the margin profile of Precision and Science. Seepex has room to improve, but it's a technology that we like. So I think it's just one of those that, in some cases, we look at both.

You're not typically booking those for 5, 6 months out in most regions. But we've also seen a nice tailwind in some of the kind of the larger project side, whether that be the centrifugal compressor side, whether that be the Nash/Garo business. So I'd say those are the types of orders that tend to have a 6 to 12 in certain cases, even longer than that kind of order-to-sale kind of lead time. So the good news here is we've seen a bit of a balance. 
So I think in the context of orders to revenue, yes, obviously, we have a stronger backlog. I think we have more backlog visibility today than we've had in probably any quarter coming in. Backlogs are up strong double digits and, frankly, even better in certain parts of the business. And yes, we have strong visibility into Q3 at this point in time, pretty much across most of the portfolio.

You've seen that in most years. I would also say the working capital side of the equation tends to follow a pretty seasonal path. This year will probably be no exception here where -- as you can see in the numbers, we have seen some inventory build prudently, frankly, in the back -- in the front half of the year. A lot of that is positioned quite frankly, for the second half execution, second half orders. 
And so we do expect to see a nice tailwind on working capital in the back half of the year. That tends to be, I would say, the kind of the 2 of the biggest contributors. I would also tell you that we've been working really hard steadily on the tax rate. We continue to see good momentum there on the tax position and the cash tax rate for the overall company and one that we would expect to continue to see moving into '22 as well. 
So I think there's multiple different levers that we're looking at and we're pulling. I think we're being very prudent, continued in this environment in terms of deploying cash. But again, we'd expect to see a second -- strong second half of the year, not too dissimilar to what you saw last year."

In the environment, we find ourselves in right for speed to execution has proven to be our competitive advantage. Of course, global macroeconomic factors continue to be a challenge. We're not immune to demanding supply chain inflation and labor market conditions, but we continue to outperform on our commercial and operational commitments, and we are again raising our guidance. This outperformance is propelled by continued organic and inorganic investments into the organization and our comprehensive M&A focused capital allocation strategy is fueled by our drive to create long-term value and compound stockholder returns. 
Moving to capital allocation strategies. Before we move to those, I have 2 important colors. Our strategy to deploy talent across our organization is paying off. We just concluded our second employee engagement survey this year across all 16,000 employees globally. And I am extremely proud to share our outstanding participation at 91% and several of our scores improved again, placing us well above the relevant manufacturing benchmarks points as to how happy are you working in a Ingersoll Rand, we now ranked in the top 10%  outperforming because of our agility, [indiscernible] and IR, it's because of our people. This is our culture. We always say and continue to believe that the combination of a high [indiscernible] is a catalyst for long-term performance. The fact nurturing and how we inspire our employees. I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the tremendous contributions of each and every one of our 16,000 employees, without whom these results would not be possible. Company was -- [Audio Gap] 
[indiscernible] 
From approximately the bottom 1/3, we're now being in the top 1/3 of the companies rated by MSCI. And we believe, based on our work, we will continue to see our ratings improve with the various [indiscernible] has been made this year to accelerate growth and allocate capital effectively. 
As we have announced [Audio Gap] in Q3, we completed both the [indiscernible] and maximum solutions. We also announced [indiscernible] earlier this week. We shared our comprehensive capital allocation focus on M&A. We completed a large share repurchase as part of KKR sales of their final equity stake in the company as well as the prepayment during the onset of COVID share. On the next slide, it's a 
[indiscernible] Investor Day. We are seeking to address and how Ingersoll Rand products and services help make life better for all our stakeholders. 
Our strategy enables us to compound our contribution to addressing megatrends such as digitization, sustainability and quality of life. We continue to leverage our own unique and proprietary demand generation engine to drive a holistic approach to customer buying patterns. One that has already captured over 3 million end user contacts and allows us to generate over 200,000 marketing qualified leads for [indiscernible] or digitally enable a meaningful portion of the 5 million assets that we have identified in the field. 
Moving to slide 6. We're not unique in needing to effectively manage the challenges of the current supply chain environment. However, in discipline through the use of IRX, an effect to minimize negative impact from challenged overcome delivery gaps. We saw early on that supply chain and logistics challenges an important issue. So we invested in this to guarantee a rigorous processes [indiscernible] and this has produced outstanding results. 
Moving to slide [indiscernible]. We will now go forward closely at our recent inorganic achievements. We signed a definitive agreement to acquire Tuthill Pumps, which is expected to close in Q4 and their dimensions, both of which will become part of the Precision and Science Technologies segment. We also closed the [indiscernible], which will become part of the Industrial Technologies and Services segment. Although these positions are representative of the key characteristics we're targeting with our inorganic growth strategy. 
Tuthill Pumps is the second [indiscernible], we have purchased from Tuthill Corporation. It is a leader in the gear and piston pumping market, which supports the expansion of our positive displacement pump. This is another example of a multi-generation family owned company with premium assets that approached us on an exclusive basis because of the relationship that we have built and the opportunities they saw for their company and employees as part of the Ingersoll Rand family. This is another testament to how our unique approach to employee ownership allows us to be at the front line in M&A. [indiscernible] dimension is a market leader in gas and pumps. It is complementary to our existing lab and life science businesses is specialized for environmental applications like emission monitoring and biogas. It has an impressive pre-synergy EBITDA margins of over 50% and more than 70% of its revenue comes from like-to-like repayment of original equipment and aftermarket parts. We also hold the acquisition of Lawrence Factor, which will reside in the ICS segment. Lawrence Factor is a great example of an acquisition that is well aligned with our company purpose of make better as their technology ensures safe work and play activities for people who depend on compressed air and gas through the proprietary air sampling and aftermarket offerings. All 3 of these acquisitions were valued on attractive purchase multiples as our synergy execution is expected to deliver mid-single-digit post synergy realization by year 3, in line with our disciplined pre-deal screening process. 
I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide [indiscernible] on our Q3 financial performance."

Moving to Slide 8, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q3. We saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX to overcome a challenging inflationary and supply chain [indiscernible] environment. Our commitment to deliver $300 million in cost synergies attributable to the Ingersoll Rand Industrial segment acquisition remains intact as we continue to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst. Total company orders and revenue increased 37% and [ 19% ] year-over-year, respectively, driven by strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. 
Compared to 2019 as reported orders in Q3 were up 27% and 16% on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis, respectively, highlighting the strong performance of our business in perspective of COVID 
[Audio Gap] 
Up 14%. The team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 26% year-over-year and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.5%, up 150 basis points year-over-year with an incremental margin of 33%. Organic orders were up 31%. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the high 30s percent. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil lubricated products shows orders for oil-free up over 50% and oil lubricated up over 30%. 
In the Americas, orders in North America were up mid-20s, while Latin America was up high 40s. Mainline Europe delivers on performance up high 40s, while India and Middle East saw continued strong recovery with order rates up in excess of 70%. Asia Pacific continues to perform well with orders up high 30s, driven by strong mid-50% growth in China, a mid-single-digit decline across the rest of Asia Pacific. In banking and blowers, orders were up low 30s on a global basis, with strong double-digit growth across each of our regions. 
Moving next to power tools and lifting, orders for the total business were up mid-20s and saw continued positive growth, driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improved execution on new product launches. We will also like to highlight 1 of the many ways that we enable our customers to become more sustainable. Our Leroy gas clusters are used to capture biogas immediate from landfills, dairy farms and wastewater facilities. As the gas is emitted, the system captures the gas, clean the methane from other gases such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide and our Leroy product compresses the methane for reinjection into pipelines or storage for power generation, both of which enable the customer to capture additional economic value. The compressor enables to capture up to 50% of the admitted biogas, whereas without it, 100% of the gas will be released into the atmosphere. Our significant into base of 25,000 units will help capture 240 million cubic feet of biogas in the next 2 years. Technologies such as these across our portfolio enable us to advance our ESG impact, not only with the steps we're taking internally to reduce our carbon footprint, water and energy usage, but also create significant value for our customers from both sustainability and economic perspective. 
Moving to Slide 12. In the Precision and Science Technology segment revenue was up 10% organically, which remains encouraging given the tough comps due to COVID-related orders and revenue in Q3 of 2020 for the medical business. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $76 million, which was up 17%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.7%, down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by the impact of Seepex and Maximus Solutions. And again, the segment was up 20 basis points excluding the impact of those acquisitions. Overall, organic orders were up 25%, driven by the ARO and Milton Roy product lines and the medical and Dosatron businesses, which serve lab life sciences, water and animal health end markets. All of these businesses were up double digits in the quarter. Incremental margins were up 25% as reported and 33% when excluding Seepex and Maximus. In this segment, we would like to highlight the momentum of our Haskel hydrogen solutions business continues to build to making life better through a more sustainable world. We have announced a long-term agreement with Hiringa refueling to supply high-capacity hydrogen refueling stations for a nationwide green hydrogen network across New Zealand. Hiring has played the first order of 4 stations with a total commitment of 24 stations to be provided through 2026. The totality of this frame agreement alone will double our Haskel hydrogen refueling business on a revenue basis. We're incredibly excited about this partnership. And as we spoke about last quarter, the investments we're making to expand our technologies and manufacturing capabilities in this high-growth markets are producing meaningful growth. 
Moving to Slide 13. Given the company's performance in Q3 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our guidance excludes both the divested high-pressure Solutions and Specialty Vehicle Technology segment, as well as the pending acquisition of Tuthill Pumps. However, Seepex, Maximus Solutions, Air Dimensions and Lawrence Factor are included in our guidance. Our prior revenue guidance was up mid-teens on a reported basis, comprised of low double-digit organic growth across both of our segments. We're now guiding up high teens in total with low double-digit growth, organic growth across both segments. This reflects an approximately 100 basis point increase in organic growth for the total company as compared to prior guidance. FX is expected to continue to be low single-digit tailwind, M&A was previously expected to contribute approximately $60 million in revenue, but given the closed acquisitions of Maximus, Seepx Seepex, Air Dimensions and Lawrence Factor, we're increasing that expected contribution to $135 million. 
Based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.175 billion to $1.195 billion, which represents a $20 million improvement from prior guidance at the midpoint of the range. In terms of cash generation, we expect adjusted free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion to remain greater than or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% of revenues. And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be in the mid-teens for the reasons Vik provided earlier. 
Turning to Slide 14. We're very excited about our upcoming virtual Investor Day, which is fast approaching and will be held on November 18. We look forward to outlining our long-term growth strategy fueled by alignment with megatrends and compounded by our unique growth enablers. We will provide detail on our markets and technologies and further discuss how our strong talent, operational execution, demand generation and M&A capabilities, coupled with attainable growth mindset creates incredible competitive advantages for our company. 
We will also outline future financial targets. You can register for the event using the link on Slide 14, and I look forward to seeing many of you on the webcast. 
Moving to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in an outstanding position. 2021 is poised to be a great year despite the challenging environment. To our employees, I want to again say thank you for your relentless efforts to execute and solve top problems throughout the quarter. They are absolutely appreciated and it is apparent in our company's performance, actively investing to deliver outpaced growth, both organically and through M&A to continue increasing the quality of our portfolio. We continue to take our role as a sustainability-minded industry leader very serious, and our employees eagerly embrace IRX to put us in that leadership position. We're proud of the transformation we have achieved at Ingersoll Rand and are excited about the future opportunity to compound growth and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A."

In addition, just to point out, ITS margins in Q4 2020 were up 400 basis points, reaching 26% margins. What our guidance here implies is that even with all the inflation, discretionary spend, increases and investments we're going to be kind of flattish in margin expansion year-over-year, which speaks to all the great actions that the teams continue to execute and put that segment to a very solid margin performance in this environment, we believe. And margins for the core business, which is kind of excluding the M&A that we said is EBITDA accretive, but gross margin accretive and some of the accelerated hydrogen investments that we're doing based on that frame order that we just received. The EBITDA margin profile still is in the 30s kind of range, which we view as quite healthy given the tough comps from medical shipments in 2020 as well as the inflation and discretionary investments that we have done here in 2021 and still do -- plan to do in the fourth quarter. So we feel good about that. And at the same time, prudent in terms of how we see supply chain out there."

So in the context of price realization was a little bit in excess of 3% across the entire enterprise, which obviously speaks to the healthy performance and frankly, the proactive measures that, frankly, all of our business has taken. Pricing did slightly outweigh inflation in Q3. So we were price cost positive in the context of we would expect to be fairly comparable to that equation in Q4. Now it is worth noting, obviously, that not unexpectedly, inflation, obviously, headwinds have risen in the second half of the year compared to the first half. We always expected that, and that's why we kind of got ahead a lot of the pricing actions. 
So again, I think we're quite pleased with the performance and the momentum that we're seeing. As we think about 2022, I think, frankly, a little bit too early to start kind of on numbers just yet. But obviously, we would expect to see healthy carryover on the pricing actions. I'd say the majority of the pricing actions that we have taken are list price oriented. So obviously, it should be inherently a little bit stickier. But obviously, we do obviously have some carryover inflation that we will begin with into 2022 as well.

And the team has just done a phenomenal job leveraging the I2V initiative and action to then relaunch an entire product portfolio with Gardner Denver. And the second piece is blows and vacuums. Blows on vacuums was a fairly small piece in China. And again, I think the team is putting a lot of good dedication and localizing and really penetrating some of the end markets that we have seen are good in terms of applications in other regions. The rest of Asia Pacific, I cannot maybe split it between emerging and developed, developing like Australia, for example. And that still continues to perform fairly well.

Just to kind of recalibrate $115 million was delivered in 2020. We expect $100 million this year, $50 million next year and then the tail, which would be $35 million into 2023. At this point in time, nothing has really changed in terms of that phasing. And clearly, as we move into 2022 and onwards, I'd say I2V and the footprint components of that equation are probably the more prominent drivers of the synergy profile moving forward."

So in terms of the first question about the compressors orders, I'll tell you that it's a little bit of everything. I mean, it's definitely the product because, again, how we are leveraging the entire product portfolio across multiple brands. And it's also the channel. And I think this is a great lead question markets as we kind of go into the Investor Day because we have case stories actually that we will show you how we have expanded our channel to really accelerate the growth and also reposition the product to really accelerate the growth. So I think it has to do with a lot of the work that we have done since the product summits. If you remember back in the I don't know, about a year ago, we spoke a lot about product comes and how the team. So it's just been a very thoughtful way and then executed with the use of IRX to really reposition a lot of the products on the channel without creating any conflict. And I think that has proven to be a pretty successful recipe. I mean availability in some products has been actually quite good. I mean, I saw the team is marketing, for example, on blowers that we have 1 of the best lead times and how that is accelerating now even the momentum as they see here in the fourth quarter. To your question in terms of the visibility of backlog, customers for compressors because you have to customize many times the options to the specific application there's not a lot of preorder that can be done on compressors just because of the optionality. And the visibility that we have in the backlog, in the compressors is really in the more larger compressors, the multistage centrifugal compressor that are kind of -- we positioned that as more long cycle business. And those when we're doing a contract with the customer, we have caveats that we could actually pass or surcharge any specific cost increases that we're seeing through the supply chain in this environment. So I think we feel that we're doing everything that we can to protect ourselves in case that obviously inflation continues to stay at this level and commodities do not go down. But I think we we feel good in terms of kind of how we're protecting ourselves from the cost position."

In terms of the comment on whether you could reprice backlog, as I said, there's components like the longer cycle that you do have some of those optionality. By and large, though, no. I mean, most of the rest of the backlog is typically a couple of months in duration, and you wouldn't expect to reprice that.

Starting on Slide 3, coming out of the third quarter, Ingersoll Rand remains in the position of strength, demonstrating again that as a purpose-driven company, we remain grounded in what we do and how we do it.",1225,"Thanks, Chris. And good morning to everyone. Starting on Slide 3, coming out of the third quarter, Ingersoll Rand remains in the position of strength, demonstrating again that as a purpose-driven company, we remain grounded in what we do and how we do it. In the environment we find ourselves in right now, our agility, our nimbleness and using IRX for speed to execution has proven to be our competitive advantage. Of course, global macroeconomic factors continue to be a challenge.
We're not immune to demanding supply chain inflation and labor market conditions, but we continue to outperform on our commercial and operational commitments, and we are again raising our guidance. This outperformance is propelled by continued organic and inorganic investments into the organization and our comprehensive M&A-focused capital allocation strategy is fueled by our drive to create long-term value and compound stockholder returns.
Moving to Slide 4, we remain committed to our 5 strategic imperatives, and we'll focus our remarks today on our growth and capital allocation strategies. Before we move to those, I have 2 important call-outs. Our strategy to deploy talent across our organization is paying off. We just concluded our second employee engagement survey this year across all 16,000 employees globally. And I am extremely proud to share we had outstanding participation at 91% and several of our scores improved again, placing us well above the relevant manufacturing benchmarks in results and participation. In fact, on responses to how happy are you working at Ingersoll Rand, we now rank in the top 10% of manufacturing organizations.
When we talk about outperforming because of our agility, nimbleness and IRX, it's because of our people. This is our culture. We always say and continue to believe that the combination of a highly engaged workforce coupled with an ownership mindset is a catalyst for long-term performance. The fact that our voluntary turnover is less than 3% even in this challenging environment also speaks highly of the culture we're nurturing and how we inspire our employees. I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the tremendous contributions of each and every one of our 16,000 employees, without whom these results would not be possible.
Our operate sustainably strategic imperative also highlights the speed at which our company moves. In less than 18 months, we have been upgraded twice by MSCI, and we sit now at a rating of A. This is an improvement from approximately the bottom 1/3 to now being in the top 1/3 of the companies rated by MSCI. And we believe, based on our work, we will continue to see our ratings improve with the various ESG rating providers. Great strides have been made this year to accelerate growth and allocate capital effectively.
As we have announced, deployed approximately $1 billion towards M&A. In Q3, we completed both the Seepex and Maximus Solutions acquisitions, and announced Air Dimensions acquisition last week. We also announced an agreement to acquire Tuthill Pumps earlier this week. We shared our comprehensive capital allocation strategy with you earlier in September. Along with our focus on M&A, we completed a large share repurchase as part of KKR sale of their final equity stake in the company as well as prepayment of the more expensive tranche of debt taken out last year during the onset of COVID. And in addition, we initiated a quarterly dividend that began in Q4 and a new Board authorized $750 million share repurchase program. On the next slide is a partial preview of what's to come at our November 18 Virtual Investor Day, where we look forward to talking in more detail about the megatrends we and our customers are seeing -- are seeking to address and how Ingersoll Rand products and services help make life better for all our stakeholders.
Our strategy enables us to compound our contribution to addressing megatrends such as digitization, sustainability and quality of life through organic growth enablers, where we have specific advantages. For example, we continue to leverage our own unique and proprietary demand generation engine to drive a holistic approach to customer buying patterns. One that has already captured over 3 million end user contacts and allows us to generate over 200,000 marketing qualified leads per year. We also continue to invest in our industrial IoT platform as we aim to connect or digitally enable a meaningful portion of the 5 million assets that we have identified in the field.
Moving to Slide 6. We're not unique in needing to effectively manage the challenges of the current supply chain environment. However, our key differentiator is our ability to respond with agility and discipline through the use of IRX to quickly and effectively minimize negative impact from challenging supply chain conditions. I would like to specially thank our global sourcing and logistics team at Ingersoll Rand as well as our factory buyers and planners for their tireless efforts and creative thinking using data-backed analytics to overcome delivery gaps. We saw very early on that supply chain and logistics challenges were going to be an important issue. So we invested in this area to guarantee that we have rigorous processes and capabilities in place to succeed, and this has produced outstanding results.
Moving to Slide 7. We will now look more closely at our recent inorganic achievements. We signed a definitive agreement to acquire Tuthill Pumps, which is expected to close in Q4 and Air Dimensions, both of which will become part of the Precision and Science Technologies segment. We also closed the acquisition of Lawrence Factor, which will become part of the Industrial Technologies and Services segment. These 3 acquisitions are representative of the key characteristics we're targeting with our inorganic growth strategy.
Tuthill Pumps is the second asset we have purchased from Tuthill Corporation. It is a leader in the gear and piston pumping market, which supports the expansion of our positive displacement pump portfolio. This is another example of a multi-generation family owned company with premium assets that approached us on an exclusive basis because of the relationship that we have built and the opportunities they saw for their company and employees as part of the Ingersoll Rand family.
This is another testament to how our unique approach to employee ownership allows us to be at the front line in M&A. Air Dimensions is a market leader in gas diaphragm pumps, which is complementary to our existing lab and life science businesses and is specialized for environmental applications like emission monitoring and biogas. It has an impressive pre-synergy EBITDA margins of over 50% and more than 70% of its revenue comes from like-to-like replacement of original equipment and aftermarket parts.
We also closed the acquisition of Lawrence Factor, which will reside in the ICS segment. Lawrence Factor is a great example of an acquisition that is well aligned with our company purpose of making life better as the technology ensures safe work and play activities for people who depend on compressed air and gas through the proprietary air sampling and aftermarket offerings. All 3 of these acquisitions were valued on attractive purchase multiples and our synergy execution is expected to deliver mid-single-digit post-synergy realization by year 3, in line with our disciplined pre-deal screening process.
I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q3 financial performance."
334158,1684541995,2427154,"Ingersoll Rand Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Ingersoll Rand Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Vicente.

Moving to Slide 8, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q3. We saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX to overcome a challenging inflationary and supply chain constrained environment. Our commitment to deliver $300 million in cost synergies attributable to the Ingersoll Rand Industrial segment acquisition remains intact as we continue to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst. Total company orders and revenue increased 37% and 19% year-over-year, respectively, driven by strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. Compared to 2019, as reported, orders in Q3 were up 27% and 16% on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis, respectively, highlighting the strong performance of our business irrespective of the COVID-impacted 2020.
Our orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company, eclipsing Q2 and setting us up well as we move into Q4. The company delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $314 million, a year-over-year improvement of $62 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.7%, a 110 basis point improvement year-over-year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $307 million after taking into account the unique items as pointed out in the slide. Total liquidity of $3.1 billion at quarter end was up approximately $0.7 billion from prior year. This now takes our net leverage to 1.3x, a 1.2x improvement from prior year.
Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, orders increased 33% and revenue increased 17%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.13x for the quarter. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q4, which is up approximately 40% from the end of 2020. The IT&S and P&ST segments both saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA margin in ITS improved 150 basis points, while the PST segment margin declined 100 basis points, driven by the impact of the Seepex and Maximus Solutions acquisitions, both of which closed in Q3. When adjusted to exclude the impact of the Seepex and Maximus acquisitions, PST margins increased by 20 basis points.
Finally, corporate costs came in at $35 million for the quarter, up year-over-year primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs as well as targeted commercial growth investments in areas like demand generation. We expect corporate costs to remain elevated at comparable levels in Q4 due to the same drivers.
One other item of note is the adjusted tax rate, which came in at 10% for the quarter and stands at 15% on a year-to-date basis. The adjusted rate is benefiting from our tax restructuring efforts that we've outlined before and specifically a few nonrecurring impacts driven by our movement of IP and implementation of a royalty structure as well as the utilization of carryforward foreign tax credits. As a result, we do expect the adjusted rate for the year to be in the mid-teens. But as we look ahead to 2022, we would expect the rate to be back in the low 20s due to the nonrepeat of some of these items.
Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow for the quarter was $131 million on a continuing ops basis, driven by strong operational performance across the business and prudent working capital management. CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million, and free cash flow included $6 million of synergy and stand-up outflows related to the IR merger. In addition, free cash flow also included $220 million in cash tax payments related to the capital gains realized due to divestitures of the HPS and SVT segments.
Finally, free cash flow also included a $49 million payment from Trane Technologies for post-closing adjustments related to the IR merger. Excluding these 3 items, adjusted free cash flow was $307 million. Leverage for the quarter was 1.3x, which was a 1.2x improvement as compared to prior year. Total company liquidity now stands at $3.1 billion based on approximately $2 billion of cash and over $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility.
Liquidity decreased by $1.6 billion in the quarter as we executed our capital allocation strategy by buying back $731 million in shares as part of KKR sale of their remaining equity stake, strategically deployed nearly $600 million to M&A and prepaid approximately $400 million in debt to remove the tranche of debt taken out during the onset of COVID-19, which carried a higher interest rate. We maintain considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy through M&A, coupled with targeted internal investment to drive sustainable organic growth. I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segments."

In our Industrial Technologies and Services segment, revenue was up 14%. The team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 26% year-over-year and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.5%, up 150 basis points year-over-year with an incremental margin of 33%. Organic orders were up 31%. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the high 30s percent. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows orders for oil-free up over 50% and oil-lubricated up over 30%.
In the Americas, orders in North America were up mid-20s, while Latin America was up high 40s. Mainland Europe delivers strong performance up high 40s, while India and Middle East saw continued strong recovery with order rates up in excess of 70%. Asia Pacific continues to perform well with orders up high 30s, driven by strong mid-50% growth in China, a mid-single-digit decline across the rest of Asia Pacific. In vacuum and blowers, orders were up low 30s on a global basis, with strong double-digit growth across each of our regions.
Moving next to power tools and lifting, orders for the total business were up mid-20s and saw continued positive growth, driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improved execution on new product launches. We will also like to highlight 1 of the many ways that we enable our customers to become more sustainable. Our LeROI gas compressors are used to capture biogas emitted from landfills, dairy farms and wastewater facilities. As the gas is emitted, the system captures the gas, cleans the methane from other gases such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide and our LeROI product compresses the methane for reinjection into pipelines or storage for power generation, both of which enable the customer to capture additional economic value.
The compressor enables to capture up to 50% of the emitted biogas, whereas without it, 100% of the gas will be released into the atmosphere. Our significant installed base of 25,000 units will help capture 240 million cubic feet of biogas in the next 2 years. Technologies such as these across our portfolio enable us to advance our ESG impact, not only with the steps we're taking internally to reduce our carbon footprint, water and energy usage, but also create significant value for our customers from both sustainability and economic perspective.
Moving to Slide 12. In the Precision and Science Technologies segment, revenue was up 10% organically, which remains encouraging given the tough comps due to COVID-related orders and revenue in Q3 of 2020 for the medical business. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $76 million, which was up 17%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.7%, down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by the impact of Seepex and Maximus Solutions. And again, the segment was up 20 basis points excluding the impact of those acquisitions.
Overall, organic orders were up 25%, driven by the ARO and Milton Roy product lines and the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which serve lab, life sciences, water and animal health end markets. All of these businesses were up double digits in the quarter. Incremental margins were up 25% as reported and 33% when excluding Seepex and Maximus. In this segment, we would like to highlight the momentum our Haskel hydrogen solutions business continues to build to making life better through a more sustainable world.
We have announced a long-term agreement with Hiringa refueling to supply high-capacity hydrogen refueling stations for a nationwide green hydrogen network across New Zealand. Hiringa has placed the first order of 4 stations with a total commitment of 24 stations to be provided through 2026. The totality of this frame agreement alone will double our Haskel hydrogen refueling business on a revenue basis. We're incredibly excited about this partnership. And as we spoke about last quarter, the investments we're making to expand our technologies and manufacturing capabilities in this high-growth markets are producing meaningful growth.
Moving to Slide 13. Given the company's performance in Q3 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our guidance excludes both the divested High Pressure Solutions and Specialty Vehicle Technologies segment, as well as the pending acquisition of Tuthill Pumps. However, Seepex, Maximus Solutions, Air Dimensions and Lawrence Factor are included in our guidance. Our prior revenue guidance was up mid-teens on a reported basis, comprised of low double-digit organic growth across both of our segments. We're now guiding up high teens in total with low double-digit growth, organic growth across both segments. This reflects an approximately 100 basis point increase in organic growth for the total company as compared to prior guidance. FX is expected to continue to be low single-digit tailwind. M&A was previously expected to contribute approximately $60 million in revenue, but given the closed acquisitions of Maximus, Seepex, Air Dimensions and Lawrence Factor, we're increasing that expected contribution to $135 million.
Based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.175 billion to $1.195 billion, which represents a $20 million improvement from prior guidance at the midpoint of the range. In terms of cash generation, we expect adjusted free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion to remain greater than or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% of revenues. And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be in the mid-teens for the reasons Vik provided earlier.
Turning to Slide 14. We're very excited about our upcoming Virtual Investor Day, which is fast approaching and will be held on November 18. We look forward to outlining our long-term growth strategy fueled by alignment with megatrends and compounded by our organic growth enablers. We will provide detail on our markets and technologies and further discuss how our strong talent, operational execution, demand generation and M&A capabilities, coupled with a sustainable growth mindset creates incredible competitive advantages for our company.
We will also outline future financial targets. You can register for the event using the link on Slide 14, and I look forward to seeing many of you on the webcast.
Moving to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in an outstanding position. 2021 is poised to be a great year despite the challenging environment. To our employees, I want to again say thank you for your relentless efforts to execute and solve top problems throughout the quarter. They are absolutely appreciated and it is apparent in our company's performance. We are actively investing to deliver outpaced growth, both organically and through M&A to continue increasing the quality of our portfolio. We continue to take our role as a sustainability-minded industry leader very serious, and our employees eagerly embrace IRX to put us in that leadership position. We're proud of the transformation we have achieved at Ingersoll Rand and are excited about the future opportunity to compound growth and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A."

Sales, obviously, you feel good about what the demand conditions look like. You're layering on some acquisitions here. 3Q was a good quarter in terms of performance.

In this current environment, we continue to be prudent based on all the overall supply chain environment kind of noise or situation that you hear out there. In addition, just to point out, ITS margins in Q4 2020 were up 400 basis points, reaching 26% margins. What our guidance here implies is that even with all the inflation, discretionary spend, increases and investments, we're going to be kind of flattish in margin expansion year-over-year, which speaks to all the great actions that the teams continue to execute and put that segment to a very solid margin performance in this environment, we believe.
And PST margins for the core business, which is kind of excluding the M&A that we said is EBITDA decretive, but gross margin accretive and some of the accelerated hydrogen investments that we're doing based on that frame order that we just received, the EBITDA margin profile still is in the 30s kind of range, which we view as quite healthy given the tough comps from medical shipments in 2020 as well as the inflation and discretionary investments that we have done here in 2021 and still do -- plan to do in the fourth quarter. So we feel good about that. And at the same time, prudent in terms of how we see supply chain out there."

So in the context of Q3, price realization was a little bit in excess of 3% across the entire enterprise, which obviously speaks to the healthy performance and frankly, the proactive measures that, frankly, all of our business has taken. Pricing did slightly outweigh inflation in Q3. So we were price/cost positive in the context of Q3. We would expect to be fairly comparable to that equation in Q4. Now it is worth noting, obviously, that not unexpectedly, inflation, obviously, headwinds have risen in the second half of the year compared to the first half. We always expected that, and that's why we kind of got ahead a lot of the pricing actions.
So again, I think we're quite pleased with the performance and the momentum that we're seeing. As we think about 2022, I think, frankly, a little bit too early to start guiding on numbers just yet. But obviously, we would expect to see healthy carryover on the pricing actions. I'd say the majority of the pricing actions that we have taken are list price oriented. So obviously, it should be inherently a little bit stickier. But obviously, we do obviously have some carryover inflation that we will be dealing with into 2022 as well.

It's obviously leading to that 35% order growth and 20% revenue growth in PST that you saw. If we look back and Gardner Denver or Medical business, it averaged, I think, something like mid-single-digit growth. But given the sort of niche focus of PST and what seems like higher growth markets, is it fair to say that PST could average higher than mid-single digits as you go into '22 and beyond?"

And what we saw quarter-over-quarter, Q2 to Q3, we saw actually the momentum of orders really accelerate in China, which is kind of contradictory to some of the things that you hear out there in the company. So it speaks to a lot of the self-help initiatives that the team is doing. We spoke about relaunching the Gardner Denver compressors, which obviously has proven to be a tremendous success into -- and that was something that we always said we were super excited about the combination of Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver because we can have a multi-brand, multichannel strategy, particularly in China.
And the team has just done a phenomenal job leveraging the I2V initiative and action to then relaunch an entire product portfolio with Gardner Denver. And the second piece is blows and vacuums. Blows and vacuums was a fairly small piece in China. And again, I think the team is putting a lot of good dedication and localizing and really penetrating some of the end markets that we have seen are good in terms of applications in other regions. The rest of Asia Pacific, I can now maybe split it between emerging and developed -- developing like Australia, for example. And that still continues to perform fairly well. Where we saw maybe a little bit of softness was on the emerging, maybe countries like Vietnam or Philippines was creating a lot of shutdown due to COVID. But again, that's a fairly small portion of our business, therefore, the  China overcoming some of the decline still drive meaningful growth in the quarter for Asia Pacific."

It really speaks to a lot of the great work that everyone is doing, and I will say great work supported by IRX of the process and the tools that we use. So we have definitely leveraged the IRX tool. As you know, it's a very high cadence, high-touch mechanism that we use to just accelerate how we execute and we prioritize the teams to the critical items. And that has allowed us to create this massive agility and nimbleness even though, obviously, we're fairly large global company and allows us to really redirect the teams to the top priorities that are happening out there.
So for example, we leverage IRX when logistics was a major issue. And you could go, say, for example, into a factory, you can see how IRX tool we were leveraging to track the backlog of containers that we needed to fulfill and acquire, as an example. I mean as simple as that could be. And now we're leveraging the IRX -- IRX to prioritize the suppliers and the commodities that we need to go after. And again, that daily, weekly cadence of ensuring that the teams continue to see a good momentum and good perspective is really what's giving us the outcome that you see here. So I think as we continue -- I mean, we think we live in a very dynamic world that we'll continue to see some maybe challenges. And -- but that's why we have always said that agility and nimbleness is going to be a core competitive advantage, follow through the use of IRX as a tool to really execute is just giving us that great sense of comfort zone that the teams will be able to continue to perform well."

You see that we're focused not only on the growth, but also on the profitability. So we believe in profitable growth is one of our key drivers and enablers for us.
And with the unique differentiation that we're launching in terms of technologies that reduce total cost of ownership and great energy reductions, I think that is what position us really well to continue to take some share and continue to launch products that help with that. I mean 1 example, the team in Europe, the CompAir team just launched a new compressor, very large -- fairly sizable compressor that some radical new technology and it is one of the most efficient compressors of that size and power in the market today. So a lot of continued innovation is really what is driving the momentum in my view.

So it will be a little bit more dilutive than the impact you saw discretely in Q3 just because of the full quarter impact of Seepex. But to Vicente's point here, the good news on Seepex is that's a gross margin accretive business.

And I think this is a great lead question, Markus, as we kind of go into the Investor Day because we have case stories actually that we will show you how we have expanded our channel to really accelerate the growth and also reposition the product to really accelerate the growth. So I think it has to do with a lot of the work that we have done since the product summit. If you remember back in the -- I don't know, about a year ago, we spoke a lot about product summit and how the team.
So it's just been a very thoughtful way and then executed with the use of IRX to really reposition a lot of the products on the channel without creating any conflict. And I think that has proven to be a pretty successful recipe. I mean availability in some products has been actually quite good. I mean I saw the team is marketing, for example, on blowers that we have one of the best lead times and how that is accelerating now even the momentum as they see here in the fourth quarter. To your question in terms of the visibility of backlog, customers for compressors because you have to customize many times the options to the specific application, there's not a lot of preorder that can be done on compressors just because of the optionality.
And the visibility that we have in the backlog, in the compressors is really in the more larger compressors, the multistage centrifugal compressor that are kind of -- we positioned that as more long cycle business. And those when we're doing a contract with the customer, we have caveats that we could actually pass or surcharge any specific cost increases that we're seeing through the supply chain in this environment. So I think we feel that we're doing everything that we can to protect ourselves in case that obviously inflation continues to stay at this level and commodities do not go down.

In terms of the comment on whether you could reprice backlog, as I said, there's components like the longer cycle that you do have some of those optionality. By and large, though, no.

He is a proud veteran who continues to help fellow veterans transitioning from military to civilian life, and he is integral to executing our strategic plan to deliver value for our shareholders. 
Chris is one example among our 16,000 employees who lives our company purpose inside and outside the company. And as you see on Slide 3, anchoring to our purpose is working. We're realizing the achievement of our desired targets. You will hear 3 key themes today. First, we're accelerating our transformation. It's amazing to think a year ago, we closed the Ingersoll Rand industrial transaction. And today, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion of value with 2 strategic divestitures, putting us in a great position to continue our portfolio transformation. 
Second, you will hear about how we are over-delivering to our expectations. As you will recall, during the down year of 2020, we controlled decremental margins. And now in the upcycle, we're delivering solid incremental margins. We're delivering strong organic growth in orders and revenue. And that illustrates our organic investments in demand generation and new product development are also working. 
And third, you will hear how Ingersoll Rand's execution excellence, what we call IRX, is becoming our economic engine to unlocking our potential. Our processes are only as good as the team that executes them. Culture and human capital management are key differentiators at Ingersoll Rand. We have a highly engaged workforce who act like owners because they are owners. Every day, our employees make decisions that demonstrate thinking and acting like owners with the power of IRX behind them. 
Our employees all around the world deserve sincere thanks for their adaptability, resiliency, dedication and determination. We will continue supporting our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and mental well-being. And on that point, our thoughts are with everyone dealing with pandemic situations, particularly in India right now. 
Moving to Slide 4. You see the road map we highlighted during our Q3 2020 earnings call. And since then, we have achieved substantial traction. Today, I will concentrate remarks around the last 2 strategies, as we have had a lot of recent momentum across these areas. Starting with Operate Sustainably and turning to Slide 5. Operating Sustainability is one of our strategic pillars, because it engages employees, customers and communities while delivering shareholder returns. In February, we committed to some aggressive targets around climate goals. I am proud that our teams continue to deliver and execute on these goals. 
For example, last week was Earth Day. And our employees participated in planting more than 3,000 trees and collecting over 4,000 pounds of waste while recycling almost 20% of that. However, advancing our ESG journey goes beyond our environmental commitments. It is also about our social and governance actions. Last week, you saw we announced our 2025 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals. We set this goal to accelerate and illustrate our commitment to the representation of talent and the career advancement and sense of belonging of all employees. 
And actually, one of the boldest and most belonging acts we have done in support our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts, a connection that some may not really make, was around our $150 million equity last September to all of our employees worldwide. Broad-based employee ownership has an equity component, not often explored. Equity grants and broad-based employee ownership, such as what we did, provide employees a tangible financial stake in company performance, and that benefits employees, families, communities and the economy at large. 
Repeatedly, studies show only represented population increased their earnings and wealth if they are employed in organizations that offer equity grants. And that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner that ties into equity and how we directly impact global ESG efforts. As I said last quarter, we see broad-based employee ownership as a game-changer. Our human capital management priorities are part of why we added Operate Sustainably as a strategic pillar. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals are the latest advancement. And we will use IRX as our key enabler to deliver on this role as we do every other critical initiative in our company. 
Moving to Slide 6. We have also used IRX to deliver against our capital allocation strategy. And as we see here, the outcome has been extremely effective. On the first of this month, we completed the majority interest sale of the High Pressure Solutions segment. And a little more than a week later, announced an agreement to sell Club Car. IRX enabled us to accelerate these transactions and make them happen. We have solid processes executed by engaged teams to ensure we always maximize value creation in an expedited way. And that's our special and unique economic engine. 
With these divestitures, we're proud that buyers will continue the commitment to employ ownership, which may be a little unusual for this type of transaction, but as I've said before, it is important to us on many fronts. And with these divestitures, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion in value. 
And on Slide 7, we see a visual illustrating the volume and timing of transaction milestones in our evolution over the last 4 years, including the completed and announced divestitures this month. Last quarter, I mentioned capital allocation is a huge part of my personal focus and I have been actively discussing this with our Board. Those discussions continue. And as we have done all along with our capital allocation strategy, we will inform you when there is something significant to share. 
Along with this today, I'll give you some additional color on how we have enhanced our inorganic growth strategy. So let's look at Slide 8. I have mentioned IRX discipline a lot this morning. It is an execution engine to drive change in every area of the business. From our environmental goals and net working capital goals to our new product development goals and our diversity, equity and inclusion goals. IRX has been transformational in helping us with the integration of companies like Tuthill and Albin, as well as helping us with divestitures and accelerating our M&A funnel. You can see our funnel has increased 5x since Q2 of last year. 
The average revenue of the companies in the funnel has increased by more than 50%, and we're moving potential acquisitions through the funnel much faster. And we have not only been integrating Ingersoll Rand and Garden Denver over the past year, but we have also completed a bolt-on acquisition with Tuthill Vacuum and Blower Systems being the most recent one. And we have already seen solid progress with Tuthill, such as growth outside the U.S. where we highlighted that as a great opportunity and already received a multimillion-dollar order in Asia Pacific during the first quarter. 
The simultaneous execution of small growth, acquisitions and divestitures highlights how IRX enables capabilities to drive significant inorganic growth. I will now turn it over to Vik to provide an update on our financials. Vik?"

We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q1. Q1 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued signs of improvement across industrial end markets. 
Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 29% and 17%, respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. In fact, our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company and set us up well as we move into Q2. In addition, the company continued to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as a catalyst and we remain on track to deliver on our $300 million cost synergy commitment. 
The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $293 million, a year-over-year improvement of $107 million, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 21.4%, a 550 basis point improvement year-over-year. Continuing performance from previous quarters, we also achieved incremental margins of 54% in Q1. One item to note, these financial metrics do not include the High Pressure Solutions segment, which was classified as discontinued operations in Q1 with relevant restatements to prior periods. Given the recently completed sale, we will not report on this segment moving forward. Free cash flow for the quarter was $108 million, up $78 million year-over-year, yielding total liquidity of $2.6 billion at quarter end. 
Turning to Slide 10. For the total company, orders increased 25% and revenue increased 13%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. The IT&S, Precision & Science Technologies and SVT segments all saw double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. 
Starting first with IT&S. The total segment saw 13% FX-adjusted orders growth with strong momentum in core compressor technologies with the Americas showing mid-single-digit orders improvement, EMEIA with low 20s percent growth and Asia Pacific with high double-digit improvement. Precision & Science saw 14% FX adjusted orders growth in the quarter. Continued double-digit growth in product lines like Medical and Dosatron drove this performance given their niche end market exposure in areas like lab, life sciences, water and animal health, as well as strong performance from the ARO brand, which primarily serves core industrial markets. 
Specialty Vehicles saw exceptionally strong orders performance, up 89% excluding FX. The team has shown positive orders growth for 5 straight quarters, and Q1 saw continued strong growth in consumer vehicles as well as golf offerings and aftermarket. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.24 for the quarter, an improvement from the prior year level of 1.13. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q2. 
The company delivered $293 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 57% year-over-year. The IT&S, Precision Science and SVT segments all saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong triple-digit margin expansion. And finally, corporate costs came in at $34 million for the quarter, consistent with prior expectations. 
Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $118 million on a continuing ops basis, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. This compares to free cash flow of $30 million in the first quarter of prior year on a continuing ops basis in what is typically our seasonally weakest quarter from a free cash flow perspective. 
CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million and free cash flow included $10 million of outflows related to the transaction. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 1.9x, which was an 0.1 turn improvement as compared to the prior quarter. This included $184 million cash outflow to fund the Tuthill acquisition, which closed in February and did not include the cash received from the HPS divestiture, which closed in April. We have line of sight to leverage coming down materially to below 1x once the SVT sale is completed, which, as mentioned previously, is expected in Q3 of this year. 
On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.6 billion based on approximately $1.64 billion of cash on hand and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. With our current liquidity and the additional cash we expect to receive from the HPS and SVT divestitures, we will have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. 
I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segment performance."

Overall, organic orders were up 11% and revenue up 9%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.14x. In addition to orders and revenue growth, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 57% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.1%, up 610 basis points year-over-year with incremental margin of 65%. 
Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low 20%. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products show that orders for both were up above 20%. From a regional split for orders and compressors, in the Americas, North America performed comparatively better at up mid-single digits, while Latin America was up low single digits. Mainland Europe was up mid-teens, while India, Middle East and Africa saw continued recovery at up high double digits. Asia Pacific continues to perform well with orders up high double digits driven by high double-digit growth in both China and across the rest of Asia Pacific. 
Moving to vacuum and blowers. Orders were up low double digits on a global basis with double-digit growth across each of our regions. Moving next to the power tools and lifting, The total business was up low double digits in orders and pivoted to positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improved execution. On the right side, we're highlighting the impact that our technologies are having on our customers' sustainability efforts. As you may remember, we acquired Runtech in 2017. 
Runtech designs and manufacturers energy-efficient solutions primarily for use in pulp and paper mills. Since the acquisition, we have done several new product launches, as well as expanded commercially in all the regions, and this has led to a 65% increase in the installed base. This has helped achieve an average of 45% energy savings per installation and saved several billions of gallons of water annually across the installed base. 
Moving to Slide 13 and the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall, organic orders were up 12%, driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which serve lab, life sciences and water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits And we also saw strong performance in our more industrial end market-oriented products like Milton Roy and ARO. 
The momentum on our hydrogen solution continues to build, and we saw some strong funnel activity. Revenue was up 7% organically, producing a book-to-bill of 1.2x. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $67 million, which was up 26%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.2%, up 350 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margins of 59%. 
From a sustainability perspective, we're highlighting our YZ brand Zero Emission Odorization and YZ Connect. ZEO is an injection system that odorizes natural gas and hydrogen delivered to communities to help safeguard people. As customers replace legacy systems with our new ZEO, this product is expected to dramatically eliminate emissions of methane. Our customers' odorization programs are further enhanced by YZ Connect, which provides remote monitoring capability through its Internet of Things, cloud platform, which is another example on how our customers can lean on us to help make life better. 
Moving to Slide 14 and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. Overall, Q1 was another very strong quarter for the SVT team. Orders and revenue were up organically 89% and 29%, respectively, driven by continued strength in consumer, golf and aftermarket programs. Adjusted EBITDA of $48 million increased 162% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.1%. This represents an outstanding 1,020 basis points improvement versus prior year, showcasing the power of IRX and the team's application to its tool to capture value and market share. And while this business continues to perform well, we made a strategic choice to divest the asset to continue aligning our portfolio to our mission-critical flow creation technologies. 
And as mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong economic outcome with the sale of Club Car to Platinum Equity. It was very important to us in this transaction and in our sale of HPS that we honor our commitment to employee ownership. As a result, employee recipients of our 2020 all-employee equity grant will have 50% of the award vest at closing and 50% will be replaced by a new equity-linked program implemented by Platinum. We're very pleased with this outcome for the Club Car team. 
Moving to Slide 15. Given the company's performance in Q1 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our initial revenue guidance was up high single digits to low double digits on a reported basis, comprised of mid-single-digit organic growth across each of the 3 segments. After removing SVT, we're now guiding up low double digits with high single-digit organic growth across each of the segments. FX is expected to continue to be a low single-digit tailwind for the business on a total year basis, given the weakening of the U.S. dollar against major foreign currencies like euro and British pound. 
So that is a slight headwind as compared to the initial guidance. From a phasing perspective, we anticipate the first half of the year to be up mid-teens, while the FX tailwinds remained most evident during the first half of 2021. Overall growth in the second half of the year is expected to normalize a bit comparatively, but still be up high single digits. We have received a lot of questions from investors on supply chain, inflationary pressures and the price cost dynamic. When we issued our initial guidance, we took the anticipated inflationary headwinds into consideration. And while we continue to see pressures around certain commodities and logistics, we have implemented our IRX tools to help mitigate the impact and our teams have executed very well, including price and execution and our continued I2V initiative. 
We do see this environment continue in Q2 and likely after, but we're confident that leveraging our IRX process and working with our suppliers will allow us to continue exceeding our customers' expectations. Based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion, which represents approximately a $45 million improvement from original guidance at the midpoint of the range when excluding SVT. 
In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to remain greater or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to remain 1.5% to 2% of revenue And finally, we expect adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. 
Moving to Slide 16. As we wrap up today's call, Ingersoll Rand is in a great place. 2021 is poised to be a great year. The first quarter provided a solid springboard with momentum into Q2. We take our role as a sustainably-minded industry leader very seriously, one who is focused on employee matters like broad-based ownership, belonging and reducing our impact to the environment. I am proud of all of our employees around the world. Thank you for how you come together every day to be there for our customers, solve problems and lean on each other and collaborate. 
I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A."

And in other kind of the puts and takes, let me just kind of give you a little bit of color here. I mean Q1, as you pointed out, I mean, very strong across segments and regions, and that is really encouraging. A few things to highlight. In Q1, we're seeing kind of an easier comp on a year-over-year basis due to the cost synergy savings as most of our savings really started to show in April of last year and onwards. 
We're also seeing the solid price realization based on the actions that we took in late 2020 and the continued execution of I2V and other initiatives. As we go into Q2 and the second half, if I kind of break it down by segment, ITS, overall, we're still expecting that kind of 30% to 35% incrementals, even with the headwinds around not only the inflation but also the discretionary costs coming back which again speaks to the ongoing synergy delivery efforts as well as our focus on kind of quality of earnings. 
On PST, touching first on Q2, as a reminder and as we highlighted in our guidance, Q2 incrementals will be lower than average to the fact that in 2020, we saw outsized demand for our medical compressors and pumps used again to fight COVID. And the majority of these orders came in, in Q1 and Q2 with shipments mostly in Q2 and Q3. And as a reminder, these shipments on the medical products came in at a premium margin. In addition, PST is seeing some of the inflationary headwinds that most companies are seeing. And while the back half of the year will be more normalized to about that kind of 35% and above. 
And so again, having said all this, I mean, as you know, we're very -- we have a pretty strong process in terms of price, I2V, sourcing that our teams are actively executing to offset any of these kind of headwinds coming in."

Again, we're not going to go crazy on the market. We'll continue to stay very disciplined in this environment. We buy companies that are a strategic fit.

In terms of kind of long cycle end markets, most of our long-cycle business, as all of you know, is in kind of what we call the Nash/Garo business, as well as the very large compressors, which is kind of the centrifugal compressor that the multistage centrifugal compressors. 
I will categorize the large multistage centrifugal compressors, orders were very strong and positive. This is an area where we are seeing very good start with -- when you think about kind of some of the end markets, we're seeing good momentum on kind of reshoring on some companies as well as markets like renewable energy and general industrial. The Nash/Garo in the first quarter was kind of down, primarily due to the timing, we say.

So typically speaking, you tend to see Q1 seasonally a little bit of the weakest, Q4 seasonally strongest and Q2, Q3 in between. I don't think you're going to see anything dramatically different in the context of the phasing or how we think about seasonality here in the context of 2021."

On the price cost, the good thing is that we actually planned for the inflation during the budget time last year with the teams. I mean we were seeing early indications of inflation, and we basically told the teams to plan for the inflation. And with that, to plan for the price. And then we executed on the price. And I think it was part of kind of our original guidance as well and reason why we -- it definitely increased prices by then. And I think the inflation is really coming in fairly in line with what we planned. 
And I would say, in addition, from a margin perspective, we continue to run the I2V procurement work that we're doing with -- that we did with the synergy integration between Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver, and that's kind of working really well. As we move forward, I mean, clearly, we continue to watch carefully this inflation. And the teams, they're kind of lock and loaded to plan for incremental price increases based on what we're seeing permanently, typically like the logistics side of things. But yes, we're looking at doing a proactively positioning of our products here in this inflationary market. 
And in terms of supply chain, I mean, we're definitely not immune to what you're seeing and hearing a lot about logistics. But I think a couple of things to highlight here. First, we're mostly in the region for the region. And this has proven to be a great strategy for us, not only in these difficult times, but also as companies looking to reshoring, it has been very helpful for us. As a second, we're working with a much larger purchasing power than in the past. And many of these are kind of new partnerships that we're creating. And this really has helped in the supply chain as they want to deliver and have very good terms with us. So I'll say that supply chain, not immune, but I think the team really working very well to get it in control."

I think on the timing, as kind of alluded, I think we've been very thoughtful on the timing. We said that we want to create stability, but at the same time, we want to improve some of these companies so we can maximize the value that we could generate. And at the same time, we did it in a way that we want to have some sort of visibility to the funnel. So in parallel, we've been working on all these aspects, not only the divestitures, but also accelerating the funnel. And you can see how some of the statistics on the funnel. And we're excited that the funnel is 5x what we had even last year. The average revenue size per company is more than 50% and the velocity, which is really important, has been cut by half.

So I think the answer is a mid-20s percent EBITDA margin kind of on the ITS segment is, without question, I think where we are targeting this business to be from a more medium-term perspective. 
And I think one thing to add would be really encouraged by the momentum we're seeing, frankly, across all the parts of that business. It's really not coming from one distinct area. I would tell you, all of the regions as well as the power tools business inclusive continuing to show good momentum. And I think some of the commercial initiatives that we also have. Vicente just spoke to, continuing to see good aftermarket traction. We're seeing a little bit outsized OE right now, which we think is a good thing as we kind of start to show more of that shift into aftermarket and build from that 40% kind of baseline we have right now of aftermarket sales, that will obviously help as well.

And that was basically up in the kind of 20s range, the industrial vacuum. 
Our industrial vacuum is really collocated within kind of large OEMs and OEMs. We always said that industrial vacuum was always a leading -- a good leading indicator for industrial recovery. And it is very exciting to continue to see that momentum happening on that industrial vacuum side of the business. So I think that's very good news for what the industrial recovery market is seeing. 
In terms of some of the other things, it's actually also good momentum based on a lot of the self-help initiatives on the commercial side. I think, Josh, it's exciting to see that we're seeing really good traction on some of the commercial kind of product summit activities that we talked about prior quarters in terms of the combination of Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand. Examples like oil-free product like the Ultima, which was a Gardner Denver technology and launched as Ingersoll Rand in Europe. That saw really, really good momentum in Europe, and that is getting launched now here in the U.S. So expect to see that accelerate the momentum, too, as well.

So I'll say good combination of maybe easy comps, but at the same time, some really good momentum in China and Asia Pacific. I think this is -- we always highlighted when we created the integration of Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver that we said Asia Pacific is definitely an area of growth and opportunity. And we're doing some very good organic investments. I mean, we spent a lot of new capital equipment to be able to have in region for region in areas like that. And I think it's really, really exciting. 
And we put a real new focus also on emerging markets in Southeast Asia, something that before with the scale that we had, it was very difficult to do. But now we have the scale, and these organic investments are definitely showing some good momentum. I think in the Americas, yes, as you said, particularly in the U.S., Andy, we will see better, easier comps here in the U.S. in the second half. Same in Europe. But I'd say as well, you saw that in Europe, at least on the compressor side, orders, we were kind of in the mid-teens up, while Americas or the U.S. mid-single-digit up. And maybe some of that is a little bit of timing in the sense that the Europeans, as I just mentioned before, they kind of went in faster in terms of doing some of these integration of the product lines that we've spoken about. And now we're seeing that getting implemented in the Americas. 
Again, Americas or the U.S. is a more complex environment where you have a combination of direct purchase with distribution. So we just wanted to be careful. But I think everything is going really well now in the U.S. as well, and we'll see some inflection here as we move forward."

No. Andy, I think you hit the nail on the head obviously when we -- so the answer to your question is you're completely right. Obviously, the direct material components of our synergy equation, most notably, the procurement side in I2V are frankly a function of volume. And we did note that even in 2020, obviously, volumes were not at kind of that kind of baseline 2019 level. What we have seen, for example, in procurement, I'd say probably better than expected percent realization on savings. So that has kind of been a nice kind of, I'd say, mitigant to lower volumes. 
Clearly, a higher volume equation clearly can materialize into higher savings. But as you said, some of that was definitely dialed in to the raise when we moved the number from $250 million to $300 million. We'd clearly indicated that the majority, if not all, of that really was coming from the direct material equation. Could there be some potential in the medium term over and above? Perhaps. But I think we want to continue to see how things play themselves out. 
But we're very encouraged and I think the momentum we're seeing, frankly, even still today on the procurement and the I2V side is very encouraging in the context of the price realization and the percent realization that the teams are actually recognizing.

I mean we're pretty pleased with, I think, the momentum we've already seen, but we've been very adamant that there are still a number of, I'd say, levers that we have to pull. First and foremost, I'll start with the tax rate. We mentioned that when we started as kind of 1 year ago, putting 2 companies together, we really didn't have what I would consider to be an optimized tax rate. We've done a lot of work, their tax organization, frankly, our whole organization has done a lot of work. We've started to implement a lot of those, I'd say, practices here, and you're already starting to see some good momentum on the tax rate. We've said that we're guiding to approximately 23%. And last year, we were 24% plus. We're already starting to see some good momentum there, and we have line of sight to getting that into the lower 20s over time. 
In terms of the working capital side, absolutely. I think the biggest area that is still ahead of us here is on the inventory side. We have mentioned, I think, a few times that inventory is really almost connected in some respects to a lot of our synergy delivery initiatives. We talk about procurement, and we focus a lot on the savings side, but there's also the -- making sure that you're negotiating terms properly and that you're actually making sure that you're pulling inventory only when you need it. And then also with the footprint side of the equation. Footprint is probably one of the biggest areas of the synergy equation. You really haven't started to see delivery in a material manner just yet. But you can be rest assured here when we start to actually optimize our footprint on the manufacturing side, there will be working capital opportunities there. 
So you put that all together and clearly, there are other areas in terms of the payables and receivables equation that we're working. Clearly, I think working capital is a major opportunity ahead that can help drive us to the levels that you're speaking to here over time. So I think we're encouraged. It's definitely, I'd say, a big focal point of the ops and finance and business teams. And we're going to continue to make momentum here as we move through this year and frankly, in next."

I know you guys have done a lot of work on looking at tracking discounting better and looking at various initiatives to sort of improve the way pricing flows through the organization. And I wonder, could you talk a little bit about the outcomes? As you look at your products, have you found that they have the pricing power you want? Or is there a structural upshift there? And as you look forward into the backlog and into years out, is that a material difference from the past?"

We typically never do peanut butter across price increases, it's just based on the specific product lines. And I will say that, as you know, our mission-critical products were very low cost relative to the overall system. And that is very good for us and works really well for us in situations of continuing to be able to increase price because of the mission criticalness and the low cost relative to the overall system that our products have. 
In terms of the stickiness and the elasticity, I mean, we have done a lot of work on testing pricing elasticity in many of our end markets and many of our products. We have a really great, I'll say, internal process for scoping that out and making sure that we continue to push the boundaries and the envelopes on that as we see that we can. But only we can only do it only as long as we have differentiated products, which is the other big play in terms of how our I2V has been really strong process for being able to continue to create differentiated products, whether it might be tweaks of innovation that is not only -- so it's a process that is not only for driving direct material costs down, but it's also driving some increase in profit -- price and profitability."

Yes. I mean I think generally speaking, a lot of the initiatives we talked about, I think, you've been speaking to, a lot of the questions we've had with regards to whether it be oil-free, whether it be investments in the hydrogen, whether it be the products that we actually highlighted in the release -- in the slides, the Runtech acquisition that we made back in 2017 or the ZEO application from the Precision Science Technologies business. Generally speaking, all of our NPDs that we're really looking at have facet of sustainability, energy savings and efficiency really baked in. 
So I would say it's probably the single biggest criteria, by and large, when we're looking at innovation. And it's also a huge criteria that we're looking at when we're actually looking at the M&A pipeline. So I'd say it's front and center. Trying to quantify exact dollars is probably a little bit tricky, but I would tell you it's probably the single biggest factor. And I would also point to we really made a commitment to it in the context of our ESG goals, which you can -- we've obviously spoken to quite a bit. So again, I think it's kind of permeating the culture and now we're actually putting distinct targets and goals that are associated with it as well."

We're proactively supporting vaccination efforts for employees based there. Again, this is because we're deemed as a critical manufacturer and you've seen that lack of oxygen in many hospitals. Our products are actually helping to enhance that. And so we're working really closely with the government to really accelerate that. But so far, no major impact, I would say.
