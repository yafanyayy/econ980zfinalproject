Let me start by summarizing some of the themes that DexCom accomplished in 2020. Total revenue grew 31% over 2019, driven by a record number of new patient additions.

Total revenue grew 31% over 2019, driven by a record number of new patient additions. This translates to more than $415 million in absolute dollar growth, another high watermark for DexCom. We doubled G6 capacity in the first 6 months of the year. Our team has done a great job to meet the ambitious plans that we outlined nearly 2 years ago to scale G6 capacity, leaving the company in the best inventory position that we have been in since the launch of G6. The scale-up led to strong gross margin expansion in 2020, even as we increasingly shift our business to the pharmacy channel. We closed the full year 2020 with our highest gross margin since 2017. 
Our enhanced capacity puts us in position to aggressively pursue our growth initiatives. This includes the expansion of our sales force, which we announced in October and have nearly completed as well as our efforts around product sampling and direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S. and international markets. 
Many of you have seen our most recent effort to drive category awareness as we kicked off a new campaign around one of our DexCom Warriors, Nick Jonas, including our ad during the Super Bowl. This bold effort should give you a sense for our belief about the market opportunity ahead of us. We've received great feedback from the campaign so far and look forward to joining forces with Nick and diabetes advocacy groups in the coming months to drive greater awareness of the benefits of CGM. 
At the height of the pandemic's first wave, we established a new effort in a matter of days to support hospitals needing to preserve personal protective equipment and utilize our remote monitoring technology. We've made significant progress in our work to bring DexCom CGM to people with type 2 diabetes, including both those on intensive insulin therapy and those who are not. We also announced several new initiatives in 2020 that we believe will position us to meet the kinds of patient growth that we expect over the next several years. 
Building on the success of our team in Manila, where we've strengthened our customer service metrics across the board, we announced a new global business services unit in Lithuania that will help serve our international operations. We also announced that we will be building our third manufacturing site and first international manufacturing site in Malaysia. This state-of-the-art facility will be key to scaling our G7 capacity and provide logistical advantages as we look to serve our growing international base. 
Speaking of G7, 2020 saw us initiate and complete the first G7 pivotal trial. We're very happy with these results and the feedback we've received from participants and clinicians involved in the trial has been outstanding. Our clinical work is continuing as we progress with the regulatory path in 2021 to support our goal to launch G7 in the second half of the year. 
In any given year, these are accomplishments that we would be proud of. But in 2020, our teams accomplished these goals during a global pandemic. I want to use this form again to say how proud I am of the DexCom employees who have embraced our mission to empower people to take control of diabetes in a year of very unique challenges. It is a privilege to both lead and learn from such a talented team. And rest assured, our team is focused on the growth opportunity ahead of us as we're now well on our way in 2021. 
This is shaping up to be another exciting year for the company, featuring our continued momentum as we look to bring G6 to many potential customers yet to use CGM, the ongoing manufacturing scale-up and launch of G7 and investing in several other key initiatives related to the growth pillars that we outlined at our recent Investor Day. We believe there is still a huge growth opportunity ahead, and we are investing to ensure that the company is positioned to deliver CGM as a mass market technology for greater health outcomes. 
The pandemic has contributed to structural changes in the way health care is delivered with DexCom CGM a valuable asset in the growing digital health and the remote monitoring health care ecosystems yet a majority of people with diabetes in the world continue to rely on fingerstick technology. It is because of these developing landscapes and our belief on what DexCom CGM offers that we are announcing the formation of DexCom Ventures today, which Steve Pacelli will lead. 
With this entrance into the venture capital space, we believe we will be able to accelerate development for innovative companies that share our commitment to empowering greater health outcomes for customers and their clinicians. This may include technologies with use cases that can be combined with our CGM system as well as independent technology platforms. 
To summarize, we are very proud of what we accomplished in 2020 and are moving forward with the same commitment to our users and the growth of DexCom well into the future. With that, I will turn it over to Quentin for a review of the fourth quarter financials and discussion of the 2021 outlook. Quen?"

As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. 
We reported worldwide revenue of $568.9 million for the fourth quarter compared to $462.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, representing growth of 23%. Our team did a great job maintaining momentum with new patient additions in the fourth quarter and accelerating our shift of the business into the pharmacy channel. Even with the increasing COVID lockdowns as the quarter progressed, new patients for the fourth quarter were in line with our original expectations for the year, a new record and a great achievement for our team. 
U.S. revenue grew 20% over the fourth quarter of 2019, totaling $451 million. We were able to drive more volume into the pharmacy channel than we originally expected, closing the year approaching 50% of our total U.S. commercial volume. This means that we are making excellent progress to position the company for long-term growth in the U.S. and an efficient operating model for the company. And while there is channel mix causing lower revenue per patient in the pharmacy channel, the underlying strength of the business saw fourth quarter unit volumes grow significantly more than our revenue growth rate in the U.S. 
Our international business reached a new high-water mark of $117 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, growing 35% over the fourth quarter of 2019. This growth includes strong performance in both our direct and distributor markets. We began an international DTC campaign in several of our markets in the fourth quarter and will continue to drive awareness of the benefits of our technology, knowing that CGM market penetration internationally remains even less than in the U.S. 
Our fourth quarter gross profit was $399.1 million or 70.2% of revenue compared to 66.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 70.2% of revenue represents our highest gross margin quarter in the past 5 years. This is another demonstration of the ability of our team to navigate our strategic shift to the pharmacy channel while delivering strong profitability across the organization. As Kevin noted, our successful scale-up of G6 has been a key driver of this margin expansion while also placing us in our strongest inventory position to date, allowing us to more aggressively target new users as we continue in 2021. 
Operating expenses were $294.7 million for Q4 2020 compared to $205.7 million in Q4 2019. The  year-over-year expense growth in the fourth quarter consists of several key areas of strategic investment, which includes roughly $15 million of nonrecurring spend related to enhancing our software development efforts and automation of our production capabilities. We also increased spending related to our DTC programs, product sampling and the expansion of our U.S. sales force. Even with significant investments throughout 2020 to prepare DexCom for future growth and efficiency, total operating expense growth for the year totaled 26%, well below our 31% revenue growth for the year. 
Operating income was $104.4 million or 18.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $103.6 million or 22.4% of revenue in the same quarter of 2019. For the year, we delivered more than 500 basis points of operating margin expansion, with full year 2020 operating margin of 16.6% exceeding our most recent guidance. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $159.2 million or 28% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $141.7 million or 30.6% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019. Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.3% also exceeded our most recent guidance and came in more than 300 basis points better than our original 2020 guidance. 
As our margin progress shows, the significant steps that we have taken over the past few years are having a great impact on our ability to translate revenue growth into profitability. We are confident that the trend will continue over the long-term as we move towards the 5-year targets that we laid out for you at our recent Investor Day by simultaneously taking opportunities that arise to invest in the growth ahead of us. 
Net income for the fourth quarter was $90.4 million or $0.91 per share. We significantly increased operating cash flow in 2020 and remain in a strong cash position, with greater than $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as we exit the year. This gives us the flexibility to pursue the strategic investments that we believe will allow us to maintain a leadership position in our field. These include some of the investments we discussed related to our fourth quarter activities. 
Turning to 2021 guidance. As we stated early last month, we anticipate full year revenues of $2.21 billion to $2.31 billion, representing growth of 15% to 20%. We expect new patient growth to continue to exceed our revenue growth rate again in 2021, with our team extending their efforts to drive U.S. commercial business into our preferred pharmacy channel. We've also contemplated potential benefits from our efforts to drive category awareness through our expanded sales force, DTC advertising, product sampling and integrated systems as well as general considerations around the competitive environment. 
Turning to margins. We have several considerations in 2021 as we position the business for efficient growth and long-term margin expansion, in line with what we outlined at our recent Investor Day. For 2021, we anticipate gross margins of approximately 65%, in line with our long-term expectations. This anticipates a slight shift from our 67% full year 2020 results, which we expect to be driven by the success of our pharmacy channel initiative as well as our 2021 investments in infrastructure related to our G7 scale up and OUS manufacturing facility in Malaysia. 
We expect operating margins of approximately 13%, reflecting our gross margin outlook as well as various investments we've contemplated in 2021. As you know, DexCom has advanced its profitability profile at a much faster pace than originally anticipated over the past few years, while at the same time, building the infrastructure to scale the business profitably. 
With the diabetes market still underpenetrated, we're going on the offense with these investments. We are continuing to invest in the growth of the business via DTC, sampling, new markets and the launch of new products that we mentioned at our Investor Day, including G7. We are also making a significant investment in the global sales force, including doubling the size of our U.S.-based commercial field team. We will also continue to work on advanced research and development, which is looking into future generations of products and sensing capability. 
We're making these investments to accelerate our ability to bring CGM to those in need. Additionally, we believe these investments will support the long-term profitability objectives that we set at Investor Day, while at the same time, yielding significant returns for our shareholders. However, in the near term, we want to be prudent about incurring these upfront costs in our guidance and let the benefits play out. We expect that adjusted EBITDA margins will be approximately 23% for 2021. 
Finally, with the release of the valuation allowance on income taxes in 2020. In 2021, we will start to have a tax rate that is applicable to earnings. We expect that rate, absent any changes in tax law, to be in the low to mid-20% range. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update."

As Kevin mentioned, our team did a great job executing on our strategic priorities throughout 2020. We quickly adapted the changes brought about by COVID and ensured not only that our existing patients could rely on their DexCom supplies, but the thousands of new patients could benefit from the use of G6. In fact, we closed the year with greater than 900,000 customers globally, up more than 38% over the end of 2019. 
We are excited by this growth, knowing the life-changing impact at CGM and the software tools that we provide with it can have on our patients. Just last month, we published 3 peer review studies in diabetes technology and therapeutics that showed a greater than 1 point A1c reduction for customers new to DexCom CGM in as little as 3 months. This study includes both type 1 and type 2 intensive insulin users, and the result validated the kind of outcomes we have seen before. 
But we took it 1 step further. We also saw a significant quality of life improvement for these patients as measured in terms of anxiety, emotional distress and burden of disease management, results that affirm our corporate mission to empower our users. We also demonstrated that the software tools we are building around our sensors are driving improved outcomes. 
Across our base, we see increased time in range for our users of real-time share and follow apps. We see increased time and range for users who engage with our Clarity software, and we see increased time and range for users who take advantage of our integration with Apple's Siri Virtual Assistant. In 2021, we will continue to work aggressively to expand our customer base so that more and more people can experience these improved outcomes with DexCom. As we outlined in our recent Investor Day and at the conference presentation last month, we prioritized 3 pillars of growth in the near term and look forward to progress on all 3 fronts in 2021, while we also lay the foundation for longer-term market expansion. 
In our core business, which we define as people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes on intensive insulin therapy, we have several initiatives underway. In the U.S., we are nearing completion of our sales force expansion, which will enhance our footprint across the country, including our reach into primary care offices. We'll continue our push to prioritize the pharmacy channel, which is the most efficient channel for our patients, clinicians and DexCom. And we'll continue our efforts to drive greater access on the awareness of the benefits that DexCom offers, including the DTC campaigns that we've been driving in both the U.S. and international markets. 
Outside the U.S., we continue to advocate for greater access in several key markets and look forward to broadening our reach in places where we have had little presence to date. This includes our expansion in France, building from a positive recent reimbursement decision as well as the launch of G6 in Japan with Terumo as our distribution partner. 
For our third pillar, expanding the use of CGM in non-intensive type 2 diabetes, we are extending our efforts with level 2 and kicking off commercial pilots with multiple partners on the digital health side. Our work with other providers continues as well as we make the case for the clinical value of DexCom CGM in the broader type 2 population. 
Recently, Everside Health, one of the nation's largest providers of on-site health clinics, announced that their Healthstat unit will make DexCom CGM available to their members with type 2 diabetes. This is a nice extension of our previous work with Healthstat following up on our pilot efforts that utilize CGM in an on-site health screening program. We remain increasingly confident in the market opportunity ahead for DexCom. 
And on this basis, today, we announced the formation of DexCom Ventures. We have a chance to identify and accelerate the development of amazing technologies, technologies that can truly make an impact to global health outcomes via innovation. I could not be more excited to lead this effort. I believe we are well positioned to advance our strategies and build connections that will make DexCom stronger in the years ahead. Look for much more from us on this front over the next several years. And in the meantime, I couldn't be more pleased to pass the torch on our day-to-day strategy and corporate development efforts to Quentin and his team. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Kevin."

We were incredibly pleased by the public response, which drove 11x greater search volume compared to the average 2021 Super Bowl commercial, the highest of any brand that advertised this year. This is why we did the ad, to drive awareness and ultimately bring CGM to more and more people who stand to benefit from this technology. 
There may be more people talking about diabetes this week than any other time in recent memory, a conversation that includes health care providers, insurance providers and people with diabetes themselves. We welcome these conversations and look forward to advancing these discussions for greater access for all people with diabetes. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?"

If you think back to our original Analyst Day, we set an expectation to be at a 25% EBITD",617,"Sure. Thanks, Robbie. Look, I think the first thing I would mention is we've made incredible progress from a profitability perspective over the last couple of years. If you think back to our original Analyst Day, we set an expectation to be at a 25% EBITDA margin by the year 2023, and we delivered 26% EBITDA margin in the year 2020. So we've made incredible progress. And I would say progress even accelerated or went beyond what our original expectations were. But we've always known there are investments we've got to make in this business to open up some of these incredible market opportunities that sit in front of us. And I think more than anything, the fact that we're making these investments ought to be a testament to the fact that we now believe in, and we're seeing that these are going to be real opportunities for us. So we're excited about making that investment. 
On the gross margin side, there's a few things to point out this year that makes 2021 a little bit unique. One, we will continue to drive the normal efficiencies and leverage through the gross margin that we have in the last several years. And I would expect there's a couple of hundred basis points of efficiencies to continue to take out of it over the course of '21. But there's 2 headwinds that we have to navigate through. One continues to be the move to the pharmacy channel. We expect that we'll see a significant move over the course of this year. We've seen that pick up in terms of its momentum in the back part of last year. The other one is we're making significant investment in standing up our first international manufacturing capability in Malaysia. We broke ground there. We have teams there as we speak starting to build out that capability, which is going to take -- it is tens of millions of units of production capacity and turns it into hundreds of millions of units of production capacity for us, which we believe is going to be necessary as we open up these markets and begin to really see results from them. So that's what's going to play out on the gross margin side, that results in a couple of hundred basis points of headwind from the 67% back to 65%. 
On the OpEx side, I think it's important. G&A is going to continue to lever nicely for us. Where the investment is going is purely in the sales expense and into R&D, and there's really a few drivers that drive it. There's the doubling of the U.S. commercial field force that we've talked about. That's pretty much done as we sit here today. Those resources are going to be in place and able to start to contribute over the course of the year, but they obviously bring with it an expense load. We're also turning up the DTC efforts. We've never been better positioned from an inventory perspective to really turn the dials on DTC and sampling and giving our commercial team the tools they need to be as effective as possible. So we're excited to be able to do that. 
And then finally, I'll just remind you, over the course of this year, we've got all the G7 expenses that are going on. We got the trial expenses, we got the filing expenses, and then we got the commercial launch behind that as well. So all those, things together drive the incremental investment from an OpEx perspective. But that's all going to show up in R&D and selling expense, you will see leverage in G&A. So I hope that answers the question for you."

Great question. 10%, 10 points of headwind is the right way to think about it, primarily driven by that pharmacy channel mix shift that continues to move towards the direction that is important for us to be able to scale the business over the long term. I'd remind you, profit dollars are higher in that channel. But yes, there is some gross margin pressure that comes with it. But from a top line perspective, that's what's driving it is that pharmacy channel, call it, roughly 10 points. I do think you'll see that evolve a little bit over the course of the year. Keep in mind, in the first part of last year, we weren't into the pharmacy channel to the same degree that we were as we exited the year. So you've got a tougher comp in Q1 and Q2. And you see that in the growth rates as well. You're going to see tougher growth comps in the first half of '21 that will start to subside in the back half of the year. So I do think that you'll see that evolve a bit as we start to anniversary some of the pharmacy shift that we saw in the back part of '20 into the back part of '21. As we head into '22, look, we'll talk about that as we get out there around that time frame. But I do think there's a couple of years here of stepping through it. Once we're through it, I think you're going to see the unit volume growth of this business is going to be much more reflective of the overall dollar growth. Unit volume growth continues to be incredibly strong. We were up 40% in units in the fourth quarter by the time everything settled out. And our unit volume growth in '21 is right around that 25% to 30% growth, so very strong unit growth continue to drive the business."

The annual revenue profile per patient, we think, is going to vary based on condition and use case. We believe internally or at least what we discuss internally is for a type 2 non-intensive patient, for example, even if a full-time use, the revenue per year per patient is going to be a lower number because we're solving a different problem. We're not managing the lives and the health and safety of these patients, but we are making them healthier and we are giving a better experience than they have. And ultimately, we will take costs from the system. As far as what that number is going to be, I don't have a number completely. We have numerous models, and many of those depend upon the final use cases. I've also said numerous times, and I'll stick to this as well, I think the ultimate use case and the way we'll ultimately price it will be for full-time use for these patients. And if they choose to use it less often, that will be their choice. So on the health and wellness side, again, many, many more patients, a lower annual revenue number, but more interactions with more different people in a completely different distribution channel. 
With respect to the products, certainly, the core technology of sensing glucose, from our perspective, on the glucose side will remain the same. As those of you who listened to our Investor Day heard when I had my chat with Dr. Peter Atia, we talked about accuracy. And he said it's actually more important for his patients because if they only go between 70 and 120, 20 points off is a big deal. And they'd be making a wrong decision as far as their health and what they eat nutrition-wise, et cetera, within accuracy. So we know that fundamental core technology needs to remain accurate. Where we get into different products is the experience that we create, possibly even different wearables based on the category, different places to receive the data. Then as you look at the new ventures unit that Steve will be working in, then you look at software  experiences for patients, data platforms to get data to these platforms better, possibly other things we could sense or measure and add to glucose. So we believe these markets are going to require something different. At the end of the day, one size fits all is not going to work for us as we try and expand and hit the goals we've laid out probably being in the future. We're going to have numerous experiences for these patient groups."

Well, I think we're incredibly excited and bullish on the future opportunities, but at the same time, our approach has always been we want to see those start to pan out and contribute. And at that point, we'll start to reflect them into guidance. So as we open up some of these new markets and validate that we're able to generate the revenue from them, then hopefully, we've got some very positive updates for you guys over time. I don't think we could be more excited around where we're making these investments. We know for a fact, the type 2 intensive space, for example, is going to come on to CGM therapy. We're seeing it happen in our results right now. We're starting to see some of it with the non-intensive. As a matter of fact, if you look at our new patient figures, it's led by type 2 patients. So we're starting to see some of that be validated. But in order to reach those patients, for example, on the sales force side, we've got to be in the primary care physician offices. That's where those patients are seen and that's where our current commercial force does not really play. And so as we've added those resources, that is going to be their primary focus, their primary target. 
Similarly, on the DTC side, I'll continue to reiterate, there's not a better investment that we make inside the 4 walls of DexCom today than our DTC efforts. And the returns that we see with the new patients that come out of it, we're very confident that, that's the best investment we can possibly make. Now will that return on investment per individual per patient start to step down into the future? It may as they get harder to bring on. Basically, for the time being, we've been very encouraged by that return that we've seen, and we'll continue to pour resources in there until we see that change. So I don't think there's a better place for us to be focusing our efforts right now than to really be building out the commercial force to see the right individuals where the patients are at and to continue to create awareness for these patients as well."

And as you look at the progress we've made, I recently prepared a speech for the sales guys. We're up 10x where we were 5 years ago from $40-plus million to over $400 million for 2020. And by every indicator, one would say, wow, that is fabulous. And in our mind, as we look at it, the opportunity is bigger than what we've addressed. And we do need to build infrastructure, and we also need to look at doing things more creatively. I think, for example, the Japan partnership with Terumo, whereby we're really letting a partner take our business in that country that is a medical technology leader in that geography is going to be a great business model for us to watch and look at. 
In France, we get reimbursement for a group of patients. We will invest some there. But we have other international models we're looking at. We literally break down every country in a type of bucket. There's great reimbursement here. Here's how we need to attack this one. There's no reimbursement here, and we're making plans across all the geographies. 
Another key investment internationally is going to be our e-commerce platform. We've had great results every place we've launched it. So in geographies where we're not where we go, we'll probably go first with an e-commerce platform going forward. And so we're investing on all fronts there. The Malaysia factory is truly an investment in scale for us. It will -- it's going to be ultra modern, as is our Arizona manufacturing facility, don't get me wrong, but we've learned a tremendous amount in building out Arizona that we can apply to Malaysia and really put ourselves in a position to whereby we can go after these businesses. One of the things that we often discuss, as we sit and discuss the what have, should have, could haves, for a better part, 1.5 years, as far as capacity, we're selling everything we built. With the opportunity now, with the inventory we have and our ops team being able to build as much as they can, we think we can much more aggressively go after these international markets just on a commercial strategy basis as well, and we're going to going forward."

And that information is already available through the Acuvia data as far as insulin prescriptions in the various territories. And we use that -- those geographies and that data to determine how we structure the territories and where we put our people. The people in their territories will be responsible for all of the medical professionals within that group, and they will continue to do that. Trying to think, is there is another part to his question. Yes, and we structured it similar to how we've done in the past. We have regions and districts within the sales organization. We've increased the number of districts, the number of regions from 2 to 4. And so similar structure that way. And then we've worked out a comp plan that we think is very fair for everybody, and our guys are willing to live with. I think the most interesting piece for me in laying out the whole sales force expansion was how it was received by our team in the beginning. You're always wary of that when you start. Instead, the team raised our hands and said we need more help. We need more exposure here. This is a good thing. There are people we don't call on. So we look forward to it. And as far as time, it takes everybody time to get acclimated to a new position, a new territory. For those who have diabetes relationships, for example, if you hire somebody from an insulin company or insulin pump company, they can go back to offices they've already been to, and they're up and running quite quickly. For others, it takes more time. And that's why we have our district managers and our regional managers to help with those relationships and train those people. So there is a time. It varies based on the experience level of the rep before they start with us. Some hit the ground running and go faster than the one before. Others, it takes a little time. And we monitor that, we watch and go give those more training that need it. So it will be fun to watch unfold."

I'd remind you, the $4 billion to $4.5 billion revenue figure we put out there out in 2025 or so was more or less our base case. That's how we qualified that to you folks. And it started to open up a bit of the type 2 nonintensive opportunity, but there's a massive market that sits in front of us. And as we open that up in bigger ways, as you start to open up things like hospital or gestational or get further upstream into the diabetes condition and get into prediabetes, those volume numbers are incredible. And so I mentioned earlier, we're talking about going from tens of millions of units to hundreds of millions of units of capability over time, and we're beginning to make those investments as we speak. 
In terms of the CapEx investment, I think you're going to see roughly double this year, what we've seen in the last couple of years. We've seen about $200 million of CapEx in the last 2 years each year. I think that is going to be north of $400 million, probably as we stand up this building and build out the capability that will then service for years to come into the future. How quickly we're ramping that is really going to be predicated on how quickly we open up some of these markets. What we're not going to do, and we've been very clear about this after having learned from the experience ourselves when we launched G6, we're not going to put ourselves in a position again to where we don't have the inventory to deliver to the patient and create a DexCom experience that is one that we want them to have. And so we are investing ahead of that curve, but we're very confident that the curve is ultimately going to be realized. I think the question is just nailing down that timing and know exactly what that's going to look like. From our perspective, we're going to be ready when it's ready to go. We're not going to be behind it."

As I look at volumes and why hundreds of millions rather than tens. As we look at the use of CGM, for example, as a diagnostic for somebody who may have pre diabetes but may not be sure as part of the annual checkup, there's hundreds of millions of people in the U.S. who would need that checkup every year. As you look at 30 million people with type 2 diabetes in the U.S., I don't know if my 30 million is right, but it's close. If just 10% of those people went on sensors full time, you're looking at 60 million to 90 million sensors we'd be selling on an annual basis. These opportunities are going to require scale. And we've just made the decision going at this in a manner to whereby we do it gradually and hope we have enough when we get there. It's just not going to work. The opportunities are too big and the investment is required. That's why we've raised the money. That's why we've made the plans. That's why we've designed the product and set the relationships that we have. We need to go after this.

Their focus will initially be on insulin-using patients who have reimbursement for the technology. The non-insulin users will, in fact, tag along as they become aware, and there are situations where some of these patients who have coverage. On the type 2 nonintensive patient, we've been very clear from the beginning that we're going to go about that -- this market 4 different ways: through programs, payers, clinicians and then directly to patients. And over the course of 2021, you will see those 4 initiatives unfold as we gather more data and launch more initiatives. And so awareness will grow. As Quentin said earlier, and Steve, a very reasonable number of our leads from the Super Bowl ad have been type 2 non-intensive patients. Whether we can serve them or not with reimbursement today remains to be seen, but we certainly have a database of these names and people we can call on as soon as we have the product offering, we want to get in that space ready. So I think we're preparing and getting ready for that. More importantly, though, as we make these clinicians aware they can't look for cases where they can make it available to their patients. They can look at situations where somebody can appeal for coverage if they have type 2 diabetes and out of control, and those appeals have been successful. So we're looking forward to going there and -- but these guys will focus on our core markets and where we play with reimbursement, first and foremost."

Well, I think when you look at the overall investment in the areas you identified, the most significant increase is likely going to show up in doubling the size of that commercial field force. And then right behind it is DTC and sampling. Sampling is a bit new to us. We've never sampled historically. We just started to roll that out in the fourth quarter and very early in seeing what that looks like. But that's a pretty easy one for us to measure. We're not going to give you the specific results of what that looks like, although the fact that we're going to continue to double down on it should tell you that we're incredibly happy with what we're seeing. But that's as easy as knowing exactly where we're dropping the samples in the field and knowing exactly what patients are utilizing those samples, and ultimately, turn into a recurring purchase for us. So those are easy measures. And on the DTC side, with social media and the leads that get created from that, that ultimately turn into patients, that becomes relatively easy to measure as well. One of the things that I think was just really fascinating coming out of the Super Bowl ad is that we had 5x more impressions in the last 4 days than we had it for the entire year of 2020 on the heels of that. I think it's just remarkable, the type of reach that we're finding with our DTC efforts. So we're going to continue to monitor those things and measure those and hold ourselves accountable to them. And as long as the return is there, we're going to continue to invest aggressively there. If we see the returns start to drop down, then we'll start to think differently. But we're not going to give specific return measures, those sorts of things. But the fact that we're doubling down in these efforts, I think, ought to convey the confidence we have in these investments and what they're bringing to us."

This company has changed so much over those for calls, a marvelous effort and some incredible work, and he'll still be here, but he's going to have some different investors to please, and we're excited about that. 
I do want to thank everybody for being on the call today. As you can tell, we remain extremely bullish about our opportunities going forward. One of our executives was having a conversation with me here one day and he said, the way he described DexCom is just as soon as we climb one mountain, we get to the top of it. And on the other side, there's a bigger one, and we start another climb. And I think as Quentin detailed our financial plans and what we have going on, what we see is a great big mountain and a great big climb, and we're preparing to do that. We think we can do it very effectively. We are very bullish about the future. Over the past several days, a lot of the talk has been around the Super Bowl commercial here. And I have gotten numerous pictures, videos, e-mails, text messages from our patients and their parents or their caregivers saying thank you for creating awareness. Kids in school are telling everybody, remember that commercial, I wear that. And I have that, and this is how I manage my diabetes. We have seen such a positive reception to this and the positive energy has just been amazing. So kudos to our marketing team, to Nick Jonas and everybody for getting this done. Our hospital initiatives and the new initiatives we've talked about. As I said, there are investments, but now we're getting numerous physicians reaching out saying, you've got to get this everywhere. It needs to be all throughout the hospital. It needs to be worn by the patients when they go home. We can't have them coming back and monitoring glucose can be very important. We'll continue to go after those efforts. Our new market efforts are very strong. 
And last, I'll go to the intensive type 2s as well. As I said, we created some awareness here. I recently had a conversation. I've had several conversations with people with type 2 diabetes, absolutely struggling with what to do. What can I possibly do to take care of myself because they just don't know. And CGM tells them. It tells them what to do. It tells them about foods. It tells them about exercise. It tells them about stress and sleep and everything else. And we are really excited for this opportunity. You'll see us have a lot of good things come to pass in 2021 on all these fronts. But thanks, everybody, for continuing to listen. And great day, great year for DexCom and our team.

This translates to more",890,"Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let me start by summarizing some of the themes that DexCom accomplished in 2020. Total revenue grew 31% over 2019, driven by a record number of new patient additions. This translates to more than $415 million in absolute dollar growth, another high watermark for DexCom. We doubled G6 capacity in the first 6 months of the year. Our team has done a great job to meet the ambitious plans that we outlined nearly 2 years ago to scale G6 capacity, leaving the company in the best inventory position that we have been in since the launch of G6.  
The scale-up led to strong gross margin expansion in 2020, even as we increasingly shift our business to the pharmacy channel. We closed the full year 2020 with our highest gross margin since 2017. Our enhanced capacity puts us in position to aggressively pursue our growth initiatives. This includes the expansion of our sales force, which we announced in October and have nearly completed as well as our efforts around product sampling and direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S. and international markets.  
Many of you have seen our most recent effort to drive category awareness as we kicked off a new campaign around one of our DexCom warriors, Nick Jonas, including our ad during the Super Bowl. This bold effort should give you a sense for our belief about the market opportunity ahead of us. We've received great feedback from the campaign so far and look forward to joining forces with Nick and diabetes advocacy groups in the coming months to drive greater awareness of the benefits of CGM.  
At the height of the pandemic's first wave, we established a new effort in a matter of days to support hospitals needing to preserve personal protective equipment and utilize our remote monitoring technology. We've made significant progress in our work to bring DexCom CGM to people with type 2 diabetes, including both those on intensive insulin therapy and those who are not. We also announced several new initiatives in 2020 that we believe will position us to meet the kinds of patient growth that we expect over the next several years.  
Building on the success of our team in Manila, where we've strengthened our customer service metrics across the board, we announced a new global business services unit in Lithuania that will help serve our international operations. We also announced that we will be building our third manufacturing site and first international manufacturing site in Malaysia. This state-of-the-art facility will be key to scaling our G7 capacity and provide logistical advantages as we look to serve our growing international base.  
Speaking of G7, 2020 saw us initiate and complete the first G7 pivotal trial. We're very happy with these results and the feedback we've received from participants and clinicians involved in the trial has been outstanding. Our clinical work is continuing as we progress with the regulatory path in 2021 to support our goal to launch G7 in the second half of the year.  
In any given year, these are accomplishments that we would be proud of. But in 2020, our teams accomplished these goals during a global pandemic. I want to use this forum again to say how proud I am of the DexCom employees who have embraced our mission to empower people to take control of diabetes in a year of very unique challenges. It is a privilege to both lead and learn from such a talented team. And rest assured, our team is focused on the growth opportunity ahead of us as we're now well on our way in 2021.  
This is shaping up to be another exciting year for the company, featuring our continued momentum as we look to bring G6 to many potential customers yet to use CGM, the ongoing manufacturing scale-up and launch of G7 and investing in several other key initiatives related to the growth pillars that we outlined at our recent Investor Day. We believe there is still a huge growth opportunity ahead, and we are investing to ensure that the company is positioned to deliver CGM as a mass market technology for greater health outcomes.  
The pandemic has contributed to structural changes in the way health care is delivered. with DexCom CGM a valuable asset in the growing digital health and the remote monitoring health care ecosystems yet a majority of people with diabetes in the world continue to rely on fingerstick technology. It is because of these developing landscapes and our belief on what DexCom CGM offers that we are announcing the formation of DexCom Ventures today, which Steve Pacelli will lead.  
With this entrance into the venture capital space, we believe we will be able to accelerate development for innovative companies that share our commitment to empowering greater health outcomes for customers and their clinicians. This may include technologies with use cases that can be combined with our CGM system as well as independent technology platforms.  
To summarize, we are very proud of what we accomplished in 2020 and are moving forward with the same commitment to our users and the growth of DexCom well into the future. With that, I will turn it over to Quentin for a review of the fourth quarter financials and discussion of the 2021 outlook. Quen?"

As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website.  
We reported worldwide revenue of $568.9 million for the fourth quarter compared to $462.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, representing growth of 23%. Our team did a great job maintaining momentum with new patient additions in the fourth quarter and accelerating our shift of the business into the pharmacy channel.  
Even with the increasing COVID lockdowns as the quarter progressed, new patients for the fourth quarter were in line with our original expectations for the year, a new record and a great achievement for our team. U.S. revenue grew 20% over the fourth quarter of 2019, totaling $451 million. We were able to drive more volume into the pharmacy channel than we originally expected, closing the year approaching 50% of our total U.S. commercial volume. This means that we are making excellent progress to position the company for long-term growth in the U.S. and an efficient operating model for the company. And while there is channel mix causing lower revenue per patient in the pharmacy channel, the underlying strength of the business saw fourth quarter unit volumes grow significantly more than our revenue growth rate in the U.S.  
Our international business reached a new high-water mark of $117 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, growing 35% over the fourth quarter of 2019. This growth includes strong performance in both our direct and distributor markets. We began an international DTC campaign in several of our markets in the fourth quarter and will continue to drive awareness of the benefits of our technology, knowing that CGM market penetration internationally remains even less than in the U.S.  
Our fourth quarter gross profit was $399.1 million or 70.2% of revenue compared to 66.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 70.2% of revenue represents our highest gross margin quarter in the past 5 years. This is another demonstration of the ability of our team to navigate our strategic shift to the pharmacy channel while delivering strong profitability across the organization.  
As Kevin noted, our successful scale-up of G6 has been a key driver of this margin expansion while also placing us in our strongest inventory position to date, allowing us to more aggressively target new users as we continue in 2021.  
Operating expenses were $294.7 million for Q4 2020 compared to $205.7 million in Q4 2019. The  year-over-year expense growth in the fourth quarter consists of several key areas of strategic investment, which includes roughly $15 million of nonrecurring spend related to enhancing our software development efforts and automation of our production capabilities. We also increased spending related to our DTC programs, product sampling and the expansion of our U.S. sales force. Even with significant investments throughout 2020 to prepare DexCom for future growth and efficiency, total operating expense growth for the year totaled 26%, well below our 31% revenue growth for the year.  
Operating income was $104.4 million or 18.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $103.6 million or 22.4% of revenue in the same quarter of 2019. For the year, we delivered more than 500 basis points of operating margin expansion, with full year 2020 operating margin of 16.6%, exceeding our most recent guidance. Adjusted EBITDA was $159.2 million or 28% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $141.7 million or 30.6% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019. Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.3% also exceeded our most recent guidance and came in more than 300 basis points better than our original 2020 guidance.  
As our margin progress shows, the significant steps that we have taken over the past few years are having a great impact on our ability to translate revenue growth into profitability. We are confident that the trend will continue over the long term as we move towards the 5-year targets that we laid out for you at our recent Investor Day by simultaneously taking opportunities that arise to invest in the growth ahead of us.  
Net income for the fourth quarter was $90.4 million or $0.91 per share. We significantly increased operating cash flow in 2020 and remain in a strong cash position with greater than $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as we exit the year. This gives us the flexibility to pursue the strategic investments that we believe will allow us to maintain a leadership position in our field. These include some of the investments we discussed related to our fourth quarter activities.  
Turning to 2021 guidance. As we stated early last month, we anticipate full year revenues of $2.21 billion to $2.31 billion, representing growth of 15% to 20%. We expect new patient growth to continue to exceed our revenue growth rate again in 2021, with our team extending their efforts to drive U.S. commercial business into our preferred pharmacy channel. We've also contemplated potential benefits from our efforts to drive category awareness through our expanded sales force, DTC advertising, product sampling and integrated systems as well as general considerations around the competitive environment.  
Turning to margins. We have several considerations in 2021 as we position the business for efficient growth and long-term margin expansion, in line with what we outlined at our recent Investor Day. For 2021, we anticipate gross margins of approximately 65%, in line with our long-term expectations. This anticipates a slight shift from our 67% full year 2020 results, which we expect to be driven by the success of our pharmacy channel initiative as well as our 2021 investments in infrastructure related to our G7 scale up and OUS manufacturing facility in Malaysia.  
We expect operating margins of approximately 13%, reflecting our gross margin outlook as well as various investments we've contemplated in 2021. As you know, DexCom has advanced its profitability profile at a much faster pace than originally anticipated over the past few years, while at the same time, building the infrastructure to scale the business profitably.  
With the diabetes market still underpenetrated, we're going on the offense with these investments. We are continuing to invest in the growth of the business via DTC, sampling, new markets and the launch of new products that we mentioned at our Investor Day, including G7. We are also making a significant investment in the global sales force, including doubling the size of our U.S.-based commercial field team. We will also continue to work on advanced research and development, which is looking into future generations of products and sensing capability. We're making these investments to accelerate our ability to bring CGM to those in need. Additionally, we believe these investments will support the long-term profitability objectives that we set at Investor Day, while at the same time, yielding significant returns for our shareholders.  
However, in the near term, we want to be prudent about incurring these upfront costs in our guidance and let the benefits play out. We expect that adjusted EBITDA margins will be approximately 23% for 2021.   
Finally, with the release of the valuation allowance on income taxes in 2020, in 2021, we will start to have a tax rate that is applicable to earnings. We expect that rate, absent any changes in tax law, to be in the low to mid-20% range. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update."

As Kevin mentioned, our team did a great job executing on our strategic priorities throughout 2020. We quickly adapted the changes brought about by COVID and ensured not only that our existing patients could rely on their DexCom supplies, but that thousands of new patients could benefit from the use of G6. In fact, we closed the year with greater than 900,000 customers globally, up more than 38% over the end of 2019.  
We are excited by this growth, knowing the life-changing impact at CGM and the software tools that we provide with it can have on our patients. Just last month, we published 3 peer review studies in diabetes technology and therapeutics that showed a greater than 1 point A1c reduction for customers new to DexCom CGM in as little as 3 months. This study includes both type 1 and type 2 intensive insulin users, and the result validated the kind of outcomes we have seen before. But we took it one step further.  
We also saw a significant quality of life improvement for these patients as measured in terms of anxiety, emotional distress and burden of disease management, results that affirm our corporate mission to empower our users. We also demonstrated that the software tools we are building around our sensors are driving improved outcomes.  
Across our base, we see increased time in range for our users of real-time share and follow apps. We see increased time and range for users who engage with our Clarity software, and we see increased time and range for users who take advantage of our integration with Apple's Siri Virtual Assistant. In 2021, we will continue to work aggressively to expand our customer base so that more and more people can experience these improved outcomes with DexCom.  
As we outlined in our recent Investor Day and at a conference presentation last month, we prioritized 3 pillars of growth in the near term and look forward to progress on all 3 fronts in 2021 while we also lay the foundation for longer-term market expansion.  
In our core business, which we define as people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes on intensive insulin therapy, we have several initiatives underway. In the U.S., we are nearing completion of our sales force expansion, which will enhance our footprint across the country, including our reach into primary care offices. We'll continue our push to prioritize the pharmacy channel, which is the most efficient channel for our patients, clinicians and DexCom. And we'll continue our efforts to drive greater access on the awareness of the benefits that DexCom offers, including the DTC campaigns that we've been driving in both the U.S. and international markets.  
Outside the U.S., we continue to advocate for greater access in several key markets and look forward to broadening our reach in places where we have had little presence to date. This includes our expansion in France, building from a positive recent reimbursement decision as well as the launch of G6 in Japan with Terumo as our distribution partner.  
For our third pillar, expanding the use of CGM in non-intensive type 2 diabetes, we are extending our efforts with level 2 and kicking off commercial pilots with multiple partners on the digital health side. Our work with other providers continues as well as we make the case for the clinical value of DexCom CGM in the broader type 2 population.  
Recently, Everside Health, one of the nation's largest providers of on-site health clinics, announced that their health debt unit will make DexCom CGM available to their members with type 2 diabetes. This is a nice extension of our previous work with Healthstats following up on our pilot efforts that utilize CGM in an on-site health screening program. We remain increasingly confident in the market opportunity ahead for DexCom.  
And on this basis, today, we announced the formation of DexCom Ventures. We have a chance to identify and accelerate the development of amazing technologies, technologies that can truly make an impact to global health outcomes via innovation. I could not be more excited to lead this effort. I believe we are well positioned to advance our strategies and build connections that will make DexCom stronger in the years ahead. Look for much more from us on this front over the next several years. And in the meantime, I couldn't be more pleased to pass the torch on our day-to-day strategy and corporate development efforts to Quentin and his team.  
With that, I'll turn it back to Kevin."

We're proud of what we accomplished in 2020, and we are pressing forward with excitement for the year ahead in 2021. Much of the discussion this week is centered around our recent Super Bowl ad. We were incredibly pleased by the public response, which drove 11x greater search volume compared to the average 2021 Super Bowl commercial, the highest of any brand that advertised this year. This is why we did the ad, to drive awareness and ultimately bring CGM to more and more people who stand to benefit from this technology.  
There may be more people talking about diabetes this week than any other time in recent memory, a conversation that includes health care providers, insurance providers and people with diabetes themselves. We welcome these conversations and look forward to advancing these discussions for greater access for all people with diabetes. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?"

If you think back to our original Analyst Day, we set an expectation to be at a 25% EBITD",617,"Sure. Thanks, Robbie. Look, I think the first thing I would mention is we've made incredible progress from a profitability perspective over the last couple of years. If you think back to our original Analyst Day, we set an expectation to be at a 25% EBITDA margin by the year 2023, and we delivered 26% EBITDA margin in the year 2020. So we've made incredible progress. And I would say progress even accelerated or went beyond what our original expectations were. But we've always known there are investments we've got to make in this business to open up some of these incredible market opportunities that sit in front of us. And I think more than anything, the fact that we're making these investments ought to be a testament to the fact that we now believe in, and we're seeing that these are going to be real opportunities for us. So we're excited about making that investment.  
On the gross margin side, there's a few things to point out this year that makes 2021 a little bit unique. One, we will continue to drive the normal efficiencies and leverage through the gross margin that we have in the last several years. And I would expect there's a couple of hundred basis points of efficiencies to continue to take out of it over the course of '21. But there's 2 headwinds that we have to navigate through. One continues to be the move to the pharmacy channel. We expect that we'll see a significant move over the course of this year. We've seen that pick up in terms of its momentum in the back part of last year. The other one is we're making significant investment in standing up our first international manufacturing capability in Malaysia. We broke ground there. We have teams there as we speak starting to build out that capability, which is going to take -- it is tens of millions of units of production capacity and turns it into hundreds of millions of units of production capacity for us, which we believe is going to be necessary as we open up these markets and begin to really see results from them. So that's what's going to play out on the gross margin side that results in a couple of hundred basis points of headwind from the 67% back to 65%.  
On the OpEx side, I think it's important. G&A is going to continue to lever nicely for us. Where the investment is going is purely in the sales expense and into R&D, and there's really a few drivers that drive it. There's the doubling of the U.S. commercial field force that we've talked about. That's pretty much done as we sit here today. Those resources are going to be in place and able to start to contribute over the course of the year, but they obviously bring with it an expense load. We're also turning up the DTC efforts. We've never been better positioned from an inventory perspective to really turn the dials on DTC and sampling and giving our commercial team the tools they need to be as effective as possible. So we're excited to be able to do that.  
And then finally, I'll just remind you, over the course of this year, we've got all the G7 expenses that are going on. We got the trial expenses, we got the filing expenses, and then we got the commercial launch behind that as well. So all those things together drive the incremental investment from an OpEx perspective. But that's all going to show up in R&D and selling expense. You will see leverage in G&A. So I hope that answers the question for you."

Great question. 10%, 10 points of headwind is the right way to think about it, primarily driven by that pharmacy channel mix shift that continues to move towards the direction that is important for us to be able to scale the business over the long term. I'd remind you, profit dollars are higher in that channel. But yes, there is some gross margin pressure that comes with it. But from a top line perspective, that's what's driving it is that pharmacy channel, call it, roughly 10 points. I do think you'll see that evolve a little bit over the course of the year. Keep in mind, in the first part of last year, we weren't into the pharmacy channel to the same degree that we were as we exited the year. So you've got a tougher comp in Q1 and Q2. And you see that in the growth rates as well. You're going to see tougher growth comps in the first half of '21 that will start to subside in the back half of the year. So I do think that you'll see that evolve a bit as we start to anniversary some of the pharmacy shift that we saw in the back part of '20 into the back part of '21. As we head into '22, look, we'll talk about that as we get out there around that time frame. But I do think there's a couple of years here of stepping through it. Once we're through it, I think you're going to see the unit volume growth of this business is going to be much more reflective of the overall dollar growth. Unit volume growth continues to be incredibly strong. We were up 40% in units in the fourth quarter by the time everything settled out. And our unit volume growth in '21 is right around that 25% to 30% growth. So very strong unit growth continue to drive the business."

We believe internally, or at least what we discuss internally, is for a type 2 non-intensive patient. For example,",445,"Margaret, this is Kevin. I'll take that. The annual revenue profile per patient, we think, is going to vary based on condition and use case. We believe internally, or at least what we discuss internally, is for a type 2 non-intensive patient. For example, even if a full-time use, the revenue per year per patient is going to be a lower number because we're solving a different problem. We're not managing the lives and the health and safety of these patients, but we are making them healthier and we are giving a better experience than they have. And ultimately, we will take costs from the system. As far as what that number is going to be, I don't have a number completely. We have numerous models, and many of those depend upon the final use cases. I've also said numerous times, and I'll stick to this as well, I think the ultimate use case and the way we'll ultimately price it will be for full-time use for these patients. And if they choose to use it less often, that will be their choice. So on the health and wellness side, again, many, many more patients, a lower annual revenue number, but more interactions with more different people in a completely different distribution channel.  
With respect to the products, certainly, the core technology of sensing glucose, from our perspective, on the glucose side will remain the same. As those of you who listened to our Investor Day heard when I had my chat with Dr. Peter Atia, we talked about accuracy. And he said it's actually more important for his patients because if they only go between 70 and 120, 20 points off is a big deal. And they'd be making a wrong decision as far as their health and what they eat nutrition-wise, et cetera, within accuracy. So we know that fundamental core technology needs to remain accurate. Where we get into different products is the experience that we create, possibly even different wearables based on the category, different places to receive the data. Then as you look at the new ventures unit that Steve will be working in, then you look at software experiences for patients, data platforms to get data to these platforms better, possibly other things we could sense or measure and add to glucose. So we believe these markets are going to require something different. At the end of the day, one size fits all is not going to work for us as we try and expand and hit the goals we've laid out probably [ being ] in the future. We're going to have numerous experiences for these patient groups."

But at the same time, our approach has always been we want to see those start to pan out and contribute. And at that point, we'll start to reflect them into guidance. So as we open up some of these new markets and validate that we're able to generate the revenue from them, then hopefully, we've got some very positive updates for you guys over time. I don't think we could be more excited around where we're making these investments. We know for a fact the type 2 intensive space, for example, is going to come on to CGM therapy. We're seeing it happen in our results right now. We're starting to see some of it with the nonintensive. As a matter of fact, if you look at our new patient figures, it's led by type 2 patients. So we're starting to see some of that be validated. But in order to reach those patients, for example, on the sales force side, we've got to be in the primary care physician offices. That's where those patients are seen and that's where our current commercial force does not really play. And so as we've added those resources, that is going to be their primary focus, their primary target.  
Similarly, on the DTC side. I'll continue to reiterate, there's not a better investment that we make inside the 4 walls of DexCom today than our DTC efforts. And the returns that we see with the new patients that come out of it, we're very confident that that's the best investment we can possibly make. Now will that return on investment per individual or per patient start to step down into the future? It may as they get harder to bring on. Basically, for the time being, we've been very encouraged by that return that we've seen, and we'll continue to pour resources in there until we see that change. So I don't think there's a better place for us to be focusing our efforts right now than to really be building out the commercial force to see the right individuals where the patients are at and to continue to create awareness for these patients as well."

And as you look at the progress we've made, I recently prepared a speech for the sales guys. We're up 10x where we were 5 years ago from $40-plus million to over $400 million for 2020. And by every indicator, one would say, wow, that is fabulous. And in our mind, as we look at it, the opportunity is bigger than what we've addressed. And we do need to build infrastructure, and we also need to look at doing things more creatively. I think, for example, the Japan partnership with Terumo, whereby we're really letting a partner take our business in that country that is a medical technology leader in that geography is going to be a great business model for us to watch and look at.  
In France, we get reimbursement for a group of patients. We will invest some there. But we have other international models we're looking at. We literally break down every country in a type of bucket. There's great reimbursement here. Here's how we need to attack this one. There's no reimbursement here, and we're making plans across all the geographies. Another key investment internationally is going to be our e-commerce platform. We've had great results every place we've launched it, so in geographies where we're not. Where we go, we'll probably go first with an e-commerce platform going forward. And so we're investing on all fronts there. The Malaysia factory is truly an investment in scale for us. It will -- it's going to be ultra modern, as is our Arizona manufacturing facility, don't get me wrong. But we've learned a tremendous amount in building out Arizona that we can apply to Malaysia and really put ourselves in a position to whereby we can go after these businesses. One of the things that we often discuss, as we sit and discuss the what have, should have, could haves, and for a better part, 1.5 years, as far as capacity, we were selling everything we built. With the opportunity now, with the inventory we have and our ops team being able to build as much as they can, we think we can much more aggressively go after these international markets just on a commercial strategy basis as well, and we're going to going forward."

And it's a large percent of their income, and it's hard. It's just hard. We empathize with those people. We've done our best with our pharmacy ship, for example. And when we gave some of these statistics at Investor Day, I think somewhere above 30% of our pharmacy patients have zero co-pay. And another group of them have less than $60 a month on their co-pay.

And that information is already available through the IQVIA data as far as insulin prescriptions in the various territories. And we use that -- those geographies and that data to determine how we structure the territories and where we put our people. The people in their territories will be responsible for all of the medical professionals within that group, and they will continue to do that. I'm trying to think, is there -- if there is another part to his question. Yes, and we structured it similar to how we've done it in the past. We have regions and districts within the sales organization. We've increased the number of districts, the number of regions from 2 to 4. And so similar structure that way. And then we've worked out a comp plan that we think is very fair for everybody, and our guys are willing to live with. I think the most interesting piece for me in laying out the whole sales force expansion was how it was received by our team in the beginning. You're always wary of that when you start. Instead, the team raised our hands and said, we need more help. We need more exposure here. This is a good thing. There are people we don't call on. So we look forward to it. And as far as time, it takes everybody time to get acclimated to a new position, a new territory. For those who have diabetes relationships, for example, if you hire somebody from an insulin company or an insulin pump company, they can go back to offices they've already been to, and they're up and running quite quickly. For others, it takes more time. And that's why we have our district managers and our regional managers to help with those relationships and train those people. So there is a time. It varies based on the experience level of the rep before they start with us. Some hit the ground running and go faster than the one before. Others, it takes a little time. And we monitor that and we watch and go give those more training that need it. So it will be fun to watch unfold."

I'd remind you, the $4 billion to $4.5 billion revenue figure we put out there out in 2025 or so was more or less our base case. That's how we qualified that to you folks. And it started to open up a bit of the type 2 nonintensive opportunity, but there's a massive market that sits in front of us. And as we open that up in bigger ways, as you start to open up things like hospital or gestational or get further upstream into the diabetes condition and get into prediabetes, those volume numbers are incredible. And so I mentioned earlier, we're talking about going from tens of millions of units to hundreds of millions of units of capability over time, and we're beginning to make those investments as we speak. 
In terms of the CapEx investment, I think you're going to see roughly double this year what we've seen in the last couple of years. We've seen about $200 million of CapEx in the last 2 years each year. I think that is going to be north of $400 million, probably as we stand up this building and build out the capability that will then service for years to come into the future. How quickly we're ramping that is really going to be predicated on how quickly we open up some of these markets. What we're not going to do, and we've been very clear about this after having learned from the experience ourselves when we launched G6, we're not going to put ourselves in a position again to where we don't have the inventory to deliver to the patient and create a DexCom experience that is one that we want them to have. And so we are investing ahead of that curve, but we're very confident that the curve is ultimately going to be realized. I think the question is just nailing down that timing and know exactly what that's going to look like. From our perspective, we're going to be ready when it's ready to go. We're not going to be behind it, so..."

As I look at volumes and why hundreds of millions rather than tens. As we look at the use of CGM, for example, as a diagnostic for somebody who may have prediabetes but may not be sure as part of the annual checkup, there's hundreds of millions of people in the U.S. who would need that checkup every year. As you look at 30 million people with type 2 diabetes in the U.S., I don't know if my 30 million is right, but it's close. If just 10% of those people went on sensors full time, you're looking at 60 million to 90 million sensors we'd be selling on an annual basis. These opportunities are going to require scale. And we've just made the decision going at this in a manner to whereby we do it gradually and hope we have enough when we get there. It's just not going to work. The opportunities are too big and the investment is required. That's why we've raised the money. That's why we've made the plans. That's why we've designed the product and set the relationships that we have. We need to go after this.

On the type 2 nonintensive patient, we've been very clear from the beginning that we're going to go about that -- this market 4 different ways: through programs, payers, clinicians, and then directly to patients. And over the course of 2021, you will see those 4 initiatives unfold as we gather more data and launch more initiatives. And so awareness will grow. As Quentin said earlier, and Steve, a very reasonable number of our leads from the Super Bowl ad have been type 2 non-intensive patients. Whether we can serve them or not with reimbursement today remains to be seen, but we certainly have a database of these names on people we can call on. As soon as we have the product offering, we want to get in that space ready. So I think we're preparing and getting ready for that. More importantly, though, as we make these clinicians aware, they can look for cases where they can make it available to their patients. They can look at situations where somebody can appeal for coverage if they have type 2 diabetes and out of control, and those appeals have been successful. So we're looking forward to going there and -- but these guys will focus on our core markets and where we play with reimbursement, first and foremost."

Well, I think when you look at the overall investment in the areas you identified, the most significant increase is likely going to show up in doubling the size of that commercial field force. And then right behind it is DTC and sampling. Sampling is a bit new to us. We've never sampled historically. We just started to roll that out in the fourth quarter and very early in seeing what that looks like. But that's a pretty easy one for us to measure. We're not going to give you the specific results of what that looks like. Although the fact that we're going to continue to double down on it should tell you that we're incredibly happy with what we're seeing. But that's as easy as knowing exactly where we're dropping the samples in the field and knowing exactly what patients are utilizing those samples, and ultimately, turn into a recurring purchase for us. So those are easy measures. And on the DTC side, with social media and the leads that get created from that, that ultimately turn into patients, that becomes relatively easy to measure as well. One of the things that I think was just really fascinating coming out of the Super Bowl ad is that we had 5x more impressions in the last 4 days than we had it for the entire year of 2020 on the heels of that. I think it's just remarkable the type of reach that we're finding with our DTC efforts. So we're going to continue to monitor those things and measure those and hold ourselves accountable to them. And as long as the return is there, we're going to continue to invest aggressively there. If we see the returns start to drop down, then we'll start to think differently. But we're not going to give specific return measures, those sorts of things. But the fact that we're doubling down in these efforts, I think, ought to convey the confidence we have in these investments and what they're bringing to us."

This company has changed so much over those 40 calls. A marvelous effort and some incredible work, and he'll still be here, but he's going to have some different investors to please, and we're excited about that. 
I do want to thank everybody for being on the call today. As you can tell, we remain extremely bullish about our opportunities going forward. One of our executives was having a conversation with me here one day and he said, the way he described DexCom is just as soon as we climb one mountain, we get to the top of it. And on the other side, there's a bigger one, and we start another climb. And I think as Quentin detailed our financial plans and what we have going on, what we see is a great big mountain and a great big climb. And we're preparing to do that. We think we can do it very effectively. We are very bullish about the future. Over the past several days, a lot of the talk has been around the Super Bowl commercial here. And I have gotten numerous pictures, videos, e-mails, text messages from our patients and their parents or their caregivers saying thank you for creating awareness. Kids in school are telling everybody, remember that commercial, I wear that. And I have that, and this is how I manage my diabetes. We have seen such a positive reception to this, and the positive energy has just been amazing. So kudos to our marketing team, to Nick Jonas and everybody for getting this done. Our hospital initiatives and the new initiatives we've talked about. As I said, there are investments, but now we're getting numerous physicians reaching out saying, you've got to get this everywhere. It needs to be all throughout the hospital. It needs to be worn by the patients when they go home. We can't have them coming back, and monitoring glucose can be very important. We'll continue to go after those efforts. Our new market efforts are very strong. 
And last, I'll go to the intensive type 2s as well. As I said, we created some awareness here. I recently had a conversation. I've had several conversations with people with type 2 diabetes absolutely struggling with what to do. What can I possibly do to take care of myself because they just don't know. And CGM tells them. It tells them what to do. It tells them about foods. It tells them about exercise. It tells them about stress and sleep and everything else. And we are really excited for this opportunity. You'll see us have a lot of good things come to pass in 2021 on all these fronts. But thanks, everybody, for continuing to listen. And great day, great year for DexCom and our team.

Let me start by summarizing some of the things that DexCom accomplished in 2020. Total revenue grew 31% over 2019, driven by a record number of new patient additions. This translates to more",890,"Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let me start by summarizing some of the things that DexCom accomplished in 2020. Total revenue grew 31% over 2019, driven by a record number of new patient additions. This translates to more than $415 million in absolute dollar growth, another high-water mark for DexCom. We doubled G6 capacity in the first 6 months of the year. Our team has done a great job to meet the ambitious plans that we outlined nearly 2 years ago to scale G6 capacity, leaving the company in the best inventory position that we have been in since the launch of G6.  
The scale-up led to strong gross margin expansion in 2020, even as we increasingly shift our business to the pharmacy channel. We closed the full year 2020 with our highest gross margin since 2017. Our enhanced capacity puts us in position to aggressively pursue our growth initiatives. This includes the expansion of our sales force, which we announced in October and have nearly completed, as well as our efforts around product sampling and direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S. and international markets.  
Many of you have seen our most recent effort to drive category awareness as we kicked off a new campaign around one of our DexCom warriors, Nick Jonas, including our ad during the Super Bowl. This bold effort should give you a sense for our belief about the market opportunity ahead of us. We've received great feedback from the campaign so far and look forward to joining forces with Nick and diabetes advocacy groups in the coming months to drive greater awareness of the benefits of CGM.  
At the height of the pandemic's first wave, we established a new effort in a matter of days to support hospitals needing to preserve personal protective equipment and utilize our remote monitoring technology. We've made significant progress in our work to bring DexCom CGM to people with type 2 diabetes, including both those on intensive insulin therapy and those who are not. We also announced several new initiatives in 2020 that we believe will position us to meet the kinds of patient growth that we expect over the next several years.  
Building on the success of our team in Manila, where we've strengthened our customer service metrics across the board, we announced a new global business services unit in Lithuania that will help serve our international operations. We also announced that we will be building our third manufacturing site and first international manufacturing site in Malaysia. This state-of-the-art facility will be key to scaling our G7 capacity and provide logistical advantages as we look to serve our growing international base.  
Speaking of G7, 2020 saw us initiate and complete the first G7 pivotal trial. We're very happy with these results and the feedback we've received from participants and clinicians involved in the trial has been outstanding. Our clinical work is continuing as we progress with the regulatory path in 2021 to support our goal to launch G7 in the second half of the year.  
In any given year, these are accomplishments that we would be proud of. But in 2020, our teams accomplished these goals during a global pandemic. I want to use this forum again to say how proud I am of the DexCom employees who have embraced our mission to empower people to take control of diabetes in a year of very unique challenges. It is a privilege to both lead and learn from such a talented team. And rest assured, our team is focused on the growth opportunity ahead of us as we're now well on our way in 2021.  
This is shaping up to be another exciting year for the company, featuring our continued momentum as we look to bring G6 to many potential customers yet to use CGM, the ongoing manufacturing scale-up and launch of G7 and investing in several other key initiatives related to the growth pillars that we outlined at our recent Investor Day. We believe there is still a huge growth opportunity ahead, and we are investing to ensure that the company is positioned to deliver CGM as a mass market technology for greater health outcomes.  
The pandemic has contributed to structural changes in the way health care is delivered, with DexCom CGM a valuable asset in the growing digital health and the remote monitoring health care ecosystems. Yet a majority of people with diabetes in the world continue to rely on fingerstick technology. It is because of these developing landscapes and our belief in what DexCom CGM offers that we are announcing the formation of DexCom Ventures today, which Steve Pacelli will lead.  
With this entrance into the venture capital space, we believe we will be able to accelerate development for innovative companies that share our commitment to empowering greater health outcomes for customers and their clinicians. This may include technologies with use cases that can be combined with our CGM system as well as independent technology platforms.  
To summarize, we are very proud of what we accomplished in 2020 and are moving forward with the same commitment to our users and the growth of DexCom well into the future. With that, I will turn it over to Quentin for a review of the fourth quarter financials and discussion of the 2021 outlook. Quentin?"

As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis.

As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website.  
We reported worldwide revenue of $568.9 million for the fourth quarter compared to $462.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, representing growth of 23%. Our team did a great job maintaining momentum with new patient additions in the fourth quarter and accelerating our shift of the business into the pharmacy channel.  
Even with the increasing COVID lockdowns as the quarter progressed, new patients for the fourth quarter were in line with our original expectations for the year, a new record and a great achievement for our team. U.S. revenue grew 20% over the fourth quarter of 2019, totaling $451 million. We were able to drive more volume into the pharmacy channel than we originally expected, closing the year approaching 50% of our total U.S. commercial volume. This means that we are making excellent progress to position the company for long-term growth in the U.S. and an efficient operating model for the company. And while there is channel mix causing lower revenue per patient in the pharmacy channel, the underlying strength of the business saw fourth quarter unit volumes grow significantly more than our revenue growth rate in the U.S.  
Our international business reached a new high-water mark of $117 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, growing 35% over the fourth quarter of 2019. This growth includes strong performance in both our direct and distributor markets. We began an international DTC campaign in several of our markets in the fourth quarter and will continue to drive awareness of the benefits of our technology, knowing that CGM market penetration internationally remains even less than in the U.S.  
Our fourth quarter gross profit was $399.1 million or 70.2% of revenue compared to 66.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019. The 70.2% of revenue represents our highest gross margin quarter in the past 5 years. This is another demonstration of the ability of our team to navigate our strategic shift to the pharmacy channel while delivering strong profitability across the organization.  
As Kevin noted, our successful scale-up of G6 has been a key driver of this margin expansion while also placing us in our strongest inventory position to date, allowing us to more aggressively target new users as we continue in 2021.  
Operating expenses were $294.7 million for Q4 2020 compared to $205.7 million in Q4 2019. The  year-over-year expense growth in the fourth quarter consists of several key areas of strategic investment, which includes roughly $15 million of nonrecurring spend related to enhancing our software development efforts and automation of our production capabilities. We also increased spending related to our DTC programs, product sampling and the expansion of our U.S. sales force. Even with significant investments throughout 2020 to prepare DexCom for future growth and efficiency, total operating expense growth for the year totaled 26%, well below our 31% revenue growth for the year.  
Operating income was $104.4 million or 18.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $103.6 million or 22.4% of revenue in the same quarter of 2019. For the year, we delivered more than 500 basis points of operating margin expansion, with full year 2020 operating margin of 16.6%, exceeding our most recent guidance. Adjusted EBITDA was $159.2 million or 28% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $141.7 million or 30.6% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019. Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.3% also exceeded our most recent guidance and came in more than 300 basis points better than our original 2020 guidance.  
As our margin progress shows, the significant steps that we have taken over the past few years are having a great impact on our ability to translate revenue growth into profitability. We are confident that the trend will continue over the long term as we move towards the 5-year targets that we laid out for you at our recent Investor Day by simultaneously taking opportunities that arise to invest in the growth ahead of us.  
Net income for the fourth quarter was $90.4 million or $0.91 per share. We significantly increased operating cash flow in 2020 and remain in a strong cash position with greater than $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as we exit the year. This gives us the flexibility to pursue the strategic investments that we believe will allow us to maintain a leadership position in our field. These include some of the investments we discussed related to our fourth quarter activities.  
Turning to 2021 guidance. As we stated early last month, we anticipate full year revenues of $2.21 billion to $2.31 billion, representing growth of 15% to 20%. We expect new patient growth to continue to exceed our revenue growth rate again in 2021, with our team extending their efforts to drive U.S. commercial business into our preferred pharmacy channel. We've also contemplated potential benefits from our efforts to drive category awareness through our expanded sales force, DTC advertising, product sampling and integrated systems as well as general considerations around the competitive environment.  
Turning to margins. We have several considerations in 2021 as we position the business for efficient growth and long-term margin expansion, in line with what we outlined at our recent Investor Day. For 2021, we anticipate gross margins of approximately 65%, in line with our long-term expectations. This anticipates a slight shift from our 67% full year 2020 results, which we expect to be driven by the success of our pharmacy channel initiative as well as our 2021 investments in infrastructure related to our G7 scale up and OUS manufacturing facility in Malaysia.  
We expect operating margins of approximately 13%, reflecting our gross margin outlook as well as various investments we've contemplated in 2021. As you know, DexCom has advanced its profitability profile at a much faster pace than originally anticipated over the past few years while at the same time building the infrastructure to scale the business profitably.  
With the diabetes market still underpenetrated, we're going on the offense with these investments. We are continuing to invest in the growth of the business via DTC, sampling, new markets and the launch of new products that we mentioned at our Investor Day, including G7. We are also making a significant investment in the global sales force, including doubling the size of our U.S.-based commercial field team. We will also continue to work on advanced research and development, which is looking into future generations of products and sensing capability. We're making these investments to accelerate our ability to bring CGM to those in need. Additionally, we believe these investments will support the long-term profitability objectives that we set at Investor Day, while at the same time yielding significant returns for our shareholders.  
However, in the near term, we want to be prudent about incurring these upfront costs in our guidance and let the benefits play out. We expect that adjusted EBITDA margins will be approximately 23% for 2021.   
Finally, with the release of the valuation allowance on income taxes in 2020, in 2021 we will start to have a tax rate that is applicable to earnings. We expect that rate, absent any changes in tax law, to be in the low to mid-20% range. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update."

As Kevin mentioned, our team did a great job executing on our strategic priorities throughout 2020. We quickly adapted to changes brought about by COVID and ensured not only that our existing patients could rely on their DexCom supplies, but that thousands of new patients could benefit from the use of G6. In fact, we closed the year with greater than 900,000 customers globally, up more than 38% over the end of 2019.  
We are excited by this growth, knowing the life-changing impact that CGM and the software tools that we provide with it can have on our patients. Just last month, we published 3 peer review studies in diabetes technology and therapeutics that showed a greater than 1 point A1c reduction for customers new to DexCom CGM in as little as 3 months. This study includes both type 1 and type 2 intensive insulin users, and the result validated the kind of outcomes we have seen before. But we took it one step further.  
We also saw a significant quality of life improvement for these patients as measured in terms of anxiety, emotional distress and burden of disease management, results that affirm our corporate mission to empower our users. We also demonstrated that the software tools we are building around our sensors are driving improved outcomes.  
Across our base, we see increased time in range for our users of real-time SHARE and Follow apps. We see increased time and range for users who engage with our Clarity software, and we see increased time and range for users who take advantage of our integration with Apple's Siri virtual assistant. In 2021, we will continue to work aggressively to expand our customer base so that more and more people can experience these improved outcomes with DexCom.  
As we outlined in our recent Investor Day and at a conference presentation last month, we've prioritized 3 pillars of growth in the near term and look forward to progress on all 3 fronts in 2021 while we also lay the foundation for longer-term market expansion.  
In our core business, which we define as people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes on intensive insulin therapy, we have several initiatives underway. In the U.S., we are nearing completion of our sales force expansion, which will enhance our footprint across the country, including our reach into primary care offices. We'll continue our push to prioritize the pharmacy channel, which is the most efficient channel for our patients, clinicians and DexCom. And we'll continue our efforts to drive greater access on the awareness of the benefits that DexCom offers, including the DTC campaigns that we've been driving in both the U.S. and international markets.  
Outside the U.S., we continue to advocate for greater access in several key markets and look forward to broadening our reach in places where we have had little presence to date. This includes our expansion in France, building from a positive recent reimbursement decision, as well as the launch of G6 in Japan with Terumo as our distribution partner.  
For our third pillar, expanding the use of CGM in non-intensive type 2 diabetes, we are extending our efforts with Level2 and kicking off commercial pilots with multiple partners on the digital health side. Our work with other providers continues as well as we make the case for the clinical value of DexCom CGM in the broader type 2 population.  
Recently, Everside Health, one of the nation's largest providers of on-site health clinics, announced that their Healthstat unit will make DexCom CGM available to their members with type 2 diabetes. This is a nice extension of our previous work with Healthstat following up on our pilot efforts that utilize CGM in an on-site health screening program. We remain increasingly confident in the market opportunity ahead for DexCom,   
and on this basis, today we announced the formation of DexCom Ventures. We have a chance to identify and accelerate the development of amazing technologies, technologies that can truly make an impact to global health outcomes via innovation. I could not be more excited to lead this effort. I believe we are well positioned to advance our strategies and build connections that will make DexCom stronger in the years ahead. Look for much more from us on this front over the next several years. And in the meantime, I couldn't be more pleased to pass the torch on our day-to-day strategy and corporate development efforts to Quentin and his team.  
With that, I'll turn it back to Kevin."

We were incredibly pleased by the public response, which drove 11x greater search volume compared to the average 2021 Super Bowl commercial, the highest of any brand that advertised this year. This is why we did the ad, to drive awareness and ultimately bring CGM to more and more people who stand to benefit from this technology.  
There may be more people talking about diabetes this week than any other time in recent memory, a conversation that includes health care providers, insurance providers and people with diabetes themselves. We welcome these conversations and look forward to advancing these discussions for greater access for all people with diabetes. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean?"

Look, I think the first thing I would mention is we've made incredible progress from a profitability perspective over the last couple of years. If you think back to our original Analyst Day, we set an expectation to be at a 25% EBITDA margin by the year 2023, and we delivered 26% EBITDA margin in the year 2020. So we've made incredible progress. And I would say progress even accelerated or went beyond what our original expectations were. But we've always known there are investments we've got to make in this business to open up some of these incredible market opportunities that sit in front of us. And I think more than anything, the fact that we're making these investments ought to be a testament to the fact that we now believe in and we're seeing that these are going to be real opportunities for us. So we're excited about making that investment.  
On the gross margin side, there's a few things to point out this year that makes 2021 a little bit unique. One, we will continue to drive the normal efficiencies and leverage through the gross margin that we have in the last several years. And I would expect there's a couple of hundred basis points of efficiencies to continue to take out of it over the course of '21. But there's 2 headwinds that we have to navigate through. One continues to be the move to the pharmacy channel. We expect that we'll see a significant move over the course of this year. We've seen that pick up in terms of its momentum in the back part of last year. The other one is we're making significant investment in standing up our first international manufacturing capability in Malaysia. We broke ground there. We have teams there as we speak starting to build out that capability, which is going to take what is tens of millions of units of production capacity and turns it into hundreds of millions of units of production capacity for us, which we believe is going to be necessary as we open up these markets and begin to really see results from them. So that's what's going to play out on the gross margin side that results in a couple of hundred basis points of headwind from the 67% back to 65%.  
On the OpEx side, I think it's important. G&A is going to continue to lever nicely for us. Where the investment is going is purely in the sales expense and into R&D, and there's really a few drivers that drive it. There's the doubling of the U.S. commercial field force that we've talked about. That's pretty much done as we sit here today. Those resources are going to be in place and able to start to contribute over the course of the year, but they obviously bring with it an expense load. We're also turning up the DTC efforts. We've never been better positioned from an inventory perspective to really turn the dials on DTC and sampling and giving our commercial team the tools they need to be as effective as possible. So we're excited to be able to do that.  
And then finally, I'll just remind you, over the course of this year we've got all the G7 expenses that are going on. We got the trial expenses, we got the filing expenses, and then we got the commercial launch behind that as well. So all those things together drive the incremental investment from an OpEx perspective. But that's all going to show up in R&D and selling expense. You will see leverage in G&A. So I hope that answers the question for you."

Great question. 10%, 10 points of headwind is the right way to think about it, primarily driven by that pharmacy channel mix shift that continues to move towards the direction that is important for us to be able to scale the business over the long term. I'd remind you, profit dollars are higher in that channel. But yes, there is some gross margin pressure that comes with it. But from a top line perspective, that's what's driving it is that pharmacy channel, call it, roughly 10 points. I do think you'll see that evolve a little bit over the course of the year. Keep in mind, in the first part of last year, we weren't into the pharmacy channel to the same degree that we were as we exited the year. So you've got a tougher comp in Q1 and Q2. And you see that in the growth rates as well. You're going to see tougher growth comps in the first half of '21 that will start to subside in the back half of the year. So I do think that you'll see that evolve a bit as we start to anniversary some of the pharmacy shift that we saw in the back part of '20 into the back part of '21. As we head into '22, look, we'll talk about that as we get out there around that time frame. But I do think there's a couple of years here of stepping through it. Once we're through it, I think you're going to see the unit volume growth of this business is going to be much more reflective of the overall dollar growth. Unit volume growth continues to be incredibly strong. We were up 40% in units in the fourth quarter by the time everything settled out. And our unit volume growth in '21 is right around that 25% to 30% growth. So very strong unit growth continue to drive the business."

And ultimately, we will take costs from the system. As far as what that number is going to be, I don't have a number completely. We have numerous models, and many of those depend upon the final use cases. I've also said numerous times, and I'll stick to this as well, I think the ultimate use case and the way we'll ultimately price it will be for full-time use for these patients. And if they choose to use it less often, that will be their choice. So on the health and wellness side, again, many, many more patients, a lower annual revenue number, but more interactions with more different people in a completely different distribution channel.  
With respect to the products, certainly, the core technology of sensing glucose, from our perspective on the glucose side, will remain the same. As those of you who listened to our Investor Day heard when I had my chat with Dr. Peter Attia, we talked about accuracy. And he said it's actually more important for his patients because if they only go between 70 and 120, 20 points off is a big deal. And they'd be making a wrong decision as far as their health and what they eat nutrition-wise, et cetera, within accuracy. So we know that fundamental core technology needs to remain accurate. Where we get into different products is the experience that we create, possibly even different wearables based on the category, different places to receive the data. Then as you look at the new ventures unit that Steve will be working in, then you look at software experiences for patients, data platforms to get data to these platforms better, possibly other things we could sense or measure and add to glucose. So we believe these markets are going to require something different. At the end of the day, one size fits all is not going to work for us as we try and expand and hit the goals we've laid out for everybody in the future. We're going to have numerous experiences for these patient groups."

Well, I think we're incredibly excited and bullish on the future opportunities. But at the same time, our approach has always been we want to see those start to pan out and contribute, and at that point, we'll start to reflect them into guidance. So as we open up some of these new markets and validate that we're able to generate the revenue from them, then hopefully, we've got some very positive updates for you guys over time. I don't think we could be more excited around where we're making these investments. We know for a fact the type 2 intensive space, for example, is going to come on to CGM therapy. We're seeing it happen in our results right now. We're starting to see some of it with the nonintensives. As a matter of fact, if you look at our new patient figures, it's led by type 2 patients. So we're starting to see some of that be validated. But in order to reach those patients, for example, on the sales force side, we've got to be in the primary care physician offices. That's where those patients are seen and that's where our current commercial force does not really play. And so as we've added those resources, that is going to be their primary focus, their primary target.  
Similarly, on the DTC side. I'll continue to reiterate, there's not a better investment that we make inside the 4 walls of DexCom today than our DTC efforts. And the returns that we see with the new patients that come out of it, we're very confident that that's the best investment we can possibly make. Now will that return on investment per individual or per patient start to step down into the future? It may, as they get harder to bring on. Basically, for the time being, we've been very encouraged by that return that we've seen, and we'll continue to pour resources in there until we see that change. So I don't think there's a better place for us to be focusing our efforts right now than to really be building out the commercial force to see the right individuals where the patients are at and to continue to create awareness for these patients as well."

And as you look at the progress we've made, I recently prepared a speech for the sales guys. We're up 10x where we were 5 years ago, from $40-plus million to over $400 million for 2020. And by every indicator, one would say, wow, that is fabulous. And in our mind, as we look at it, the opportunity is bigger than what we've addressed. And we do need to build infrastructure, and we also need to look at doing things more creatively. I think, for example, the Japan partnership with Terumo, whereby we're really letting a partner take our business in that country that is a medical technology leader in that geography, is going to be a great business model for us to watch and look at.  
In France, we get reimbursement for a group of patients. We will invest some there. But we have other international models we're looking at. We literally break down every country in a type of bucket: there's great reimbursement here, here's how we need to attack this one, there's no reimbursement here. And we're making plans across all the geographies. Another key investment internationally is going to be our e-commerce platform. We've had great results every place we've launched it, so in geographies where we're not, where we go, we'll probably go first with an e-commerce platform going forward. And so we're investing on all fronts there. The Malaysia factory is truly an investment in scale for us. It will -- it's going to be ultra modern, as is our Arizona manufacturing facility, don't get me wrong. But we've learned a tremendous amount in building out Arizona that we can apply to Malaysia and really put ourselves in a position to whereby we can go after these businesses. One of the things that we often discuss as we sit and discuss the would've, should've, could'ves, for a better part, 1.5 years, as far as capacity, we were selling everything we built. With the opportunity now, with the inventory we have and our ops team being able to build as much as they can, we think we can much more aggressively go after these international markets just on a commercial strategy basis as well, and we're going to going forward."

And it's a large percent of their income, and it's hard. It's just hard. We empathize with those people. We've done our best with our pharmacy shift, for example. And when we gave some of these statistics at Investor Day, I think somewhere above 30% of our pharmacy patients have zero co-pay. And another group of them have less than $60 a month on their co-pay.

We have regions and districts within the sales organization. We've increased the number of districts, the number of regions from 2 to 4. And so similar structure that way. And then we've worked out a comp plan that we think is very fair for everybody, and our guys are willing to live with. I think the most interesting piece for me in laying out the whole sales force expansion was how it was received by our team in the beginning. You're always leery of that when you start. Instead, the team raised their hands and said, ""We need more help. We need more exposure here. This is a good thing. There are people we don't call on."" So we look forward to it. And as far as time, it takes everybody time to get acclimated to a new position, a new territory. For those who have diabetes relationships, for example if you hire somebody from an insulin company or an insulin pump company, they can go back to offices they've already been to, and they're up and running quite quickly. For others, it takes more time. And that's why we have our district managers and our regional managers to help with those relationships and train those people. So there is a time. It varies based on the experience level of the rep before they start with us. Some hit the ground running and go faster than the one before. Others, it takes a little time. And we monitor that and we watch and go give those more training that need it. So it will be fun to watch unfold."

How do we think about that plant or the plants coming online in terms of what level of volume do you think you need to be when it comes to the kind of sales numbers that you put out there for the long term to kind of really truly get those plants to lever the fixed cost investments they've made? I guess what I'm trying to ask is, if sales ramp faster than we've kind of modeled here, is there upside to your gross margin? Conversely, if it's kind of in line with the long-term guidance -- what gets that 65% higher as I contemplate these CapEx investments?"

I'd remind you, the $4 billion to $4.5 billion revenue figure we put out there out in 2025 or so was more or less our base case. That's how we qualified that to you folks. And it started to open up a bit of the type 2 nonintensive opportunity, but there's a massive market that sits in front of us. And as we open that up in bigger ways, as you start to open up things like hospital or gestational or get further upstream into the diabetes condition and get into prediabetes, those volume numbers are incredible. And so I mentioned earlier, we're talking about going from tens of millions of units to hundreds of millions of units of capability over time, and we're beginning to make those investments as we speak. 
In terms of the CapEx investment, I think you're going to see roughly double this year what we've seen in the last couple of years. We've seen about $200 million of CapEx in the last 2 years each year. I think that is going to be north of $400 million, probably as we stand up this building and build out the capability that will then serve us for years to come into the future. How quickly we're ramping that is really going to be predicated on how quickly we open up some of these markets. What we're not going to do, and we've been very clear about this after having learned from the experience ourselves when we launched G6, we're not going to put ourselves in a position again to where we don't have the inventory to deliver to the patient and create a DexCom experience that is one that we want them to have. And so we are investing ahead of that curve, but we're very confident that the curve is ultimately going to be realized. I think the question is just nailing down that timing and know exactly what that's going to look like. From our perspective, we're going to be ready when it's ready to go. We're not going to be behind it, so..."

Thanks, Quentin. And let me add just a bit. As I look at volumes and why hundreds of millions rather than tens, as we look at the use of CGM, for example, as a diagnostic for somebody who may have prediabetes but may not be sure, as part of the annual checkup, there's hundreds of millions of people in the U.S. who would need that checkup every year. As you look at 30 million people with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. -- I don't know if my 30 million is right, but it's close -- if just 10% of those people went on sensors full time, you're looking at 60 million to 90 million sensors we'd be selling on an annual basis. These opportunities are going to require scale. And we've just made the decision going at this in a manner to whereby we do it gradually and hope we have enough when we get there is just not going to work. The opportunities are too big and the investment is required. That's why we've raised the money. That's why we've made the plans. That's why we've designed the product and set the relationships that we have. We need to go after this. And when you look at the size of the investment versus the size of the prize, size of the prize is way bigger than the size of the investment."

The non-insulin users will, in fact, tag along as they become aware, and there are situations where some of these patients do have coverage. On the type 2 nonintensive patient, we've been very clear from the beginning that we're going to go about that -- this market 4 different ways: through programs, payers, clinicians, and then directly to patients. And over the course of 2021, you will see those 4 initiatives unfold as we gather more data and launch more initiatives. And so awareness will grow. As Quentin said earlier, and Steve, a very reasonable number of our leads from the Super Bowl ad have been type 2 non-intensive patients. Whether we can serve them or not with reimbursement today remains to be seen, but we certainly have a database of these names of people we can call on. As soon as we have the product offering, we want to get in that space ready. So I think we're preparing and getting ready for that. More importantly, though, as we make these clinicians aware, they can look for cases where they can make it available to their patients. They can look at situations where somebody can appeal for coverage if they have type 2 diabetes and out of control, and those appeals have been successful. So we're looking forward to going there and -- but these guys will focus on our core markets and where we play with reimbursement first and foremost."

Well, I think when you look at the overall investment in the areas you identified, the most significant increase is likely going to show up in doubling the size of that commercial field force. And then right behind it is DTC and sampling. Sampling is a bit new to us. We've never sampled historically. We just started to roll that out in the fourth quarter and very early in seeing what that looks like. But that's a pretty easy one for us to measure. We're not going to give you the specific results of what that looks like, although the fact that we're going to continue to double down on it should tell you that we're incredibly happy with what we're seeing. But that's as easy as knowing exactly where we're dropping the samples in the field and knowing exactly what patients are utilizing those samples and ultimately turn into a recurring purchase for us. So those are easy measures. And on the DTC side, with social media and the leads that get created from that that ultimately turn into patients, that becomes relatively easy to measure as well. One of the things that I think was just really fascinating coming out of the Super Bowl ad is that we had 5x more impressions in the last 4 days than we had it for the entire year of 2020 on the heels of that. I think it's just remarkable the type of reach that we're finding with our DTC efforts. So we're going to continue to monitor those things and measure those and hold ourselves accountable to them. And as long as the return is there, we're going to continue to invest aggressively there. If we see the returns start to drop down, then we'll start to think differently. But we're not going to give specific return measures, those sorts of things. But the fact that we're doubling down in these efforts, I think, ought to convey the confidence we have in these investments and what they're bringing to us."

So what you didn't want to do is create all this awareness and then be in a back order situation immediately. And if you go back to 2019, we operated through most all of '19 in a back order situation. We came out of that early in '20 which has now allowed us to build inventories and put ourselves in a position where we can start to get more aggressive with these things.

This company has changed so much over those 40 calls, but a marvelous effort and some incredible work, and he'll still be here, but he's going to have some different investors to please, and we're excited about that. 
I do want to thank everybody for being on the call today. As you can tell, we remain extremely bullish about our opportunities going forward. One of our executives was having a conversation with me here one day and he said, the way he described DexCom is, just as soon as we climb one mountain, we get to the top of it, and on the other side, there's a bigger one, and we start another climb. And I think as Quentin detailed our financial plans and what we have going on, what we see is a great big mountain and a great big climb. And we're preparing to do that. We think we can do it very effectively. We are very bullish about the future. Over the past several days, a lot of the talk has been around the Super Bowl commercial here. And I have gotten numerous pictures, videos, e-mails, text messages from our patients and their parents or their caregivers saying thank you for creating awareness. Kids in school are telling everybody, ""Remember that commercial? I wear that, and I have that, and this is how I manage my diabetes."" We have seen such a positive reception to this, and the positive energy has just been amazing. So kudos to our marketing team, to Nick Jonas and everybody for getting this done. Our hospital initiatives and the new initiatives we've talked about, as I said, there are investments, but now we're getting numerous physicians reaching out saying, ""You've got to get this everywhere. It needs to be all throughout the hospital. It needs to be worn by the patients when they go home. We can't have them coming back, and monitoring glucose can be very important."" We'll continue to go after those efforts. Our new market efforts are very strong. 
And last, I'll go to the intensive type 2s as well. As I said, we created some awareness here. I recently had a conversation -- I've had several conversations with people with type 2 diabetes absolutely struggling with what to do. What can I possibly do to take care of myself because they just don't know. And CGM tells them. It tells them what to do. It tells them about foods. It tells them about exercise. It tells them about stress and sleep and everything else. And we are really excited for this opportunity. You'll see us have a lot of good things come to pass in 2021 on all these fronts. But thanks, everybody, for continuing to listen. And a great day, great year for DexCom and our team. Thanks, everybody."

Today, we reported strong first quarter results with total revenue growth of 25% over the first quarter of 2020. As I often tell our employees, our ability to thrive as a company ultimately comes down to solving significant problems with a great product. And that is what we continue to see with G6. We hear incredible stories of improved glucose control, reduced disease burden and people being empowered and those responses have only increased as we've enhanced tools to better drive our customer experiences. These stories are coming from multiple sources as well, whether it is coming from G6 users or their family members who are gaining better control of their glucose levels to real-time data or clinicians who are empowered by the ability to gather unique insights into the diabetes treatment of their type 1 or type 2 patients and optimize therapy accordingly. And even new settings like nurses and doctors in the inpatient setting, who are deploying CGM and learning about its potential to optimize workflows and benefit from our remote monitoring technology. 
New customer additions are off to a great start in 2021, especially in the U.S., as we continue to see growth across all channels, building from the increased access that we've gained over the past several years. This includes continued traction for people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 intensively managed diabetes, both of which have continued the strong growth momentum that we've seen over the past couple of years. We're also seeing a growing number of type 2 nonintensive customers on G6, not only through our partnerships like UnitedHealthcare's level 2 program, but also including the other innovative programs and providers that are establishing early access to Dexcom CGM. 
We're also progressing our strategic commercial efforts, with the remainder of our commercial sales force expansion completed in the first quarter and our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts, generating new levels of brand awareness. The Super Bowl commercial featuring Nick Jonas was a highlight for the company in the first quarter. We were able to generate significant excitement for our employees and customers, many of whom have sent us pictures and stories of their pride and feeling represented during one of the biggest annual events in the world. We also contribute to a broader conversation in the diabetes community that we hope will help facilitate broader access to CGM in the future. The ad drove a record number of visitors to our website, a record for single-day new customer leads and significantly more media impressions than we generated in all of 2020. 
And we are confident that there will be ongoing benefits that will come from the ad. In fact, according to the independent Harris Poll, DexCom led all Super Bowl advertisers in brand equity growth. Overall, it was a great investment for the company, and I'm really proud of our team for pulling it together. Our commercial efforts also include a strong push from our teams to expand access to Dexcom CGM technology internationally, both deeper in existing markets as well into new geographies. With DexCom in the strongest inventory position in the company's history as a result of our scaling initiatives, we are aggressively advocating for broader access to our G6 systems for people with type 1 diabetes and intensively managed type 2 diabetes, similar to what we have done here in the United States. 
Since we last reported in February, we have received confirmation from 3 additional Canadian provinces that they will begin covering Dexcom CGM. This is a great step forward in expanding access for people with diabetes. There is significant demand from customers and clinicians, and we are optimistic that we will continue this positive momentum in Canada with both the public and private payers over the coming months. 
In certain reimbursed markets, we are proactively lowering price to significantly expand access to incremental customer populations. This positions us well to continue to grow sensor volume significantly now and into the future, and we believe the incremental volumes will more than offset the impact of price in the near term. 
In conjunction with our commercial initiatives and the growing CGM category awareness, we are advancing the clinical and regulatory path for our next-generation G7 CGM system. As a reminder, we expect G7 to improve all aspects of the current customer experience offered with G6 in a disposable wearable that is less than half the size. We are working to compare the submission for CE Mark in accordance with the new medical device reporting standard in the EU. At this point, we remain on track for our target launch of G7 in the second half of 2021. We also plan to present preliminary data on G7 performance at the upcoming ATTD conference in early June. Our trial that will support our U.S. ICGM filing is also well underway. And we have received outstanding feedback from the investigators and patients involved. We expect to complete that trial in the current quarter, and we'll keep you updated as we progress towards regulatory approvals and launch. 
Even as we advance our strategic plans and have seen continued customer growth over the past year, the evidence of the global pandemic remains with us. We continue to navigate certain closures and territories that have seen cases spike, and our team remains focused on the 3 priorities that we have emphasized throughout the past year: the health and safety of our employees, continued supply of our customers and service to our communities. Towards this end, we were pleased to recently work with the state of Arizona to open the first indoor mass vaccination facility in Arizona to help the community as it transitions to the heat of the summer months. This facility rests within our Mesa distribution facility and has the capacity to support several thousand appointments per day. I am proud to lead a company whose employees are so dedicated to the service of our customers and willing to think creatively about what it means to be a leader in the communities that we serve. 
As we come back to first quarter results, I want to welcome a new voice to our earnings call, those familiar to many of you already. Last month, we announced the promotion of Jereme Sylvain to the role of Chief Financial Officer and I'm pleased to have Jereme joined Quentin and I for his first DexCom earnings call this afternoon.

I'm excited to be with you today and in the new role as we advance our work together for people with diabetes. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconcilia",1078,"Thank you, Kevin. I'm excited to be with you today and in the new role as we advance our work together for people with diabetes. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found on today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. 
For the first quarter of 2021, we reported worldwide revenue of $505 million, compared to $405 million for the first quarter of 2020, representing growth of 25% on a reported basis and 23% on a constant currency basis. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth of $100 million or more. Impressively, our revenue performance came against our toughest quarterly comparison in 2020 for both our U.S. and international businesses as the first quarter of 2020 was largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also saw nearly 40% global unit volume growth in the quarter, demonstrating the continued customer growth in the business. 
U.S. revenue totaled $381 million for the first quarter compared to $292 million for the first quarter in 2020, representing growth of 30%. Our U.S. business was the primary driver of growth in the first quarter, with our commercial efforts in rising CGM awareness driving solid volumes and an acceleration from our fourth quarter growth percentage. We believe that we are well positioned to continue this momentum. Our DTC efforts are driving awareness of Dexcom CGM. We have new connected systems coming to market that build from years of collaborative work with our partners and we have an expanded field sales force equipped with the products that our customers love. 
Our international business reached another quarterly high watermark with a revenue of $124 million or 10% growth on a reported basis compared to the first quarter of 2020. As we saw in the final 3 quarters of 2020, the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns has had a greater impact on new customer growth in certain international markets, which has a compounding effect on our reoccurring revenue model. Nevertheless, we delivered growth against our toughest quarterly comp of 2020, where international revenue grew 61% before the pandemic. 
We continue to see strong growth across a number of our markets, particularly in countries where the administrative requirements to access CGM are minimized via our e-commerce channel or via broad reimbursement. 
As many of you have seen, we've successfully reduced our manufacturing costs and intentionally increased sensor production capacity. Through these manufacturing efficiencies and increased capacity, we are no longer restricted to focusing on high-risk, high-reimbursement populations. With this increased commercial flexibility, we are executing on our strategy to broaden access to our CGM technology by pushing deeper into existing markets we previously could not address. Through the incremental volumes generated by these efforts, we believe we will offset any near-term price impact while better positioning the company for long-term growth. 
Our first quarter gross profit was $343.9 million or 68.1% of revenue compared to 63.9% of revenue in the first quarter of 2020. The fact that we are driving margin expansion, despite absorbing the channel mix impact associated with the acceleration of our U.S. business to the pharmacy channel, is a testament to the work of our teams to drive down material and production costs. Operating expenses were $297.5 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $215.4 million for the first quarter of 2020. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2021 as a result of several of the key initiatives that we outlined in our original 2021 guidance in February. This includes our expanded commercial efforts with the doubling of our U.S. sales force and increased global DTC marketing efforts, both reflected in the quarterly results. 
In addition, the first quarter research and development expense includes costs associated with our large U.S. ICGM trial for G7 which will continue into the second quarter as we generate the data necessary to support our regulatory filing. Offsetting those strategic investments, we continue to gain leverage in our general and administrative expenses in the quarter, demonstrating the benefits of our scaling initiatives. To that end, as we've previously indicated, we have launched a global business services facility in Lithuania, which is now officially live in servicing our customers. 
Operating income was $46.4 million or 9.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $43.3 million or 10.7% of revenue in the same quarter of 2020, with 150 basis point decrease resulting from our strategic investments offset by our gross margin improvement. Adjusted EBITDA was $94.4 million or 18.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $77.8 million or 19.2% of revenue for the first quarter of 2020. Net income for the first quarter was $32.8 million or $0.33 per share. 
We remain in a great financial position, closing the first quarter with more than $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and well positioned to continue our G7 scale-up and remain opportunistic as we look to expand our growth opportunities. 
Turning to guidance. We expect some impact to new customer starts to continue during the ongoing global vaccine rollout, particularly in certain international markets as well as continued higher than usual volumes in our U.S. Medicaid channel as the economy recovers. With the strong first quarter performance as well as the currency benefit that we saw in the first quarter and continue to anticipate, we are pleased to be in a position to raise our full year 2021 revenue guidance. We now expect 2021 revenue to be between $2.26 billion to $2.36 billion, representing growth of 17% to 22% over 2020. This growth continues to factor in strong unit growth volumes, which are offsetting the impact of lower revenue per customer channels and our recent efforts to broaden access to G6 in international markets as well as the impact of currency. 
Turning to margins. We are affirming the full year 2021 targets previously established on our fourth quarter call. This includes non-GAAP results to be approximately at the following levels: gross profit margins of approximately 65%, operating margins of approximately 13%. We continue to expect that adjusted EBITDA margins to be approximately 23%. And finally, as you may have noticed, from a tax perspective, we have transitioned to profitability and we'll have a tax rate applicable to earnings going forward. Our expectation

It's been a pleasure to work alongside Jeremy for the last 7 years of our careers, and I am thrilled for him as he now steps into the CFO role. I look forward to watching you and take this next step in his career and look forward to the many contributions that he'll make in his new role while also excited by the opportunity to turn my attention much more broadly to our strategic and scaling efforts across the organization. 
Our teams remain incredibly focused on our strategic initiatives and are making great progress on several fronts. As Kevin mentioned, we are advancing our regulatory and clinical efforts for G7 and will present the first set of G7 data at the upcoming ATTD conference in early June. As we press forward toward our G7 goals, we are making steady progress in our effort to scale G7 manufacturing to support our launches and the continued growth of our global customer base. In the near term, this includes the lines that we are building in our San Diego and Mesa, Arizona facilities. We've also broken ground on our manufacturing site in Malaysia, which we expect to enable us to significantly scale our G7 production capacity to serve meaningfully more customers as we continue to grow our business in the years to come. 
Even with G7 on the horizon, we remain committed to building on the leading customer experience that we have established for users of our G6 system. Following the December regulatory approval in the U.S., we rolled out an update to the G6 algorithm in the first quarter. We believe this update will drive further reductions to times in which data is temporarily unavailable and have seen excellent results from the initial launch of this updated algorithm in Canada in 2020. These are the kinds of incremental improvements that we are always looking to provide, and they are contributing to our strong customer retention and satisfaction levels reflected in our industry-leading Net Promoter Scores. 
On the insulin delivery front, we were encouraged to see the great results from the Omnipod 5 pivotal trial presented at Endo 2021, and look forward to the upcoming launch of that system for our DexCom customers using the Omnipod pump. With this launch in Omnipod's differentiated patch pump form factor as well as tandem's continued market traction with their Dexcom-connected Control-IQ, we believe that we are very well positioned to continue to benefit from the growing appreciation for these automated insulin delivery systems. 
Similarly, we continue to advance our development with Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and more recently, Ypsomed, leaving us in a strong position in future years as people with diabetes stand to benefit from greater variety in their choices for Bluetooth-connected insulin delivery options that integrate Dexcom CGM. 
We've discussed the excellent first quarter performance in our U.S. IIT market as well as some of the key strategic initiatives that we are undertaking to expand access in our international markets. We are also making excellent progress in our effort to drive the third pillar of near-term growth that we highlighted at our 2020 Investor Day, the non-intensive type 2 market. 
As we've mentioned before, we are taking multichannel approach to enabling access to Dexcom CGM in the absence of widespread reimbursement. This involves direct work with payers, digital health programs, health care providers, and integrated networks as well as the patients themselves. The early rollout of Level2 is progressing well as we continue to see that program expand and our teams are working well with the United Healthcare team to optimize the experience for members using our G6 system as part of that program. 
We also worked with several partners to expand their use of G6 in their respective type 2 populations in the first quarter. This includes the initiation of commercial pilots with Teladoc Health's Livongo for Diabetes platform as well as with Welldoc. Everside Health also announced that it will offer G6 to its members with type 2 diabetes in its health staff business unit, and we are proceeding there now in a pilot phase. This relationship builds from our initial work with Healthstat over the previous 2 years, including the use of Dexcom CGM in a pilot for health screenings at on-site clinics. 
Each of these relationships is expanding the pool of customers who can access our technology while generating evidence of the utility of Dexcom CGM for the broader type 2 market that we believe will drive access and awareness in the future. 
Beyond these core growth initiatives, our teams continue to advance innovative research and product development that we feel will contribute to long-term growth for DexCom. This includes the hospital market, where we are generating data via our patient registry and receiving great feedback as many hospitals across America continue to take advantage of the FDA's temporary allowance to use Dexcom CGM in the inpatient setting during the pandemic. This also includes several clinical studies assessing the use of Dexcom CGM for better management of gestational diabetes, a solution that we believe can enhance the outcomes for both the mother and the child. And finally, we continue to access next-generation technologies that we believe can build from the sensor platform that we've established with G6 and G7. We look forward to updating you as we progress. 
With that, I will pass it back to Kevin."

And so because of that, we're raising what we call channel mix/pricing headwinds to about $250 million on the year.

We've looked at what we accomplished in the U.S. here, what we've done is we've increased access by going to the pharmacy channel by looking at Medicare approval, for example, which came in at a lower price than what our DME price was before. As we've set up, Medicaid pricing structures in the U.S. that are yet once again a pricing structure lower than what we had before, but to increase access to a number of patients. We then have looked at our OUS business in several of our key geographies and said, you know what, our access is not broad enough. Our access is very much focused on very intensively managed type 1s, oftentimes just children or adults with pumps or adults with an incredibly bad hypoglycemia awareness or something along those lines. And it's more important to us to reach more patients. So we've taken the strategy we've used in the U.S., and we're deploying it in other places as well to increase our access. We won't let Libre 3 drive our decisions. We'll drive our own."

But as far as calling on more voices, we are learning that, in all fairness, we've been underserved with respect to our ability to call on people. There's a great story we heard from down in Texas. One of our reps called on a physician or and talk to them about our product and the doctor said, I know nothing about your product. I've put people on your competitors' product because they come and ask me for it. So again, using the sample program that Quentin described with DexCom, we put this patient on the system, introduced the physician to it, and now he's prescribing Dexcom all the time. Because of the experience that patient had. We needed a deeper reach. We'll get that deeper reach with what we've done, and we'll continue to evaluate over time. And we've got tremendous metrics on our salespeople. We have an incredible commercial organization that monitors that. But we also very much understand it takes a while to get up to speed.

It really created a lot of awareness for our company awareness we hadn't had before, and that was really the goal, as we talked about. We developed more brand equity from our ad than anybody else.

In terms of the extent of it, as we go after these incremental markets and open up access, we almost look at that as new patients. And so when we go after new patients and new markets, certainly, pricing is going to change over time. So there could be impacts that drag out over time in the future years as a result of just going after incremental pockets of patients and any sort of knock along impact, certainly not anything that we would expect to be significant. But that will always be contemplated in our guidance, and it will all be something that we certainly talk to on these calls. I wouldn't expect anything that we provide hasn't been thought through and contemplated in any of the targets that we provide to you guys."

I think from our perspective, all that we know right now is kind of the environment we operate within with respect to COVID, which we know from an international perspective has certainly created some incremental pressure in pockets of that business,",324,"Yes. I think from our perspective, all that we know right now is kind of the environment we operate within with respect to COVID, which we know from an international perspective has certainly created some incremental pressure in pockets of that business, particularly those that require in clinic visit to get onto the product or some of those administrative hurdles that have been put there. In other channels where we have e-commerce, for example, we're seeing incredible results. And so I think one thing to point out on that first quarter international result is that when you look at it from a 2-year growth perspective, it's an incredibly strong number. Last year was an absolute record growth for us in that first quarter from an international perspective. So I think you got to normalize that when you're looking at that first quarter growth. But in terms of the remainder of the year, on an international basis and patient adoption, a big part of stepping price down in line with kind of our global pricing strategy was the fact that we had to see administrative requirements reduced or eliminated altogether to get patients onto the product. And so in these markets where we've done that, the hurdle to get onto the product has been removed. And so we absolutely would expect to see patient -- new patient acquisition become much easier for us and see that start to take off in a very positive way. So I do think you're going to see that uptick over the course of the year, even in the COVID environment. With, of course, the caveat being that it kind of stays stable to where it's at today. If we were to get worse in some case, then we might have to think about that differently, but we're trying to look at the future based upon what we see today and how it's impacted the markets here in the moment."

So it's not like you're going in there and loading up with 3 to 6 months as we did in the past in the DME channel. And even in the DME channel today, there's less of that loading up by patients with G6 than there was in G5 and G4 prior to that. We don't view that, that people will quit purchasing their G6 is when G7 is announced because in all fairness, our customers can let without it.

And I think by the day, we learn more and more that increases that bullishness for us and the confidence that there's going to be some real opportunity there to create value coming from it. And you're going to see a study a little bit later this year, midyear at some of the midyear society meetings that's going to start to really lay out the benefit of using CGM relative to BGM in this type 2 population, particularly the non-intensive population that just demonstrates the sort of impact we can have on patients say they're on basal only. And that's a 4 million patient population in the U.S. So I think that sort of data starts to really accumulate in favor of opening up a whole another market segment that doubles the existing core U.S. intensive market today that we're very excited about. So you'll see that data here mid-year, but I think all of it starts to point to the fact that this type 2 space is going to open up in a significant way, and we're well positioned to take advantage of it."

Everything important in diabetes care is going to revolve around CGM. For example, there are numerous in some delivery devices and algorithms available for automated insulin delivery. But there's only one CGM commercially capable of delivering the patient experience and outcomes that we've owned vision for a very long time. And that's only the beginning. They're incredible new compounds, treatments and programs stepping forward for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and we are very confident that the right CGM experience will become an integral part of all these solutions, and we haven't even started talking about the difference we can make as part of our pre-diabetes program.

Today, we reported strong first quarter results with total revenue growth of 25% over the first quarter of 2020. As I often tell our employees, our ability to thrive as a company ultimately comes down to solving significant problems with a great product. And that is what we continue to see with G6. We hear incredible stories of improved glucose control, reduced disease burden and people being empowered, and those responses have only increased as we've enhanced tools to better drive our customer experiences. These stories are coming from multiple sources as well, whether it is coming from G6 users or their family members who are gaining better control of their glucose levels to real-time data or clinicians who are empowered by the ability to gather unique insights into the diabetes treatment of their type 1 or type 2 patients and optimize therapy accordingly, and even new settings like nurses and doctors in the inpatient setting who are deploying CGM and learning about its potential to optimize workflows and benefit from our remote monitoring technology. 
New customer additions are off to a great start in 2021, especially in the U.S., as we continue to see growth across all channels, building from the increased access that we've gained over the past several years. This includes continued traction for people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 intensively managed diabetes, both of which have continued the strong growth momentum that we've seen over the past couple of years. We're also seeing a growing number of type 2 nonintensive customers on G6, not only through our partnerships like UnitedHealthcare's Level2 program, but also including the other innovative programs and providers that are establishing early access to DexCom CGM. 
We're also progressing our strategic commercial efforts, with the remainder of our commercial sales force expansion completed in the first quarter and our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts generating new levels of brand awareness. The Super Bowl commercial featuring Nick Jonas was a highlight for the company in the first quarter. We were able to generate significant excitement for our employees and customers, many of whom have sent us pictures and stories of their pride and feeling represented during one of the biggest annual events in the world. We also contribute to a broader conversation in the diabetes community that we hope will help facilitate broader access to CGM in the future. The ad drove a record number of visitors to our website, a record for single-day new customer leads and significantly more media impressions than we generated in all of 2020. 
And we are confident that there will be ongoing benefits that will come from the ad. In fact, according to the independent Harris Poll, DexCom led all Super Bowl advertisers in brand equity growth. Overall, it was a great investment for the company, and I'm really proud of our team for pulling it together. Our commercial efforts also include a strong push from our teams to expand access to DexCom CGM technology internationally, both deeper in existing markets as well into new geographies. With DexCom in the strongest inventory position in the company's history as a result of our scaling initiatives, we are aggressively advocating for broader access to our G6 systems for people with type 1 diabetes and intensively managed type 2 diabetes, similar to what we have done here in the United States. 
Since we last reported in February, we have received confirmation from 3 additional Canadian provinces that they will begin covering DexCom CGM. This is a great step forward in expanding access for people with diabetes. There is significant demand from customers and clinicians, and we are optimistic that we will continue this positive momentum in Canada with both the public and private payers over the coming months. 
In certain reimbursed markets, we are proactively lowering price to significantly expand access to incremental customer populations. This positions us well to continue to grow sensor volume significantly now and into the future, and we believe the incremental volumes will more than offset the impact of price in the near term. 
In conjunction with our commercial initiatives and the growing CGM category awareness, we are advancing the clinical and regulatory path for our next-generation G7 CGM system. As a reminder, we expect G7 to improve all aspects of the current customer experience offered with G6 in a disposable wearable that is less than half the size. We are working to prepare the submission for CE Mark in accordance with the new medical device reporting standard in the EU. At this point, we remain on track for our target launch of G7 in the second half of 2021. 
We also plan to present preliminary data on G7 performance at the upcoming ATTD conference in early June. Our trial that will support our U.S. iCGM filing is also well underway. And we have received outstanding feedback from the investigators and patients involved. We expect to complete that trial in the current quarter, and we'll keep you updated as we progress towards regulatory approvals and launch. 
Even as we advance our strategic plans and have seen continued customer growth over the past year, the evidence of the global pandemic remains with us. We continue to navigate certain closures in territories that have seen cases spike, and our team remains focused on the 3 priorities that we have emphasized throughout the past year: the health and safety of our employees, continued supply of our customers and service to our communities. Towards this end, we were pleased to recently work with the state of Arizona to open the first indoor mass vaccination facility in Arizona to help the community as it transitions to the heat of the summer months. This facility rests within our Mesa distribution facility and has the capacity to support several thousand appointments per day. I am proud to lead a company whose employees are so dedicated to the service of our customers and willing to think creatively about what it means to be a leader in the communities that we serve. 
As we come back to first quarter results, I want to welcome a new voice to our earnings call, those familiar to many of you already. Last month, we announced the promotion of Jereme Sylvain to the role of Chief Financial Officer. And I'm pleased to have Jereme joined Quentin and I for his first DexCom earnings call this afternoon.

For the first quarter of 2021, we reported worldwide revenue of $505 million compared to $405 million for the first quarter of 2020, representing growth of 25% on a reported basis and 23% on a constant currency basis. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth of $100 million or more. Impressively, our revenue performance came against our toughest quarterly comparison in 2020 for both our U.S. and international businesses as the first quarter of 2020 was largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also saw nearly 40% global unit volume growth in the quarter, demonstrating the continued customer growth in the business. 
U.S. revenue totaled $381 million for the first quarter compared to $292 million for the first quarter in 2020, representing growth of 30%. Our U.S. business was the primary driver of growth in the first quarter, with our commercial efforts in rising CGM awareness driving solid volumes and an acceleration from our fourth quarter growth percentage. We believe that we are well positioned to continue this momentum. Our DTC efforts are driving awareness of DexCom CGM. We have new connected systems coming to market that build from years of collaborative work with our partners, and we have an expanded field sales force equipped with the products that our customers love. 
Our international business reached another quarterly high watermark with a revenue of $124 million or 10% growth on a reported basis compared to the first quarter of 2020. As we saw in the final 3 quarters of 2020, the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns has had a greater impact on new customer growth in certain international markets, which has a compounding effect on our reoccurring revenue model. Nevertheless, we delivered growth against our toughest quarterly comp of 2020, where international revenue grew 61% before the pandemic. 
We continue to see strong growth across a number of our markets, particularly in countries where the administrative requirements to access CGM are minimized via our e-commerce channel or via broad reimbursement. As many of you have seen, we've successfully reduced our manufacturing costs and intentionally increased sensor production capacity. Through these manufacturing efficiencies and increased capacity, we are no longer restricted to focusing on high-risk, high-reimbursement populations. With this increased commercial flexibility, we are executing on our strategy to broaden access to our CGM technology by pushing deeper into existing markets we previously could not address. Through the incremental volumes generated by these efforts, we believe we will offset any near-term price impact while better positioning the company for long-term growth. 
Our first quarter gross profit was $343.9 million or 68.1% of revenue compared to 63.9% of revenue in the first quarter of 2020. The fact that we are driving margin expansion, despite absorbing the channel mix impact associated with the acceleration of our U.S. business to the pharmacy channel, is a testament to the work of our teams to drive down material and production costs. Operating expenses were $297.5 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $215.4 million for the first quarter of 2020. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2021 is a result of several of the key initiatives that we outlined in our original 2021 guidance in February. This includes our expanded commercial efforts with the doubling of our U.S. sales force and increased global DTC marketing efforts, both reflected in the quarterly results. 
In addition, the first quarter research and development expense includes costs associated with our large U.S. iCGM trial for G7, which will continue into the second quarter as we generate the data necessary to support our regulatory filing. Offsetting those strategic investments, we continue to gain leverage in our general and administrative expenses in the quarter, demonstrating the benefits of our scaling initiatives. To that end, as we've previously indicated, we have launched a global business services facility in Lithuania, which is now officially live in servicing our customers. 
Operating income was $46.4 million or 9.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $43.3 million or 10.7% of revenue in the same quarter of 2020, with 150 basis point decrease resulting from our strategic investments offset by our gross margin improvement. Adjusted EBITDA was $94.4 million or 18.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $77.8 million or 19.2% of revenue for the first quarter of 2020. Net income for the first quarter was $32.8 million or $0.33 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the first quarter with more than $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and well positioned to continue our G7 scale-up and remain opportunistic as we look to expand our growth opportunities. 
Turning to guidance. We expect some impact to new customer starts to continue during the ongoing global vaccine rollout, particularly in certain international markets as well as continued higher-than-usual volumes in our U.S. Medicaid channel as the economy recovers. With the strong first quarter performance as well as the currency benefit that we saw in the first quarter and continue to anticipate, we are pleased to be in a position to raise our full year 2021 revenue guidance. We now expect 2021 revenue to be between $2.26 billion to $2.36 billion, representing growth of 17% to 22% over 2020. This growth continues to factor in strong unit growth volumes, which are offsetting the impact of lower revenue per customer channels and our recent efforts to broaden access to G6 in international markets as well as the impact of currency. 
Turning to margins. We are affirming the full year 2021 targets previously established on our fourth quarter call. This includes non-GAAP results to be approximately at the following levels: gross profit margins of approximately 65%, operating margins of approximately 13%. We continue to expect that adjusted EBITDA margins to be approximately 23%. And finally, as you may have noticed, from a tax perspective, we have transitioned to profitability and we'll have a tax rate applicable to earnings going forward. Our expectation

It's been a pleasure to work alongside Jereme for the last 7 years of our careers, and I am thrilled for him as he now steps into the CFO role. I look forward to watching you and take this next step in his career and look forward to the many contributions that he'll make in his new role while also excited by the opportunity to turn my attention much more broadly to our strategic and scaling efforts across the organization. 
Our teams remain incredibly focused on our strategic initiatives and are making great progress on several fronts. As Kevin mentioned, we are advancing our regulatory and clinical efforts for G7 and will present the first set of G7 data at the upcoming ATTD conference in early June. As we press forward toward our G7 goals, we are making steady progress in our effort to scale G7 manufacturing to support our launches and the continued growth of our global customer base. In the near term, this includes the lines that we are building in our San Diego and Mesa, Arizona facilities. We've also broken ground on our manufacturing site in Malaysia, which we expect to enable us to significantly scale our G7 production capacity to serve meaningfully more customers as we continue to grow our business in the years to come. 
Even with G7 on the horizon, we remain committed to building on the leading customer experience that we have established for users of our G6 system. Following the December regulatory approval in the U.S., we rolled out an update to the G6 algorithm in the first quarter. We believe this update will drive further reductions to times in which data is temporarily unavailable and have seen excellent results from the initial launch of this updated algorithm in Canada in 2020. These are the kinds of incremental improvements that we are always looking to provide, and they are contributing to our strong customer retention and satisfaction levels reflected in our industry-leading Net Promoter Scores. 
On the insulin delivery front, we were encouraged to see the great results from the Omnipod 5 pivotal trial presented at ENDO 2021, and look forward to the upcoming launch of that system for our DexCom customers using the Omnipod pump. With this launch in Omnipod's differentiated patch pump form factor as well as Tandem's continued market traction with their DexCom-connected Control-IQ, we believe that we are very well positioned to continue to benefit from the growing appreciation for these automated insulin delivery systems. 
Similarly, we continue to advance our development with Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and more recently, Ypsomed, leaving us in a strong position in future years as people with diabetes stand to benefit from greater variety in their choices for Bluetooth-connected insulin delivery options that integrate DexCom CGM. 
We've discussed the excellent first quarter performance in our U.S. IIT market as well as some of the key strategic initiatives that we are undertaking to expand access in our international markets. We are also making excellent progress in our effort to drive the third pillar of near-term growth that we highlighted at our 2020 Investor Day, the nonintensive type 2 market. 
As we've mentioned before, we are taking multichannel approach to enabling access to DexCom CGM in the absence of widespread reimbursement. This involves direct work with payers, digital health programs, health care providers, and integrated networks as well as the patients themselves. The early rollout of Level2 is progressing well as we continue to see that program expand and our teams are working well with the UnitedHealthcare team to optimize the experience for members using our G6 system as part of that program. 
We also worked with several partners to expand their use of G6 in their respective type 2 populations in the first quarter. This includes the initiation of commercial pilots with Teladoc Health's Livongo for Diabetes platform as well as with WellDoc. Everside Health also announced that it will offer G6 to its members with type 2 diabetes in its Healthstat business unit, and we are proceeding there now in a pilot phase. This relationship builds from our initial work with Healthstat over the previous 2 years, including the use of DexCom CGM in a pilot for health screenings at on-site clinics. Each of these relationships is expanding the pool of customers who can access our technology while generating evidence of the utility of DexCom CGM for the broader type 2 market that we believe will drive access and awareness in the future. 
Beyond these core growth initiatives, our teams continue to advance innovative research and product development that we feel will contribute to long-term growth for DexCom. This includes the hospital market, where we are generating data via our patient registry and receiving great feedback as many hospitals across America continue to take advantage of the FDA's temporary allowance to use DexCom CGM in the inpatient setting during the pandemic. This also includes several clinical studies assessing the use of DexCom CGM for better management of gestational diabetes, a solution that we believe can enhance the outcomes for both the mother and the child. And finally, we continue to access next-generation technologies that we believe can build from the sensor platform that we've established with G6 and G7. We look forward to updating you as we progress. 
With that, I will pass it back to Kevin."

But on the channel mix headwinds that we've been talking about here in the last 6 to 8 quarters or so, is it still fair to be thinking around $200 million, plus or minus, this year? And given the exit rate from 4Q of '20, still fair to think a little bit of that as front-end loaded? And then when I look at your 30% U.S. growth, it would seem like if I ex out the channel headwinds, the pricing headwinds there, volumes must have grown well north of 40%.

The one thing we have talked about, and Kevin referred to it on the call as did I, is that we are going to be a little more aggressive in international markets. And so because of that, we're raising what we call channel mix/pricing headwinds to about $250 million on the year. And that obviously takes into account the aggressive steps we've taken outside the U.S. 
In terms of your question in terms of growth and unit volume, we talked about unit volume approaching 40% on a global basis. When you take the channel mix headwinds we talked about, you are correct.

So maybe just help us understand how some of those initiatives have played out in the early days with respect to the Q1 and early into Q2. And just, are there any metrics? Or is there any sort of goalpost you can help me frame the early execution on those initiatives for us? And how do we think about that as we move through '21?"

I'll take a quick shot at the sampling and then hand it over to Kevin here. There aren't any metrics that we're going to disclose, particularly to sampling, in and of itself, although I will tell you, the early response to this program has been beyond our expectations, both from a physician's perspective of just how easy we've enabled these PCPs to get products into the hands of our patients and then also from a patient perspective when they realize just how easy it is to use the DexCom product. So the sampling program has been beyond what we imagined coming out of the gate. It will continue to be a big part of what we do into the future. But in terms of giving specific metrics around it, that's not something we will do. I will tell you, it's one of the better investments that we look to make at this point."

With respect to the sales force, we've added everybody we were going to add. Everybody's in place. And everybody is getting up to speed. And some of the people came from a diabetes background, so they get it to speed easier because they have relationships already established in these offices, possibly from another company. Others, it's going to take a little while longer, and we plan for that as we do this expansion. But as far as calling on more voices, we are learning that, in all fairness, we've been underserved with respect to our ability to call on people. 
There's a great story we heard from down in Texas. One of our reps called on a physician or -- and talked to them about our product and the doctor said, I know nothing about your product. I've put people on your competitors' product because they come and ask me for it. So again, using the sample program that Quentin described with Hello Dexcom, we put this patient on the system, introduce the physician to it, and now he's prescribing DexCom all the time because of the experience that patient had. We needed a deeper reach. We'll get that deeper reach with what we've done, and we'll continue to evaluate over time. And we've got tremendous metrics on our salespeople. We have an incredible commercial organization that monitors that. But we also very much understand it takes a while to get up to speed. 
The other great thing I can tell you about this expansion, we literally have thousands of people apply for these jobs. And a lot of very, very qualified people that we did not hire. This is a place that people want to work and a product that they really want to represent, and we want to continue that culture and maintain that."

As I called out on the call, the effect of the Super Bowl, the ad was more than just short-term sales growth, in our minds. The awareness we generated, the text messages I was getting during the Super Bowl from industry and technology executives that I've met over the years made it all worth it. I'm just sitting on the couch saying, ""hey, this is really cool."" It really created a lot of awareness for our company, awareness we hadn't had before, and that was really the goal, as we talked about. We developed more brand equity from our ad than anybody else. So that was important to us. The DTC remains important. 
As you watch our ads, you'll see certainly more with Nick and certainly other campaigns as well. And then on top of that, having more feet on the Street is good. We needed it. But it will take time to develop those relationships. I think of the 3, I couldn't quantify one of them, but I think, ultimately, the sales force expansion will be extremely helpful in this.

And so as you think about the customer experience that we're trying to create here, we've been talking about increases in Net Promoter Scores. That's starting to play through and customer utilization have it. So that's certainly something we saw a little bit of.

But there's really 2 components you have to be aware of. We do expect to take on incremental channel mix headwinds in our international markets for the back half of the year. So we have to contemplate that in light of some of the efficiencies you're starting to see. 
And then getting back to the -- our previous discussions about the drivers when we set guidance is, in the back half of the year, it's when we're going to launch G7. And when we launched G7, the yield that you get on some of these lines generally is a little lower. You saw it also happen with our launch of G6. There's a little bit of step back as you start to work out the kinks of these lines and the yields start to play out.

And really, what you're seeing with the pricing decisions today is that we're in a position now where we can pull some of those decisions forward where we couldn't have historically. 
And a lot of that comes down to having inventory available to us, being highly confident in the ability to continue to grow and scale the levels of production as we go into the future. So I'm confident you're going to see terrific results coming out of that international business over time. And with some of these decisions that we've made, we're now opening up access to patient volumes that are 5 or 6x larger than what we were really addressing historically.

I think from our perspective, all that we know right now is kind of the environment we operate within with respect to COVID, which we know from an international perspective has certainly created some incremental pressure in pockets of that business, particularly those that require in clinic visit to get onto the product or some of those administrative hurdles that have been put there. In other channels where we have e-commerce, for example, we're seeing incredible results. And so I think one thing to point out on that first quarter international result is that when you look at it from a 2-year growth perspective, it's an incredibly strong number. Last year was an absolute record growth for us in that first quarter from an international perspective. So I think you got to normalize that when you're looking at that first quarter growth. 
But in terms of the remainder of the year, on an international basis and patient adoption, a big part of stepping price down in line with kind of our global pricing strategy was the fact that we had to see administrative requirements reduced or eliminated altogether to get patients onto the product. And so in these markets where we've done that, the hurdle to get onto the product has been removed. And so we absolutely would expect to see patient -- new patient acquisition become much easier for us and see that start to take off in a very positive way. So I do think you're going to see that uptick over the course of the year, even in the COVID environment with, of course, the caveat being that it kind of stays stable to where it's at today. If we were to get worse in some case, then we might have to think about that differently.

As far as patients slowing their purchases of G6, in particular, in the pharmacy channel, you're buying 1 month of product at a time. So it's not like you're going in there and loading up with 3 to 6 months as we did in the past in the DME channel. And even in the DME channel today, there's less of that loading up by patients with G6 than there was in G5 and G4 prior to that. 
We don't view that, that people will quit purchasing their G6 is when G7 is announced because in all fairness, our customers can't live without it. And when we have the opportunity to take care of them all, what we'll do is organize but as rapid a migration as we possibly can.

But having connectivity into a product like that is something that we're very excited about and believe that they'll have success with, and we'll have success with as well. 
I think with respect to the whole type 2 population and the opportunity there, we couldn't be more bullish on the opportunity that sits in front of us. And I think by the day, we learn more and more that increases that bullishness for us and the confidence that there's going to be some real opportunity there to create value coming from it. And you're going to see a study a little bit later this year, midyear, at some of the midyear society meetings that's going to start to really lay out the benefit of using CGM relative to BGM in this type 2 population, particularly the nonintensive population that just demonstrates the sort of impact we can have on patients who say they're on basal only. And that's a 4 million patient population in the U.S. 
So I think that sort of data starts to really accumulate in favor of opening up a whole another market segment that doubles the existing core U.S. intensive market today that we're very excited about. So you'll see that data here midyear. But I think all of it starts to point to the fact that this type 2 space is going to open up in a significant way, and we're well positioned to take advantage of it."

As far as our outlook on the business going forward, our great quarter fuels our continued belief that best is yet to come. I recently caught up with a friend who's a long-time health care industry executive and the gist of his message to me was very simple. Everything important in diabetes care is going to revolve around CGM. For example, there are numerous instant delivery devices and algorithms available for automated insulin delivery. But there's only one CGM commercially capable of delivering the patient experience and outcomes that we've all envisioned for a very long time. And that's only the beginning. 
There are incredible new compounds, treatments and programs stepping forward for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and we are very confident that the right CGM experience will become an integral part of all these solutions, and we haven't even started talking about the difference we can make as part of our pre-diabetes program. We've never been more excited and engaged in our opportunity than we are today. Thank you again, everyone, and have a great day."

Today, we reported great results for our second quarter with 32% revenue growth for the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2020, as well as solid execution on our key strategic initiatives t",1168,"Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, we reported great results for our second quarter with 32% revenue growth for the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2020, as well as solid execution on our key strategic initiatives that we will discuss throughout the call today. The $143 million in absolute dollar revenue growth compared to the second quarter in 2020, referent the highest quarterly increase in DexCom's history. We continue to believe that we are early in our story with the potential to drive a far greater impact on global health. Our growth performance is closely related to the progress we've made to advance access on our CGM systems for people with diabetes. And because there is often so much misinformation spread about access to DexCom's CGM in the field or the cost of our products for people with diabetes. Let me point out several key points that our investors, clinicians and current and potential customers should know. 
We've advanced pharmacy access in the U.S., where more than 70% of our commercial customers have a monthly out-of-pocket cost of less than $60 per month, and nearly 1/3 of our customers have 0 out-of-pocket costs for their G6 sensors. According to IQVIA, this is less than the comparable out-of-pocket cost for our nearest competitor. The latest research from diabetes market research firm Partners confirms our conclusion, with DexCom having the lowest customer co-pays of the 3 largest CGM suppliers in the U.S. for customers on intensive insulin therapy. We've significantly expanded coverage for people with intensively managed type 2 diabetes, with the overwhelming majority of these patients now having coverage for DexCom CGM in the U.S. We also continue to advocate for equitable access to our CGM supplies for populations that are often underserved. As of July 2021, there are now 43 state Medicaid programs providing coverage for DexCom CGM, including a growing number of states providing access through the pharmacy channel for both type 1 and type 2 intensive users. We are building even more on those advocacy efforts in collaboration with several key nonprofit organizations that support the diabetes community. 
In June, we launched the global movement for time in range to broaden awareness of time and range and its benefits for people with diabetes and their health care providers. And we hope that this collaboration effort will lead to future solutions for improved CGM access. Our teams have taken a leading role to drive the removal of administrative barriers that prevent people with diabetes from accessing the benefits of real-time CGM. Along these lines, we are pleased to see the update from CMS in the second quarter to remove the requirement of at least 4 daily fingersticks for Medicare customers. This will simplify the CGM onboarding process for both customers and clinicians. We've also made solid progress internationally, building from our position of operational strength to advocate for broader reimbursement for G6. This initiative is moving forward according to plan with several geographies publicly announcing enhancements to their coverage of DexCom CGM in the second quarter. 
Despite these developments, a majority of people on mealtime insulin continue to manage their diabetes with fingersticks. Even in the U.S., a leader in CGM adoption, we continue to believe that the type 1 market remains less than 50% penetrated and the type 2 intensive market is less than 25% penetrated. So there remains a great opportunity ahead of us, even in the markets that we currently serve. 
At the same time, we are generating a growing evidence base for the use of DexCom CGM. And at the ATTD and ADA industry conferences in June, we presented exciting research affirming the benefits of our product platform, including the ALERTT1 trial. This randomized controlled trial was simultaneously published in the land set, showing superior health outcomes associated with the use of DexCom CGM relative to our nearest competitor Flash Glucose Monitor. These conferences also featured several presentations on the use of CGM for people of type 2 diabetes, including those not using mealtime insulin, as well as use in women who are pregnant used in the hospital setting and even conclusions applicable to Health and wells using CGM data. 
Perhaps the most significant of these presentations was the long-awaited readout of our MOBILE trial, which was also published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. MOBILE is another rigorous randomized controlled trial assessing the value of DexCom CGM compared to the current standard of care, fingersticks, for people in type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin. Importantly, the study looked at a diverse user base representative of the U.S. population, and it assess these people in the primary care clinical environments were traditionally served. 
So what did we see? We saw clinically significant A1c reductions for users of our DexCom CGM systems. And perhaps even more telling, we saw a 16% time and range increase for the CGM cohort, which is 4 additional hours per day spent in the target glucose range. These were results produced with DexCom CGM and DexCom software. We designed the trial with the goal of changing the standard of care for these basal insulin users, a group that we believe includes between 3 million and 4 million people in the U.S. alone. With these results, we feel that MOBILE and DexCom have the potential to do just that, and our teams look forward to driving better awareness and access based on the study outcomes and the JAMA publication. 
We also made great progress in the second quarter to advance the clinical and regulatory pathway for our next-generation G7 CGM system. At ATTD in June, we provided an update on the performance of G7 drawn from our recent clinical trials. Based on the data shown, we expect that G7 will continue the excellent clinical and real world performance and reliability that we have established with our G6 brand, and it will do so with several factors that we believe will enhance our customer experience, including a fully disposable sensor enhancementer, a redesigned app experience and a market-leading 30-minute wire period. 
Our G7 continues to progress according to our plans. During the second quarter, we concluded our U.S. clinical trial that will support our iCGM filing and our teams have now shifted to processing the data and working toward preparing the regulatory filing. In addition, we've recently submitted G7 for CERC approval. As we previously discussed, we believe that this timing places us on track to begin the G7 launch by the end of 2021. 
These are incredible achievements and advances from the quarter and a nice step forward to fulfill the promise presented by our CGM technology. And this is just the beginning. There are several additional areas of progress that Jereme and Quentin will discuss based on the great work of our teams in the past several months. 
So with that said, let me turn it over to Jereme for a review of our second quarter financial performance. Jereme?"

As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. 
For the second quarter of '21, we reported worldwide revenue of $595 million compared to $452 million for the second quarter of 2020, representing growth of 32% on a reported basis and 30% on a constant currency basis. As Kevin noted, this represents a record for absolute dollar growth in a quarter year-over-year. U.S. revenue totaled $462 million in the second quarter compared to $367 million in the second quarter of 2020, representing growth of 26%. 
Our momentum and market leadership position in the U.S. remains strong, and we have been very encouraged with the continued interest in CGM in the marketplace. With the combination of greater depth in our sales force, solid results from our direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns and expanded ability to allow for patients and clinicians to trial the G6 experience, we are beginning to see preliminary results in our effort to further expand our presence into primary care offices and position the company to extend our customer base. 
International business grew about 58% in the second quarter, totaling $134 million. While the second quarter comp benefited from the impact of COVID on our second quarter 2020 results, we saw good sequential growth momentum as the business once again achieved a new high watermark. The international growth was broad-based across all markets, including core markets like Germany, the U.K., Canada, Australia and the Nordic region. 
Our shift to the pharmacy channel and sales initiatives in the U.S. and our market expansion initiatives internationally are all progressing according to plan, driving high volume growth in both regions. Volume growth for the second quarter came in around the mid-40% range on a global basis. Perhaps the greatest examples of the international effort during the quarter came from Canada, where we saw public announcements of provincial coverage for G6 from 2 of the largest Canadian provinces: Quebec, where coverage of G6 was established for people with type 1 diabetes; and British Columbia, which became the first Canadian province to cover G6 for people with type 1 diabetes and intentionally manage type 2 diabetes. 
These public announcements are representative of our broader strategy to advance access to our technology for people with diabetes. We are leveraging the increasing strength of our operations and driving a meaningful expansion to the total number of patients that we can address via reimbursed pathways. 
Our second quarter gross profit was $47.1 million or 70.1% of revenue compared to 64.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2020. We're very proud of the effort that's gone into these results. The 600 basis points of gross margin expansion is another great validation of the growing efficiencies that we've achieved through product design and efficient manufacturing operations. It is these types of efforts that drive the strategic flexibility to expand our addressable market that I just referenced. 
Operating expenses were $315.6 million for Q2 2021 compared to $213 million for Q2 2020. These results reflect what we previously noted in our discussion of our 2021 plans. We have several areas of investment that we are pursuing, which account for the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales relative to the second quarter of 2020. These include the costs associated with our expanded field sales force, the pivotal trial in support of our USG 7 regulatory submission, the G7 manufacturing scale-up and global direct-to-consumer marketing. 
Our strategic investments have also included our efforts to efficiently scale and lower the cost to serve our customers, as we envision a future in which we serve meaningfully more people than we do today. Our global business services operations in Lithuania and the Philippines are key examples of those initiatives that are driving great customer service while leveraging our G&A spend. 
Operating income was $101.5 million or 17.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $76.7 million or 17% of revenue in the same quarter of 2020. The 10 basis point year-over-year improvement was driven by strong improvements to our gross margin, resulting from the design of our products and the manufacturing efficiencies that come there through. These improvements more than offset the strategic investments that we've made during the year. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $156.6 million or 26.3% of revenue for the second quarter compared to $122.6 million or 27.1% of revenue for the second quarter of 2020. Net income for the second quarter was $75.4 million or $0.76 per share. 
We remain in a great financial position, closing the second quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and great financial flexibility to drive our strategic initiatives. 
Turning to guidance. We continue to expect solid volume growth across all of our regions in the back half of the year with momentum driven by growing CGM awareness globally. Based on our second quarter performance, we are pleased to be in a position to once again raise our full year 2021 revenue guidance. We now expect 2021 revenue to be between $2.35 billion to $2.4 billion, representing growth of 22% to 25% over 2020. This increase comes on top of our expectations for approximately $10 million of unfavorable currency impact in the back half relative to prior guidance. This revenue increase is primarily a reflection of our continued growth momentum as well as the ongoing impact of our channel mix and international access expansion strategies. 
We will see a greater revenue per patient impact to our existing base from our international access initiatives in the second half of the year, but we continue to expect the incremental volume driven by these efforts to offset those pressures in our base this year alone. More importantly, this will leave us in a much better position in the years to come. 
Turning to margins. We are increasing our full year 2021 targets. This includes non-GAAP results to be approximately at the following levels: Gross profit margins of approximately 67%, operating margins of approximately 14% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 24%. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Quentin for a scale and strategy update."

As Kevin and Jereme indicated, we made great progress on our key strategic initiatives during the second quarter. It is hard not to be excited about the market potential for CGM after seeing the depth of research using DexCom technology at the recent ATDD and ADA industry conferences. We saw well over a dozen presentations from DexCom's insulin delivery partners, highlighting the clinical utility of their DexCom integrated systems, in DexCom's leadership in the field of interoperable solutions. 
Outside of the MOBILE and ALERTT publications that Kevin mentioned, we also saw several presentations from our DexCom team members as well as independent investigators with outcomes that are very promising for the continued growth of DexCom CGM. In one study presented by our health economics team, we looked at real world evidence, documenting the cost savings for a significant number of patients with type 2 diabetes using G6, including both the intensive insulin therapy and those who are not treated with meal-time insulin. The results were compelling with the magnitude of cost savings generated for the G6 users being nearly identical to the cost savings we've seen in several of our other pilots. This is yet another data point supporting eco benefits associated with the better glucose control for our customers, and we are excited to leverage this growing evidence base into broader access for people with diabetes around the world. 
We also continue to nova our software solutions to enable differentiated user experiences that meet the needs of the diverse customer bases that we serve. Most recently, in mid-July, we received FDA clearance on a real-time API software solution. This is, to our knowledge, one of the first, if not the first real-time API clearance in the medical device sector that enables integration with third-party apps. As many of you likely know, prior to the clearance of our real-time API, our various digital health partners were limited to the display of CGM data on a 3-hour delayed basis through our retrospective API. With this new API, partners who are now invited by DexCom have the ability to integrate real-time DexCom CGM data into the respective apps and devices. This is another great win for our customers, who will now benefit from the ability to see real-time glucose levels in a variety of new displays according to their needs. At the time of the approval, we announced [indiscernible] for Diabetes program as early users of the new API solution. In addition, WellDoc and UnitedHealthcare's Level 2 are also utilizing our real-time connectivity solutions and their integrated offerings. This is an exciting innovation for us and an example of how we are leveraging our leadership in software connectivity to advance our market position in the growing digital health landscape. 
On the commercial front, we remain well positioned to drive growth in broader DexCom market penetration in several locations. In addition to the significant access expansion efforts that we began to implement last quarter to enable multiples of growth in our core markets, we are growing our presence in locations that are relatively new to our team. This includes Japan, where we've recently sent our first shipment of G6 systems to our local distributor. Although we have had a minor presence in Japan through the use of our G4 professional CGM, these G6 systems represent the expanded use of our product to serve people with diabetes with our core ambulatory solution. We are incredibly excited to bring our CGM technology to empower people with diabetes in Japan, and look forward to developing that as a nice growth market for DexCom. 
In addition to the strong G7 performance data showed at ATTD in the clinical and regulatory updates that Kevin provided, our operations team is continuing according to plan in our G7 manufacturing development and scaling efforts. We have automated lines producing G7 product as we speak, with a steadiness of additional lines scheduled to be delivered through the back half of this year and throughout 2022. In addition, the vendors in our supply chain are scaling up G7 capabilities alongside us as we sit here today. We will take what we have learned from these automated lines at San Diego and Mesa and use them to quickly replicate and scale in our new manufacturing facility in Malaysia. As we've said before, this effort will be critical to our ability to serve significant customer populations that we think can benefit from our CGM technology, giving us a clear runway to produce more than 200 million sensors per year and a much stronger presence in a key growth region for us. 
Our team is doing a great job to advance our efforts in what continues to be a challenging environment to navigate because of the impact of the pandemic globally. We are currently building out the manufacturing facility while also scaling our supply chain, putting us on track to be ready for production in 2022. As you can see from our 70% gross margin this quarter, we're making this progress on G7, while also advancing our efforts towards operational excellence, resulting in even greater improvements in efficiencies to our G6 manufacturing, procurement and distribution capabilities. 
Overall, as I think Kevin and Jereme would agree, we are very proud of the work of our teams to execute on the ambitious plans that we set forth in 2021. 
With that, I'll pass the call back to Kevin."

To be honest with you, I don't think we've seen the benefit yet of the increased access that we spoke to really back in the first quarter. And the team has made incredible progress and working with the payers and negotiating these contracts. I'd say we're through 90% or so of those all landing in favorable positions where we probably increased or improved access for nearly 1 million patients in the first half of the year alone in the OUS business. But the reality is that benefit is not going to show up until the back half of the year.

To your point on the international incremental headwinds about the access for price conversation,  that has started. It is back half loaded. We certainly will have some of those in the first half of next year as we anniversary some of those contracts. So the $250 million we talked about was really the impact on 2021.

So we'll monitor that very closely. That's a really good question and something we think about a lot here."

So we're continuing to see record new patient adds. No doubt in many ways driven by the work we're doing around DTC and sales force as well as samples. So I think you've got certainly a data point that's helpful. The other piece is, over the past 18 months, we've doubled the active prescribers of our product. And no doubt, as we get out and we get into the field and see endocrinologists, but also primary care physicians, the work we're doing around expanding that access has yielded really incredible benefits for the amount of prescribers that are out there that are: one, aware; and two, prescribing our product. I think those 2 things are just clear indications of the investments we're making in the awareness, in the DTC, in the sales force is paying off. And hopefully, that gives you some context, of course, looking at the quarter's revenue performance also helps as well. So those all data points, I think, really give you some color as to why we think it's still an incredible investment and why we think the returns still are some of the best in the business."

Does some of that plays through -- we'll have a little bit of pressure on margin. The other one is the launch of G7. When we launched G7, those lines won't be at full capacity, and then we'll be at full yield. Just like when we launched G6 and we launched some of the automation around G6, it took a little bit of time to work through some of the kinks on these automated lines. And while we still expect incredible output right out the gate, that's going to cost us a little bit more. And so I think what you're seeing is some of the international access, but then when we launched G7 and those lines start to appreciate, the cost of producing those in that shorter period are going to be a little bit higher. To your question is that transitory, all the work that the team is doing around the capability of manufacturing at high capacity as well as high yields, all of that will bounce back and play through. And if this quarter is any demonstration of how good they are, you can see the margins that you see this quarter have shown that this team does an incredible job of yielding out these lines over time. And we expect that to turn around with G7 into the future. But there will be some time as we launch G7 as we get those lines up and running, where there will be a little bit of weight just similar to what we had with G6 that we're going to have to navigate through. But again, I think we're still super bullish on the capability, and we're super proud of the team and really expecting that team to do incredible job as we launch G7."

So -- we'll have G7 in both locations over time, going to give us an opportunity to produce north of 200 million sensors altogether. And when you think about the distribution of those sensors and where they're going, both in the U.S. and internationally speaking, I think it makes a lot of sense to continue to have a capability here in the States as well in Malaysia, particularly when you start to look at the logistical distribution costs associated with moving that product around the volumes that we're talking. So it will exist in both locations. I do think over time, the lower cost profile will come out of that Malaysia business.

Today, we reported great results for our second quarter with 32% revenue growth for the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2020, as well as solid execution on our key strategic initiatives that we will discuss throughout the call today. The $143 million in absolute dollar revenue growth compared to the second quarter in 2020 represents the highest quarterly increase in DexCom's history. We continue to believe that we are early in our story with the potential to drive a far greater impact on global health.
Our growth performance is closely related to the progress we've made to advance access on our CGM systems for people with diabetes. And because there is often so much misinformation spread about access to DexCom's CGM in the field, while the cost of our products for people with diabetes. Let me point out several key points that our investors, clinicians and current and potential customers should know. We've advanced pharmacy access in the U.S., where more than 70% of our commercial customers have a monthly out-of-pocket cost of less than $60 per month, and nearly 1/3 of our customers have 0 out-of-pocket costs for their G6 sensors.
According to IQVIA, this is less than the comparable out-of-pocket cost for our nearest competitor. The latest research from diabetes market research firm, Seagrove Partners, confirms our conclusion. With DexCom having the lowest customer co-pays of the 3 largest CGM suppliers in the U.S. for customers on intensive insulin therapy, we've significantly expanded coverage for people with intensively managed type 2 diabetes, with the overwhelming majority of these patients now having coverage for DexCom CGM in the U.S.
We also continue to advocate for equitable access to our CGM supplies for populations that are often underserved. As of July 2021, there are now 43 State Medicaid programs providing coverage for DexCom CGM, including a growing number of states providing access through their pharmacy channel for both type 1 and type 2 intensive users. We are building even more on those advocacy efforts in collaboration with several key nonprofit organizations that support the diabetes community.
In June, we launched the global movement for time and range to broaden awareness of time and range and its benefits for people with diabetes and their health care providers. And we hope that this collaboration effort will lead to future solutions for improved CGM access. Our teams have taken a leading role to drive the removal of administrative barriers that prevent people with diabetes from accessing the benefits of real-time CGM. Along these lines, we are pleased to see the update from CMS in the second quarter to remove the requirement of at least 4 daily finger sticks for Medicare customers. This will simplify the CGM onboarding process for both customers and clinicians. We've also made solid progress internationally, building from our position of operational strength to advocate for broader reimbursement for G6. This initiative is moving forward according to plan with several geographies publicly announcing enhancements to their coverage of DexCom CGM in the second quarter.
Despite these developments, a majority of people on mealtime insulin continue to manage their diabetes with finger sticks. Even in the U.S., a leader in CGM adoption, we continue to believe that the type 1 market remains less than 50% penetrated and the type 2 intensive market is less than 25% penetrated. So there remains a great opportunity ahead of us, even in the markets that we currently serve.
At the same time, we are generating a growing evidence base for the use of DexCom CGM. And at the ATTD and ADA industry conferences in June, we presented exciting research affirming the benefits of our product platform, including the ALERTT1 trial. This randomized controlled trial was simultaneously published in the Lancet, showing superior health outcomes associated with the use of DexCom CGM relative to our nearest competitor, Flash Glucose Monitor. These conferences also featured several presentations on the use of CGM for people of type 2 diabetes, including those not using mealtime insulin as well as use in women who are pregnant used in the hospital setting and even conclusions applicable to health and wellness using CGM data.
Perhaps the most significant of these presentations was the long-awaited readout of our MOBILE trial, which was also published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. MOBILE is another rigorous randomized controlled trial assessing the value of DexCom CGM compared to the current standard of care, finger sticks, for people of type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin. Importantly, the study looked at a diverse user base representative of the U.S. population, and it assess these people in a primary care clinical environments where they are traditionally served.
So what did we see? We saw clinically significant A1c reductions for users of our DexCom CGM systems. And perhaps even more telling, we saw a 16% time and range increase for the CGM cohort, which is 4 additional hours per day spent in the target glucose range. These were results produced with DexCom CGM and DexCom software. We designed the trial with the goal of changing the standard of care for these basal insulin users, a group that we believe includes between 3 million and 4 million people in the U.S. alone. With these results, we feel that MOBILE and DexCom have the potential to do just that, and our teams look forward to driving better awareness and access based on the study outcomes and the JAMA publication.
We also made great progress in the second quarter to advance the clinical and regulatory pathway for our next-generation G7 CGM system. At ATTD in June, we provided an update on the performance of G7 drawn from our recent clinical trials. Based on the data shown, we expect that G7 will continue the excellent clinical and real world performance and reliability that we have established with our G6 brand. And it will do so with several factors that we believe will enhance our customer experience, including a fully disposable sensor and transmitter, a redesigned app experience and a market-leading 30-minute warmup period.
Our G7 continues to progress according to our plans. During the second quarter, we concluded our U.S. clinical trial that will support our iCGM filing and our teams have now shifted to processing the data and working toward preparing the regulatory filing. In addition, we've recently submitted G7 for CE Mark approval. As we previously discussed, we believe that this timing places us on track to begin the G7 launch by the end of 2021.
These are incredible achievements and advances from the quarter and a nice step forward to fulfill the promise presented by our CGM technology. And this is just the beginning. There are several additional areas of progress that Jereme and Quentin will discuss based on the great work of our teams in the past several months.
So with that said, let me turn it over to Jereme for a review of our second quarter financial performance. Jereme?"

As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis.

As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website.
For the second quarter of 2021, we reported worldwide revenue of $595 million compared to $452 million for the second quarter of 2020, representing growth of 32% on a reported basis and 30% on a constant currency basis. As Kevin noted, this represents a record for absolute dollar growth in a quarter year-over-year. U.S. revenue totaled $462 million in the second quarter compared to $367 million in the second quarter of 2020, representing growth of 26%.
Our momentum and market leadership position in the U.S. remains strong, and we have been very encouraged with the continued interest in CGM in the marketplace. With the combination of greater depth in our sales force, solid results from our direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns and expanded ability to allow for patients and clinicians to trial the G6 experience, we are beginning to see preliminary results in our effort to further expand our presence into primary care offices and position the company to extend our customer base.
International business grew about 58% in the second quarter, totaling $134 million. While the second quarter comp benefited from the impact of COVID on our second quarter 2020 results, we saw good sequential growth momentum as the business once again achieved a new high watermark. The international growth was broad-based across all markets, including core markets like Germany, the U.K., Canada, Australia and the Nordic region.
Our shift to the pharmacy channel and sales initiatives in the U.S. and our market expansion initiatives internationally are all progressing according to plan, driving high volume growth in both regions. Volume growth for the second quarter came in around the mid-40% range on a global basis. Perhaps the greatest examples of the international effort during the quarter came from Canada, where we saw public announcements of provincial coverage for G6 from 2 of the largest Canadian provinces: Quebec, where coverage of G6 was established for people with type 1 diabetes; and British Columbia, which became the first Canadian province to cover G6 for people with type 1 diabetes and intentionally manage type 2 diabetes.
These public announcements are representative of our broader strategy to advance access to our technology for people with diabetes. We are leveraging the increasing strength of our operations and driving a meaningful expansion to the total number of patients that we can address via reimbursed pathways.
Our second quarter gross profit was $417.1 million or 70.1% of revenue compared to 64.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2020. We're very proud of the effort that's gone into these results. The 600 basis points of gross margin expansion is another great validation of the growing efficiencies that we've achieved through product design and efficient manufacturing operations. It is these types of efforts that drive the strategic flexibility to expand our addressable market that I just referenced.
Operating expenses were $315.6 million for Q2 2021 compared to $213 million for Q2 2020. These results reflect what we previously noted in our discussion of our 2021 plans. We have several areas of investment that we are pursuing, which account for the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales relative to the second quarter of 2020. These include the costs associated with our expanded field sales force, the pivotal trial in support of our U.S. G7 regulatory submission, the G7 manufacturing scale-up and global direct-to-consumer marketing.
Our strategic investments have also included our efforts to efficiently scale and lower the cost to serve our customers as we envision a future in which we serve meaningfully more people than we do today. Our global business services operations in Lithuania and the Philippines are key examples of those initiatives that are driving great customer service while leveraging our G&A spend.
Operating income was $101.5 million or 17.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $76.7 million or 17% of revenue in the same quarter of 2020. The 10 basis point year-over-year improvement was driven by strong improvements to our gross margin, resulting from the design of our products and the manufacturing efficiencies that come there through. These improvements more than offset the strategic investments that we've made during the year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $156.6 million or 26.3% of revenue for the second quarter compared to $122.6 million or 27.1% of revenue for the second quarter of 2020. Net income for the second quarter was $75.4 million or $0.76 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the second quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and great financial flexibility to drive our strategic initiatives.
Turning to guidance. We continue to expect solid volume growth across all of our regions in the back half of the year with momentum driven by growing CGM awareness globally. Based on our second quarter performance, we are pleased to be in a position to once again raise our full year 2021 revenue guidance. We now expect 2021 revenue to be between $2.35 billion to $2.4 billion, representing growth of 22% to 25% over 2020. This increase comes on top of our expectations for approximately $10 million of unfavorable currency impact in the back half relative to prior guidance. This revenue increase is primarily a reflection of our continued growth momentum as well as the ongoing impact of our channel mix and international access expansion strategies.
We will see a greater revenue per patient impact to our existing base from our international access initiatives in the second half of the year, but we continue to expect the incremental volume driven by these efforts to offset those pressures in our base this year alone. More importantly, this will leave us in a much better position in the years to come.
Turning to margins. We are increasing our full year 2021 targets. This includes non-GAAP results to be approximately at the following levels: gross profit margins of approximately 67%, operating margins of approximately 14% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 24%.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Quentin for a scale and strategy update."

As Kevin and Jereme indicated, we made great progress on our key strategic initiatives during the second quarter. It is hard not to be excited about the market potential for CGM after seeing the depth of research using DexCom technology at the recent ATTD and ADA industry conferences. We saw well over a dozen presentations from DexCom's insulin delivery partners, highlighting the clinical utility of their DexCom integrated systems and DexCom's leadership in the field of interoperable solutions.
Outside of the MOBILE and ALERTT publications that Kevin mentioned, we also saw several presentations from our DexCom team members as well as independent investigators with outcomes that are very promising for the continued growth of DexCom CGM. In one study presented by our health economics team, we looked at real world evidence, documenting the cost savings for a significant number of patients with type 2 diabetes using G6, including both the intensive insulin therapy and those who are not treated with mealtime insulin. The results were compelling with the magnitude of cost savings generated for the G6 users being nearly identical to the cost savings we've seen in several of our other pilots. This is yet another data point supporting economic benefits associated with the better glucose control for our customers, and we are excited to leverage this growing evidence base into broader access for people with diabetes around the world.
We also continue to innovate our software solutions to enable differentiated user experiences that meet the needs of the diverse customer bases that we serve. Most recently, in mid-July, we received FDA clearance on a real-time API software solution. This is, to our knowledge, one of the first, if not the first real-time API clearance in the medical device sector that enables integration with third-party apps. As many of you likely know, prior to the clearance of our real-time API, our various digital health partners were limited to the display of CGM data on a 3-hour delayed basis through our retrospective API. With this new API, partners who are now invited by DexCom have the ability to integrate real-time DexCom CGM data into the respective apps and devices. This is another great win for our customers, who will now benefit from the ability to see real-time glucose levels in a variety of new displays according to their needs.
At the time of the approval, we announced Garmin and Teladoc Health Livongo for diabetes program as early users of the new API solution. In addition, Welldoc and UnitedHealthcare's Level2 are also utilizing our real-time connectivity solutions and their integrated offerings. This is an exciting innovation for us and an example of how we are leveraging our leadership in software connectivity to advance our market position in the growing digital health landscape.
On the commercial front, we remain well positioned to drive growth in broader DexCom market penetration in several locations. In addition to the significant access expansion efforts that we began to implement last quarter to enable multiples of growth in our core markets, we are growing our presence in locations that are relatively new to our team. This includes Japan, where we've recently sent our first shipment of G6 systems to our local distributor. Although we have had a minor presence in Japan through the use of our G4 professional CGM, these G6 systems represent the expanded use of our product to serve people with diabetes with our core ambulatory solution. We are incredibly excited to bring our CGM technology to empower people with diabetes in Japan and look forward to developing that as a nice growth market for DexCom.
In addition to the strong G7 performance data showed at ATTD in the clinical and regulatory updates that Kevin provided, our operations team is continuing according to plan in our G7 manufacturing development and scaling efforts. We have automated lines producing G7 product as we speak, with a steady cadence of additional lines scheduled to be delivered through the back half of this year and throughout 2022.
In addition, the vendors in our supply chain are scaling up G7 capabilities alongside us as we sit here today. We will take what we have learned from these automated lines in San Diego and Mesa and use them to quickly replicate and scale in our new manufacturing facility in Malaysia. As we've said before, this effort will be critical to our ability to serve significant customer populations that we think can benefit from our CGM technology, giving us a clear runway to produce more than 200 million sensors per year and a much stronger presence in a key growth region for us.
Our team is doing a great job to advance our efforts in what continues to be a challenging environment to navigate because of the impact of the pandemic globally. We are currently building out the manufacturing facility while also scaling our supply chain, putting us on track to be ready for production in 2022. As you can see from our 70% gross margin this quarter, we're making this progress on G7, while also advancing our efforts towards operational excellence, resulting in even greater improvements in efficiencies to our G6 manufacturing, procurement and distribution capabilities.
Overall, as I think Kevin and Jereme would agree, we are very proud of the work of our teams to execute on the ambitious plans that we set forth in 2021.
With that, I'll pass the call back to Kevin."

We will make sure that we deliver that file in a very pristine manner. We hear a lot of things about FDA delays and things of that nature. We don't want to create any delays.

And the team has made incredible progress and working with the payers and negotiating these contracts, I'd say we're through 90% or so of those all landing in favorable positions where we probably increased or improved access for nearly 1 million patients in the first half of the year alone in that OUS business. But the reality is that benefit is not going to show up until the back half of the year.

And so the $200 million on what we call the original shift mix primarily in the U.S. is still the same. And in the second quarter, it came in a little bit lighter than the first quarter, but generally in line. And so I think we're seeing that stable. And we talked about it at the beginning of year being pretty stable throughout the course of the year.
To your point on the international incremental headwinds about the access for price conversation, that has started. It is back half loaded. We certainly will have some of those in the first half of next year as we anniversary some of those contracts. So the $250 million we talked about was really the impact on 2021. And so you'll see the $50 million in the back half of the year. There will be a little of that into 2022. We'll go into that in the future, but that will happen over a 12-month period."

So we've certainly raised it and passed through some of that for the balance of the year.
As we think about the back half of the year, we simply don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We talked about the impact, and you pointed out the international access, but there still is COVID out there and the delta variant is out there. And so rather than increase it and get bullish and get ahead of ourselves, we want to see how it plays through for the balance of the year. We do hear instances out there outside the U.S. where primary care physicians are taking their practice and ultimately using their time to administer vaccinations. While we've done a great job navigating through those thus far this year, we do want to be prudent and make sure that we are contemplating.

And we expect the same to happen this year. So I think that will help you at least think about Q3 and the balance of the year. We do expect Q4 to have less of a weighting you saw in Q1 as a result of the move to the pharmacy where the year gets a little bit less seasonal. I think you'll expect the same in Q4, where you don't have folks in the DME channel rushing to meet benefits. So I do think you'll see, as we've talked about before, as we make more and more moves to the pharmacy, less heavy weighting on Q4 and less light weighting on Q1 and start to move out of that seasonality.

But look, we're in the midst of evaluating a lot of different potential business models. As you look at the whole type 2 non-intensive space as it opens up, we're looking at the international business continue to expand in a significant way. Pharmacy access continues to grow. All of these things are going to continue to put a bit of pressure on the gross margin profile. But if you saw the way that we were able to take cost out of the product from a design perspective and improve the process efficiencies around manufacturing this, your confidence level only increases and where we can keep that gross margin over time.
So we're incredibly excited by what we're seeing. A lot of that doesn't contemplate the fact that over time, you probably see us move into a 15-day where cycle on the product itself, and so there's significant benefits that come there also. So again, a bit back to Jereme's point earlier, this is not an area that we're going to get ahead of ourselves, but we feel like we have the flexibility we need to really get after the market opportunities that present themselves and still deliver a very attractive gross margin profile in this business."

We want to provide as much input to these tools as we possibly can and work with as many partners as possible.
I think from the very beginning, we've always had a bit of a different approach to the value of information, data and software, in particular. And what you're seeing play out right now is part of that vision that we've had there and the approval of the real-time API. We've invested heavily in the ability to produce this capability. We understand the importance of interoperability, the importance of putting information in the hands of the patients. That's who DexCom is. And you're going to continue to see us invest in that area and really use it as a differentiator.
In terms of how that evolves into the future and is there opportunity to create value in that monetization of the data stream or the real-time API. Those are all things we'll evaluate over time. That's not our strategy today. Today, it's all about improving outcomes for patients that's going to show up in the way of incremental sensor sales over time, and we're very happy with that approach.

We believe we'll have a market for G6 for quite some time. While we're going to do a global launch and go very quickly, there will be places where G7 isn't going to be available immediately. Our partners are going to take a while to catch up on the automated insulin delivery side. We're working with them now on G7, but we've got -- we've still got some G6 room to grow there. And there are some countries where we aren't yet or some geographies where we need to get started, where we can offer G6 in those areas while we sell G7 and others.
So we are planning this. It's one of our areas of great debate, and I think we'll manage as best we can. We won't be bashful about taking down G6 lines if G7 is ready to go and is the home run we think it's going to be.

The other piece is, over the past 18 months, we've doubled the active prescribers of our product. And no doubt, as we get out and get into the field and see endocrinologists, but also primary care physicians, the work we're doing around expanding that access has yielded really incredible benefits for the amount of prescribers that are out there that are: one, aware; and two, prescribing our product. I think those 2 things are just clear indications of the investments we're making in the awareness, in the DTC, in the sales force is paying off.

Just like when we launched G6 and we launched some of the automation around G6, it took a little bit of time to work through some of the kinks on these automated lines. And while we still expect incredible output right out the gate, that's going to cost us a little bit more. And so I think what you're seeing is some of the international access, but then when we launched G7 and those lines start to appreciate, the cost of producing those in that shorter period are going to be a little bit higher.
To your question is that transitory, all the work that the team is doing around the capability of manufacturing at high capacity as well as high yields, all of that will bounce back and play through. And if this quarter is any demonstration of how good they are, you can see the margins that you see this quarter have shown that this team does an incredible job of yielding out these lines over time. And we expect that to turn around with G7 into the future. But there will be some time as we launch G7 as we get those lines up and running, where there will be a little bit of weight just similar to what we had with G6 that we're going to have to navigate through.

With respect to Malaysia, it will not be exclusive -- G7 will not be exclusive to that location. We will start with G7 here in the States, both in San Diego and Mesa. As a matter of fact, lines are there as we speak, and we'll continue to ramp up there into the back part of this year and into next year as well. As Malaysia comes online and the buildings up out of the ground, and we validated the clean room and the capability there, we'll begin to build out the G7 capability there as well. So we'll have G7 in both locations over time, that's going to give us an opportunity to produce north of 200 million sensors altogether.
And when you think about the distribution of those sensors and where they're going, both in the U.S. and internationally speaking, I think it makes a lot of sense to continue to have a capability here in the States as well in Malaysia, particularly when you start to look at the logistical distribution costs associated with moving that product around in the volumes that we're talking. So it will exist in both locations. I do think over time, the lower cost profile will come out of that Malaysia business. That's a big part of the value proposition there, but that's going to let us serve a lot of those international markets very effectively and efficiently."

I think the best thing I can talk about with Tandem is just a recent story. I got to know it on my computer, somebody wanted to give me a Facebook message, and it was a person who told me he spent 22 years on Medtronic systems and is now on Tandem Control-IQ with DexCom and he has never been healthier, never had a lower A1c, never had better -- he said my whole life has changed. He goes, this system is amazing. So we believe the integrated systems driven by DexCom sensors are game changers. People get accurate sensor information that can take these sophisticated algorithms and make proper decisions. We're very bullish and optimistic on the -- on both of these opportunities going forward. Very excited."

Today, we reported another strong quarter for DexCom with third quarter revenue growth of 30% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and 28% growth on an organic basis. This revenue growth rate represents continued momentum from DexCom CGM adoption around the world, as we once again achieved a record quarter of new customer growth. The third quarter also saw several strategic accomplishments across our teams that lay the foundation for our future growth opportunities. In the U.S., we received FDA clearance for 2 key software solutions that continue to differentiate our connected products from those of our competitors and position us as a partner of choice across a health care and wearables ecosystem. 
First, in July, we received FDA clearance for our real-time API. For those of you who are unaware, and API is the tool that allows 1 app to connect with another app. Prior to this clearance, our customers and clinicians could only utilize our retrospective API, which integrated DexCom data into third-party apps on a 3-hour delayed basis. We believe that by putting the power of choice at our users' fingertips with real-time data, we can help use the daily burden of diabetes management and significantly improved quality of life for our customers. This tool will be available to partners invited by DexCom, and we already have several that have begun the development process to enable real-time displays for their communities. This includes Garmin, which became the first partner to launch apps connected to our real-time API 2 weeks ago, bringing DexCom readings into their portfolio of wearables and cycling computers. Second, on the heels of the real-time API clearance, we received FDA clearance in August for the DexCom app, an app module. This module was specifically designed for people with nonintensive type 2 diabetes and can directly integrate into another third-party health care app. With the integrated DexCom app, it is now even easier for our partners to access and display our CGM data, enabling single app solutions that simplify the experiences for DexCom users. 
UnitedHealth Group became our first partner to launch the integrated DexCom app in app module in late September, bringing the embedded app into their Level 2 diabetes care program. Our connectivity, software and data infrastructure solutions are our core strength of DexCom. These 2 recent FDA clearances reflect the increased investment that we put into software development and we believe increase our competitive advantages moving forward. In late September, we also announced the launch of DexCom 1 in 4 international markets where we previously had no presence. Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. 
DexCom 1 leverages the G6 hardware platform and a completely redesigned software experience that focuses on simplicity, and ease of use for our customers. This is the first product launch in our history that started exclusively through the DexCom e-commerce platform, a platform that has been embraced by our customers in Canada and the U.K. over the past 2 years. with the proven performance of our CGM systems, the new software experience and efficient e-commerce solution and affordable pricing plans, we believe that DexCom 1 will be an important product for us as we drive the business toward our long-term targets. Most importantly, this differentiated product is a key step for us to bring DexCom CGM to significantly more people with diabetes who previously did not have access to our products. Early feedback around the product has been very favorable, and we look forward to seeing the full results from these launches as we leverage the full breadth of our expanding product portfolio to achieve our 2020 Investor Day goal of tripling our international addressable market by the end of 2023. 
Building from the strength of our mobile trial that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in June, investigators published the results from the extension phase of the trial in diabetes care during the third quarter. In this extension phase, we rerandomized the population who are initially on CGM to see if the benefits would be retained for those who stayed on CGM compared to those who returned to fingerstick monitoring. Once again, the results were clear. Those who stayed on our G6 systems maintain greater time and range improvements over the 6-month extension phase compared to those who did not. The results confirmed that for the significant population of people with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin, there is significant benefit in continuous CGM use to optimize therapy and support behavior modifications. Our teams are working hard to leverage the conclusions from mobile into greater access to our technology for people with type 2 diabetes. And this is just 1 area in which we are building the foundation for our long-term growth. 
We are advancing our pilot efforts with UnitedHealth Level 2, Teladoc Livongo for Diabetes, Welldoc, Onduo and others. We are generating strong clinical evidence for expanded indications for CGM use in inpatient settings and for women who are pregnant. We continue to leverage our advantages in connectivity by gaining new customers and progressing our pipeline of solutions with our leading insulin delivery partners. 
Finally, we continue to advance our G7 scale-up and regulatory efforts during the quarter. We've had excellent communication with our notified body in Europe and believe that we remain on track to begin the launch of our G7 system in the fourth quarter upon receiving CE Mark clearance. In the U.S., we've made great progress in preparation for our regulatory submission. I believe that we are now in the final stages of that effort. We look forward to the comprehensive G7 510(k) submission, including G7 hardware and full Android and iOS software to the FDA in the next few weeks. As you can see, our teams are working very hard and making great progress to advance our core strategic efforts, whether it is in expanding our product portfolio, creating differentiated user experiences or laying the foundation for new market opportunities that will drive our future growth. 
So with that said, let me turn it over now to Jereme for a review of our third quarter financial performance. Jereme?"
114039,1684352479,2416632,"DexCom, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","DexCom, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the third quarter of 2",1020,"Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported worldwide revenue of $650 million compared to $501 million for the third quarter of 2020, representing growth of 30% on a reported basis and 28% on an organic basis. In late July, we were proud to complete the acquisition of our distributor in Australia and New Zealand. With this acquisition, we began generating revenue for certain non-CGM health care products, which we have categorized as inorganic growth for the quarter. This non-CGM distribution revenue contributed approximately 2% to our reported growth for the third quarter. 
The transition from distributor markets to direct sales is 1 of several important strategic initiatives that we outlined at our 2020 Investor Day as we seek to significantly grow our international presence. We believe a larger direct international footprint will give us greater control to leverage our marketing strength, invest in accelerating our growth and ensure that the direction of these core markets is aligned to our strategic interest. 
In terms of the financial impact of the third quarter acquisition, we expect the transaction to be approximately neutral to our operating margin for the full year as it was in the third quarter. U.S. revenue totaled $490 million in the third quarter compared to $399 million in the third quarter of 2020, representing growth of 23%. We continue to see good momentum in the U.S. where we are benefiting from the increased market access and field presence that we've enabled over the past year. New customer growth remains strong across all segments of the population including people with type 1 diabetes, intensively manage people with type 2 diabetes where we have significantly expanded market access in the past year and even early adopters in the type 2 non-intensive population. 
Our international business grew 57% in the third quarter, totaling $161 million. Excluding the impact of non-CGM distribution revenue generated by our acquisition of our distributor in Australia and New Zealand, Growth for our international business was 46% in the third quarter. We continue to see very encouraging growth across the board in our international markets with the majority of our markets delivering record sales in the third quarter. Although it is still early, we believe that our strategic moves to broaden access in several markets have been very successful thus far and have left us well positioned to expand our growth profile internationally, and you see that in the reflected current quarter results. 
Along those lines, our global volume growth in the third quarter remained strong, exceeding 40% for the quarter. This is well above our 28% organic revenue growth rate and supports the momentum behind DexCom CGM globally, as we aggressively seek to advance access to our technology and drive better health outcomes and quality of life for people with diabetes. 
As Kevin mentioned, the launch of DexCom 1 adds to our product portfolio and provides another key element of our strategy to expand access to CGM globally. As we continue to scale our business in conjunction with our ambitious plans for customer growth, we are creating tools that allow us to serve our growing base in an efficient manner, and the use of our e-commerce platform for the initial DexCom 1 launch is a good example of that focus. 
Our third quarter gross profit was $446.9 million or 68.7% of revenue compared to 68% of revenue in the third quarter of 2020. The year-over-year gross margin expansion is an impressive result, especially when you factor in our strategic efforts this year to drive greater mix to the pharmacy channel and expanded international access. This is a credit to our teams who have innovated and embrace change where necessary to drive efficiencies and position us to maximize our strategic opportunities. We continue to demonstrate the ability to leverage both our manufacturing operations and R&D teams to be ever more efficient in the delivery of our products. Operating expenses were $323.1 million for Q3 2021 compared to $245.7 million in Q3 2020. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat year-over-year as we offset investments in software development, G7 scale-up and our expanded global commercial sales force with strong leverage of our general and administrative functions. Operating income was $123.8 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $95 million in the same quarter of 2020, holding flat 19% of revenue. As this result indicates we've been able to retain much of our operating margin this year even as we have significantly reinvested in our business. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $173.5 million or 26.7% of revenue for the third quarter compared to $146.9 million or 29.3% of revenue for the third quarter of 2020. Net income for the third quarter was $89.5 million or $0.89 per share. We closed the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, giving us great financial flexibility to drive our strategic initiatives. This includes the continued build-out of our manufacturing facility in Malaysia and G7 scale-up in Mesa, Arizona as well as opportunities that are lying on our business objectives, such as our recent distributor acquisition. 
Turning to guidance. Our third quarter performance has placed us in a position to once again raise our full year 2021 outlook for revenue and margins as we look to wrap up another excellent year. We now expect 2021 revenue to be between $2.425 billion and $2.450 billion, representing growth of 26% to 27% over 2020. This guidance includes approximately 100 basis points of non-CGM inorganic growth related to our recent distributor acquisition. 
Turning to margins. We are increasing our full year 2021 targets. This includes non-GAAP results to be approximately at the following levels, which include a neutral impact from our distributor acquisition. Gross profit margins of approximately 68%, operating margins of approximately 16% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 25%.

First, to our new DexCom team members in Australia and New Zealand, we are absolutely thrilled to have you with us on our journey to empower people to take control of diabetes. We look forward to working together and learning from you as we bring our technology to those in need in these key markets. Our operations team has provided another highlight in the third quarter as our G6 manufacturing yields reached all-time highs, and our warranty rates reached all-time lows. Those are the kind of metrics that lead to the margin improvements that we've seen and reflect countless hours of work from our talented employees. And finally, our R&D team continues to innovate with several updates to our sensor pipeline as well as our leadership in data and software solutions. The 2 FDA clearances this quarter are a testament to those efforts and a nice validation of the strategy that we discussed to leverage software as a competitive advantage and a key area of investment. 
As Sean mentioned at the start of the call, we've invited Jake Leach, our Chief Technology Officer, to join us for the Q&A portion of the call in order to address any questions around these clearances and our product innovation. 
I would now like to open the call up for Q&A. Sean?"

We have some work to do on the product labeling side and some work to do with the FDA as we migrate down that path, and we've had some of those discussions. But the results are spectacular as we've seen people use this product. In fact, we recently got a an e-mail from a position. And again, this is in the type 2 world, not intensive, but was telling us about a recent experience with a patient who had gone from an A1C in the down to no medications in an A1c of 5.5% or something like that. It works there. It works also very much on the -- just the metabolic front-end general, anybody who wears a CGM and watches that data, and particularly if you set those lines narrow between like 70 and 120. If you go above the 120 mark, you ask yourself what you ate, you can usually figure out and go back to something that you could do different, the effects of exercise, the effects of poor sleep, the effective stress of an earnings call. to be demonstrated in CGM graph. I think it's a wonderful market opportunity. The data has to be presented properly. That's where the Live API and the approvals we talked about today come in. The API is a quick way to get there. And Jay knows the technical stuff better than me, but the API also requires a person to run a DexCom app and the other app. With the other -- the app and app module that we talked about today, some of these larger programs, again, like Level 2 with UnitedHealth Group, -- You have 1 app experience with like a DexCom button or a DexCom experience right in the middle of it. So if you're branding a wellness situation and really want that to be your focal point we can resign in that app and you can have that experience. So we think both solutions, they offer speed, but they also offer different experiences. And then we'll pick the partners we want to work with on both sides. Those that have the best need for 1 versus the other. So we're excited for both of them, Jeff. We're very excited for these markets, and it's long been part of our long-term strategy. but we need the technology to get there, and our product pipeline truly supports going there over time."

And what you see in the quarter, I think we talked a little bit about on the call is it was a record revenue quarter in most of our international markets. So I think you see it playing through on the revenue front. I think you saw a 46% organic growth rate outside the U.S., which again, another incredibly strong quarter fueled by a lot of the access that we've been able to create. 
And then you look at the new patient growth. It's another record quarter for new patient adds in this quarter. again, all pointing to some of the access that we've created outside the U.S. So I think some of the examples, I think we talked a little bit about them publicly last quarter with Canada, for example, in multiple different provinces allowing us access to those publicly reimbursed channels. And I think in those channels, you're seeing just that. A lot of people now have the access to DexCom CGM technology, and they're taking advantage of that. So we'll continue to expect that to play through. It's why we ultimately made the decision to do it. And I think you've seen it play through in the financial results and our expectation is you continue to see it play through over the long haul."

Just a couple of tangible things, which I think are helpful to see, again, another record quarter for new patient adds. I think you can see that playing through. And in many ways, that's driven by the sales force. So you see that continued momentum. I'd say the 1 thing that we have noticed that hasn't prevented us from being at completely full effectiveness is some of the impacts of the Delta variant. I think that's probably the only thing that we've seen that's been a challenge, and that's just getting access to some of these offices when they're no longer seeing folks in person. And so you've seen a lot of physicians opening up in those locations we're doing incredibly well. So there's more to work through, and that's a function of just navigating through these COVID landscapes more than anything else. So I think in short, you're seeing the performance, you're seeing the growth, seeing the new patient adds, and we've ramped up very nicely. It's been an incredible year for us thus far and very bullish on what it means for next year. So I think that's really the feedback thus far.

So I'll first and foremost, reiterate, the total pricing expectation for the year, the $250 million is still the expectation. If anything, we might come a little bit light on that, but that still is the expectation. And so then the pricing in Q3 was generally in line with prior quarters, a little bit elevated, but it's not a material step change. And that's a function of some of those OUS contracts kicking in. So really, that's where we come from a pricing perspective. So it's not necessarily pulling anything in. We've often talked about 2022 being relatively similar to 2021, and we're still on that trajectory. So I wouldn't necessarily expect any of that -- To your question on how Q4 plays out in the guide and doing the math there, and you're doing the math right. One of the things we're mindful of, and there's really 2 pieces to it, as you think about it. There's the piece we talked about a little bit earlier, which is the Delta variant and getting into new primary care offices and making sure that we're seeing that over time before we count on it. So that's the first piece of it, and we're mindful of that. And then the second piece of it as more and more of our product is fulfilled through the pharmacy, the historical trends over time, you're going to see start to migrate just a little bit. You saw it start this year in -- If you look back to Q1, our sequential pullback from prior year Q4 into Q1 was a bit mooted. And you're going to see the same thing in this Q4, which means as more and more goes to the pharmacy, you no longer have folks in the DME space than on they have the high deductible health plans, where folks are maximizing benefits at the end of the year. So we expect a little bit less seasonality as we progress. And in turn, we expect a little seasonality in Q1 of next year. So that's what you're reading into it. That's ultimately what comes through in the guide. So you're doing the math right, but those are some of the expectations that went into it."

In terms of your question on the distributor, the impact of the distributor acquisition growth in the quarter in our CGM business, it rounds to 0%. And so it's because there was 2 months in the quarter and that markup on the margin in the distributor market is relatively small. The question is, well, why do you do it? And what do you -- it's our ability to control penetrating deeper into these markets, and that's ultimately why we do it. It's not to try to get a margin uplift. It's actually to try to control investment -- We're a company that has cash on the balance sheet. We're willing to invest in these markets, and we want to continue to invest in these markets. So as we take them direct, the goal is then to reinvest and make sure that we're driving adoption. So the impact of the distributor really nominal on our organic growth rate, like I said, it rounds to 0. So the 28% is the organic growth rate, even including that. So hopefully, that helps you around the acquisition. There isn't much there that changes the results this quarter."

Now once we get to full capacity, there's no reason why we don't get back to our long-term gross margin guide, and we'll get into 2022 when we get there. But there's nothing structurally in those lines that would prevent us from meeting what we had talked about from our long-term gross margin guide. There may be ebbs and flows quarter-by-quarter as we ramp up. But I don't expect there to be any issues there. So if you're kind of asking the question, well, how would I wait the 2o -- most of the impact is upon the launch of G7 and turning on those machines and the depreciation associated with it.

It is not a life in-depth decision. -- for them. So I can see the revenue per patient being lower for this group over time even in continuous use, but I don't know how much yet. There will certainly be intermittent use models that might be available and lead to good outcomes. But 1 of the mistakes that a lot of these programs make in the beginning is they try and minimize the number of sensors because they're worried about the costs, they're trying to control. And in reality, the benefits to these patients and these customers who use the systems get are derived from CGM data. So we have to balance those things and balance that against our current business model as well. But we do believe it's going to be a very good population and the there was long a belief that all these patients won't want to wear it all the time. No, they do. They very much enjoy the data and really like knowing where they are. That has not been a problem at all."

One of the things I think our team has done, there's 2 pieces of it. One, do you have enough product? And two, can you manage the cost? And I think our team has done an incredible job in lining up the product. Now that doesn't mean everybody is out of the woods that everybody's got supply chains they're naturally running through. But this team got ahead of it very early and has been working collaboratively with all of our suppliers well in advance to make sure that we're properly communicating the value of our product and making sure that we're working with them to secure supply. And that's ongoing, but that's work that's been done well in advance of everybody else kind of jumping on it. So we're very proud of that team. In terms of the inflationary measures, we're in a bit of a unique environment. There have been absolutely inflationary measures, but we're also making a lot more product. And so you kind of get economies of scale and purchasing power, which offset some of the challenges associated with inflation. So our expectation is we're able to navigate both of those and it will not impact kind of our longer-term gross margins because of that nature. So -- Hopefully that answers your question. Maybe I could turn it over to -- well, I can answer the Omnipod questions. So with Pod 5, there are a decent amount of folks using it. There's some studies out there I don't want to quote them just because I don't know how accurate they are. We generally have a good feel for it, although we haven't put it out there publicly. We can let Omnipod do that if they want to. But we do know once Omnipod 5 is launched and the integration associated with DexCom, it could provide a catalyst certainly for us. The 1 thing we will say is when we continue to say it all the time, is CGM first. And so we do believe that a lot of folks do come to CGM and then ultimately could choose to go on to an integrated system. And -- Most folks that do get on to our product today now are MDI. And so a lot of those are out there. That all being said, another AID system with 1 is novel as Omnipod. The zinc is certainly something that's interesting. And for patients that like patch pumps, I think this is an incredible opportunity for folks to get on that platform."

And so that kind of flows through as you mentioned, the e-commerce experience, but into the app, the mobile app itself. It's a new -- completely new app architecture for us. So it's a new piece of software. And the first part that users will see that's quite different is the onboarding modules. So we basically spent a lot of time studying human factors in how users use the products, particularly in those -- when they're first learning how to use it. So what the onboard module does is really walks them through a simple process in how to get up and running quickly on their CGM. The other thing about it that's different than G6 is it has a simplified alert scheme -- So it doesn't have some of the more sophisticated predictive alerts that G6 does it. It has a very simple, easy-to-use approachable alert scheme. The other thing that we added is with our current G6 system, a lot of the kind of data over time statistics are built into our Clarity software with DexCom One, we've actually incorporated that into the DexCom 1 app. So typical statistics like average glucose time and range estimated A1C. That's all built into the single DexCom 1. And then finally, in that vein of simplicity, -- There's no AID connectivity for DexCom 1. It also doesn't have the share remote monitoring feature. So it's really about bringing a simple CGM product to people who've never had access to DexCom CGM and haven't experienced life without fingersticks."

It is a lower level of technology with respect to net than what we offer. And so it is targeted different people. Certainly, we'll have access to more type 2 patients and access to insulin users.

And our routine after the call was very simple. He'd come me up and he'd say, -- This is what you guys were trying to say, and he was pretty much always right on point. So I'm preparing my closing remarks today, let me reiterate what we're trying to tell you. Leverage and growth continue. Our 28% revenue growth achieved through sensor volume growth in excess of 40% demonstrates the continued commitment and talent of our commercial organization. Profitability continues to improve as well, yet we remain mindful of the investments we need to make in the future. Our global access strategy is working. We continue to achieve the numbers we've achieved while we've expanded access to our product globally through strategically shifting our customers to channels, which was sold in reduced revenue per customer annually and yet margins have increased. 
Next, G7 is on schedule, and it's coming. All of the efforts related to G7 are moving at a frenetic pace around here. I've never seen our people so engage in a single-minded purpose. And finally, our software development and data platform commitments are going to be critical in the future and you saw big steps this quarter. We've spent a great deal of time talking about software as a differentiator today and we haven't over the past several months. you're beginning to see -- you're seeing the beginning of a great change with DexCom 1 and the data sharing and experience-enhancing technologies recently approved by the FDA also demonstrate this. It's only the beginning. Our long-term focus has always been for the data generated from our devices to be consumed in a way that really makes an impact on people's lives and on their health care in general. Thanks, and everybody, have a great day."

Today, we reported another strong quarter for DexCom with third quarter revenue growth of 30% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and 28% growth on an organic basis. This revenue growth rate represents continued momentum from DexCom CGM adoption around the world, as we once again achieved a record quarter of new customer growth. The third quarter also saw several strategic accomplishments across our teams that lay the foundation for our future growth opportunities. 
In the U.S., we received FDA clearance for 2 key software solutions that continue to differentiate our connected products from those of our competitors and position us as a partner of choice across a health care and wearables ecosystem. First, in July, we received FDA clearance for our real-time API. For those of you who are unaware, an API is the tool that allows one app to connect with another app. Prior to this clearance, our customers and clinicians could only utilize our retrospective API, which integrated DexCom data into third-party apps on a 3-hour delayed basis. 
We believe that by putting the power of choice at our users' fingertips with real-time data, we can help ease the daily burden of diabetes management and significantly improved quality of life for our customers. This tool will be available to partners invited by DexCom, and we already have several that have begun the development process to enable real-time displays for their communities. This includes Garmin, which became the first partner to launch apps connected to our real-time API 2 weeks ago, bringing DexCom readings into their portfolio of wearables and cycling computers. 
Second, on the heels of the real-time API clearance, we received FDA clearance in August for the DexCom app, an app module. This module was specifically designed for people with nonintensive type 2 diabetes and can directly integrate into another third-party health care app. With the integrated DexCom app, it is now even easier for our partners to access and display our CGM data, enabling single app solutions that simplify the experiences for DexCom users.  
UnitedHealth Group became our first partner to launch the integrated DexCom app in app module in late September, bringing the embedded app into their Level 2 diabetes care program. Our connectivity, software and data infrastructure solutions are our core strength of DexCom. These 2 recent FDA clearances reflect the increased investment that we put into software development and we believe increase our competitive advantages moving forward. In late September, we also announced the launch of DexCom 1 in 4 international markets where we previously had no presence. Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. 
DexCom 1 leverages the G6 hardware platform and a completely redesigned software experience that focuses on simplicity, and ease of use for our customers. This is the first product launch in our history that started exclusively through the DexCom e-commerce platform, a platform that has been embraced by our customers in Canada and the U.K. over the past 2 years. With the proven performance of our CGM systems, the new software experience and efficient e-commerce solution and affordable pricing plans, we believe that DexCom 1 will be an important product for us as we drive the business toward our long-term targets. 
Most importantly, this differentiated product is a key step for us to bring DexCom CGM to significantly more people with diabetes who previously did not have access to our products. Early feedback around the product has been very favorable, and we look forward to seeing the full results from these launches as we leverage the full breadth of our expanding product portfolio to achieve our 2020 Investor Day goal of tripling our international addressable market by the end of 2023.  
Building from the strength of our mobile trial that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in June, investigators published the results from the extension phase of the trial in Diabetes care during the third quarter. In this extension phase, we rerandomized the population who are initially on CGM to see if the benefits would be retained for those who stayed on CGM compared to those who returned to fingerstick monitoring. Once again, the results were clear. Those who stayed on our G6 systems maintain greater time and range improvements over the 6-month extension phase compared to those who did not. The results confirmed that for the significant population of people with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin, there is significant benefit in continuous CGM use to optimize therapy and support behavior modifications. Our teams are working hard to leverage the conclusions from mobile into greater access to our technology for people with type 2 diabetes. And this is just one area in which we are building the foundation for our long-term growth.  
We are advancing our pilot efforts with UnitedHealth Level 2, Teladoc's Livongo for Diabetes, WellDoc, Onduo and others. We are generating strong clinical evidence for expanded indications for CGM use in inpatient settings and for women who are pregnant. We continue to leverage our advantages in connectivity by gaining new customers and progressing our pipeline of solutions with our leading insulin delivery partners.  
Finally, we continue to advance our G7 scale-up and regulatory efforts during the quarter. We've had excellent communication with our notified body in Europe and believe that we remain on track to begin the launch of our G7 system in the fourth quarter upon receiving CE Mark clearance. In the U.S., we've made great progress in preparation for our regulatory submission. I believe that we are now in the final stages of that effort. 
We look forward to the comprehensive G7 510(k) submission, including G7 hardware and full Android and iOS software to the FDA in the next few weeks. As you can see, our teams are working very hard and making great progress to advance our core strategic efforts, whether it is in expanding our product portfolio, creating differentiated user experiences or laying the foundation for new market opportunities that will drive our future growth. So with that said, let me turn it over now to Jereme for a review of our third quarter financial performance. Jereme?"
114039,1684352479,2416772,"DexCom, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","DexCom, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the third quarter of 2",1020,"Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the third quarter of 2021, we reported worldwide revenue of $650 million compared to $501 million for the third quarter of 2020, representing growth of 30% on a reported basis and 28% on an organic basis. In late July, we were proud to complete the acquisition of our distributor in Australia and New Zealand. With this acquisition, we began generating revenue for certain non-CGM health care products, which we have categorized as inorganic growth for the quarter. This non-CGM distribution revenue contributed approximately 2% to our reported growth for the third quarter.  
The transition from distributor markets to direct sales is one of several important strategic initiatives that we outlined at our 2020 Investor Day as we seek to significantly grow our international presence. We believe a larger direct international footprint will give us greater control to leverage our marketing strength, invest in accelerating our growth and ensure that the direction of these core markets is aligned to our strategic interest.  
In terms of the financial impact of the third quarter acquisition, we expect the transaction to be approximately neutral to our operating margin for the full year as it was in the third quarter. U.S. revenue totaled $490 million in the third quarter compared to $399 million in the third quarter of 2020, representing growth of 23%. We continue to see good momentum in the U.S. where we are benefiting from the increased market access and field presence that we've enabled over the past year. New customer growth remains strong across all segments of the population including people with type 1 diabetes, intensively manage people with type 2 diabetes where we have significantly expanded market access in the past year and even early adopters in the type 2 non-intensive population.  
Our international business grew 57% in the third quarter, totaling $161 million. Excluding the impact of non-CGM distribution revenue generated by our acquisition of our distributor in Australia and New Zealand, growth for our international business was 46% in the third quarter. We continue to see very encouraging growth across the board in our international markets with the majority of our markets delivering record sales in the third quarter. Although it is still early, we believe that our strategic moves to broaden access in several markets have been very successful thus far and have left us well positioned to expand our growth profile internationally, and you see that in the reflected current quarter results.  
Along those lines, our global volume growth in the third quarter remained strong, exceeding 40% for the quarter. This is well above our 28% organic revenue growth rate and supports the momentum behind DexCom CGM globally, as we aggressively seek to advance access to our technology and drive better health outcomes and quality of life for people with diabetes.  
As Kevin mentioned, the launch of DexCom 1 adds to our product portfolio and provides another key element of our strategy to expand access to CGM globally. As we continue to scale our business in conjunction with our ambitious plans for customer growth, we are creating tools that allow us to serve our growing base in an efficient manner, and the use of our e-commerce platform for the initial DexCom 1 launch is a good example of that focus.  
Our third quarter gross profit was $446.9 million or 68.7% of revenue compared to 68% of revenue in the third quarter of 2020. The year-over-year gross margin expansion is an impressive result, especially when you factor in our strategic efforts this year to drive greater mix to the pharmacy channel and expanded international access. This is a credit to our teams who have innovated and embrace change where necessary to drive efficiencies and position us to maximize our strategic opportunities. We continue to demonstrate the ability to leverage both our manufacturing operations and R&D teams to be ever more efficient in the delivery of our products. 
Operating expenses were $323.1 million for Q3 2021 compared to $245.7 million in Q3 2020. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales were relatively flat year-over-year as we offset investments in software development, G7 scale-up and our expanded global commercial sales force with strong leverage of our general and administrative functions. Operating income was $123.8 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $95 million in the same quarter of 2020, holding flat 19% of revenue. As this result indicates we've been able to retain much of our operating margin this year even as we have significantly reinvested in our business.  
Adjusted EBITDA was $173.5 million or 26.7% of revenue for the third quarter compared to $146.9 million or 29.3% of revenue for the third quarter of 2020. Net income for the third quarter was $89.5 million or $0.89 per share. We closed the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, giving us great financial flexibility to drive our strategic initiatives. This includes the continued build-out of our manufacturing facility in Malaysia and G7 scale-up in Mesa, Arizona as well as opportunities that are relying on our business objectives, such as our recent distributor acquisition.  
Turning to guidance. Our third quarter performance has placed us in a position to once again raise our full year 2021 outlook for revenue and margins as we look to wrap up another excellent year. We now expect 2021 revenue to be between $2.425 billion and $2.450 billion, representing growth of 26% to 27% over 2020. This guidance includes approximately 100 basis points of non-CGM inorganic growth related to our recent distributor acquisition.  
Turning to margins. We are increasing our full year 2021 targets. This includes non-GAAP results to be approximately at the following levels, which include a neutral impact from our distributor acquisition. Gross profit margins of approximately 68%, operating margins of approximately 16%, and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 25%.  
With that, I will now turn the call back to Kevin."

We look forward to working together and learning from you as we bring our technology to those in need in these key markets. Our operations team has provided another highlight in the third quarter as our G6 manufacturing yields reached all-time highs, and our warranty rates reached all-time lows. Those are the kind of metrics that lead to the margin improvements that we've seen and reflect countless hours of work from our talented employees. 
And finally, our R&D team continues to innovate with several updates to our sensor pipeline as well as our leadership in data and software solutions. The 2 FDA clearances this quarter are a testament to those efforts and a nice validation of the strategy that we discussed to leverage software as a competitive advantage and a key area of investment.

We have some work to do on the product labeling side and some work to do with the FDA as we migrate down that path, and we've had some of those discussions. But the results are spectacular as we've seen people use this product. In fact, we recently got an e-mail from a physician. And again, this is in the type 2 world, nonintensive, but was telling us about a recent experience with a patient who had gone from an A1c in the 12 down to no medications and an A1c of 5.5 or something like that. It works there. 
It works there. It works also very much on the -- just the metabolic front-end general, anybody who wears a CGM and watches that data, and particularly if you set those lines narrow between like 70 and 120, if you go above the 120 mark, you ask yourself what you ate. You can usually figure out and go back to something that you could do different, the effects of exercise, the effects of poor sleep, the effect of stress of an earnings call is going to be demonstrated in CGM graph. 
I think it's a wonderful market opportunity. The data has to be presented properly. That's where the Live API and the approvals we talked about today come in. The API is a quick way to get there. And Jay knows the technical stuff better than me, but the API also requires a person to run a DexCom app and the other app. With the other -- the app in app module that we talked about today, some of these larger programs, again, like Level 2 with UnitedHealth Group,  you have one app experience with like a DexCom button or a DexCom experience right in the middle of it. So if you're branding a wellness situation and really want that to be your focal point, we can resign in that app and you can have that experience. 
So we think both solutions, they offer speed, but they also offer different experiences. And then we'll pick the partners we want to work with on both sides. Those that have the best need for 1 versus the other. So we're excited for both of them, Jeff. We're very excited for these markets, and it's long been part of our long-term strategy. but we need the technology to get there, and our product pipeline truly supports going there over time."

What you see in Europe, and certainly, it's really in all the markets we've gone in with our access strategy as we've moved into various countries and obviously, exchange price for access to populations that we historically haven't been able to get to. And what you see in the quarter, I think we talked a little bit about on the call is it was a record revenue quarter in most of our international markets. So I think you see it playing through on the revenue front. I think you saw a 46% organic growth rate outside the U.S., which again, another incredibly strong quarter fueled by a lot of the access that we've been able to create. 
And then you look at the new patient growth. It's another record quarter for new patient adds in this quarter, again, all pointing to some of the access that we've created outside the U.S. So I think some of the examples, I think we talked a little bit about them publicly last quarter with Canada, for example, in multiple different provinces allowing us access to those publicly reimbursed channels. And I think in those channels, you're seeing just that. A lot of people now have the access to DexCom CGM technology, and they're taking advantage of that. So we'll continue to expect that to play through. It's why we ultimately made the decision to do it. And I think you've seen it play through in the financial results and our expectation is you continue to see it play through over the long haul."

So where we sit today, and we talked a little bit about it last quarter, but I want to reiterate it is, in the U.S., we've doubled our covering prescriber coverage over the past 18 months. And so what I mean by that is the amount of physicians that are writing DexCom's scripts has doubled in 18 months. That's a testament to the work that's being done by the U.S. commercial team, which has been fueled by multiple things, certainly, direct-to-consumer advertising, doubling the size of the sales force, those all really play into folks adopting the technology. 
Just a couple of tangible things, which I think are helpful to see, again, another record quarter for new patient adds. I think you can see that playing through. And in many ways, that's driven by the sales force. So you see that continued momentum. I'd say the one thing that we have noticed that hasn't prevented us from being at completely full effectiveness is some of the impacts of the Delta variant. I think that's probably the only thing that we've seen that's been a challenge, and that's just getting access to some of these offices when they're no longer seeing folks in person. 
And so you've seen a lot of physicians opening up in those locations we're doing incredibly well. So there's more to work through, and that's a function of just navigating through these COVID landscapes more than anything else. So I think in short, you're seeing the performance, you're seeing the growth, seeing the new patient adds, and we've ramped up very nicely. It's been an incredible year for us thus far and very bullish on what it means for next year. So I think that's really the feedback thus far. And again, as we get more and more data, we'll continue to share it as it becomes available."

So I'll first and foremost, reiterate, the total pricing expectation for the year, the $250 million is still the expectation. If anything, we might come a little bit light on that, but that still is the expectation. And so then the pricing in Q3 was generally in line with prior quarters, a little bit elevated, but it's not a material step change. And that's a function of some of those OUS contracts kicking in. So really, that's where we come from a pricing perspective. 
So it's not necessarily pulling anything in. We've often talked about 2022 being relatively similar to 2021, and we're still on that trajectory. So I wouldn't necessarily expect any of that. To your question on how Q4 plays out in the guide and doing the math there, and you're doing the math right. One of the things we're mindful of, and there's really 2 pieces to it, as you think about it. There's the piece we talked about a little bit earlier, which is the Delta variant and getting into new primary care offices and making sure that we're seeing that over time before we count on it. So that's the first piece of it, and we're mindful of that. 
And then the second piece of it as more and more of our product is fulfilled through the pharmacy, the historical trends over time, you're going to see start to migrate just a little bit. You saw it start this year in Q1. If you look back to Q1, our sequential pullback from prior year Q4 into Q1 was a bit mooted. And you're going to see the same thing in this Q4, which means as more and more goes to the pharmacy, you no longer have folks in the DME space than on they have the high deductible health plans, where folks are maximizing benefits at the end of the year. So we expect a little bit less seasonality as we progress. And in turn, we expect a little seasonality in Q1 of next year. So that's what you're reading into it. That's ultimately what comes through in the guide. So you're doing the math right, but those are some of the expectations that went into it."

In terms of your question on the distributor, the impact of the distributor acquisition on growth in the quarter in our CGM business, it rounds to 0%. And so it's because there was 2 months in the quarter and that markup on the margin in the distributor market is relatively small. The question is, well, why do you do it? And what do you -- it's our ability to control penetrating deeper into these markets, and that's ultimately why we do it. It's not to try to get a margin uplift. It's actually to try to control investment. 
We're a company that has cash on the balance sheet. We're willing to invest in these markets, and we want to continue to invest in these markets. So as we take them direct, the goal is then to reinvest and make sure that we're driving adoption. So the impact of the distributor really nominal on our organic growth rate, like I said, it rounds to 0. So the 28% is the organic growth rate, even including that. So hopefully, that helps you around the acquisition. There isn't much there that changes the results this quarter."

We're on that glide path right now. And so we're making headways. We haven't given a specific update as a percentage.

So we're in the early stages of understanding what is the exact CGM that meets the needs in the hospital. We've seen good success with G6 under times of COVID use in the hospital. It is really serving a need, but it's not exactly the right workflow for the hospitals. And so what we want to do is better understand how do we build a CGM that really meets the needs of that segment. On the pregnancy side, we're very excited about the building in pregnancy functionality and providing information that's important for expected mothers into the G7 product. And so that's part of our road map, and we're actively working on building that into the G7."

What we've learned and what the data that we've seen most recently supports and we'll continue to talk about is continuous use of the system provides much better health care outcomes than intermittent or sporadic use the things that patients learn with this technology, having that feedback full time provides a much better outcome. With respect to the long-term revenue model, and again, I'm speculating a bit here, but I'll just repeat what I say to the team internally, we're solving a much different problem for somebody who's not on insulin. 
It is not a life-and-death decision for them. So I can see the revenue per patient being lower for this group over time even in continuous use, but I don't know how much yet. There will certainly be intermittent use models that might be available and lead to good outcomes. But one of the mistakes that a lot of these programs make in the beginning is they try and minimize the number of sensors because they're worried about the costs, they're trying to control. And in reality, the benefits to these patients and these customers who use the systems get -- are derived from CGM data. So we have to balance those things and balance that against our current business model as well. But we do believe it's going to be a very good population and there was long a belief that all these patients won't want to wear it all the time. No, they do. They very much enjoy the data and really like knowing where they are. That has not been a problem at all."

We'll make sure that we isolated out over the long haul, so that you're able to identify what is and what isn't out there. 
So I think you can feel comfortable there, provided it's material. In terms of the actual acquisition itself, and being able to get into the market, this was -- this is a group of folks who have done an incredible job with CGM adoption in that country. And so when we get into these countries, we want to make sure, one, we have the team. We make sure that there's nothing in their way from continuing to develop CGM awareness and develop CGM adoption. So there's nothing that prevents us under the structure. The only thing we mentioned in terms of investment is very similar to the way you've thought about our organization in the U.S. 
We know that investment in DTC and in sales reps where it makes sense and in sampling. And all of the things that we've put in place makes great sense in other markets. You've seen us do some of that in Europe. And certainly, we've done some in Canada. And we expect to do more of that. And when we take it direct, we can do a little bit more of that.

But this team got ahead of it very early and has been working collaboratively with all of our suppliers well in advance to make sure that we're properly communicating the value of our product and making sure that we're working with them to secure supply. 
And that's ongoing, but that work has been done well in advance of everybody else kind of jumping on it. So we're very proud of that team. In terms of the inflationary measures, we're in a bit of a unique environment. There have been absolutely inflationary measures, but we're also making a lot more product. And so you kind of get economies of scale and purchasing power, which offset some of the challenges associated with inflation.

So we basically spent a lot of time studying human factors and how users use the products, particularly in those -- when they're first learning how to use it. 
So what the onboard module does is really walks them through a simple process in how to get up and running quickly on their CGM. The other thing about it that's different than G6 is it has a simplified alert scheme -- So it doesn't have some of the more sophisticated predictive alerts that G6 does it. It has a very simple, easy-to-use approachable alert scheme. The other thing that we added is with our current G6 system, a lot of the kind of data over time statistics are built into our Clarity software with DexCom 1, we've actually incorporated that into the DexCom 1 app. So typical statistics like average glucose time and range estimated A1C. That's all built into the single DexCom 1. And then finally, in that vein of simplicity,  there's no AID connectivity for DexCom 1. It also doesn't have the share remote monitoring feature.

He'd call me up and he'd say, this is what you guys were trying to say, and he was pretty much always right on point. So I'm preparing my closing remarks today, let me reiterate what we're trying to tell you. 
Leverage and growth continue. Our 28% revenue growth achieved through sensor volume growth in excess of 40% demonstrates the continued commitment and talent of our commercial organization. Profitability continues to improve as well, yet we remain mindful of the investments we need to make in the future. Our global access strategy is working. We continue to achieve the numbers we've achieved while we've expanded access to our product globally through strategically shifting our customers to channels, which was sold in reduced revenue per customer annually and yet margins have increased. 
Next, G7 is on schedule, and it's coming. All of the efforts related to G7 are moving at a frenetic pace around here. I've never seen our people so engage in a single-minded purpose. And finally, our software development and data platform commitments are going to be critical in the future and you saw big steps this quarter. We've spent a great deal of time talking about software as a differentiator today and we haven't over the past several months. you're beginning to see -- you're seeing the beginning of a great change with DexCom 1 and the data sharing and experience-enhancing technologies recently approved by the FDA also demonstrate this. It's only the beginning. Our long-term focus has always been for the data generated from our devices to be consumed in a way that really makes an impact on people's lives and on their health care in general.
