Q1 was a very good start to the year as we met or exceeded all of our guidance targets. Revenue was $970 million, with GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 and non-GAAP earnings above our target range at $1.52. The business was strong across all geographies and product groups. And for the year, we are reaffirming our guidance with low to mid-teens non-GAAP EPS growth, revenues surpassing the $4 billion milestone, non-GAAP operating margin of 29% to 30% and more than $1 billion in operating cash flow. 
Meanwhile, our markets are strong. Wherever one looks, be it at AI and machine learning, hyperscale-enabled cloud computing, 5G, next-generation automotive, massively connected IoT or software enhanced medical devices all require more chips and software. Chips to store and move huge amounts of IoT data through the cloud, chips for massive general compute and AI-driven smarts in every vertical end market, still more chips to tie these huge hardware-software systems seamlessly together and make them both secure and save and the escalating need for ever more secure software with embedded on an electronic system or in the enterprise software space. This is the center of gravity for Synopsys. With our product portfolio that not only excel in advanced system-on-chip design, but reaches down into the critical foundation of silicon manufacturing and up to the intensifying needs of smart software, we are uniquely positioned at the heart of this opportunity space. 
It's quite rewarding to see the adoption and business momentum of the innovations we've introduced over the past several years and the enthusiasm around our further expansions into brand-new domains through our next wave of technology disruptions. 
Let me share some highlights, beginning with EDA. Our groundbreaking Fusion Design Platform continues to drive proliferation and competitive displacements, supporting strong revenue growth. This includes major expansions and evaluations at historical competitor strongholds. 
Customers clearly recognize our leadership at the most advanced nodes now down to 5- and 3-nanometer. Our Fusion Compiler product, specifically deliver superior performance, power and area results with numerous competitive wins and wide deployments with influential, high-impact semi and systems companies around the world, we see growing business momentum. 
Integral to our sustainable differentiation is native integration of our golden signoff product, which guarantees the most accurate and timely results. 
Our deep collaboration with foundries ensures that our mutual customers can access the most advanced technologies with well honed design flows. This quarter, for example, we announced the collaboration with Samsung Foundry to deliver the fastest design closure and signoff for 5 and 3 nanometers. 
We continue to also see good growth and momentum in custom. We again added several new Custom Compiler customers, including 2 in the wireless communications segment, also further inroads with memory companies who are adopting our complete end-to-end custom solution. 
A never-ending challenge in today's complex designs is verification not only of the chips, but also the intersection of the chips with the software that runs on top of them. Our verification continuing platform is uniquely powerful in this sweet spot of modern design and is driving strong growth. Adoptions are expanding rapidly at influential customers, ranging from leading hyperscalers to automotive to the most sophisticated global semis and systems companies. For example, AWS which utilizes our verification software to accelerate the development of data center chips and automotive supplier automotive for its autonomous driving applications. Strong demand continues for our market-leading hardware solutions. Just this quarter, we added 10 new customers and had 45 repeat orders. 
The power of our comprehensive design plus verification solution is evident in full portfolio adoption. This quarter, it included a global design services leader who adopted both Fusion and Verification platforms for highly complex designs, replacing their legacy tools. 
Now to IP, where we again delivered strong double-digit revenue growth. Outsourcing of sophisticated IP blocks continues unabated. Our track record of innovation, reliability in advanced node leadership have led to our #1 position in interface, embedded memory and foundry-specific IP. We provide the broadest portfolio by far, accelerating time-to-market and reducing risk for our customers. This quarter, we continued to show strong momentum across multiple applications and products. 
In high-performance compute, which is one of the most dynamic segments today, our comprehensive IP portfolio has driven more than 450 wins in 7-nanometer and over 100 in 5-nanometer. We achieved silicon proof of our 112-gigabit Ethernet PHY on 5-nanometer, driving the leading-edge in this key product area. 
With the tremendous growth in Internet traffic, security is a big concern in protecting the data transfer in hyperscale cloud centers. This quarter, we launched the industry's first security IP modules for PCI Express 5.0 and CXL communication interfaces. We have already secured the first design win with a growing pipeline. 
Building on our lead and advanced technology, we released the first phases of our 3-nanometer foundation IP offerings. 
Building on our innovation and momentum in EDA and IP, we have invested in unique and breakthrough solutions to next-generation challenges that our customers face. We do this in close collaboration with ecosystem partners through a combination of R&D and technology acquisitions. While we have a number of these in our innovation pipeline, let me highlight 3 that we recently announced: one, 3D multi-die design; two, AI-driven design flows; and three, silicon life cycle management. 
Starting with 3D multi-die design. Think of it as combining and stacking multiple die together not on the board, but on a specialized large chip. This leads to extremely tight configuration with much higher data speed and bandwidth than with a traditional board and packages approach. Our new 3DIC Compiler product enables the design and analysis of these complex 3D systems, taking full advantage of our technical breadth by leveraging both Fusion Compiler and our signoff tools. 
Early momentum is building rapidly with expanding evaluations and adoptions. Designers are seeing the performance and capacity benefits of a single environment and are beginning to move away from older mix-and-match solutions. For example, 3DIC Compiler helped a large Asian semiconductor company complete a highly advanced test chip in record time, saving weeks of design time. With this, we also combined our high-bandwidth memory and die-to-die IP that enables interconnecting these complex systems. 
Moving next to AI-driven design. We have a breakthrough and already award-winning new solution, DSO.ai. DSO stands for design space optimization. While maximizing the contribution of engineering teams, DSO.ai leverages machine learning techniques and computation to explore the design space for still better solutions in terms of chip performance, power and area. This autonomous search substantially accelerates the work of the human design team. Indeed, in Q1, customers using DSO.ai reported remarkable productivity improvements, consistently realizing better results in a fraction of the time and effort typically required. On top of that, multiple production tape-outs have recently been completed. Our customers are already holding DSO.ai as an anchor product and are beginning to deploy across their organizations. 
Finally, Silicon Lifecycle Management, a new platform to monitor, analyze and optimize chips as they are designed, manufactured, tested and deployed in the field. Synopsys is uniquely well equipped to provide a comprehensive solution through our long-standing expertise in design, manufacturing and IP. We add sensors, monitors and data analytics on chip to provide insight to test yield and reliability management tools. This gives smart visibility into critical performance, reliability, safety and security issues for chip's entire lifespan. 
In Q1, we expanded our capabilities with the acquisition of Moortec which provides leading-edge process, voltage and temperature sensors. Initial interest in activity are strong and expanding. We're in talks with a number of leading IDM and fabless customers. We're also engaged with major cloud service providers to deploy aspects of our solution into their platforms. These new innovation areas create not only new business growth opportunities, they also leverage strong cross disciplinary expertise in Synopsys from design to manufacturing to IP. 
Now to Software Integrity, testing software code for security vulnerabilities and quality issues. We delivered a solid beginning to the year and are on track towards meeting our fiscal '21 goals to reaccelerate growth. As I mentioned in December, we have implemented several important enhancements, all showing encouraging progress. First, evolving our go-to-market strategy and customer success organization including tuning our sales coverage and building an indirect channel program. Second, bolstering our strategic consulting capabilities to better serve growing market needs. And third, evolving our product road map to capitalize on the latest security trend. 
These improvements are beginning to show in our results. All geographies delivered at or above plan. We have numerous multimillion-dollar new agreements and sizable expansions with customers ranging from industrials and aerospace to electronics and financial services. The trend towards adoption of multiple products continues. 
Customer interest in a consulting-led approach to software security is growing. Recent publicized security breaches only underscore that need. Our expanded team is ramping up, and we see very good long-term opportunity. 
In addition, industry analysts continue to recognize the quality and breadth of our portfolio. Synopsys was again named a leader in the Forrester Wave for static application security testing. 
To summarize, Q1 was a very good start to the year. We delivered strong financial results and are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal '21. Our markets are healthy as customer investment in critical chip and system designs as well as immense amounts of software remains very strong. Our differentiated portfolio of solutions including exciting innovations in brand-new areas of technology disruption is generating high demand and strong growth. 
Lastly, keep an eye out for our second annual corporate social responsibility report to be published in the next few weeks. We're proud of the progress we've made in the areas of environmental stewardship, social solidarity and corporate governance. We look forward to sharing with you our metrics and future objectives. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Trac."

We grew revenue broadly across all product groups and geographies. We reported non-GAAP earnings above our target range and continue to expand non-GAAP operating margin. We produced another quarter of robust collections, leading to a very strong cash flow, and we announced a $250 million repurchase in the quarter. Our strong start, market leadership and the resiliency of our business model with nearly 90% recurring revenue gives us the confidence to reiterate our 2021 financial targets. 
I'll now review our first quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. 
We grew total revenue to $970 million, up 16% as design activity generally and demand for our products in particular remain high. The quarter also reflected the timing of some product shipments shifting forward into Q1. Semiconductor and System Design segment revenue was $878 million, with both EDA and IP performing well. Software Integrity segment revenue was $92 million, a solid start towards our full year objectives. 
Moving on to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $822 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $684 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 29.6%. 
Adjusted operating margin for Semiconductor & System Design was 31.8% as Software Integrity was 8.6%. 
Finally, GAAP earnings per share were $1.03, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.52. 
Turning to cash. We generated $174 million in operating cash flow, our highest first quarter operating cash flow to date driven by strong collections and a couple of large customer payments that came in early. 
We initiated a $250 million stock repurchase, consistent with our commitment to increasing buybacks this year. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.02 billion and total debt of $123 million. 
I'll now provide our guidance. We are reiterating a very solid outlook growth and profitability for the year. Revenue of $4 billion to $4.05 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $3.234 billion and $3.279 billion; total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $2.825 billion and $2.855 billion, a non-GAAP operating margin of 29% to 30%; Other income and expenses between minus $11 million and minus $7 million; non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 60%; GAAP earnings of $4.29 to $4.45 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $6.23 to $6.3 per share; cash flow from operations of $1.2 to $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures of approximately $100 million. 
Now to the targets for the second quarter. Revenue between $970 million and $1 billion, total GAAP costs and expenses between $801 million and $819 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $697 million and $707 million, GAAP earnings of $0.93 and to $1.02 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $1.50 to $1.55 per share. 
As we announced in December, we are raising our long-term financial objective to manage to a Rule of 45 model over the next several years. We'll achieve this through a combination of solid revenue growth and non-GAAP operating margin expansion further beyond 30%. We're reiterating a strong outlook for the year and executing to our plan is an important step towards that objective. At the same time, we continue to work through our long-term planning process, and we'll provide additional details as we have in the past, once that process is complete. 
In conclusion, we delivered a very good start to the year. We drove double-digit revenue and earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. Our ongoing focus on managing the business for sustainable long-term growth has served us well. While steadily expanding profitability, we continue to invest in the critical next-generation technologies driving our customers' momentum. And we've prudently managed the strong cash flow we've generated through a balance of a balance of value-enhancing M&A and substantial buybacks. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

But you're certainly very correct to say that DSO is of high potential because but DSO really applies to some of our other flagships. And in the case of design automation it uses a Fusion Compiler and a number of the tools that go with it. And so they're in light its power because if you can amend the human with machine learning-driven enhancements and acceleration, then it's very similar to what we literally did 30 years ago when we came in to the market with automatic synthesis, where the human did a lot of work and the synthesis became essentially a power tool for them. And so I expect that we will see impact of that already this year and certainly next year. 
If we look at 3DIC, that will be a little bit more gradual, but it's very fundamental because as you well know, a lot of people had predicted the death of Moore's law. And by the way, it's far from dead, but it has slowed down. And what is so interesting, in my opinion, with 3DIC is that, that is another way to adding substantial complexity where instead of doing it all on 1 chip, you can do multiple complex chips and connect them very closely together. So over time, this will grow in importance. 
And then Silicon Lifecycle Management is particularly interesting because the word life cycle is in there. And that would tend to say, well, the utilization will be over a longer time frame, but the interest turns out to be extremely high already now because people see that if we could put a variety of data sources and intelligence inside of the chip for self-diagnosis, that's going to be rapidly more and more important for all the places where chips are used on applications that could engage our human life. And of course, the car comes up as the first example for that, but robotics and a number of other areas, we'll have the same. 
And so what -- from our perspective is exciting about this, these are also very much organic innovations may be amended with some small acquisitions. And it bodes well for sort of the speed in which we are creating new value, and that's an additional reason to emphasize it to you."

But one of the things that we've been hearing from fabless chip companies as they're struggling to get access to adequate manufacturing capacity, in particular, leading-edge process nodes. Is that there really seems to be less of a hurry to develop the latest and greatest sub-5-nanometer chip? And so my question to you is, have you seen any slowdown or any feedback from customers indicative of perhaps a slower pace of design innovation in light of the capacity constraints the chip industry is seeing?"

For starters, on the advanced nodes, we see none of that on the contrary. I think the race is fully on. A lot of companies understand that the impact of, let me call it, AI-enhanced computation is going to be enormous on a lot of end markets, and those are sophisticated chips. And a lot of people are essentially chasing that opportunity, all in the hope of having the best offering. And so no slowdown as far as we can tell. And I emphasize in the preamble, the many new technologies we have precisely because that is of high appeal. 
I think part of the confusion around the capacity question comes from the fact that the automotive industry, which is hammered right now by essentially the lack of a few parts in order to ship a car, it's really quite pathetic because these are little parts And they hold back a high value product, is actually mostly in older technologies and in older manufacturing and so not even 300-millimeter but the smaller wafer sizes. And for those, there's not really an alternative because there's a limited number of these foundries. And sure, you could redesign these chips, but who wants to redesign these old chips just because right now, for a couple of months, you don't have enough parts. And so that is the picture that we see. I expect that, that will go away in a few months. But nonetheless, meanwhile, if you're caught in essentially the supply chain narrow spot, you can see the impact. 
And so over time, I think what we will see is that a number of companies will become more careful in saying, ""Hey, if I have to move this design to a newer technology, I want to design it already now so that it's better documented and can be essentially remapped to a new technology."""

So for Art, it's been quite obvious for the last number of years that there's been a rejuvenation of growth in synthesis. And as well in implementation for obviously benefiting you in those 2 areas. But industry data and just the logic of technology would suggest that there was a close correlation between synthesis and the usage of RTL simulation, where you're also a market leader and then similarly for implementation correlated to DFM and physical verification. The question therefore is, has the growth -- the better trajectory you've seen in both DC and implementation induced more rapid growth as well in those highly correlated technologies and products. 
And then for Trac, how are you thinking about your head count growth for the year in the context of your OpEx guidance for fiscal '21? At the end of the quarter, you had what appeared to be a record number of openings, equivalent to over 6% of head count. So maybe talk about how you're thinking about the rate of bringing people on.

An",427,"Okay. Jay, the question you're asking is complex because fundamentally, the picture that you're painting is a picture that started with individual tools and had long moved towards tools that are very correlated with each other and often used in tandem. And so a number of years ago, I point the term that we're moving from scale complexity more of the same to systemic complexity, which is more of the same plus heterogeneous demands and constraints all coming together. And so if you take as I said of gravity, like you did in synthesis and implementation and you look upward, you arrive at RTL, which is essentially a way to describe hardware. But RTL does very much look like a language, and that's not a surprise because right on top of that, sits software. And so we very much see a cone upward that's broadening where hardware and software and hardware-software together to be verified and optimized, and this is increasingly the case for all the large systems. And by the way, around the software for simulation, we added a variety of hardware accelerators such as emulation and prototyping. 
If you look downward, you mentioned DFM, which stands for design for manufacturing. And that is an absolutely correct term because the manufacturing, which was nicely isolated, somebody else was worried about the physics, as you go to smaller and smaller things, you have to worry about a lot of things when you design a chip. And so the connectivity down to the manufacturing has grown substantially, and we do ourselves way more there. But aside of manufacturing, I could have added the word test because we also do design for test. You have now heard the Silicon Lifecycle Management, which is sort of designing for what happens later. I could have added to word FUSA, functional safety because for all the cars, there are all kinds of rules that one has to follow, and we have actually a fabulous offering in that. That is, by the way, also manifested in the IP. And reliability is going to grow in importance as well for all of these products. 
So for a long time, we have always looked at this as the big picture. And the complexity of these intersections is actually one of the areas where Synopsys shines. And that's precisely why I mentioned in the preamble a few times that the benefit of the cross-discipline is something that -- where we can really add a lot of value to our customers. And I think that will continue."

And so when they entered the space of starting to do, let's say, significant chips, not the really small things, but of some meaning, right away, they entered with a design methodology that was more up-to-date than what some of the other companies use. And so that predicated from the start a substantial amount of IP being used in parallel to the advanced technologies. And so from that sense, the balance is slightly different than in the traditional west if I can call it that. At the same time, increasingly now all of these companies look the same to us be it China, either in Korea or in Europe or in the U.S. All the ones that are driving the state of the art have to deal with the physics underneath have to deal with the software on top and have to deal with the sophistication of large IP blocks and substantial development capabilities. And so while it was more different, maybe a decade or so ago, I think it is now more the same than it was before.

Secondly, the hyp",366,"Sure. Well, first, I think your description fits well, the situation, meaning the traditional big players continue to invest heavily because they are chasing or driving, depending how you look at it, advanced technology, no matter what.  Secondly, the hyperscalers are clearly continuing to see the opportunity to do more designs themselves to do more manufacturing, not so much manufacturing, but control where they get their own products from and the one thing that's different about hyperscales versus other companies, they don't design chips to sell the chips. They design chips in order to use them in their own product offering. Having said that, a number of these companies have been successful already at doing that. Some have acquired small start-ups and some are literally growing their design teams and their experience to go with it as we speak. And so it's a part of the market that is definitely on very good growth, I would say, probably twice as much as the rest. 
And then the other category, you call them start-ups, sometimes we also call them all AI companies or machine learning-ish companies because there are many companies around that and not that they all do AI processors, there's a vibrant world that is essentially trying to change the future. And so only anything that is close to machine learning is super highly interested in -- at the minimum, two things, which is compute very fast and compute with a lot of data. And once you say these words, you have to also say not using too much power because otherwise you fry the chips. And so those are all good words for us because that means they tend to immediately heads towards the most advanced IP, head towards the most advanced utilization of tools. And so that has also been a very good market for us. 
So some of the AI guys get acquired by the traditional list. Some of the traditionals get acquired by the hyperscalers. It's a live market. And live is a good word in here because this is a field where advanced change in technology opens new doors at the very moment where there are a lot of opportunities."

Q1 was a very good start to the year, as we met or exceeded all of our guidance targets.

Q1 was a very good start to the year, as we met or exceeded all of our guidance targets. Revenue was $970 million, with GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 and non-GAAP earnings above our target range at $1.52. Business was strong across all geographies and product groups. And for the year, we are reaffirming our guidance with low to mid-teens non-GAAP EPS growth, revenues surpassing the $4 billion milestone, non-GAAP operating margin of 29% to 30% and more than $1 billion in operating cash flow.
Meanwhile, our markets are strong. Wherever one looks, be it at AI and machine learning, hyperscale-enabled cloud computing, 5G, next-generation automotive, massively connected IoT or software-enhanced medical devices, all require more chips and software. Chips to store and move huge amounts of IoT data through the cloud, chips for massive general compute and AI-driven smarts in every vertical end market, still more chips to tie these huge hardware-software systems seamlessly together and make them both secure and safe, and the escalating need for evermore secure software whether embedded on an electronic system or in the enterprise software space.
This is the center of gravity for Synopsys with our product portfolio that not only excels in advanced system-on-chip design but reaches down into the critical foundation of silicon manufacturing and up to the intensifying needs of smart software, we are uniquely positioned at the heart of this opportunity space. It's quite rewarding to see the adoption and business momentum of the innovations we've introduced over the past several years and the enthusiasm around our further expansions into brand-new domains through our next wave of technology disruptions.
Let me share some highlights, beginning with EDA. Our groundbreaking Fusion Design Platform continues to drive proliferation and competitive displacements, supporting strong revenue growth. This includes major expansions and evaluations at historical competitor strongholds. Customers clearly recognize our leadership at the most advanced nodes now down to 5- and 3-nanometer. Our Fusion Compiler product, specifically, delivers superior performance, power and area results. With numerous competitive wins and wide deployments with influential, high-impact semi and systems companies around the world, we see growing business momentum.
Integral to our sustainable differentiation is native integration of our golden signoff products, which guarantees the most accurate and timely results. Our deep collaboration with foundries ensures that our mutual customers can access the most advanced technologies with well-honed design flows. This quarter, for example, we announced the collaboration with Samsung Foundry to deliver the fastest design closure and signoff for 5 and 3 nanometers. We continue to also see good growth and momentum in Custom. We, again, added several new Custom Compiler customers, including 2 in the wireless communications segment, also further inroads with memory companies who are adopting our complete end-to-end custom solution.
A never-ending challenge in today's complex designs is verification, not only of the chips, but also the intersection of the chips with the software that runs on top of them. Our Verification Continuum platform is uniquely powerful in the sweet spot of modern design and is driving strong growth. Adoptions are expanding rapidly at influential customers, ranging from leading hyperscalers to automotive to the most sophisticated global semis and systems companies. For example, AWS, which utilizes our verification software to accelerate the development of data center chips and automotive supplier automotive for its autonomous driving applications.
Strong demand continues for our market-leading hardware solutions. Just this quarter, we added 10 new customers and had 45 repeat orders. The power of our comprehensive design plus verification solution is evident in full portfolio adoptions. This quarter, it included a global design services leader who adopted both Fusion and Verification platforms for highly complex designs, replacing their legacy tools.
Now to IP, where we again delivered a strong double-digit revenue growth. Outsourcing of sophisticated IP blocks continues unabated. Our track record of innovation reliability in advanced node leadership have led to our #1 position in interface, embedded memory and foundry-specific IP. We provide the broadest portfolio by far, accelerating time-to-market and reducing risk for our customers. This quarter, we continued to show strong momentum across multiple applications and products.
In high-performance compute, which is one of the most dynamic segments today, our comprehensive IP portfolio has driven more than 450 wins in 7-nanometer and over 100 in 5-nanometer. We achieved silicon proof of our 112-gigabit Ethernet PHY on 5-nanometer, driving the leading-edge in this key product area.
With the tremendous growth in Internet traffic, security is a big concern in protecting the data transfer in hyperscale cloud centers. This quarter, we launched the industry's first security IP modules for PCI Express 5.0 and CXL communication interfaces. We have already secured the first design win with a growing pipeline. Building on our lead in advanced technology, we released the first phases of our 3-nanometer foundation IP offerings.
Building on our innovation and momentum in EDA and IP, we have invested in unique and breakthrough solutions to next-generation challenges that our customers face. We do this in close collaboration with ecosystem partners through a combination of R&D and technology acquisitions. While we have a number of these in our innovation pipeline, let me highlight 3 that we recently announced: one, 3D multi-die design; two, AI-driven design flows; and three, silicon life cycle management.
Starting with 3D multi-die design. Think of it as combining and stacking multiple die together, not on a board, but on a specialized large chip. This leads to extremely tight configurations with much higher data speed and bandwidth than with a traditional board and packages approach. Our new 3DIC Compiler product enables the design and analysis of these complex 3D systems, taking full advantage of our technical breadth by leveraging both Fusion Compiler and our signoff tools.
Early momentum is building rapidly with expanding evaluations and adoptions. Designers are seeing the performance and capacity benefits of a single environment and are beginning to move away from older mix-and-match solutions. For example, 3DIC Compiler helped a large Asian semiconductor company complete a highly advanced test chip in record time, saving weeks of design time. With this, we also combined our high-bandwidth memory and die-to-die IP that enables interconnecting these complex systems.
Moving next to AI-driven design. We have a breakthrough and already award-winning new solution, DSO.ai. DSO stands for design space optimization. While maximizing the contribution of engineering teams, DSO.ai leverages machine learning techniques and computation to explore the design space for still better solutions in terms of chip performance, power and area. This autonomous search substantially accelerates the work of the human design team. Indeed, in Q1, customers using DSO.ai reported remarkable productivity improvements, consistently realizing better results in a fraction of the time and effort typically required. On top of that, multiple production tapeouts have recently been completed. Our customers are already heralding DSO.ai as an anchor product and are beginning to deploy it across their organizations.
Finally, Silicon Lifecycle Management, a new platform to monitor, analyze and optimize chips as they are designed, manufactured, tested and deployed in the field. Synopsys is uniquely well equipped to provide a comprehensive solution through our long-standing expertise in design, manufacturing and IP. We add sensors, monitors and data analytics on chip to provide insights to test yield and reliability management tools. This gives smart visibility into critical performance, reliability, safety and security issues for chip's entire lifespan.
In Q1, we expanded our capabilities with the acquisition of Moortec, which provides leading-edge process, voltage and temperature sensors. Initial interest and activity are strong and expanding. We're in talks with a number of leading IDM and fabless customers. We're also engaged with major cloud service providers to deploy aspects of our solution into their platforms. These new innovation areas create not only new business growth opportunities, they also leverage strong cross-disciplinary expertise in Synopsys from design to manufacturing to IP.
Now to Software Integrity, testing software code for security vulnerabilities and quality issues. We delivered a solid beginning to the year and are on track towards meeting our fiscal '21 goals to reaccelerate growth. As I mentioned in December, we have implemented several important enhancements, all showing encouraging progress. First, evolving our go-to-market strategy and customer success organization, including tuning our sales coverage and building an indirect channel program. Second, bolstering our strategic consulting capabilities to better serve growing market needs. And third, evolving our product road map to capitalize on the latest security trend.
These improvements are beginning to show in our results. All geographies delivered at or above plan. We have numerous multimillion-dollar new agreements and sizable expansions with customers ranging from industrials and aerospace to electronics and financial services. The trend towards adoption of multiple products continues. Customer interest in a consulting-led approach to software security is growing. Recent publicized security breaches only underscore that need. Our expanded team is ramping up, and we see very good long-term opportunity. In addition, industry analysts continue to recognize the quality and breadth of our portfolio. Synopsys was again named a leader in the Forrester Wave for static application security testing.
To summarize, Q1 was a very good start to the year. We delivered strong financial results and are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal '21. Our markets are healthy as customer investment in critical chip and system designs as well as immense amounts of software remains very strong. Our differentiated portfolio of solutions, including exciting innovations in brand-new areas of technology disruption is generating high demand and strong growth.
Lastly, keep an eye out for our second annual corporate social responsibility report to be published in the next few weeks. We're proud of the progress we've made in the areas of environmental stewardship, social solidarity and corporate governance. We look forward to sharing with you our metrics and future objectives.
With that, I'll turn it over to Trac."

We grew revenue broadly across all product groups and geographies. We reported non-GAAP earnings above our target range and continue to expand non-GAAP operating margin. We produced another quarter of robust collections, leading to a very strong cash flow, and we announced a $250 million repurchase in the quarter. Our strong start, market leadership and the resiliency of our business model with nearly 90% recurring revenue gives us the confidence to reiterate our 2021 financial targets.
I'll now review our first quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated.
We grew total revenue to $970 million, up 16% as design activity generally and demand for our products in particular remain high. The quarter also reflected the timing of some product shipments shifting forward into Q1. Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was $878 million, with both EDA and IP performing well. Software Integrity segment revenue was $92 million, a solid start towards our full year objectives.
Moving on to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $822 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $684 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 29.6%. Adjusted operating margin for Semiconductor & System Design was 31.8%, as Software Integrity was 8.6%. Finally, GAAP earnings per share were $1.03, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.52.
Turning to cash. We generated $174 million in operating cash flow, our highest first quarter operating cash flow to date, driven by strong collections and a couple of large customer payments that came in early. We initiated a $250 million stock repurchase, consistent with our commitment to increasing buybacks this year. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.02 billion and total debt of $123 million.
I'll now provide our guidance. We are reiterating a very solid outlook growth and profitability for the year. Revenue of $4 billion to $4.05 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $3.234 billion and $3.279 billion; total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $2.825 billion and $2.855 billion, a non-GAAP operating margin of 29% to 30%; Other income and expenses between minus $11 million and minus $7 million; non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 60%; GAAP earnings of $4.29 to $4.45 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $6.23 to $6.30 per share; cash flow from operations of $1.2 to $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures of approximately $100 million.
Now to the targets for the second quarter. Revenue between $970 million and $1 billion, total GAAP costs and expenses between $801 million and $819 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $697 million and $707 million, GAAP earnings of $0.93 and to $1.02 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $1.50 to $1.55 per share.
As we announced in December, we are raising our long-term financial objective to manage to a Rule of 45 model over the next several years. We'll achieve this through a combination of solid revenue growth and non-GAAP operating margin expansion further beyond 30%. Reiterating a strong outlook for the year and executing to our plan is an important step towards that objective. At the same time, we continue to work through our long-term planning process, and we'll provide additional details, as we have in the past, once that process is complete.
In conclusion, we delivered a very good start to the year. We drove double-digit revenue and earnings growth and generated strong cash flow. Our ongoing focus on managing the business for sustainable long-term growth has served us well. While steadily expanding profitability, we continue to invest in the critical next-generation technologies driving our customers' momentum. And we've prudently managed the strong cash flow we've generated through a balance of value-enhancing M&A and substantial buybacks.
And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

But you're certainly very correct to say that DSO is of high potential because DSO really applies to some of our other flagships. And in the case of design automation, it uses Fusion Compiler and a number of the tools that go with it. And so therein lies its power because if you can amend the human with machine learning-driven enhancements and acceleration, that it's very similar to what we literally did 30 years ago when we came into the market with automatic synthesis where the human did a lot of work and the synthesis became essentially a power tool for them. And so I expect that we will see impact of that already this year and certainly, next year.
If we look at 3DIC, that will be a little bit more gradual but is very fundamental because as you well know, a lot of people had predicted the death of Moore's Law. And by the way, it's far from dead, but it has slowed down. And what is so interesting, in my opinion, with 3DIC is that, that is another way to adding substantial complexity where instead of doing it all on 1 chip, you can do multiple complex chips and connect them very closely together. So over time, this will grow in importance.
And then Silicon Lifecycle Management is particularly interesting because the word life cycle is in there. And that would tend to say, well, the utilization will be over a longer time frame, but the interest turns out to be extremely high already now because people see that if we could put a variety of data sources and intelligence inside of the chip for self-diagnosis, that's going to be rapidly more and more important for all the places where chips are used on applications that could engage our human life. And of course, the car comes up as the first example for that, but robotics and a number of other areas will have the same.
And so what from our perspective is exciting about this, these are also very much organic innovations maybe amended with some small acquisitions. And it bodes well for sort of the speed in which we are creating new value, and that's an additional reason to emphasize it to you."

For starters, on the advanced nodes, we see none of that on the contrary. I think the race is fully on. A lot of companies understand that the impact of, let me call it, AI-enhanced computation is going to be enormous on a lot of end markets, and those are sophisticated chips. And a lot of people are essentially chasing that opportunity, all in the hope of having the best offering. And so no slowdown as far as we can tell. And I emphasize in the preamble, the many new technologies we have precisely because that is of high appeal.
I think part of the confusion around the capacity question comes from the fact that the automotive industry, which is hammered right now by essentially the lack of a few parts in order to ship a car, it's really quite pathetic because these are little parts and they hold back a high-value product, is actually mostly in older technologies and in older manufacturing, and so not even 300-millimeter but the smaller wafer sizes. And for those, there's not really an alternative because there's a limited number of these foundries. And sure, you could redesign these chips, but who wants to redesign these old chips just because right now for a couple of months you don't have enough parts. And so that is the picture that we see. I expect that that will go away in a few months. But nonetheless, meanwhile, if you're caught in essentially the supply chain narrow spot, you can see the impact.
And so over time, I think what we will see is that a number of companies will become more careful in saying, ""Hey, if I have to move this design to a newer technology, I want to design it already now so that it's better documented and can be essentially remapped to a new technology."""

So for Aart, it's been quite obvious for the last number of years that there's been a rejuvenation of growth in synthesis and as well in implementation for -- obviously benefiting you in those 2 areas. But industry data and just the logic of technology would suggest that there was a close correlation between synthesis and the usage of RTL simulation, where you're also a market leader and then similarly, for implementation correlated to DFM and physical verification. The question therefore is, has the growth -- the better trajectory you've seen in both DC and implementation induced more rapid growth as well in those highly correlated technologies and products?
And then for Trac, how are you thinking about your head count growth for the year in the context of your OpEx guidance for fiscal '21? At the end of the quarter, you had what appeared to be a record number of openings, equivalent to over 6% of head count. So maybe talk about how you're thinking about the rate of bringing people on.

An",428,"Okay. Jay, the question you're asking is complex because fundamentally, the picture that you're painting is a picture that started with individual tools and has long moved towards tools that are very correlated with each other and often used in tandem. And so a number of years ago, I coined the term that we're moving from scale complexity more of the same to systemic complexity, which is more of the same plus heterogeneous demands and constraints all coming together. And so if you take as I said of gravity, like you did in synthesis and implementation and you look upward, you arrive at RTL, which is essentially a way to describe hardware. But RTL does very much look like a language, and that's not a surprise because right on top of that, sits software. And so we very much see a cone upward that's broadening where hardware and software and hardware-software together have to be verified and optimized, and this is increasingly the case for all the large systems. And by the way, around the software for simulation, we added a variety of hardware accelerators such as emulation and prototyping.
If you look downward, you mentioned DFM, which stands for design for manufacturing. And that is an absolutely correct term because the manufacturing, which was nicely isolated, somebody else was worried about the physics, as you go to smaller and smaller things, you have to worry about a lot of things when you design a chip. And so the connectivity down to the manufacturing has grown substantially, and we do ourselves way more there. But aside from manufacturing, I could have added the word test because we also do design for test. You have now heard the Silicon Lifecycle Management, which is sort of designing for what happens later. I could have added to word FuSa, functional safety, because for all the cars, there are all kinds of rules that one has to follow, and we have actually a fabulous offering in that. That is, by the way, also manifested in the IP. And reliability is going to grow in importance as well for all of these products.
So for a long time, we have always looked at this as the big picture. And the complexity of these intersections is actually one of the areas where Synopsys shines. And that's precisely why I mentioned in the preamble a few times that the benefit of the cross-disciplines is something that -- where we can really add a lot of value to our customers. And I think that will continue."

And so that predicated from the start a substantial amount of IP being used in parallel to the advanced technologies. And so from that sense, the balance is slightly different than in the traditional west if I can call it that.
At the same time, increasingly now all of these companies look the same to us be they in China, be they in Korea or in Europe or in the U.S. All the ones that are driving the state of the art have to deal with the physics underneath have to deal with the software on top and have to deal with the sophistication of large IP blocks and substantial development capabilities. And so while it was more different, maybe a decade or so ago, I think it is now more the same than it was before.
And in hardware, I think it's sort of a very similar picture. The most advanced users are the people that are sitting at the intersection of hardware and software, and that is precisely where Synopsys shine."

And I don't want to announce who these people are. Some have probably spoken publicly at this point in time. But that has followed a lot of hard work to make that possible. And now the question will be, are the economics and the capabilities sufficient to be a good counterweight to the x86 family of processes that are typically used in the cloud?
So it is well possible that we're actually going to see a further diversification of computation largely because cloud is not only the regular general purpose computation, but now we have specialized efforts, certainly, in everything dealing with big data and machine learning. And for that, clearly, a number of players have put processes on the market that are dedicated to that and are particularly fast for it.

Secondly, the hyper",366,"Sure. Well, first, I think your description fits well the situation, meaning the traditional big players continue to invest heavily because they are chasing or driving, depending how you look at it, advanced technology, no matter what. Secondly, the hyperscalers are clearly continuing to see the opportunity to do more designs themselves, to do more manufacturing -- not so much manufacturing, but the control where they get their own products from.
And the one thing that's different about hyperscalers versus other companies, they don't design chips to sell the chips. They design chips in order to use them in their own product offering. Having said that, a number of these companies have been successful already at doing that. Some have acquired small start-ups, and some are literally growing their design teams and their experience to go with it as we speak. And so it's a part of the market that is definitely on very good growth, I would say, probably twice as much as the rest.
And then the other category, you call them start-ups, sometimes we also call them all-AI companies or machine learning-ish companies because there are many companies around that and not that they all do AI processors, but there's a vibrant world that is essentially trying to change the future. And so only anything that is close to machine learning is super highly interested in -- at the minimum, 2 things, which is compute very fast and compute with a lot of data. And once you say these words, you have to also say not using too much power because otherwise you fry the chips. And so those are all good words for us because that means they tend to immediately head towards the most advanced IP, head towards the most advanced utilization of tools. And so that has also been a very good market for us.
So some of the AI guys get acquired by the traditionalist. Some of the traditionalist get acquired by the hyperscalers. It's a live market. And live is a good word in here because this is a field where advanced change in technology opens new doors. At the very moment, we have a lot of opportunities."

Trac will discuss the financials in more detail. 
Before commenting on highlights, let me say a few words about the dire situation in South Asia. While parts of the world are progressing well with vaccination, we are seeing an enormous challenge for the people of South Asia. Our top priority is the well-being of our employees, and we have taken many steps to support them and their families. Ranging from orchestrating oxygen concentrators to teaming up with vaccination clinics to ambulance services, food delivery and family health, our objective is to maximally mitigate the impact of COVID and make sure that every employee can call on Synopsys as a beacon of care and solidarity. 
Despite the pandemic challenges, we are thankful that from a business perspective, we continue to ship our products and support our customers with no material disruptions, and our business is doing well. 
Looking at the overall market, demand for semiconductors is very strong. While some of the near-term demand can be attributed to segments such as automotive, catching up after a year of COVID slowing, there is an undeniable new wave of growth on the horizon as every vertical market demands machine learning chips to harvest their big data for their specific needs. In other words, the early technical successes of machine learning in the cloud are now moving to the edge, attracted by the economic promise of smart everything. The technology push has grown into a vertical economic pool. All segments are impacted, and the race is on to provide smart solutions in automotive, health, consumer, 5G and so on. 
This push/pool opens a whole new era for semiconductors and software and with it, great opportunities for Synopsys. First, the foundational building blocks are complex chips, chips for data generation and sensors, for storage, for transport and for compute, all needing IP blocks, speed, low power and security. This is great for Synopsys. 
Second, not just chips, systems of chips. While the complexity of a system on a chip continues to grow, the leading edge is moving to systems off chips. By abutting them seamlessly and stacking them on top of each other, massive transistor counts opened the door to brand-new functionality. This growing systemic complexity is great for Synopsys. 
Third, chips differentiated by vertical market. Each vertical has its own needs. Automotive has safety requirements. Mobile requires extreme low power. Aerospace and industrial ones built in life cycle diagnostics. High-powered new entrants, such as hyperscalers and AI, design their own chips for super performance. And everybody, be it medical and health markets, financial sector, communications or infrastructure, everybody needs much better security. All of these are disciplines that we have invested in for years. Great for Synopsys. 
And lastly, software and silicon are tightly linked and must be tuned for each other: software to be written to consume less power in the chips, chips to be optimized for a huge amount of sensor data, software to be debugged on prototypes of chips that have not been built yet to speed time to market, chips to be optimized for blindingly fast computation and always, software and chips must be secured together. These are all technologies we are leading in. Great for Synopsys. 
So we're perfectly placed, and our mission is to capitalize the Smart Everything ambitions of our semiconductor partners and vertical customers by delivering 1,000x system performance in this decade. 
In that context, let me share some highlights, beginning with EDA, which delivered another strong quarter, both in design and verification. 
In digital design, proliferation and competitive displacement by our Fusion Design Platform again drove strong growth. In particular, strong momentum for Fusion Compiler. For example, ARM is leveraging Fusion Compiler power on its next-generation V1 and M2 infrastructure cores. Fusion Compiler was also selected for advanced mobile designs at Samsung driven by superior throughput and performance per watt results. 
Our momentum in the most advanced 3-nanometer node is also evident with 5 new test chip tape-outs as processor, graphics and mobile technology leaders as well as next wave 3-nanometer adopters. 
We see strong innovation and market disruption with our custom design platform as well. In Q2, we announced our Prime Sim Continuum platform for analog mixed signal simulation. With the industry's brand-new graphics processor base acceleration, it cuts time to results by 10x. Endorsed by Samsung Electronics, NVIDIA and Kioxia, Prime Sim delivers significant productivity gains at companies such as Nanya Technology, where it is deployed on DRAM design. 
In addition, we again secured multiple full-flow displacements in the quarter, including another large analog design company in Japan. 
In verification software, we have strong growth with our Verification Continuum platform, driven by adoption momentum with hyperscalers. Our hardware verification solutions drove excellent results as well, including 14 new logos and more than 50 repeat orders in Q2. Fueling our ongoing strong growth in continuous innovation, including new turbocharged application-specific emulation systems, 2 of which went to market in the quarter. 
The ZeBu and power emulation system lets customers perform power analysis earlier in the design cycle, dramatically reducing power-related risks. Also, just last week, we launched ZeBu EP1, the industry's first ultrafast 10 megahertz emulation system. It targets high-performance compute for 5G, GPU, AI and automotive, handling designs up to 2 billion gates. 
We also shipped the latest generation of prototyping HAPS-100. With the fastest performance and unmatched enterprise scalability, it accelerates software development, system validation and verification. 
Customers like NVIDIA and are already relying on HAPS-100 for their most demanding projects. 
Now to IP, which again achieved excellent revenue growth driven by technical leadership and strong market dynamics. In Q2, we extended our advantage in the high-performance compute market. We acquired more than IP and its 400-gig, 800-gig Ethernet controllers. Combined with our existing 112-gig Ethernet 5, we now offer a full Ethernet solution for hyper performance data center applications. 
Advancing our lead in next-generation PCI Express interfaces, we delivered the industry's first complete PCI Express 6.0 IP solution. Needed for huge bandwidth demand, we see strong market traction with leading customers. And in addition to the EDA adoption I referenced earlier, we announced a strategic collaboration with ARM to closely align product road maps and enhance our interface IP solutions with specific features for the Arm Neoverse platform. 
Our interface and foundation IP are also gaining broad industry adoption on the advanced 5-nanometer FinFET process driven by vertical segments such as high-performance compute, automotive and AI. More than 20 leading semiconductor companies use our 5-nanometer IP with multiple first-pass silicon successes attesting to the robustness and reliability of our portfolio. 
Lastly, to address the above-mentioned safety and security requirements for automotive, we launched a new design-ware hardware secure module and our safety and security processor IP solutions with integrated functional safety features. 
Let me now turn to 2 exciting and disruptive technologies we recently introduced. First is DSO.ai our award-winning AI-powered design system that hits right at the foundation of the new growth era very complex chips. DSO.ai autonomously searches the vast design space for optimal solutions in terms of chip performance, power and area. It does this using very sophisticated machine learning. This not only substantially accelerates the schedule of human design teams, but it enables them to push the technology envelope towards better solutions. The improvements and results over the last 2 quarters have been extraordinary. 
One example is a very large influential U.S. company who reported what I like to call a productivity world record. On a leading-edge chip, a single engineer using DSO.ai was able to achieve in weeks what typically takes an entire team month to complete. 
Another global leader recently highlighted unprecedented 3x designer productivity and meeting timing specs weeks ahead of schedule. Results like these are driving notable adoptions. For example, Renesas now uses DSO.ai for its advanced automotive chip design environment. 
The other innovation push is our silicon life cycle management platform, or SLM for short. This end-to-end solution monitors, analyzes and optimizes chips as they are designed, manufactured, tested and deployed in the field.  SLM leverages our long-standing unique expertise to give customers visibility into performance, reliability, safety and security issues for chip's entire lifespan. We're actively engaged with multiple customers at 5 and 3-nanometer that seek to use SLM to optimize their design flow with data collected during test. 
The vertical market pull by hyperscalers, for example, is a strong driver of important adoptions. In Q2, 10 new customers adopted a variety of SLM capabilities. Several of them having adopted one element of our portfolio are already broadening to other aspects of our platform. Stay tuned as we continue to roll out new capabilities. 
Now to Software Integrity, which had another very solid quarter towards meeting its financial '21 goal and accelerating growth. Revenue was ahead of plan in every region, reflecting strong orders momentum. We're seeing good results from the changes we've made in our go-to-market strategy and execution. In Q2, we added 100 new logos, and retention exceeded our targets. 
The services business was particularly strong and is driving comprehensive service plus products engagements. A great example is an important multimillion dollar new business win with a large transportation company who replaced incumbent products with Synopsys for the end-to-end value we provide. 
We also launched our channel partner program to expand our reach into geographies and verticals not currently touched through direct sales. The benefits are apparent. For example, we closed a multimillion dollar new adoption in South America, where we didn't have any selling capability 6 months ago. 
On the technology front, we delivered a significant enhancement to our Polaris platform, Intelligent Orchestration. It's a set of processes within Polaris that run parallel to our customers' DevOps pipeline. Intelligent Orchestration communicates and automate security testing in synchronization with each company's specific protocol and is built for easier and efficient integration into their development pipeline. The opportunity in this space is vast, and we're encouraged by the steady progress the team is making. 
In summary, we delivered an outstanding Q2 and are raising our outlook for fiscal '21. Our markets are strong, reflecting extensive customer investments in critical chip and system designs with an increasing need for safety and security. 
As we look beyond this year's $4 billion revenue milestone, we see a new era at the intersection of silicon and software that will deliver Smart Everything to all vertical market segments. We see technology challenges that demands the cooperation and teamwork around many complex discipline, disciplines we are strong. And we see Synopsys in the midst of this vision as a well-equipped catalyst to our customers and partners' success. 
Finally, I want to recognize the efforts of our global team who over the past 1.5 years have adopted and succeeded despite upheaval and uncertainty. Thank you all for your solidarity and hard work. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Trac."

We",678,"Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. As we report another outstanding quarter, let me echo Aart's thanks to our team, not only for their dedication, but also for their unwavering focus on innovation to fuel the exciting opportunities we have ahead. We are in a great position as we set our sights on the next level financial ambitions. On top of a solid foundation of nearly 90% recurring revenue, a diverse and growing customer base and market and technology leadership, our track record of excellent execution continued in Q2. We are increasingly confident in our outlook and are raising our revenue, non-GAAP earnings non-GAAP operating margin and cash flow guidance for the year. 
Now to our second quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. 
We generated total revenue of $1.024 billion, up 19% and above our target range, driven by broad-based strength across product groups and geographies. Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was $930 million, with strong growth in both EDA, software and hardware and IP. Software Integrity segment revenue was $94 million. The positive orders momentum we saw in the quarter shows that the adjustments we've made in the business are taking hold. We are on track to meet our 2021 expectations of 15% to 20% orders growth and to exit the year with double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We're on a good path to accelerate revenue growth back to the 15% to 20% range long term. 
Moving on to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $830 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $707 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 31%. We are on track to again deliver operating margin expansion for the year and are raising the bottom end of our guidance range. Adjusted operating margins for the Semiconductor & System Design segment was 33%, and Software Integrity margin was 9%. 
Finally, GAAP earnings per share were $1.24, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.70, well above our target range. 
Turning to cash. We generated a record $526 million in operating cash flow. We completed $145 million of stock buybacks, bringing the total for the year to $398 million. And we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.46 billion and total debt of $116 million. 
Now to guidance. For fiscal 2021: revenue of $4.035 billion to $4.085 billion, an increase of $35 million, representing double-digit growth; total GAAP costs and expenses between $3.241 billion and $3.286 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.835 billion and $2.865 billion; a non-GAAP operating margin of 29.5% to 30%; other income and expenses between minus $5 million and minus $9 million; non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%, GAAP earnings of $4.55 to $4.72 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $6.38 to $6.45 per share, representing mid-teens growth; cash flow from operations of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $100 million. 
Targets for the third quarter: Revenue between $1.03 billion and $1.06 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $807 million and $825 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $707 million and $717 million; GAAP earnings of $1.30 to $1.41 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $1.75 to $1.80 per share. 
Our track record is reflective of how we intend to manage the business to exceed the rule of 40. Based on a vibrant market opportunity, our strong portfolio and our excellent execution, we see an opportunity to accelerate revenue growth and expand non-GAAP operating margin beyond 30%. Our long-term financial objective is to manage the Rule 45 over the next several years, and we will provide additional details once our long-term planning process is complete. 
In conclusion, we delivered strong revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth and record operating cash flow. Our strength is broad-based across product groups and geographies, and we are raising our guidance for the year. At the same time, we continue to develop and deliver transformative innovations that enable our customers endeavors and position us well for many years to come.

Well, there's 2 ways to look at this from the perspective of the vertical or from the perspective of the pure semiconductor companies. From the vertical, the first thing that people need to choose is, will they design their own chips, yes or no. And if you take the example of the hyperscalers some, not all, but some of the automotive companies, the hyperscalers clearly are doing more and more of their own chip design. And automotive are either sort of doubling in it or looking at some of their suppliers, the Tier 1s. 
In all cases, they are doing more chip design. And so that is good news for us. And absolutely, you're right that a lot of that design is done by substantial IP reviews, and you saw that our IP business is strong. Now if you sit on the other side of the fence as a semiconductor provider, you look at these customers are -- each of them as opportunities to take sort of a core architecture and then say, ""Well, how do I take my architecture and do different derivatives that are particularly good for different submarkets and essentially reuse some IP or add some that are just -- that is just necessary for that vertical?"" 
And so I think there's no doubt that, therefore, we will see more chips of different type and more design. In all cases, consumption of IP will continue to grow."

As Aart described, the overall markets are healthy, and we're executing well against that. So there's a number of different factors. 
The backlog I would translate the increase in backlog to whether the business is healthy or not. The backlog increased this quarter as a function of the renewals that we had planned. But overall, the business that we did book saw a very good run rate growth. And the growth in that business gave us really strong outlook for the year and confidence in the year."

There are some people that do take existing chips and decide that they're going to do modification so that they can get more capacity with another vendor. 
People really hate to do that because it's a lot of work and no direct benefit, except that if you can ship to a customer, that's great. But it takes some time. And so I don't think that, that is going to be a particularly strong driver. But the shortages should not be just interpreted, I think, as a reaction to a market that has been partially asleep during the COVID time and now is obviously catching up. 
And automotive is the best example because the mistake that was made there is they stopped ordering. And in the past, they were very powerful, and everybody jumped when they need something. Now there was just no capacity left. And the reason there's no capacity left is because all the capacity is used by huge demand period. And that's why I'm trying to differentiate a little bit with the temporary demand that comes out of sort of just this historical 1.5 years wave, versus, I think, something that is much more profound, which is a whole new era of semiconductors impacting verticals. And I expect that to continue. 
And by the way, you can see how many, many places, including countries have decided to substantially increase the capacity. Those increases will take a couple of years to actually have impact But they do illustrate the direction that our field is taking."

Let me start with SLM because what's interesting about SLM is this word life cycle because if you just take a chip and you say, put it in a phone or put it in a car, we all know which one has the longer life cycle. And so -- and in the age of the car, you have, of course, safety that is part of it. 
And so suddenly, the ability to put inside of the chip sensors and the diagnostic system that, by the way, gets trained by AI so that a chip can self-diagnose as, ""Well, I'm not feeling so good, you better start stopping the car,"" so to speak, is going to be a very high value, maybe even more practical immediately is in cloud centers, where people run compute at the max speed. And they want to know is a certain set of process is going to go down so that I replace them before it happens. So in essence, preventive maintenance. 
And so in that sense, SLM is interesting because we touch these chips literally at the early days of even what are the type of transistors. So very minute physics, but now we also have very meaningful interaction with very large companies that are exactly in those verticals I described. 
Now DSO.ai, I think, is breakthrough technology. And it's always difficult to compare something that we did over 30 years ago. But the early days of Synthesis had something similar, which is it took a set of human tasks where complexity just was outrunning the human and automated it. And overnight, we could do circuits that were better than what a human could do in a fraction of the time, and we're faster and smaller. 
Now we're talking of entire chip pieces, very large designs with many, many different constraints. And the fact that we can take tasks that take people multiple months and bring them down literally to a few weeks with fewer people and in the last few quarters even better results certainly sounds very similar. But to me, it's sort of essentially 30 years later, many orders of magnitude more complexity. And I think it fits well the very moment where the semiconductor industry will want to do many more chips for all these verticals. 
And so we use sometimes the front line of using AI to design AI chips, but that is exactly what this is. And it's exciting. We're just at the beginning of that, but the impact is already economically felt by the users."

Tonight, you referred to a new era of EDA. We've heard similar remarks from you and others in the industry for some time now or silicon renaissance and so forth. The question is how that affects your business profile specifically with respect to services. That is to say, as you move into this new era, does this tend to increase the kind of services and AE support that you necessarily have to provide to encompass or support this new era? 
And if so, what could be the margin implications of having to provide that incrementally higher degree of support relatedly, with respect to the next generation of chips, the domain-specific chips that you talked about now for actually like 2 or 3 years? What does that mean during the design process in terms of license consumption. If we think about your model as now prospectively a kind of consumption model, as is often the case in simulation, do you think that the consumption or utilization intensity per design, per run, however you want to think about it necessarily goes up."

But being there, done that, and by the way, that will continue for a while. 
What makes systemic complexity interesting is that you get multiple players intersecting. Certainly, you have companies that are sitting on these verticals that are highly interested in knowing how the chips will actually work because they write their own software, for example. And vice versa, the people providing chips are really interested. So what software does this car manufacturer really want to run on it that has to be really fast so that I can change the architecture of my chip to accommodate that? 
And our role is interestingly broadened because we're sitting at the intersection of all of that. And you may recall that a number of years ago, under our logo, we literally put silicon to software. Well, that was essentially the summary at that time of this vision that there's a continuum that ultimately brings the power of chips to end users that have -- that are not really interested in chips, except that they need them to get smart outcomes. 
And so when you move into that space, it's not so much as support is increasing, but that there are new service opportunities, the number of the new players initially may not know so much about these domains. but they know a lot about their opportunity space and helping them connect is an opportunity that will continue to grow for us. And we will certainly be able to manage it so that, including with the tools, the profitability will be very reasonable or even good. 
The second part of your question, which ties directly to this is this notion of domain specific. And if I can take one example that is well understood and yet in its infancy, is automotive. And as you know, a number of years ago, a car started to think about this whole notion of autonomous driving or at least at the beginning, defensive driving and chip manufacturers quickly figured out that there may be a long-term big opportunity there, except automotive guys also have rules such as safety rules, and they've had those for a long, long time. Some are simple. Some are becoming very complex. And certainly, what does it mean? 
Well, it means for companies such as Synopsys that we have a whole effort on the IP side and on the tool side to build in what's called USA functional safety. And this is partially mandated by the automotive guys, partially, it is being developed on the fly with the complexity. 
And so these are great opportunities for us because our IP collection, we must have invested in functional safety, there for 5 or 6 years. The enormous amount of effort, but now that we have that, it's a great differentiation. And so I see our role to be very much a catalyst in the middle of these different factions that we all understand. And I think there will be more and more verticals that will engage suddenly at high speed and the race is on."

In general though, when volume increases, with it also the number of designs increases.

But the other comment would be different foundries are sort of also focusing on different type nodes, some focused mostly on the most advanced nodes, other would be sort of in the middle field and then the truly older trailing edge nodes, they're typically limited by the amount of capacity at 200-millimeter wafers. 
What is interesting in the nodes that are maybe not the leading, leading edge, but let's say, 3, 4 years behind that, there, the application of the newer tools that we have actually has a lot of impact on those, too, because newer tools for older nodes still means a lot better design out of these older nodes. And so it actually gives them a bit of a second life from an efficiency point of view. And as you said, if people can do really well with nodes that have been well honed where the yield is high, the cost equation is very attractive.

I'm happy to report outstanding second quarter results, exceeding all of our key guidance metrics. We delivered revenue of $1.024 billion with GAAP earnings per share of $1.24 and non-GAAP earnings of $1.70.
Business was strong across all product groups and geographies. We continue to make good progress on our margin expansion goal and generated record operating cash flow of $526 million. As a result of our first half strength and growing confidence in our year, we are raising guidance for revenue, non-GAAP ops margin, earnings and cash flow. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.
Before commenting on highlights, let me say a few words about the dire situation in South Asia. While parts of the world are progressing well with vaccination, we are seeing an enormous challenge for the people of South Asia. Our top priority is the well-being of our employees, and we have taken many steps to support them and their families. Ranging from orchestrating oxygen concentrators to teaming up with vaccination clinics to ambulance services, food delivery and family health, our objective is to maximally mitigate the impact of COVID and make sure that every employee can call on Synopsys as a beacon of care and solidarity. Despite the pandemic challenges, we are thankful that from a business perspective, we continue to ship our products and support our customers with no material disruptions, and our business is doing well.
Looking at the overall market. Demand for semiconductors is very strong. While some of the near-term demand can be attributed to segments such as automotive catching up after a year of COVID slowing, there is an undeniable new wave of growth on the horizon as every vertical market demands machine learning chips to harvest their big data for their specific needs. In other words, the early technical successes of machine learning in the cloud are now moving to the edge, attracted by the economic promise of Smart Everything. The technology push has grown into a vertical economic pull. All segments are impacted, and the race is on to provide smart solutions in automotive, health, consumer, 5G and so on.
This push/pull opens a whole new era for semiconductors and software, and with it, great opportunities for Synopsys. First, the foundational building blocks are complex chips, chips for data generation and sensors, for storage, for transport and for compute, all needing IP blocks, speed, low power and security. This is great for Synopsys.
Second, not just chips, systems of chips. While the complexity of a system on a chip continues to grow, the leading edge is moving to systems of chips. By abutting them seamlessly and stacking them on top of each other, massive transistor counts open the door to brand-new functionality. This growing systemic complexity is great for Synopsys.
Third, chips differentiated by vertical market. Each vertical has its own needs. Automotive has safety requirements. Mobile requires extreme low power. Aerospace and industrial once built in life cycle diagnostics. High-powered new entrants such as hyperscalers and AI design their own chips for super performance. And everybody, be it medical and health markets, financial sector, communications or infrastructure, everybody needs much better security. All of these are disciplines that we have invested in for years. Great for Synopsys.
And lastly, software and silicon are tightly linked and must be tuned for each other: software to be written to consume less power in the chips; chips to be optimized for huge amount of sensor data; software to be debugged on prototypes of chips that have not been built yet to speed time to market; chips to be optimized for blindingly fast computation; and always, software and chips must be secured together. These are all technologies we are leading in. Great for Synopsys. So we're perfectly placed, and our mission is to capitalize the Smart Everything ambitions of our semiconductor partners and vertical customers by delivering 1,000x system performance in this decade. 
In that context, let me share some highlights, beginning with EDA, which delivered another strong quarter both in design and verification. In digital design, proliferation and competitive displacement by our Fusion Design Platform again drove strong growth. In particular, strong momentum for Fusion Compiler. For example, ARM is leveraging Fusion Compiler on its next-generation Neoverse V1 and M2 infrastructure cores. Fusion Compiler was also selected for advanced mobile designs at Samsung driven by superior throughput and performance per watt results. Our momentum in the most advanced 3-nanometer node is also evident with 5 new test chip tape-outs at processor, graphics and mobile technology leaders as well as next wave 3-nanometer adopters. 
We see strong innovation and market disruption with our Custom Design Platform as well. In Q2, we announced our PrimeSim Continuum platform for analog, mixed signal simulation. With the industry's brand-new graphics processor base acceleration, it cuts time to results by 10x. Endorsed by Samsung Electronics, NVIDIA and Kioxia, PrimeSim delivers significant productivity gains at companies such as Nanya Technology, where it is deployed on DRAM design. In addition, we again secured multiple full-flow displacements in the quarter, including another large analog design company in Japan.
In verification software, we have strong growth with our Verification Continuum Platform driven by adoption momentum with hyperscalers. Our hardware verification solutions drove excellent results as well, including 14 new logos and more than 50 repeat orders in Q2. Fueling our ongoing strong growth is continuous innovation, including new turbocharged application-specific emulation systems, 2 of which went to market in the quarter.
The ZeBu Empower emulation system lets customers perform power analysis earlier in the design cycle, dramatically reducing power-related risks. Also, just last week, we launched ZeBu EP1, the industry's first ultrafast 10-megahertz emulation system. It targets high-performance compute for 5G, GPU, AI and automotive, handling designs up to 2 billion gates. 
We also shipped the latest generation of prototyping HAPS-100. With the fastest performance and unmatched enterprise scalability, it accelerates software development, system validation and verification. Customers like NVIDIA and Furiosa are already relying on HAPS-100 for their most demanding projects.
Now to IP, which again achieved excellent revenue growth driven by technical leadership and strong market dynamics. In Q2, we extended our advantage in the high-performance compute market. We acquired MorethanIP and its 400-gig, 800-gig Ethernet controllers. Combined with our existing 112-gig Ethernet PHY, we now offer a full Ethernet solution for high-performance data center applications.
Advancing our lead in next-generation PCI Express interfaces, we delivered the industry's first complete PCI Express 6.0 IP solution. Needed for huge bandwidth demand, we see strong market traction with leading customers. And in addition to the EDA adoption I referenced earlier, we announced a strategic collaboration with ARM to closely align product road maps and enhance our interface IP solutions with specific features for the Arm Neoverse platform.
Our interface and foundation IP are also gaining broad industry adoption on the advanced 5-nanometer FinFET process driven by vertical segments such as high-performance compute, automotive and AI. More than 20 leading semiconductor companies use our 5-nanometer IP with multiple first-pass silicon successes, attesting to the robustness and reliability of our portfolio.
Lastly, to address the above-mentioned safety and security requirements for automotive, we launched a new DesignWare Hardware Secure Module and ARC Safety and Security Processor IP solutions with integrated functional safety features.
Let me now turn to 2 exciting and disruptive technologies we recently introduced. First is DSO.ai, our award-winning AI-powered design system that hits right at the foundation of the new growth era, very complex chips. DSO.ai autonomously searches the vast design space for optimal solutions in terms of chip performance, power and area. It does this using very sophisticated machine learning. This not only substantially accelerates the schedule of human design teams, but it enables them to push the technology envelope towards better solutions. 
The improvements and results over the last 2 quarters have been extraordinary. One example is a very large influential U.S. company who reported what I like to call a productivity world record. On a leading-edge chip, a single engineer using DSO.ai was able to achieve in weeks what typically takes an entire team months to complete. Another global leader recently highlighted unprecedented 3x designer productivity and meeting timing specs weeks ahead of schedule. Results like these are driving notable adoptions. For example, Renesas now uses DSO.ai for its advanced automotive chip design environment.
The other innovation push is our Silicon Life Cycle Management Platform, or SLM for short. This end-to-end solution monitors, analyzes and optimizes chips as they are designed, manufactured, tested and deployed in the field. SLM leverages our long-standing unique expertise to give customers visibility into performance, reliability, safety and security issues for chip's entire lifespan. We're actively engaged with multiple customers at 5- and 3-nanometer that seek to use SLM to optimize their design flow with data collected during test.
The vertical market pull by hyperscalers, for example, is a strong driver of important adoptions. In Q2, 10 new customers adopted a variety of SLM capabilities. Several of them, having adopted one element of our portfolio, are already broadening to other aspects of our platform. Stay tuned as we continue to roll out new capabilities.
Now to Software Integrity, which had another very solid quarter towards meeting its financial '21 goal and accelerating growth. Revenue was ahead of plan in every region, reflecting strong orders momentum. We're seeing good results from the changes we've made in our go-to-market strategy and execution. In Q2, we added 100 new logos, and retention exceeded our targets.
The services business was particularly strong and is driving comprehensive service plus products engagements. A great example is an important multimillion-dollar new business win with a large transportation company who replaced incumbent products with Synopsys for the end-to-end value we provide.
We also launched our channel partner program to expand our reach into geographies and verticals not currently touched through direct sales. The benefits are apparent. For example, we closed a multimillion-dollar new adoption in South America, where we didn't have any selling capability 6 months ago.
On the technology front, we delivered a significant enhancement to our Polaris platform, Intelligent Orchestration. It's a set of processes within Polaris that run parallel to our customers' DevOps pipelines. Intelligent Orchestration communicates and automates security testing in synchronization with each company's specific protocol and is built for easier and efficient integration into their development pipeline. The opportunity in this space is vast, and we're encouraged by the steady progress the team is making.
In summary, we delivered an outstanding Q2 and are raising our outlook for fiscal '21. Our markets are strong, reflecting extensive customer investments in critical chip and system designs with an increasing need for safety and security. As we look beyond this year's $4 billion revenue milestone, we see a new era at the intersection of silicon and software that will deliver Smart Everything to all vertical market segments. We see technology challenges that demands the cooperation and teamwork around many complex disciplines, disciplines we are strong in. And we see Synopsys in the midst of this vision as a well-equipped catalyst to our customers and partners' success.
Finally, I want to recognize the efforts of our global team who over the past 1.5 years have adopted and succeeded despite upheaval and uncertainty. Thank you all for your solidarity and hard work.
With that, I'll turn it over to Trac."

As we report another outstanding quarter, let me echo Aart's thanks to our team not only for their dedication but also for their unwavering focus on innovation to fuel the exciting opportunities we have ahead. 
We are in a great position as we set our sights on the next level financial ambitions. On top of a solid foundation of nearly 90% recurring revenue, a diverse and growing customer base and market and technology leadership, our track record of excellent execution continued in Q2. We are increasingly confident in our outlook and are raising our revenue, non-GAAP earnings, non-GAAP operating margin and cash flow guidance for the year.
Now to our second quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated.
We generated total revenue of $1.024 billion, up 19% and above our target range, driven by broad-based strength across product groups and geographies. Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was $930 million, with strong growth in both EDA, software and hardware and IP. Software Integrity segment revenue was $94 million. The positive orders momentum we saw in the quarter shows that the adjustments we've made in the business are taking hold. We are on track to meet our 2021 expectations of 15% to 20% orders growth and to exit the year with double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We're on a good path to accelerate revenue growth back to the 15% to 20% range long term.
Moving on to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $830 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $707 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 31%. We are on track to again deliver operating margin expansion for the year and are raising the bottom end of our guidance range. Adjusted operating margin for the Semiconductor & System Design segment was 33%, and Software Integrity margin was 9%.
Finally, GAAP earnings per share were $1.24, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.70, well above our target range.
Turning to cash. We generated a record $526 million in operating cash flow. We completed $145 million of stock buybacks, bringing the total for the year to $398 million. And we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.46 billion and total debt of $116 million.
Now to guidance. For fiscal 2021, revenue of $4.035 billion to $4.085 billion, an increase of $35 million, representing double-digit growth; total GAAP costs and expenses between $3.241 billion and $3.286 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.835 billion and $2.865 billion; a non-GAAP operating margin of 29.5% to 30%; other income and expenses between minus $5 million and minus $9 million; non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; GAAP earnings of $4.55 to $4.72 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $6.38 to $6.45 per share, representing mid-teens growth; cash flow from operations of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion; and capital expenditures of approximately $100 million.
Targets for the third quarter are: revenue between $1.03 billion and $1.06 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $807 million and $825 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $707 million and $717 million; GAAP earnings of $1.30 to $1.41 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $1.75 to $1.80 per share.
Our track record is reflective of how we intend to manage the business to exceed the Rule of 40. Based on a vibrant market opportunity, our strong portfolio and our excellent execution, we see an opportunity to accelerate revenue growth and expand non-GAAP operating margin beyond 30%. Our long-term financial objective is to manage to Rule of 45 over the next several years, and we will provide additional details once our long-term planning process is complete.
In conclusion, we delivered strong revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth and record operating cash flow. Our strength is broad-based across product groups and geographies, and we are raising our guidance for the year. At the same time, we continue to develop and deliver transformative innovations that enable our customers' endeavors and position us well for many years to come.

Well, there's 2 ways to look at this, from the perspective of the vertical or from the perspective of the pure semiconductor companies. From the vertical, the first thing that people need to choose is, will they design their own chips, yes or no. And if you take the example of the hyperscalers, some, not all, but some of the automotive companies, the hyperscalers clearly are doing more and more of their own chip design. And automotive are either sort of doubling in it or looking at some of their suppliers, the Tier 1s. In all cases, they are doing more chip design. And so that is good news for us. And absolutely, you're right that a lot of that design is done by substantial IP reuse, and you saw that our IP business is strong. 
Now if you sit on the other side of the fence as a semiconductor provider, you look at these customers are -- each of them as opportunities to take sort of a core architecture and then say, ""Well, how do I take my architecture and do different derivatives that are particularly good for different submarkets and essentially reuse some IP or add some that are just -- that is just necessary for that vertical?"" And so I think there's no doubt that, therefore, we will see more chips of different type and more design. In all cases, consumption of IP will continue to grow."

But the shortages should not be just interpreted, I think, as a reaction to a market that has been partially asleep during the COVID time and now is obviously catching up. And automotive is the best example because the mistake that was made there is they stopped ordering. And in the past, they were very powerful, and everybody jumped when they need something. Now there was just no capacity left. And the reason there's no capacity left is because all the capacity is used by huge demand period. 
And that's why I'm trying to differentiate a little bit with the temporary demand that comes out of sort of just this historical 1.5-year wave versus, I think, something that is much more profound, which is a whole new era of semiconductors impacting verticals. And I expect that to continue. And by the way, you can see how many, many places, including countries have decided to substantially increase the capacity. Those increases will take a couple of years to actually have impact. But they do illustrate the direction that our field is taking."

Let me start with SLM because what's interesting about SLM is this word life cycle because if you just take a chip and you say, put it in a phone or put it in a car, we all know which one has the longer life cycle. And so -- and in the case of the car, you have, of course, safety that is part of it. 
And so suddenly, the ability to put inside of the chip sensors and the diagnostic system that, by the way, gets trained by AI so that a chip can self-diagnose as, well, I'm not feeling so good. You better start stopping the car, so to speak, is going to be a very high value. Maybe even more practical immediately is in cloud centers, where people run compute at the max speed and they want to know is a certain set of process is going to go down so that I replace them before it happens. So in essence, preventive maintenance. 
And so in that sense, SLM is interesting because we touch these chips literally at the early days of even what are the type of transistors. So very minute physics, but now we also have very meaningful interaction with very large companies that are exactly in those verticals I described. 
Now DSO.ai, I think, is breakthrough technology. And it's always difficult to compare something that we did over 30 years ago. But the early days of Synthesis had something similar, which is it took a set of human tasks where complexity just was outrunning the human and automated it. And overnight, we could do circuits that were better than what a human could do in a fraction of the time, and we're faster and smaller. 
Now we're talking of entire chip pieces, very large designs with many, many different constraints. And the fact that we can take tasks that take people multiple months and bring them down literally to a few weeks with fewer people and, in the last few quarters, even better results certainly sounds very similar. But to me, it's sort of essentially 30 years later, many orders of magnitude more complexity. And I think it fits well the very moment where the semiconductor industry will want to do many more chips for all these verticals. 
And so we use sometimes the front line of using AI to design AI chips, but that is exactly what this is. And it's exciting. We're just at the beginning of that, but the impact is already economically felt by the users."

Well, all of these words are encouraging because I certainly believe that while it's not a panacea to all human problems by any means, it has enormous power to evolve all vertical fields.

We've heard similar remarks from you and others in the industry for some time now or silicon renaissance and so forth. The question is how that affects your business profile specifically with respect to services. That is to say as you move into this new era, does this tend to increase the kind of services and AE support that you necessarily have to provide to encompass or support this new era? And if so, what could be the margin implications of having to provide that incrementally higher degree of support? 
Relatedly with respect to the next generation of chips, the domain-specific chips that you talked about now for actually 2 or 3 years, what does that mean during the design process in terms of license consumption? If we think about your model as now prospectively a kind of consumption model, as is often the case in simulation, do you think that the consumption or utilization intensity per design, per run, however you want to think about it, necessarily goes up?"

But been there, done that. And by the way, that will continue for a while. 
What makes systemic complexity interesting is that you get multiple players intersecting. Certainly, you have companies that are sitting on these verticals that are highly interested in knowing how the chips will actually work because they write their own software, for example. And vice versa, the people providing chips are really interested. So what software does this car manufacturer really want to run on it that has to be really fast so that I can change the architecture of my chip to accommodate that? 
And our role is interestingly broadened because we're sitting at the intersection of all of that. And you may recall that a number of years ago, under our logo, we literally put silicon to software. Well, that was essentially the summary at that time of this vision that there's a continuum that ultimately brings the power of chips to end users that have -- that are not really interested in chips, except that they need them to get smart outcomes. 
And so when you move into that space, it's not so much that support is increasing but that there are new service opportunities as the number of new players initially may not know so much about these domains but they know a lot about their opportunity space and helping them connect is an opportunity that will continue to grow for us. And we will certainly be able to manage it so that, including with the tools, the profitability will be very reasonable or even good. 
The second part of your question, which ties directly to this, is this notion of domain specific. And if I can take one example that is well understood and yet in its infancy, is automotive. And as you know, a number of years ago, a car started to think about this whole notion of autonomous driving or, at least at the beginning, defensive driving. And chip manufacturers quickly figured out that there may be a long-term big opportunity there, except automotive guys also have rules such as safety rules. And they've had those for a long, long time. 
Some are simple. Some are becoming very complex. And certainly, what does it mean? Well, it means for companies such as Synopsys that we have a whole effort on the IP side and on the tool side to build in what's called FuSa, Functional Safety. And this is partially mandated by the automotive guys. Partially, it is being developed on the fly with the complexity. 
And so these are great opportunities for us because our IP collection, we must have invested in Functional Safety, there for 5 or 6 years. It's an enormous amount of effort, but now that we have that, it's a great differentiation. And so I see our role to be very much a catalyst in the middle of these different factions that we all understand. And I think there will be more and more verticals that will engage suddenly at high speed and the race is on."

Or how do you see kind of the TAM for that trailing edge market over the next several years?"

But the other comment would be different foundries are sort of also focusing on different type nodes. Some focus mostly on the most advanced nodes. Other would be sort of in the middle field. And then the truly older trailing edge nodes, they're typically limited by the amount of capacity at 200-millimeter wafers. 
What is interesting in the nodes that are maybe not the leading, leading edge but, let's say, 3, 4 years behind that, there, the application of the newer tools that we have actually has a lot of impact on those, too, because newer tools for older nodes still means a lot better design out of these older nodes. And so it actually gives them a bit of a second life from an efficiency point of view. And as you said, if people can do really well with nodes that have been well honed where the yield is high, the cost equation is very attractive. And we see, for example, one of our most advanced tools, Fusion Compiler, going back to older nodes with some of our customers with great delight."

And there's no question whatsoever that, that is an area that will continue to grow. And we had mentioned in earlier conversation specialties for certain verticals. It's interesting that these are capabilities, Prototyping, that are of high interest in the automotive space, for example, because they start working on the software many, many years before a car is even fully conceived. And so being able to accelerate all of that is of high importance. 
Now underneath that, there is invariably always the same demand, which is make it faster, make it faster. And that is what Emulation and Prototyping is all about. But it's also give it a larger capacity. And it's also are there certain tasks that you would like to accelerate such as the question of, ""Well, if I write my software this way, how much power is it going to consume versus if I write it differently, will I be able to do better?"" Well, those are specialty questions that we now are increasingly answering using Emulation and Prototyping. 
On top of that, we're on the most advanced chips inside of our machines that are available. And so this ability to specialize and optimize for specific applications turns out to be extremely valuable, and we're doing very, very well with that."

Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.
Before commenting on highlights, let me say a few words about the dire situation in South Asia. While parts of the world are progressing well with vaccination, we are seeing an enormous challenge for the people of South Asia. Our top priority is the well-being of our employees, and we have taken many steps to support them and their families. Ranging from orchestrating oxygen concentrators to teaming up with vaccination clinics to ambulance services, food delivery and family health, our objective is to maximally mitigate the impact of COVID and make sure that every employee can call on Synopsys as a beacon of care and solidarity. Despite the pandemic challenges, we are thankful that from a business perspective, we continue to ship our products and support our customers with no material disruptions, and our business is doing well.
Looking at the overall market, demand for semiconductors is very strong. While some of the near-term demand can be attributed to segments such as automotive catching up after a year of COVID slowing, there is an undeniable new wave of growth on the horizon as every vertical market demands machine learning chips to harvest their big data for their specific needs. 
In other words, the early technical successes of machine learning in the cloud are now moving to the edge, attracted by the economic promise of Smart Everything. The technology push has grown into a vertical economic pull. All segments are impacted, and the race is on to provide smart solutions in automotive, health, consumer, 5G and so on. 
This push/pull opens a whole new era for semiconductors and software, and with it, great opportunities for Synopsys. First, the foundational building blocks are complex chips, chips for data generation and sensors, for storage, for transport and for compute, all needing IP blocks, speed, low power and security. This is great for Synopsys.
Second, not just chips, systems of chips. While the complexity of a system on a chip continues to grow, the leading edge is moving to systems of chips. By abutting them seamlessly and stacking them on top of each other, massive transistor counts open the door to brand-new functionality. This growing systemic complexity is great for Synopsys.
Third, chips differentiated by vertical market. Each vertical has its own needs. Automotive has safety requirements. Mobile requires extreme low power. Aerospace and industrial wants built in life cycle diagnostics. High-powered new entrants such as hyperscalers and AI design their own chips for super performance. And everybody, be it medical and health markets, financial sector, communications or infrastructure, everybody needs much better security. All of these are disciplines that we have invested in for years. Great for Synopsys. 
And lastly, software and silicon are tightly linked and must be tuned for each other: software to be written to consume less power in the chips; chips to be optimized for huge amount of sensor data; software to be debugged on prototypes of chips that have not been built yet to speed time to market; chips to be optimized for blindingly fast computation; and always, software and chips must be secured together. These are all technologies we are leading in. Great for Synopsys. So we're perfectly placed, and our mission is to capitalize the Smart Everything ambitions of our semiconductor partners and vertical customers by delivering 1,000x system performance in this decade. 
In that context, let me share some highlights, beginning with EDA, which delivered another strong quarter both in design and verification. In digital design, proliferation and competitive displacement by our Fusion Design Platform again drove strong growth. In particular, strong momentum for Fusion Compiler. 
For example, ARM is leveraging Fusion Compiler on its next-generation Neoverse V1 and N2 infrastructure cores. Fusion Compiler was also selected for advanced mobile designs at Samsung driven by superior throughput and performance per watt results. Our momentum in the most advanced 3-nanometer node is also evident with 5 new test chip tape-outs at processor, graphics and mobile technology leaders as well as next wave 3-nanometer adopters. 
We see strong innovation and market disruption with our Custom Design Platform as well. In Q2, we announced our PrimeSim Continuum platform for analog, mixed signal simulation. With the industry's brand-new graphics processor base acceleration, it cuts time to results by 10x. Endorsed by Samsung Electronics, NVIDIA and Kioxia, PrimeSim delivers significant productivity gains at companies such as Nanya Technology, where it is deployed on DRAM design. In addition, we again secured multiple full-flow displacements in the quarter, including another large analog design company in Japan.
In verification software, we have strong growth with our Verification Continuum Platform driven by adoption momentum with hyperscalers. Our hardware verification solutions drove excellent results as well, including 14 new logos and more than 50 repeat orders in Q2. Fueling our ongoing strong growth is continuous innovation, including new turbocharged application-specific emulation systems, 2 of which went to market in the quarter.
The ZeBu Empower emulation system lets customers perform power analysis earlier in the design cycle, dramatically reducing power-related risks. Also, just last week, we launched ZeBu EP1, the industry's first ultrafast 10-megahertz emulation system. It targets high-performance compute for 5G, GPU, AI and automotive, handling designs up to 2 billion gates. 
We also shipped the latest generation of prototyping HAPS-100. With the fastest performance and unmatched enterprise scalability, it accelerates software development, system validation and verification. Customers like NVIDIA and Furiosa are already relying on HAPS-100 for their most demanding projects.
Now to IP, which again achieved excellent revenue growth driven by technical leadership and strong market dynamics. In Q2, we extended our advantage in the high-performance compute market. We acquired MorethanIP and its 400-gig, 800-gig Ethernet controllers. Combined with our existing 112-gig Ethernet PHY, we now offer a full Ethernet solution for high-performance data center applications.
Advancing our lead in next-generation PCI Express interfaces, we delivered the industry's first complete PCI Express 6.0 IP solution. Needed for huge bandwidth demand, we see strong market traction with leading customers. And in addition to the EDA adoption I referenced earlier, we announced a strategic collaboration with ARM to closely align product road maps and enhance our interface IP solutions with specific features for the Arm Neoverse platform.
Our interface and foundation IP are also gaining broad industry adoption on the advanced 5-nanometer FinFET process driven by vertical segments such as high-performance compute, automotive and AI. More than 20 leading semiconductor companies use our 5-nanometer IP with multiple first-pass silicon successes, attesting to the robustness and reliability of our portfolio.
Lastly, to address the above-mentioned safety and security requirements for automotive, we launched a new DesignWare Hardware Secure Module and ARC Safety and Security Processor IP solutions with integrated functional safety features.
Let me now turn to 2 exciting and disruptive technologies we recently introduced. First is DSO.ai, our award-winning AI-powered design system that hits right at the foundation of the new growth era, very complex chips. DSO.ai autonomously searches the vast design space for optimal solutions in terms of chip performance, power and area. It does this using very sophisticated machine learning. This not only substantially accelerates the schedule of human design teams, but it enables them to push the technology envelope towards better solutions. 
The improvements and results over the last 2 quarters have been extraordinary. One example is a very large influential U.S. company who reported what I like to call a productivity world record. On a leading-edge chip, a single engineer using DSO.ai was able to achieve in weeks what typically takes an entire team months to complete. Another global leader recently highlighted unprecedented 3x designer productivity and meeting timing specs weeks ahead of schedule. Results like these are driving notable adoptions. For example, Renesas now uses DSO.ai for its advanced automotive chip design environment.
The other innovation push is our Silicon Life Cycle Management Platform, or SLM for short. This end-to-end solution monitors, analyzes and optimizes chips as they are designed, manufactured, tested and deployed in the field. SLM leverages our long-standing unique expertise to give customers visibility into performance, reliability, safety and security issues for chip's entire lifespan. We're actively engaged with multiple customers at 5- and 3-nanometer that seek to use SLM to optimize their design flow with data collected during test.
The vertical market pull by hyperscalers, for example, is a strong driver of important adoptions. In Q2, 10 new customers adopted a variety of SLM capabilities. Several of them, having adopted one element of our portfolio, are already broadening to other aspects of our platform. Stay tuned as we continue to roll out new capabilities.
Now to Software Integrity, which had another very solid quarter towards meeting its financial '21 goal and accelerating growth. Revenue was ahead of plan in every region, reflecting strong orders momentum. We're seeing good results from the changes we've made in our go-to-market strategy and execution. In Q2, we added 100 new logos, and retention exceeded our targets.
The services business was particularly strong and is driving comprehensive service plus products engagements. A great example is an important multimillion-dollar new business win with a large transportation company who replaced incumbent products with Synopsys for the end-to-end value we provide.
We also launched our channel partner program to expand our reach into geographies and verticals not currently touched through direct sales. The benefits are apparent. For example, we closed a multimillion-dollar new adoption in South America, where we didn't have any selling capability 6 months ago.
On the technology front, we delivered a significant enhancement to our Polaris platform, Intelligent Orchestration. It's a set of processes within Polaris that run parallel to our customers' DevOps pipelines. Intelligent Orchestration communicates and automates security testing in synchronization with each company's specific protocol and is built for easier and efficient integration into their development pipeline. The opportunity in this space is vast, and we're encouraged by the steady progress the team is making.
In summary, we delivered an outstanding Q2 and are raising our outlook for fiscal '21. Our markets are strong, reflecting extensive customer investments in critical chip and system designs with an increasing need for safety and security. As we look beyond this year's $4 billion revenue milestone, we see a new era at the intersection of silicon and software that will deliver Smart Everything to all vertical market segments. We see technology challenges that demands the cooperation and teamwork around many complex disciplines, disciplines we are strong in. And we see Synopsys in the midst of this vision as a well-equipped catalyst to our customers and partners' success.
Finally, I want to recognize the efforts of our global team who over the past 1.5 years have adopted and succeeded despite upheaval and uncertainty. Thank you all for your solidarity and hard work.
With that, I'll turn it over to Trac."

On top of a solid foundation of nearly 90% recurring revenue, a diverse and growing customer base and market and technology leadership, our track record of excellent execution continued in Q2. We are increasingly confident in our outlook and are raising our revenue, non-GAAP earnings, non-GAAP operating margin and cash flow guidance for the year.
Now to our second quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated.
We generated total revenue of $1.024 billion, up 19% and above our target range, driven by broad-based strength across product groups and geographies. Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was $930 million, with strong growth in both EDA, software and hardware and IP. Software Integrity segment revenue was $94 million. The positive orders momentum we saw in the quarter shows that the adjustments we've made in the business are taking hold. We are on track to meet our 2021 expectations of 15% to 20% orders growth and to exit the year with double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We're on a good path to accelerate revenue growth back to the 15% to 20% range long term.
Moving on to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $830 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $707 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 31%. We are on track to again deliver operating margin expansion for the year and are raising the bottom end of our guidance range. Adjusted operating margin for the Semiconductor & System Design segment was 33%, and Software Integrity margin was 9%.
Finally, GAAP earnings per share were $1.24, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.70, well above our target range.
Turning to cash. We generated a record $526 million in operating cash flow. We completed $145 million of stock buybacks, bringing the total for the year to $398 million. And we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.46 billion and total debt of $116 million.
Now to guidance. For fiscal 2021, revenue of $4.035 billion to $4.085 billion, an increase of $35 million, representing double-digit growth; total GAAP costs and expenses between $3.241 billion and $3.286 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.835 billion and $2.865 billion; a non-GAAP operating margin of 29.5% to 30%; other income and expenses between minus $5 million and minus $9 million; non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; GAAP earnings of $4.55 to $4.72 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $6.38 to $6.45 per share, representing mid-teens growth; cash flow from operations of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion; and capital expenditures of approximately $100 million.
Targets for the third quarter are: revenue between $1.03 billion and $1.06 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $807 million and $825 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $707 million and $717 million; GAAP earnings of $1.30 to $1.41 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $1.75 to $1.80 per share.
Our track record is reflective of how we intend to manage the business to exceed the Rule of 40. Based on a vibrant market opportunity, our strong portfolio and our excellent execution, we see an opportunity to accelerate revenue growth and expand non-GAAP operating margin beyond 30%. Our long-term financial objective is to manage to Rule of 45 over the next several years, and we will provide additional details once our long-term planning process is complete.
In conclusion, we delivered strong revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth and record operating cash flow. Our strength is broad-based across product groups and geographies, and we are raising our guidance for the year. At the same time, we continue to develop and deliver transformative innovations that enable our customers' endeavors and position us well for many years to come.
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

I'm just curious, how do we scale the benefits of those -- I'm sorry, not scale -- square the benefits of those differentiations with the fact that there's -- there tends to be more increased IP usage from some of these newer entrants? And so I'm just curious, with differentiation seeming to lead to more custom design, what does that mean for those IP blocks that get designed once and used by many?"

Well, there's 2 ways to look at this, from the perspective of the vertical or from the perspective of the pure semiconductor companies. From the vertical, the first thing that people need to choose is, will they design their own chips, yes or no. 
And if you take the example of the hyperscalers, some, not all, but some of the automotive companies, the hyperscalers clearly are doing more and more of their own chip design. And automotive are either sort of dabbling in it or looking at some of their suppliers, the Tier 1s. In all cases, they are doing more chip design. And so that is good news for us. And absolutely, you're right that a lot of that design is done by substantial IP reuse, and you saw that our IP business is strong. 
Now if you sit on the other side of the fence as a semiconductor provider, you look at these customers are -- each of them as opportunities to take sort of a core architecture and then say, ""Well, how do I take my architecture and do different derivatives that are particularly good for different submarkets and essentially reuse some IP or add some that are just -- that is just necessary for that vertical?"" And so I think there's no doubt that, therefore, we will see more chips of different type and more design. In all cases, consumption of IP will continue to grow."

So there's a number of different factors.
The backlog -- I would translate the increase in backlog to whether the business is healthy or not. The backlog increased this quarter as a function of the renewals that we had planned. But overall, the business that we did book saw very good run rate growth. And the growth in that business gave us really strong outlook for the year and confidence in the year."

There are some people that do take existing chips and decide that they're going to do modification so that they can get more capacity with another vendor. People really hate to do that because it's a lot of work and no direct benefit, except that if you can ship to a customer, that's great. But it takes some time. 
And so I don't think that, that is going to be a particularly strong driver. But the shortages should not be just interpreted, I think, as a reaction to a market that has been partially asleep during the COVID time and now is obviously catching up. And automotive is the best example because the mistake that was made there is they stopped ordering. And in the past, they were very powerful, and everybody jumped when they needed something. Now there was just no capacity left. And the reason there's no capacity left is because all the capacity is used by huge demand period. 
And that's why I'm trying to differentiate a little bit with the temporary demand that comes out of sort of just this historical 1.5-year wave versus, I think, something that is much more profound, which is a whole new era of semiconductors impacting verticals. And I expect that to continue. And by the way, you can see how many, many places, including countries have decided to substantially increase the capacity. Those increases will take a couple of years to actually have impact. But they do illustrate the direction that our field is taking."

Is there a way to characterize or maybe compare to products in your past and the consequence of these new technologies? Is this just the natural evolution of Synopsys? Or is there something different?

Let me start with SLM because what's interesting about SLM is this word life cycle. Because if you just take a chip and you say, put it in a phone or put it in a car, we all know which one has the longer life cycle. And so -- and in the case of the car, you have, of course, safety that is part of it. 
And so suddenly, the ability to put inside of the chip sensors and the diagnostic system that, by the way, gets trained by AI so that a chip can self-diagnose as, well, I'm not feeling so good. You better start stopping the car, so to speak, is going to be a very high value. Maybe even more practical immediately is in cloud centers, where people run compute at the max speed and they want to know is a certain set of processors going to go down so that I replace them before it happens. So in essence, preventive maintenance. 
And so in that sense, SLM is interesting because we touch these chips literally at the early days of even what are the type of transistors. So very minute physics, but now we also have very meaningful interaction with very large companies that are exactly in those verticals I described. 
Now DSO.ai, I think, is breakthrough technology. And it's always difficult to compare something that we did over 30 years ago. But the early days of Synthesis had something similar, which is it took a set of human tasks where complexity just was outrunning the human and automated it. And overnight, we could do circuits that were better than what a human could do in a fraction of the time, and were faster and smaller. 
Now we're talking of entire chip pieces, very large designs with many, many different constraints. And the fact that we can take tasks that take people multiple months and bring them down literally to a few weeks with fewer people and, in the last few quarters, even better results certainly sounds very similar. But to me, it's sort of essentially 30 years later, many orders of magnitude more complexity. And I think it fits well the very moment where the semiconductor industry will want to do many more chips for all these verticals. 
And so we use sometimes the front line of using AI to design AI chips, but that is exactly what this is. And it's exciting. We're just at the beginning of that, but the impact is already economically felt by the users."

But I think the most interesting part of all of this is that there is gradually now a broader understanding that the whole next wave of human products impact and so on is very, very much linked to the notion of big data intersecting with AI, i.e., smart results. And it's interesting that now even electronics are referred to as infrastructure in a country. Well, all of these words are encouraging because I certainly believe that while it's not a panacea to all human problems by any means, it has enormous power to evolve all vertical fields.

But overall, what you're seeing in the results for this year and last year really is why we feel really optimistic about the future and why we have communicated our confidence in being able to drive the business towards a Rule of 45. And that's really going to come through a combination of really strong revenue growth and margin expansion.
And so you've touched on it a little bit. You're seeing some really good acceleration in the business. And as Software Integrity ramps up and gets back to where we believe it's capable of operating at, that should help with the overall mix. But keep in mind, it's only 10% of the business. The overall growth rate is a reflection of what we're -- how well we're doing in EDA and IP as well."

The",195,"Aart, let me ask you 2 related questions regarding the evolution of EDA and your markets. Tonight, you referred to a new era of EDA. We've heard similar remarks from you and others in the industry for some time now or silicon renaissance and so forth. The question is how that affects your business profile specifically with respect to services. That is to say as you move into this new era, does this tend to increase the kind of services and AE support that you necessarily have to provide to encompass or support this new era? And if so, what could be the margin implications of having to provide that incrementally higher degree of support? 
Relatedly with respect to the next generation of chips, the domain-specific chips that you talked about now for actually 2 or 3 years, what does that mean during the design process in terms of license consumption? If we think about your model as now prospectively a kind of consumption model, as is often the case in simulation, do you think that the consumption or utilization intensity per design, per run, however you want to think about it, necessarily goes up?"

But been there, done that. And by the way, that will",546,"Well, I think your question brings sort of together everything that we would refer to as systemic complexity, meaning that, of course, chips continue to be more complex and bigger and more transistors. But been there, done that. And by the way, that will continue for a while. 
What makes systemic complexity interesting is that you get multiple players intersecting. Suddenly you have companies that are sitting on these verticals that are highly interested in knowing how the chips will actually work because they write their own software, for example. And vice versa, the people providing chips are really interested. So what software does this car manufacturer really want to run on it that has to be really fast so that I can change the architecture of my chip to accommodate that? 
And our role is interestingly broadened because we're sitting at the intersection of all of that. And you may recall that a number of years ago, under our logo, we literally put silicon to software. Well, that was essentially the summary at that time of this vision that there's a continuum that ultimately brings the power of chips to end users that have -- that are not really interested in chips, except that they need them to get smart outcomes. 
And so when you move into that space, it's not so much that support is increasing but that there are new service opportunities as a number of new players initially may not know so much about these domains but they know a lot about their opportunity space and helping them connect is an opportunity that will continue to grow for us. And we will certainly be able to manage it so that, including with the tools, the profitability will be very reasonable or even good. 
The second part of your question, which ties directly to this, is this notion of domain specific. And if I can take one example that is well understood and yet in its infancy, is automotive. And as you know, a number of years ago, a car started to think about this whole notion of autonomous driving or, at least at the beginning, defensive driving. And chip manufacturers quickly figured out that there may be a long-term big opportunity there, except automotive guys also have rules such as safety rules. And they've had those for a long, long time. 
Some are simple. Some are becoming very complex. And certainly, what does it mean? Well, it means for companies such as Synopsys that we have a whole effort on the IP side and on the tool side to build in what's called FuSa, Functional Safety. And this is partially mandated by the automotive guys. Partially, it is being developed on the fly with the complexity. 
And so these are great opportunities for us because our IP collection, we must have invested in Functional Safety, there for 5 or 6 years. It's an enormous amount of effort, but now that we have that, it's a great differentiation. And so I see our role to be very much a catalyst in the middle of these different factions that we all understand. And I think there will be more and more verticals that will engage suddenly at high speed and the race is on."

And relative to that full year guide, you are kind of embedding a pretty -- a meaningful deceleration, if not in top line, in EPS. Is this nothing more than normal conservatism?

We feel really good about the momentum we have in the business. And that's reflected in the full year guide. 
We've always cautioned that the quarter-on-quarter profile is going to move depending on what the profile of revenue is. And from a revenue perspective, I'm actually really, really pleased with how linear it is this year and the fact that we were able to get half -- almost half the business booked in the first half of the year. So it's a great profile with really good visibility. 
We continue to ramp up hiring in the second half. And so you're going to see the expense profile go up. But as we're ramping up hiring in the second half, we're mindful of the trajectory and what it implies for our ability to continue to drive margin expansion over time. So we're very cognizant of that. 
But no, there's nothing unusual to the profile. And I wouldn't characterize it as deceleration at all. I think right now, when you look at the year-over-year comparison, just keep in mind that last year was unusually back-end loaded. So it's going to skew the comparisons, particularly in the second half."

As existing foundries kind of move from region to region, is there sort of redundant or duplicative spend on the EDA, kind of question number one?

So we touched manufacturing a little bit because we have a number of tools that are designed specifically under the topic of silicon engineering to help optimize circuitry and chips for manufacturing efficiency and yield. But you're absolutely right that most of the investments on sheer capacity don't touch us so much, except if people want to enter the business such as be in a foundry or go after specific segments of the market that they didn't go before. There, certainly our tools matter a great deal to help them get there. 
In general though, when volume increases, with it, also the number of designs increases. And so the advances in sheer silicon technology and the number of designs are actually very positive at this point in time. And the fact that more people want to be in the manufacturing means that more people are also into the investment of R&D around the field. So at this point in time, it's all positive."

But the other comment would be different foundries are sort of also focusing on different type nodes. Some focus mostly on the most advanced nodes. Other would be sort of in the middle field. And then the truly older trailing edge nodes, they're typically limited by the amount of capacity at 200-millimeter wafers. 
What is interesting in the nodes that are maybe not the leading, leading edge but, let's say, 3, 4 years behind that, there, the application of the newer tools that we have actually has a lot of impact on those, too, because newer tools for older nodes still means a lot better design out of these older nodes. And so it actually gives them a bit of a second life from an efficiency point of view. And as you said, if people can do really well with nodes that have been well honed where the yield is high, the cost equation is very attractive. And we see, for example, one of our most advanced tools, Fusion Compiler, going back to older nodes with some of our customers with great delight."

I'm happy to report outstanding second quarter results, exceeding all of our key guidance metrics. We delivered revenue of $1.024 billion with GAAP earnings per share of $1.24 and non-GAAP earnings of $1.70.
Business was strong across all product groups and geographies. We continue to make good progress on our margin expansion goal and generated record operating cash flow of $526 million. As a result of our first half strength and growing confidence in our year, we are raising guidance for revenue, non-GAAP ops margin, earnings and cash flow. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.
Before commenting on highlights, let me say a few words about the dire situation in South Asia. While parts of the world are progressing well with vaccination, we are seeing an enormous challenge for the people of South Asia. Our top priority is the well-being of our employees, and we have taken many steps to support them and their families. Ranging from orchestrating oxygen concentrators to teaming up with vaccination clinics to ambulance services, food delivery and family health, our objective is to maximally mitigate the impact of COVID and make sure that every employee can call on Synopsys as a beacon of care and solidarity. Despite the pandemic challenges, we are thankful that from a business perspective, we continue to ship our products and support our customers with no material disruptions, and our business is doing well.
Looking at the overall market, demand for semiconductors is very strong. While some of the near-term demand can be attributed to segments such as automotive catching up after a year of COVID slowing, there is an undeniable new wave of growth on the horizon as every vertical market demands machine learning chips to harvest their big data for their specific needs. 
In other words, the early technical successes of machine learning in the cloud are now moving to the edge, attracted by the economic promise of Smart Everything. The technology push has grown into a vertical economic pull. All segments are impacted, and the race is on to provide smart solutions in automotive, health, consumer, 5G and so on. 
This push/pull opens a whole new era for semiconductors and software, and with it, great opportunities for Synopsys. First, the foundational building blocks are complex chips, chips for data generation and sensors, for storage, for transport and for compute, all needing IP blocks, speed, low power and security. This is great for Synopsys.
Second, not just chips, systems of chips. While the complexity of a system on a chip continues to grow, the leading edge is moving to systems of chips. By abutting them seamlessly and stacking them on top of each other, massive transistor counts open the door to brand-new functionality. This growing systemic complexity is great for Synopsys.
Third, chips differentiated by vertical market. Each vertical has its own needs. Automotive has safety requirements. Mobile requires extreme low power. Aerospace and industrial wants built in life cycle diagnostics. High-powered new entrants such as hyperscalers and AI design their own chips for super performance. And everybody, be it medical and health markets, financial sector, communications or infrastructure, everybody needs much better security. All of these are disciplines that we have invested in for years. Great for Synopsys. 
And lastly, software and silicon are tightly linked and must be tuned for each other: software to be written to consume less power in the chips; chips to be optimized for huge amount of sensor data; software to be debugged on prototypes of chips that have not been built yet to speed time to market; chips to be optimized for blindingly fast computation; and always, software and chips must be secured together. These are all technologies we are leading in. Great for Synopsys. So we're perfectly placed, and our mission is to capitalize the Smart Everything ambitions of our semiconductor partners and vertical customers by delivering 1,000x system performance in this decade. 
In that context, let me share some highlights, beginning with EDA, which delivered another strong quarter both in design and verification. In digital design, proliferation and competitive displacement by our Fusion Design Platform again drove strong growth. In particular, strong momentum for Fusion Compiler. 
For example, ARM is leveraging Fusion Compiler on its next-generation Neoverse V1 and N2 infrastructure cores. Fusion Compiler was also selected for advanced mobile designs at Samsung driven by superior throughput and performance per watt results. Our momentum in the most advanced 3-nanometer node is also evident with 5 new test chip tape-outs at processor, graphics and mobile technology leaders as well as next wave 3-nanometer adopters. 
We see strong innovation and market disruption with our Custom Design Platform as well. In Q2, we announced our PrimeSim Continuum platform for analog, mixed signal simulation. With the industry's brand-new graphics processor base acceleration, it cuts time to results by 10x. Endorsed by Samsung Electronics, NVIDIA and Kioxia, PrimeSim delivers significant productivity gains at companies such as Nanya Technology, where it is deployed on DRAM design. In addition, we again secured multiple full-flow displacements in the quarter, including another large analog design company in Japan.
In verification software, we have strong growth with our Verification Continuum Platform driven by adoption momentum with hyperscalers. Our hardware verification solutions drove excellent results as well, including 14 new logos and more than 50 repeat orders in Q2. Fueling our ongoing strong growth is continuous innovation, including new turbocharged application-specific emulation systems, 2 of which went to market in the quarter.
The ZeBu Empower emulation system lets customers perform power analysis earlier in the design cycle, dramatically reducing power-related risks. Also, just last week, we launched ZeBu EP1, the industry's first ultrafast 10-megahertz emulation system. It targets high-performance compute for 5G, GPU, AI and automotive, handling designs up to 2 billion gates. 
We also shipped the latest generation of prototyping HAPS-100. With the fastest performance and unmatched enterprise scalability, it accelerates software development, system validation and verification. Customers like NVIDIA and Furiosa are already relying on HAPS-100 for their most demanding projects.
Now to IP, which again achieved excellent revenue growth driven by technical leadership and strong market dynamics. In Q2, we extended our advantage in the high-performance compute market. We acquired MorethanIP and its 400-gig, 800-gig Ethernet controllers. Combined with our existing 112-gig Ethernet PHY, we now offer a full Ethernet solution for high-performance data center applications.
Advancing our lead in next-generation PCI Express interfaces, we delivered the industry's first complete PCI Express 6.0 IP solution. Needed for huge bandwidth demand, we see strong market traction with leading customers. And in addition to the EDA adoption I referenced earlier, we announced a strategic collaboration with ARM to closely align product road maps and enhance our interface IP solutions with specific features for the Arm Neoverse platform.
Our interface and foundation IP are also gaining broad industry adoption on the advanced 5-nanometer FinFET process driven by vertical segments such as high-performance compute, automotive and AI. More than 20 leading semiconductor companies use our 5-nanometer IP with multiple first-pass silicon successes, attesting to the robustness and reliability of our portfolio.
Lastly, to address the above-mentioned safety and security requirements for automotive, we launched a new DesignWare Hardware Secure Module and ARC Safety and Security Processor IP solutions with integrated functional safety features.
Let me now turn to 2 exciting and disruptive technologies we recently introduced. First is DSO.ai, our award-winning AI-powered design system that hits right at the foundation of the new growth era, very complex chips. DSO.ai autonomously searches the vast design space for optimal solutions in terms of chip performance, power and area. It does this using very sophisticated machine learning. This not only substantially accelerates the schedule of human design teams, but it enables them to push the technology envelope towards better solutions. 
The improvements and results over the last 2 quarters have been extraordinary. One example is a very large influential U.S. company who reported what I like to call a productivity world record. On a leading-edge chip, a single engineer using DSO.ai was able to achieve in weeks what typically takes an entire team months to complete. Another global leader recently highlighted unprecedented 3x designer productivity and meeting timing specs weeks ahead of schedule. Results like these are driving notable adoptions. For example, Renesas now uses DSO.ai for its advanced automotive chip design environment.
The other innovation push is our Silicon Life Cycle Management Platform, or SLM for short. This end-to-end solution monitors, analyzes and optimizes chips as they are designed, manufactured, tested and deployed in the field. SLM leverages our long-standing unique expertise to give customers visibility into performance, reliability, safety and security issues for chip's entire lifespan. We're actively engaged with multiple customers at 5- and 3-nanometer that seek to use SLM to optimize their design flow with data collected during test.
The vertical market pull by hyperscalers, for example, is a strong driver of important adoptions. In Q2, 10 new customers adopted a variety of SLM capabilities. Several of them, having adopted one element of our portfolio, are already broadening to other aspects of our platform. Stay tuned as we continue to roll out new capabilities.
Now to Software Integrity, which had another very solid quarter towards meeting its financial '21 goal and accelerating growth. Revenue was ahead of plan in every region, reflecting strong orders momentum. We're seeing good results from the changes we've made in our go-to-market strategy and execution. In Q2, we added 100 new logos, and retention exceeded our targets.
The services business was particularly strong and is driving comprehensive service plus products engagements. A great example is an important multimillion-dollar new business win with a large transportation company who replaced incumbent products with Synopsys for the end-to-end value we provide.
We also launched our channel partner program to expand our reach into geographies and verticals not currently touched through direct sales. The benefits are apparent. For example, we closed a multimillion-dollar new adoption in South America, where we didn't have any selling capability 6 months ago.
On the technology front, we delivered a significant enhancement to our Polaris platform, Intelligent Orchestration. It's a set of processes within Polaris that run parallel to our customers' DevOps pipelines. Intelligent Orchestration communicates and automates security testing in synchronization with each company's specific protocol and is built for easier and efficient integration into their development pipeline. The opportunity in this space is vast, and we're encouraged by the steady progress the team is making.
In summary, we delivered an outstanding Q2 and are raising our outlook for fiscal '21. Our markets are strong, reflecting extensive customer investments in critical chip and system designs with an increasing need for safety and security. As we look beyond this year's $4 billion revenue milestone, we see a new era at the intersection of silicon and software that will deliver Smart Everything to all vertical market segments. We see technology challenges that demands the cooperation and teamwork around many complex disciplines, disciplines we are strong in. And we see Synopsys in the midst of this vision as a well-equipped catalyst to our customers and partners' success.
Finally, I want to recognize the efforts of our global team who over the past 1.5 years have adopted and succeeded despite upheaval and uncertainty. Thank you all for your solidarity and hard work.
With that, I'll turn it over to Trac."

As we report another outstanding quarter, let me echo Aart's thanks to our team not only for their dedication but also for their unwavering focus on innovation to fuel the exciting opportunities we have ahead. 
We are in a great position as we set our sights on the next level financial ambitions. On top of a solid foundation of nearly 90% recurring revenue, a diverse and growing customer base and market and technology leadership, our track record of excellent execution continued in Q2. We are increasingly confident in our outlook and are raising our revenue, non-GAAP earnings, non-GAAP operating margin and cash flow guidance for the year.
Now to our second quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated.
We generated total revenue of $1.024 billion, up 19% and above our target range, driven by broad-based strength across product groups and geographies. Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was $930 million, with strong growth in both EDA, software and hardware and IP. Software Integrity segment revenue was $94 million. The positive orders momentum we saw in the quarter shows that the adjustments we've made in the business are taking hold. We are on track to meet our 2021 expectations of 15% to 20% orders growth and to exit the year with double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We're on a good path to accelerate revenue growth back to the 15% to 20% range long term.
Moving on to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $830 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $707 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 31%. We are on track to again deliver operating margin expansion for the year and are raising the bottom end of our guidance range. Adjusted operating margin for the Semiconductor & System Design segment was 33%, and Software Integrity margin was 9%.
Finally, GAAP earnings per share were $1.24, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.70, well above our target range.
Turning to cash. We generated a record $526 million in operating cash flow. We completed $145 million of stock buybacks, bringing the total for the year to $398 million. And we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.46 billion and total debt of $116 million.
Now to guidance. For fiscal 2021, revenue of $4.035 billion to $4.085 billion, an increase of $35 million, representing double-digit growth; total GAAP costs and expenses between $3.241 billion and $3.286 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.835 billion and $2.865 billion; a non-GAAP operating margin of 29.5% to 30%; other income and expenses between minus $5 million and minus $9 million; non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; GAAP earnings of $4.55 to $4.72 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $6.38 to $6.45 per share, representing mid-teens growth; cash flow from operations of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion; and capital expenditures of approximately $100 million.
Targets for the third quarter are: revenue between $1.03 billion and $1.06 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $807 million and $825 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $707 million and $717 million; GAAP earnings of $1.30 to $1.41 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $1.75 to $1.80 per share.
Our track record is reflective of how we intend to manage the business to exceed the Rule of 40. Based on a vibrant market opportunity, our strong portfolio and our excellent execution, we see an opportunity to accelerate revenue growth and expand non-GAAP operating margin beyond 30%. Our long-term financial objective is to manage to Rule of 45 over the next several years, and we will provide additional details once our long-term planning process is complete.
In conclusion, we delivered strong revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth and record operating cash flow. Our strength is broad-based across product groups and geographies, and we are raising our guidance for the year. At the same time, we continue to develop and deliver transformative innovations that enable our customers' endeavors and position us well for many years to come.

You talked about the chip differentiation by vertical as a nice tailwind for the company. I'm just curious, how do we scale the benefits of those -- I'm sorry, not scale -- square the benefits of those differentiations with the fact that there's -- there tends to be more increased IP usage from some of these newer entrants? And so I'm just curious, with differentiation seeming to lead to more custom design, what does that mean for those IP blocks that get designed once and used by many?"

Well, there's 2 ways to look at this, from the perspective of the vertical or from the perspective of the pure semiconductor companies. From the vertical, the first thing that people need to choose is, will they design their own chips, yes or no. 
And if you take the example of the hyperscalers, some, not all, but some of the automotive companies, the hyperscalers clearly are doing more and more of their own chip design. And automotive are either sort of dabbling in it or looking at some of their suppliers, the Tier 1s. In all cases, they are doing more chip design. And so that is good news for us. And absolutely, you're right that a lot of that design is done by substantial IP reuse, and you saw that our IP business is strong. 
Now if you sit on the other side of the fence as a semiconductor provider, you look at these customers are -- each of them as opportunities to take sort of a core architecture and then say, ""Well, how do I take my architecture and do different derivatives that are particularly good for different submarkets and essentially reuse some IP or add some that are just -- that is just necessary for that vertical?"" And so I think there's no doubt that, therefore, we will see more chips of different type and more design. In all cases, consumption of IP will continue to grow."

There are some people that do take existing chips and decide that they're going to do modification so that they can get more capacity with another vendor. People really hate to do that because it's a lot of work and no direct benefit, except that if you can ship to a customer, that's great. But it takes some time. 
And so I don't think that, that is going to be a particularly strong driver. But the shortages should not be just interpreted, I think, as a reaction to a market that has been partially asleep during the COVID time and now is obviously catching up. And automotive is the best example because the mistake that was made there is they stopped ordering. And in the past, they were very powerful, and everybody jumped when they needed something. Now there was just no capacity left. And the reason there's no capacity left is because all the capacity is used by huge demand period. 
And that's why I'm trying to differentiate a little bit with the temporary demand that comes out of sort of just this historical 1.5-year wave versus, I think, something that is much more profound, which is a whole new era of semiconductors impacting verticals. And I expect that to continue. And by the way, you can see how many, many places, including countries have decided to substantially increase the capacity. Those increases will take a couple of years to actually have impact. But they do illustrate the direction that our field is taking."

You better start stopping the car, so to speak, is going to be a very high value. Maybe even more practical immediately is in cloud centers, where people run compute at the max speed and they want to know is a certain set of processors going to go down so that I replace them before it happens. So in essence, preventive maintenance. 
And so in that sense, SLM is interesting because we touch these chips literally at the early days of even what are the type of transistors. So very minute physics, but now we also have very meaningful interaction with very large companies that are exactly in those verticals I described. 
Now DSO.ai, I think, is breakthrough technology. And it's always difficult to compare something that we did over 30 years ago. But the early days of Synthesis had something similar, which is it took a set of human tasks where complexity just was outrunning the human and automated it. And overnight, we could do circuits that were better than what a human could do in a fraction of the time, and were faster and smaller. 
Now we're talking of entire chip pieces, very large designs with many, many different constraints. And the fact that we can take tasks that take people multiple months and bring them down literally to a few weeks with fewer people and, in the last few quarters, even better results certainly sounds very similar. But to me, it's sort of essentially 30 years later, many orders of magnitude more complexity. And I think it fits well the very moment where the semiconductor industry will want to do many more chips for all these verticals. 
And so we use sometimes the front line of using AI to design AI chips, but that is exactly what this is. And it's exciting. We're just at the beginning of that, but the impact is already economically felt by the users."

But I think the most interesting part of all of this is that there is gradually now a broader understanding that the whole next wave of human products impact and so on is very, very much linked to the notion of big data intersecting with AI, i.e., smart results.

We've heard similar remarks from you and others in the industry for some time now or silicon renaissance and so forth. The question is how that affects your business profile specifically with respect to services. That is to say as you move into this new era, does this tend to increase the kind of services and AE support that you necessarily have to provide to encompass or support this new era? And if so, what could be the margin implications of having to provide that incrementally higher degree of support? 
Relatedly with respect to the next generation of chips, the domain-specific chips that you talked about now for actually 2 or 3 years, what does that mean during the design process in terms of license consumption? If we think about your model as now prospectively a kind of consumption model, as is often the case in simulation, do you think that the consumption or utilization intensity per design, per run, however you want to think about it, necessarily goes up?"

But been there, done that. And by the way, that will continue for a while. 
What makes systemic complexity interesting is that you get multiple players intersecting. Suddenly you have companies that are sitting on these verticals that are highly interested in knowing how the chips will actually work because they write their own software, for example. And vice versa, the people providing chips are really interested. So what software does this car manufacturer really want to run on it that has to be really fast so that I can change the architecture of my chip to accommodate that? 
And our role is interestingly broadened because we're sitting at the intersection of all of that. And you may recall that a number of years ago, under our logo, we literally put silicon to software. Well, that was essentially the summary at that time of this vision that there's a continuum that ultimately brings the power of chips to end users that have -- that are not really interested in chips, except that they need them to get smart outcomes. 
And so when you move into that space, it's not so much that support is increasing but that there are new service opportunities as a number of new players initially may not know so much about these domains but they know a lot about their opportunity space and helping them connect is an opportunity that will continue to grow for us. And we will certainly be able to manage it so that, including with the tools, the profitability will be very reasonable or even good. 
The second part of your question, which ties directly to this, is this notion of domain specific. And if I can take one example that is well understood and yet in its infancy, is automotive. And as you know, a number of years ago, a car started to think about this whole notion of autonomous driving or, at least at the beginning, defensive driving. And chip manufacturers quickly figured out that there may be a long-term big opportunity there, except automotive guys also have rules such as safety rules. And they've had those for a long, long time. 
Some are simple. Some are becoming very complex. And certainly, what does it mean? Well, it means for companies such as Synopsys that we have a whole effort on the IP side and on the tool side to build in what's called FuSa, Functional Safety. And this is partially mandated by the automotive guys. Partially, it is being developed on the fly with the complexity. 
And so these are great opportunities for us because our IP collection, we must have invested in Functional Safety, there for 5 or 6 years. It's an enormous amount of effort, but now that we have that, it's a great differentiation. And so I see our role to be very much a catalyst in the middle of these different factions that we all understand. And I think there will be more and more verticals that will engage suddenly at high speed and the race is on."

In general though, when volume increases, with it, also the number of designs increases.

But the other comment would be different foundries are sort of also focusing on different type nodes. Some focus mostly on the most advanced nodes. Other would be sort of in the middle field. And then the truly older trailing edge nodes, they're typically limited by the amount of capacity at 200-millimeter wafers. 
What is interesting in the nodes that are maybe not the leading, leading edge but, let's say, 3, 4 years behind that, there, the application of the newer tools that we have actually has a lot of impact on those, too, because newer tools for older nodes still means a lot better design out of these older nodes. And so it actually gives them a bit of a second life from an efficiency point of view. And as you said, if people can do really well with nodes that have been well honed where the yield is high, the cost equation is very attractive.

We again made excellent progress on our margin expansion goals and generated $422 million of operating cash flow. Thanks to the hard work of our entire Synopsys team.
On a TTM basis, we have surpassed the major milestone we set our sights on a few years ago, $4 billion in revenue and 30% operating margin. Reflecting our strong year-to-date results, the vibrant markets we serve and technology innovations driving customer momentum in all product groups and all geographies. We are raising fiscal 2021 revenue, non-GAAP ops margin, earnings and cash flow targets.
We are well on the way towards our next goal of crossing $5 billion in revenue by 2023, raising our long-term revenue objective to double-digit growth with continued margin expansion. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.
Meanwhile, the market is not only strong, it is transforming in a way that is very positive for Synopsys. Both consumer and business demand for Smart Everything continue to intensify and grow. Smart devices intersect many skills and technologies, massive amounts of data to be stored, transmitted and processed, sophisticated machine learning and application software specific to each market segment. In this megatrend, semiconductors are absolutely critical. This means not just more chips, but more advanced chips, lower power chips and chips that can be about it or stacked for tight implementations. In addition, security and safety are rapidly becoming must-haves, integrating more and more system requirements.
To make Smart Everything possible, companies need more automation while transforming the way they approach the development of their systems. New entrants such as large hyperscalers increasingly designed their own specialized chips and our business with them is growing rapidly. Other systems companies, such as automotive, increasingly exert heavy influence on their suppliers by specifying key elements of chip performance as well as functional safety and security.
Synopsys is a crucial enabler and the broad economic pool is now augmented -- augmenting the traditional Moore's Law push, thus driving more opportunity for us. Synopsys is ideally suited to capitalize on these tailwinds. Over the past 5 years plus, we've invested heavily in breakthrough innovations that are now driving excellent customer results and with it accelerated business growth. Let me highlight 3 areas: AI and autonomous design, silicon IP and security.
Let's start with AI. Designing today's most advanced chips with the additional vertical market requirements is among the most difficult engineering tasks, period. As schedule pressured designers reach the practical limits of human design efforts, we must use the power of AI to automate not just design tasks but entire segments of the design flow. This is exactly what Synopsys pioneered 1.5 years ago. AI-driven autonomous design. 
Sitting on top of our Fusion Design Platform, we have built an AI design solution that automatically explores, implements and optimizes multi-month design efforts in a matter of weeks. Called DSO.ai which stands for design space optimization using AI, the system has been used by customers on real chips going through production tape-outs and seeing silicon back from manufacturing. DSO.ai is breakthrough technology. The results are great. Through this, we've already achieved important customer renewals. Not only does it literally reduce design times from months to weeks. It improves performance, power and area substantially beyond what teams of expert achieve on their own.
In addition to early industry recognition, as it won a 2020 World Electronics Achievement award for Innovative Product of the Year, customer engagements have been exceptional with early endorsements by Samsung and Renesas. In addition, this quarter, A large Asia Pacific provider of advanced chips achieved with 1 engineer in 1 month, what previously required several experts over 3 months of manual work. One high-profile U.S. customer using DSO.ai attained better quality of results through a remarkable 20% reduction in power consumption. Next Monday, our keynote, the Hot Chips conference reporting on further great DSO advances and another exciting customer success.
The impact of this AI brain is greatly leveraged by the powerful system that it sits on top of our Fusion Design Platform. We pioneered the Fusion concept several years ago by literally fusing together critical segments of the design flow into a single platform. The outcome best-in-class results in terms of chip speed, power and area. Today, Fusion Compiler is the only solution available that seamlessly integrates market-leading synthesis, place and route with timing, power and physical sign-off all into a single tool. It's the fastest ramping new design solution in Synopsys history already surpassing 500 tape-outs across multiple verticals, including AI, 5G and high-performance compute for process nodes from 40-nanometer down to 3 nanometer.
Notably, our leading foundry partners are already actively leveraging Fusion Compiler towards 2-nanometer enablement. Our Fusion Design Platform is relied on by the world's largest influential and hard-driving companies. Production successes include advanced tapeout by Samsung Foundry for its next-generation chip in 3-nanometer gate all around technology. 
In parallel to autonomous design, another way to reduce risk and speed time to market for complex chips is by using a ready-made IP. Our broad market-leading IP portfolio is delivering excellent double-digit growth towards what will be another outstanding year. Demand is very strong, with customers substantially expanding their reliance on us and renewing multiyear commitments faster than ever before. High-performance compute, automotive and mobile markets are especially strong, wanting both more and more advanced IP.
Let me highlight 3 areas. First, with growth in cloud data, we're seeing high demand for faster, high-performance interfaces, such as DDR5, PCI Express 5.0 and 6.0 and 800-gig Ethernet. We saw great momentum this quarter with multiple customers selecting our first to market next-generation PCI Express 6.0 IP for advanced high-performance compute chips. This is a testament to the success of our PCI Express 5.0 IP, which has nearly 200 design wins this quarter, we also saw immediate traction for our 400, 800 gig Ethernet IP solution through multiple design wins that include our 112 gig SerDes.
Second, the number of highly advanced chip designs across cloud, AI and 5G application has been growing rapidly. Our large and experienced R&D team remains at the forefront of delivering highly differentiated IP at the cutting edge of technology. In 5-nanometer, we've secured nearly 400 design-ins across 33 customers. And this quarter, a significant driver of our physical IP business came from 5, 4 and 3 nanometer.
Lastly, we're also seeing our customers integrating more security capabilities into their chips. This is driving excellent momentum with our security IP portfolio, including strong demand for IDE IP to secure PCI Express and CXL interfaces, which is a natural segue to software integrity. We're doing well with increasing momentum following the significant execution and operational improvements we've made. In fact, Q3 was our highest order quarter ever, and we expect to eclipse our original revenue goal for the year. As masses ongoing security threats to business safety and health become almost commonplace, companies are rethinking their protection strategies. It's no longer effective to pick and choose point tools with partial capabilities.
Protection now requires a holistic strategic approach. Synopsys is at the forefront of this evolution with the industry's only portfolio that features the broadest set of application testing solutions, strategic consulting to assist executives and boards in charging their software security plan and an innovative offering that elevates the impact of the Polaris platform. With the recent introduction of intelligent orchestration, our Polaris platform can seamlessly integrate and automate security testing within each company's protocol.
We took another significant step in Q3 with the acquisition of Code Dx. They are the leading provider of application security risk management products that automate and accelerate the discovery, prioritization and remediation of software vulnerabilities. This combination elevates our capabilities beyond what competitors can provide a comprehensive, easy-to-adopt holistic solution.
On the go-to-market side, we see very good progress from the enhancements we've made. Our services business, again did better than planned with over 20 new logo wins in North America alone. Our win and renewal rates continue to improve, and we're encouraged by the progress we've made.
Industry analysts continue to recognize the strength of our strategy and portfolio. For the fifth year in a row, Synopsys was named the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing. And today, we were again recognized as a leader in the Forrester wave for software composition analysis.
So far, I've highlighted 3 major areas: AI, IP and security. Let me point out a couple of other innovations that enable this new era. One of Synopsys' strength is focused on the intersection of hardware and software, which is inherently crucial in Smart Everything. Our hardware-based verification systems continued to generate very strong business with year-to-date 36 new logos and about 150 repeat orders. In addition, with innovation spanning both emulation FPGA-based prototyping, we're off to a solid start to a multiyear product upgrade cycle.
Over the last 2 quarters, we introduced new application-specific emulation products. The ZeBu Empower system enables early power analysis to reduce power-related risks. And the ZeBu EP1 is the first of its kind high-performance compute for mobile, GPU, CPU and AI design. Both are substantially faster with higher capacity than any competitive solution in the market today. And we're already seeing strong demand and deployments at large influential customers around the world.
Q3 was our largest orders quarter ever for our HAPS prototyping product line, fueled by the new HAPS-100, with highest performance and unmatched enterprise scalability we closed multiple competitive wins in the quarter. With the momentum in both emulation and prototyping, we expect another record revenue year, extending our market and technology leadership. With increasing chip and system complexity, growing reliability requirements are now demanding ongoing post-silicon analysis, maintenance and optimization.
Our new silicon life cycle management platform leverages our leadership in both EDA and IP as it monitors, analyzes and optimizes chips from design to manufacturing to infield adjustments. This innovative approach opens up a substantial new TAM for us with business ramping ahead of expectations. Even at this early stage, we achieved 2 large expanded renewals this quarter.
In summary, Q3 results were excellent, and we are raising our full year objectives substantially. Vibrant markets, compelling innovations and strong execution position us to continue to increase shareholder and value going forward. While we will provide specific long-term objectives next quarter, we aim to cross $5 billion in revenue by 2023. We are raising our annual revenue growth objectives to double digits with continued margin expansion. These results are not possible without our global team. Through the pandemic, they have demonstrated commitment, resilience and compassion for others while executing very well. Lastly, I hope you and your families have vaccinated, healthy and staying safe.
With that, I'll return it over to Trac."

Third quarter results, including record revenue and non-GAAP earnings reflect strong momentum across the company. For the full year, we are on track to deliver mid-teens revenue growth, an increase in non-GAAP operating margin of more than 200 basis points, non-GAAP earnings per share growth of more than 20% and approximately $1.35 billion in operating cash flow. The combination of the dynamic markets we serve, the powerful impact of our products and solutions and customer results and our history of strong execution is the basis for us setting the goal of crossing $5 billion in revenue by 2023.
Now to the third quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. We generated total revenue of $1.057 billion, up 10%, driven by broad-based strength across all product groups and geographies. Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was $959 million, with solid growth in both EDA and IP. Software Integrity segment revenue was $98 million, and we are executing better than expected against our bookings plan for the year. As a result, we project that Software Integrity revenue growth will approach double digits for the full year, and we are solidly on the path to accelerate revenue growth to the 15% to 20% range long term.
Moving on to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $855 million, which includes approximately $15 million in restructuring costs. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $720 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 31.9%. We are on track to deliver operating margin expansion to approximately 30.5% for the year. Adjusted operating margin for the Semiconductor & System Design segment was 34% and Software Integrity margin was 9%.
Wrapping up the income statement. GAAP earnings per share were $1.27, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.81.
Turning to cash. We generated $422 million in operating cash flow. We recently completed a $175 million stock buyback, bringing the total to the fiscal year to $573 million. And we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.53 billion with total debt of $107 million.
For fiscal 2021, we are raising our revenue and non-GAAP operating margin and earnings guidance. Our targets are: revenue of $4.19 billion to $4.22 billion, an increase of $145 million at the midpoint, representing mid-teens growth; total GAAP costs and expenses between $3.431 billion and $3.459 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.915 billion and $2.925 billion; a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30.5%; Other income and expenses between minus $6 million and minus $4 million; non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; GAAP earnings of $4.63 and to $4.79 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $6.78 to $6.83 per share, representing over 20% growth; cash flow from operations of approximately $1.35 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $90 million.
Now to the targets for the fourth quarter. Revenue between $1.138 billion and $1.168 billion, total GAAP costs and expenses between $924 million and $952 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $805 million and $815 million, GAAP earnings of $1.09 to $1.25 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $1.75 to $1.80 per share.
We will provide detailed 2022 guidance and our updated long-term financial objectives and assumptions will report next quarter. As part of that discussion, we will also provide an update of our normalized -- of our 3-year normalized non-GAAP tax rate, which is under review. Although we have not completed the assessment, I want to highlight that the rate may increase in light of the assumptions under review.
In conclusion, we delivered record revenue and non-GAAP earnings and strong operating cash flow. Based on our excellent results year-to-date and our outlook for Q4, we are substantially raising our targets for the full year and setting the goal of crossing $5 billion in revenue by 2023. This reflects an increase in our long-term revenue growth objectives to double digits and is also complemented by ongoing margin expansion. At the same time, we will continue to invest to further scale the business and drive increasing shareholder value going forward.

Largely as a result of many years of complex investments that certainly are intersecting in a positive way. And so you may recall that many times we talked about a Fusion Compiler, for example, as sort of a platform to do very advanced design with. Well, once you intersect that with the ability to automate some of that, in other words, put sort of a brain on top of it, that brain, if it functions well, can do a lot because the Fusion Compiler is a very, very powerful tool. And so all of these efforts took many years to get to this point, and now they are showing results. And what is powerful about showing results is you learn very quickly from the results to get better results and improve. And so this is moving forward very rapidly. Simultaneously, you opened up a very good other comment, which is that a number of efforts become maybe not entirely domain specific, but certainly more domain sensitive. 
And so when you talk about automotive or industrial or other areas that require a certain degree of security and safety, well, those are additional demands that come in. And in general, if you buy into my picture of saying, hey, the whole world is heading towards Smart Everything, well, all the smart is applied in those verticals in different ways. And so some have a lot of data. Others have very difficult data to deal with and others just require instantaneous fast computing. Those are all a bit different. And so yes, there will be an increase for gradual specializations in the vertical markets. But at the same time, you can only do that if you have an extremely strong and capable foundation. And I think we're certainly in a good spot for that."

What I did not mention is that DSO.ai is actually a capability that can also be applied in other domains. And over time, we will use some of that technology and the ability to design better silicon technologies, for example, or in the verification space. So there are many directions that we can take with that. And we are strongly engaged now with some of the most advanced design teams in the world.

And for a good reason. That is why they are the most successful ones and continue to grow. And so I expect that to be the case for multiple of our top customers.
In terms of structural changes, we've had the good fortune to be able to somewhat continually inside of Synopsys evolve the structure as technologies either gain strength or are better put together with other products. And we've continued to do quite a bit of that under Sassine Ghazi, our COO's leadership. And I think that has been very effective because not only does a high degree of vitality. It also opens up new doors. And you've seen, for example, out of the design effort, the SLM, the silicon life cycle management suddenly emerge and a number of other capabilities. A great example, of course, is DSO because it intersects with really the entire company primarily right now in design because there the results are just fantastic and a very high value. And so we will continue in that vein.
On the field side, there are 2. We continue to optimize for the customers driving different technologies and making sure that the coverage is very good.

Let me give you some color about how we're thinking about SIG. If you remember at the beginning of the year, we said that we're going to make some changes and to get the business back on a growth path 15% to 20%. And what we said was for this current year that we would exit the year at double digits, right, because it would take time for the improvements in bookings that translate to revenue. And that by Q4, our goal is to exit the year in double digits. We are now, in fact, approaching double digits for the full year and not just exiting. So I think the momentum clearly has been progressively improving. And I think if you recall the tone throughout the year, I think it was kind of cautiously optimistic because we're seeing good progression and impacting the changes that 1 quarter, 2 quarter, I think it's too early to call. But 4 quarters in, it does feel like we really are on the right path. And we continue executing this, the goal of 15% to 20% growth long term feels very, very doable.
With regards to the investments, I think same thing there. We are -- we have been progressively feeling positive. And again, if you remember the commentary on operating margins, we thought we would have to invest more this year and then bring margins down in order to drive growth. In fact, the team has done a really good job balancing the changes in the business, but while kind of managing their investments to keep margins relatively flat. And so if the hiring that you're seeing certainly reflects an emphasis of hiring in the areas where we can get the most impact. And it's just a very disciplined approach in terms of hiring. So overall, just good results that supports continued investments in that business, but the outlook is very good growth in the next few years as well as margin improvements."

And so that is one of the reasons why you see the semiconductor industry do so well. And the fact that in some areas, our shortages may have nothing to do with that because it's certain specific areas.

First is there have been a number of generations of semiconductor transistors, play in or was for many years the way to do it. The thought to do FinFET was heresy because these were very difficult to do and impossible and then they became possible, and we move forward on that. The way to look at data all around is essentially, it's a sophisticated variation on FinFET and a number of advanced customers and manufacturing partners are clearly investing in this and clearly going in this direction. And we can absolutely support it all the way from the very beginnings of providing them with tools that allow them to literally simulate and design individual transistors all the way to our design system. Fusion Compiler is completely capable of handling this. So that's not going to be a problem.
The second comment is what you're referring to when you say new types of transistor is de facto a form of continuation of Moore's Law. Meaning still smaller transistors, there's still less power, still faster speed. And while Moore's Law has slowed down, I want to emphasize, it is still continuing. And that too, for many times was viewed as impossible, but it is absolutely continuing.
I would amend it with something, though, which is you also see more talk of now bringing multiple chiplets or sometimes called tiles closely together sometimes on top of other chips and on other pieces of semiconductor. And to me, that is a mega booster pack to Moore's Law because if you cannot do more transistors on a chip, can you do 2 chips closely together? And there are a number of design issues that Synopsys is particularly well equipped for because when you do something in 2 chips instead of 1, the biggest problem is the in between, right, which is how quickly can you get the signals one to the other. And that's why you want to have them very, very closely linked.
We have a complete 3D IC, that design system for that. And as we see people do a combination of still smaller devices, but now also multiple chips closely together, we will gradually see that growing. So I'm very encouraged that for the next 10 years, we're still going to see way more complex systems. And in our case, the word complex is a good word."

Therefore, the economics from the end markets will come down into the systems semiconductor and in our world because we are the enablers for that. And I'm also super enthusiastic because I feel that many of the investments that we've made have led Synopsys to be at just a unique point of new innovation and having had the opportunity to be part of the early beginnings of automation via synthesis many years ago.
I would equate what we're doing right now with AI on not a design step but a whole design flow to be very, very similar. And therefore, a long-term high impact.

We again made excellent progress on our margin expansion goals and generated $422 million of operating cash flow. 
Thanks to the hard work of our entire Synopsys team, on a TTM basis, we have surpassed the major milestone we set our sights on a few years ago, $4 billion in revenue and 30% operating margin. Reflecting our strong year-to-date results, the vibrant markets we serve and technology innovations driving customer momentum in all product groups and all geographies, we are raising fiscal 2021 revenue, non-GAAP ops margin, earnings and cash flow targets. 
We are well on the way towards our next goal of crossing $5 billion in revenue by 2023, raising our long-term revenue objective to double-digit growth with continued margin expansion. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail. 
Meanwhile, the market is not only strong, it is transforming in a way that is very positive for Synopsys. Both consumer and business demand for Smart Everything continue to intensify and grow. Smart devices intersect many skills and technologies. Massive amounts of data to be stored, transmitted and processed, sophisticated machine learning and application software specific to each market segment. In this megatrend, semiconductors are absolutely critical. This means not just more chips, but more advanced chips, lower power chips and chips that can be above it or stacked for tight implementations. In addition, security and safety are rapidly becoming must-haves, integrating more and more system requirements. 
To make Smart Everything possible, companies need more automation while transforming the way they approach the development of their systems. New entrants such as large hyperscalers increasingly design their own specialized chips and our business with them is growing rapidly. Other systems companies, such as automotive, increasingly exert heavy influence on their suppliers by specifying key elements of chip performance as well as functional safety and security. 
Synopsys is a crucial enabler and the broad economic pool is now augmented -- augmenting the traditional Moore's Law push, thus driving more opportunity for us. Synopsys is ideally suited to capitalize on these tailwinds. Over the past 5 years plus, we've invested heavily in breakthrough innovations that are now driving excellent customer results and with it, accelerated business growth. Let me highlight 3 areas: AI and autonomous design, silicon IP and security. 
Let's start with AI. Designing today's most advanced chips with the additional vertical market requirements is among the most difficult engineering tasks, period. As schedule pressured designers reach the practical limits of human design efforts, we must use the power of AI to automate not just design tasks but entire segments of the design flow. This is exactly what Synopsys pioneered 1.5 years ago. AI-driven autonomous design.  
Sitting on top of our Fusion Design Platform, we have built an AI design solution that automatically explores, implements and optimizes multi-month design efforts in a matter of weeks. Called DSO.ai which stands for design space optimization using AI, the system has been used by customers on real chips going through production tape-outs and seeing silicon back from manufacturing. DSO.ai is breakthrough technology. The results are great. Through this, we've already achieved important customer renewals. Not only does it literally reduce design times from months to weeks, it improves performance, power and area substantially beyond what teams of expert achieve on their own. 
In addition to early industry recognition, as it won a 2020 World Electronics Achievement award for Innovative Product of the Year, customer engagements have been exceptional with early endorsements by Samsung and Renesas. In addition, this quarter, a large Asia Pacific provider of advanced chips achieved with 1 engineer in 1 month, what previously required several experts over 3 months of manual work. One high-profile U.S. customer using DSO.ai attained better quality of results through a remarkable 20% reduction in power consumption. Next Monday, our keynote, the Hot Chips conference reporting on further great DSO advances and another exciting customer success. 
The impact of this AI brain is greatly leveraged by the powerful system that it sits on top of, our Fusion Design Platform. We pioneered the Fusion concept several years ago by literally fusing together critical segments of the design flow into a single platform. The outcome, best-in-class results in terms of chip speed, power and area. Today, Fusion Compiler is the only solution available that seamlessly integrates market-leading synthesis, place and route with timing, power and physical sign-off all into a single tool. It's the fastest ramping new design solution in Synopsys history already surpassing 500 tape-outs across multiple verticals, including AI, 5G and high-performance compute for process nodes from 40-nanometer down to 3 nanometer. 
Notably, our leading foundry partners are already actively leveraging Fusion Compiler towards 2-nanometer enablement. Our Fusion Design Platform is relied on by the world's largest influential and hard-driving companies. Production successes include advanced tapeout by Samsung Foundry for its next-generation chip in 3-nanometer gate all around technology.  
In parallel to autonomous design, another way to reduce risk and speed time to market for complex chips is by using a ready-made IP. Our broad market-leading IP portfolio is delivering excellent double-digit growth towards what will be another outstanding year. Demand is very strong, with customers substantially expanding their reliance on us and renewing multiyear commitments faster than ever before. High-performance compute, automotive and mobile markets are especially strong, wanting both more and more advanced IP. 
Let me highlight 3 areas. First, with growth in cloud data, we're seeing high demand for faster, high-performance interfaces, such as DDR5, PCI Express 5.0 and 6.0 and 800-gig Ethernet. We saw great momentum this quarter with multiple customers selecting our first to market next-generation PCI Express 6.0 IP for advanced high-performance compute chips. This is a testament to the success of our PCI Express 5.0 IP, which has nearly 200 design wins this quarter, we also saw immediate traction for our 400, 800 gig Ethernet IP solution through multiple design wins that include our 112 gig SerDes. 
Second, the number of highly advanced chip designs across cloud, AI and 5G application has been growing rapidly. Our large and experienced R&D team remains at the forefront of delivering highly differentiated IP at the cutting edge of technology. In 5-nanometer, we've secured nearly 400 design-ins across 33 customers. And this quarter, a significant driver of our physical IP business came from 5, 4 and 3 nanometer. 
Lastly, we're also seeing our customers integrating more security capabilities into their chips. This is driving excellent momentum with our security IP portfolio, including strong demand for IDE IP to secure PCI Express and CXL interfaces, which is a natural segue to software integrity. We're doing well with increasing momentum following the significant execution and operational improvements we've made. In fact, Q3 was our highest order quarter ever, and we expect to eclipse our original revenue goal for the year. As massive ongoing security threats to business safety and health become almost commonplace, companies are rethinking their protection strategies. It's no longer effective to pick and choose point tools with partial capabilities. 
Protection now requires a holistic strategic approach. Synopsys is at the forefront of this evolution with the industry's only portfolio that features the broadest set of application testing solutions, strategic consulting to assist executives and Boards in charging their software security plan and an innovative offering that elevates the impact of the Polaris platform. With the recent introduction of intelligent orchestration, our Polaris platform can seamlessly integrate and automate security testing within each company's protocol. 
We took another significant step in Q3 with the acquisition of Code Dx. They are the leading provider of application security risk management products that automate and accelerate the discovery, prioritization and remediation of software vulnerabilities. This combination elevates our capabilities beyond what competitors can provide, a comprehensive, easy-to-adopt holistic solution. 
On the go-to-market side, we see very good progress from the enhancements we've made. Our services business, again, did better than planned with over 20 new logo wins in North America alone. Our win and renewal rates continue to improve, and we're encouraged by the progress we've made. 
Industry analysts continue to recognize the strength of our strategy and portfolio. For the fifth year in a row, Synopsys was named the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing. And today, we were again recognized as a leader in the Forrester Wave for software composition analysis. 
So far, I've highlighted 3 major areas: AI, IP and security. Let me point out a couple of other innovations that enable this new era. One of Synopsys' strength is focused on the intersection of hardware and software, which is inherently crucial in Smart Everything. Our hardware-based verification systems continue to generate very strong business with year-to-date 36 new logos and about 150 repeat orders. In addition, with innovation spanning both emulation FPGA-based prototyping, we're off to a solid start to a multiyear product upgrade cycle. 
Over the last 2 quarters, we introduced new application-specific emulation products. The ZeBu empower system enables early power analysis to reduce power-related risks. And the ZeBu EP1 is the first of its kind high-performance compute for mobile, GPU, CPU and AI design. Both are substantially faster with higher capacity than any competitive solution in the market today. And we're already seeing strong demand and deployments at large influential customers around the world. 
Q3 was our largest orders quarter ever for our HAPS prototyping product line, fueled by the new HAPS-100. With highest performance and unmatched enterprise scalability, we closed multiple competitive wins in the quarter. With the momentum in both emulation and prototyping, we expect another record revenue year, extending our market and technology leadership. With increasing chip and system complexity, growing reliability requirements are now demanding ongoing post-silicon analysis, maintenance and optimization. 
Our new silicon life cycle management platform leverages our leadership in both EDA and IP as it monitors, analyzes and optimizes chips from design to manufacturing to infield adjustments. This innovative approach opens up a substantial new TAM for us with business ramping ahead of expectations. Even at this early stage, we achieved 2 large expanded renewals this quarter. 
In summary, Q3 results were excellent, and we are raising our full year objectives substantially. Vibrant markets, compelling innovations and strong execution position us to continue to increase shareholder and value going forward. While we will provide specific long-term objectives next quarter, we aim to cross $5 billion in revenue by 2023. We are raising our annual revenue growth objectives to double digits with continued margin expansion. These results are not possible without our global team. Through the pandemic, they have demonstrated commitment, resilience and compassion for others while executing very well. Lastly, I hope you and your families are vaccinated, healthy and staying safe. 
With that, I'll return it over to Trac."

Third quarter results, including record revenue and non-GAAP earnings, reflect strong momentum across the company. For the full year, we are on track to deliver mid-teens revenue growth, an increase in non-GAAP operating margin of more than 200 basis points, non-GAAP earnings per share growth of more than 20% and approximately $1.35 billion in operating cash flow. The combination of the dynamic markets we serve, the powerful impact of our products and solutions and customer results and our history of strong execution is the basis for us setting the goal of crossing $5 billion in revenue by 2023. 
Now to the third quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. We generated total revenue of $1.057 billion, up 10%, driven by broad-based strength across all product groups and geographies. Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was $959 million, with solid growth in both EDA and IP. Software Integrity segment revenue was $98 million, and we are executing better than expected against our bookings plan for the year. As a result, we project that Software Integrity revenue growth will approach double digits for the full year, and we are solidly on the path to accelerate revenue growth to the 15% to 20% range long term. 
Moving on to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $855 million, which includes approximately $15 million in restructuring costs. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $720 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 31.9%. We are on track to deliver operating margin expansion to approximately 30.5% for the year. Adjusted operating margin for the Semiconductor & System Design segment was 34% and Software Integrity margin was 9%. 
Wrapping up the income statement. GAAP earnings per share were $1.27, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.81. 
Turning to cash. We generated $422 million in operating cash flow. We recently completed a $175 million stock buyback, bringing the total to the fiscal year to $573 million. And we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.53 billion with total debt of $107 million. 
For fiscal 2021, we are raising our revenue and non-GAAP operating margin and earnings guidance. Our targets are: revenue of $4.19 billion to $4.22 billion, an increase of $145 million at the midpoint, representing mid-teens growth; total GAAP costs and expenses between $3.431 billion and $3.459 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.915 billion and $2.925 billion, a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30.5%; Other income and expenses between minus $6 million and minus $4 million; non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; GAAP earnings of $4.63 to $4.79 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $6.78 to $6.83 per share, representing over 20% growth; cash flow from operations of approximately $1.35 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $90 million. 
Now to the targets for the fourth quarter. Revenue between $1.138 billion and $1.168 billion, total GAAP costs and expenses between $924 million and $952 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $805 million and $815 million, GAAP earnings of $1.09 to $1.25 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $1.75 to $1.80 per share. 
We will provide detailed 2022 guidance and our updated long-term financial objectives and assumptions we'll report next quarter. As part of that discussion, we will also provide an update of our normalized -- of our 3-year normalized non-GAAP tax rate, which is under review. Although we have not completed the assessment, I want to highlight that the rate may increase in light of the assumptions under review. 
In conclusion, we delivered record revenue and non-GAAP earnings and strong operating cash flow. Based on our excellent results year-to-date and our outlook for Q4, we are substantially raising our targets for the full year and setting the goal of crossing $5 billion in revenue by 2023. This reflects an increase in our long-term revenue growth objectives to double digits and is also complemented by ongoing margin expansion. At the same time, we will continue to invest to further scale the business and drive increasing shareholder value going forward. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."

I think that Synopsys has a high degree of vitality right now, largely as a result of many years of complex investments that certainly are intersecting in a positive way. And so you may recall the many times we talked about a Fusion Compiler, for example, as sort of a platform to do very advanced design with. Well, once you intersect that with the ability to automate some of that, in other words, put sort of a brain on top of it, that brain, if it functions well, can do a lot because the Fusion Compiler is a very, very powerful tool. 
And so all of these efforts took many years to get to this point, and now they are showing results. And what is powerful about showing results is you learn very quickly from the results to get better results and improve. And so this is moving forward very rapidly. Simultaneously, you opened up a very good other comment, which is that a number of efforts become maybe not entirely domain specific, but certainly more domain sensitive. And so when you talk about automotive or industrial or other areas that require a certain degree of security and safety, well, those are additional demands that come in. 
And in general, if you buy into my picture of saying, hey, the whole world is heading towards Smart Everything, well, all the smart is applied in those verticals in different ways. And so some have a lot of data. Others have very difficult data to deal with, and others just require instantaneous fast computing. Those are all a bit different. And so yes, there will be an increase for gradual specializations in the vertical markets. But at the same time, you can only do that if you have an extremely strong and capable foundation. And I think we're certainly in a good spot for that."

What I did not mention is that DSO.ai is actually a capability that can also be applied in other domains. And over time, we will use some of that technology and the ability to design better silicon technologies, for example, or in the verification space. So there are many directions that we can take with that. And we are strongly engaged now with some of the most advanced design teams in the world.

And for a good reason. That is why they are the most successful ones and continue to grow. And so I expect that to be the case for multiple of our top customers. 
In terms of structural changes. We've had the good fortune to be able to somewhat continually inside of Synopsys evolve the structure as technologies either gain strength or are better put together with other products. And we've continued to do quite a bit of that under Sassine Ghazi, our COO's leadership. And I think that has been very effective because not only does a high degree of vitality. It also opens up new doors. 
And you've seen, for example, out of the design effort, the SLM, the silicon life cycle management suddenly emerge and a number of other capabilities. A great example, of course, is DSO because it intersects with really the entire company primarily right now in design because there the results are just fantastic and of very high value. And so we will continue in that vein. 
On the field side, there are 2. We continue to optimize for the customers driving different technologies and making sure that the coverage is very good. And in many ways, the good news is that despite all the restrictions with COVID, I think we have not really missed any beat in covering the needs of our customers well. And so right now, I would consider that Synopsys is actually in a pretty good spot."

We've increased it by 8 points since the low of '18, right? And so there has been a lot of changes across the company. And so while we have been able to grow the business, reinvest in the business, we're simultaneously making a lot of that change. And so there is good opportunity for us to sustain that going forward. And so it's not a new skill that we have to acquire and develop. This is something that we've been working on for many years now. And so this practice of driving to higher profitability in the next few years is going to be more of the same, but more hard work because we're off -- we're working off a pretty high base. 
With regards to the customer concentration, I think the -- while the reality is we're still working on finalizing the budgets for next year and the plans for the next couple of years, what we are seeing is really strong -- strength across the broad product sets and strength across the broad customer base. And there's enough confidence in our ability to execute against that, that we feel willing to go out and commit to $5 billion by '23. So it's very, very much broad-based."

Let me give you some color about how we're thinking about SIG. If you remember, at the beginning of the year, we said that we're going to make some changes and to get the business back on a growth path of 15% to 20%. And what we said was for this current year that we would exit the year at double digits, right, because it would take time for the improvements in bookings to translate to revenue. And that by Q4, our goal is to exit the year in double digits. 
We are now, in fact, approaching double digits for the full year and not just exiting. So I think the momentum clearly has been progressively improving. And I think if you recall the tone throughout the year, I think it was kind of cautiously optimistic because we're seeing good progression and impacting the changes that 1 quarter, 2 quarter, I think it's too early to call. But 4 quarters in, it does feel like we really are on the right path. And if we continue executing this, the goal of 15% to 20% growth long term feels very, very doable. 
With regards to the investments, I think same thing there. We are -- we have been progressively feeling positive. And again, if you remember the commentary on operating margins, we thought we would have to invest more this year and then bring margins down in order to drive growth. In fact, the team has done a really good job balancing the changes in the business, while kind of managing their investments to keep margins relatively flat. 
And so we've -- the hiring that you're seeing certainly reflects an emphasis of hiring in the areas where we can get the most impact. And it's just a very disciplined approach in terms of hiring. So overall, just good results that supports continued investments in that business. But the outlook is very good growth in the next few years as well as margin improvements."

First is there have been a number of generations of semiconductor transistors, [ planar ] was for many years the way to do it. The thought to do FinFET was heresy because these were very difficult to do and impossible and then they became possible, and we moved forward on that. The way to look at data all around is essentially, it's a sophisticated variation on FinFET and a number of advanced customers and manufacturing partners are clearly investing in this and clearly going in this direction. And we can absolutely support it all the way from the very beginnings of providing them with tools that allow them to literally simulate and design individual transistors all the way to our design system. Fusion Compiler is completely capable of handling this. So that's not going to be a problem.
The second comment is what you're referring to when you say new types of transistor is de facto a form of continuation of Moore's Law. Meaning still smaller transistors, still less power, still faster speed. And while Moore's Law has slowed down, I want to emphasize, it is still continuing. And that, too, for many times was viewed as impossible, but it is absolutely continuing.
I would amend it with something, though, which is you also see more talk of now bringing multiple chiplets or sometimes called tiles closely together, sometimes on top of other chips, on other pieces of semiconductor. And to me, that is a mega booster pack to Moore's Law because if you cannot do more transistors on a chip, can you do 2 chips closely together? And there are a number of design issues that Synopsys is particularly well equipped for because when you do something in 2 chips instead of 1, the biggest problem is the in between, right, which is how quickly can you get the signals from one to the other. And that's why you want to have them very, very closely linked.
We have a complete 3D IC, that design system for that. And as we see people do a combination of still smaller devices, but now also multiple chips closely together, we will gradually see that growing. So I'm very encouraged that for the next 10 years, we're still going to see way more complex systems. And in our case, the word complex is a good word."

Therefore, the economics from the end markets will come down into the systems semiconductor and in our world because we are the enablers for that. And I'm also super enthusiastic because I feel that many of the investments that we've made have led Synopsys to be at just a unique point of new innovation and having had the opportunity to be part of the early beginnings of automation via synthesis many years ago.
I would equate what we're doing right now with AI on not a design step but a whole design flow to be very, very similar. And therefore, a long-term high impact.

I'm happy to report that Synopsys delivered another record year, substantially exceeding our original goals. We grew revenue 14% to $4.2 billion, with double-digit growth in all product groups and geographies. We substantially expanded our non-GAAP operating margin with more than 20% earnings growth and generated record cash flow $1.49 billion. In addition, disruptive innovation and collaborations accelerated our momentum as a number of large customers significantly expanded their commitments as visible in an outstanding orders year. As a result, we enter fiscal 2022 with momentum. 
Looking forward, we are raising our long-term financial objectives strong double-digit revenue growth anchored in a step-up in EDA and IP targets, ongoing non-GAAP operating margin expansion and non-GAAP earnings per share growth in the mid-teens range, all of which is driving very strong cash flow. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail. 
Underlying our elevated outlook vigorous market, but just as importantly, a long-term growing demand for Smart Everything in every vertical segment. The enhanced technical challenges powering this new era are well aligned with Synopsys' strength. Specifically, the Smart Everything era brings together massive amounts of data with the new wonders of machine learning software. Combined with a metaverse outlook of human machine interaction, the role of chip-centric electronic systems has enormous potential. This requires highly complex semiconductor chips with massive compute capability, evolving semiconductors from system on a chip to tightly integrated systems of chips and increased need for security and safety across software and hardware that is across the entire system. 
From an economic perspective, new entrants are already designing their own specialized chips. Traditional vertical market leaders are taking on a more active role in influencing chip and system architecture and design. At all levels, investments in urgency are increasing. To deliver on this product, our customers are transforming the way they approach design, whether it's processor or mobile teams combining multiple compute storage and connectivity chips together in 3DIC structures, or hyperscalers investing in their own chip architectures to increase their cloud differentiation, or automotive OEMs dictating specific safety protocols, or financial services companies inserting security testing into their development processes. All are driven by the urgency of the economic opportunity and the need for strong partners to master the complexity of the task. 
Synopsys connects with all of these and is uniquely equipped to help capitalize this new era. The center of gravity of the technical challenges is the intersection of hardware and software. A chip is only as good as its interaction with the software and vice versa, in other words, the system. This system focus has been at the core of Synopsys innovation for many years and is now fueling mounting customer and business momentum. 
Nowhere is systemic complexity more visible than in our IP business. The sophistication of our IP blocks requires reaching deep down into the understanding of the advanced silicon nodes and also high up to the system architecture and software. IP is thus a bellwether of systems leadership as new architectures are increasingly jumpstarted by selecting the most important IP building blocks and their configuration. Benefiting from this, we achieved another record year in IP with revenue surpassing $1 billion and growing approximately 20%. 
This momentum is maintained reasons: First, continued strong demand to outsource IP as customers need their most skilled resources to focus on the differentiating aspect of their chips; second, an increasing number of new entrants in segments such as automotive, high-performance compute and AI accelerate their schedule by, whenever possible, selecting complex IP building blocks that are commercially available from a company they trust. As the #1 provider of interface, foundation and physical IP, Synopsys is in a unique position to provide complete solutions across multiple key segments. 
For example, we have the broadest IP portfolio for the fast-growing, high-performance compute and data center markets, including PCI Express, HBM3, 400/800 gig Ethernet and many memory interfaces. We also see continued strength in automotive, fueled by the electrification of cars, the push to autonomous driving and the explicit demand for higher safety, security and reliability. Our IP has been selected by approximately 50 automotive companies with nearly 500 IP wins to date. 
In addition, Synopsys has always driven the leading edge, providing IP and of course, EDA, on the most advanced process nodes. With the mobile and compute companies were deeply engaged at 3-nanometer and had over 250 design wins at 5-nanometer this year. 
Let me talk a bit about system verification Under our Synopsys logo, our tag line states silicon to software. Our unique strength is to sit at the intersection of validating hardware and software, or simply put verifying that the chips and the systems do what was intended. Building on our market-leading VCS chip simulation solution, we were at the forefront of delivering software and hardware-based prototyping more than a decade ago. Since then, our offering has rapidly gained technical and market leadership. 
2021 was a record hardware year, with strength in both emulation and prototyping. Our solutions sit at the sweet spot of hardware-software co-verification, and our emulators are the fastest machines with the highest capacity and the lowest cost of ownership. This year, we increased our differentiation. We introduced application-specific emulation products, ZeBu Empower and ZeBu EP1, that  are significantly faster and higher capacity than any competitive solution in the market. Meanwhile, our new HAPS-100 prototyping system now delivers 2x faster performance and 4x better debug driving accelerated growth. During the year, we achieved multiple competitive wins and significantly broadened our customer base as we added more than 50 new logos and 200 repeat orders. 
Obviously, at the center of enabling the Smart Everything era sits the promise of AI. Which brings the question, what about applying AI to chip design? Today, machine learning enables significant capabilities and runtime advances in all of our key products. About 2 years ago, we delivered disruptive technology at a very different magnitude, using AI to automate not just tools but entire design flows. The outcome is remarkable. 
Our award-winning DSO.ai solution is getting great results on production designs with a rapidly growing number of customer partners. DSO.ai which stands for design space optimization using AI does exactly what the name says. It explores many design options, learns from them using design and tool data and design configurations that a human is unlikely to ever find. Moreover, since design variables such as performance, power, size, yields, reliability and so on, all trade off against each other, DSO.ai can optimize well beyond what the design team can easily fathom. 
Through this year, results better and better. Run by our customers on real production designs, DSO.ai has reduced design times from months to weeks with superior performance and power results. One of notable example is Samsung, which relied on DSO.ai for multiple complex projects, the most recent being an advanced production design for a new mobile product. applied at every stage of design implementation, DSO.ai delivered performance well beyond their speed target and substantially reduced power consumption, all while saving weeks of manual effort. 
Central to DSO.ai's results are the powerful engines underneath it: Our Fusion Design platform. The platform is centered around our Fusion Compiler product, the only solution today to seamlessly integrate market-leading synthesis and place and route, cross-checked and optimized by timing, power and physical sign-off all in a single tool. Fusion Compiler's full flow proliferation and competitive wins increased through the year, including major expansions and competitive displacements. Revenue more than doubled this year. 
Seminal to our sustainable differentiation is a native integration of our golden sign off products. As recognized by multiple awards from our foundry partners, our deep collaboration to ensure that our mutual customers have well honed and trusted design flows at the most advanced technologies. 
In addition to a continued push for smaller geometries, the Smart Everything hunger much more compute, storage and data management is so high that the economics of physically abutting and stacking multiple chips or chiplets is driving a push towards so-called 3DIC design. This brings about many challenges including architecting how to partition into multiple chiplets, making the connections between the chiplets blindingly fast and predicting and dissipating the heat of so much computation. 
Synopsys is at the forefront of this emerging wave. In 2020, we introduced 3DIC Compiler which offers a modern differentiated approach to this complex design challenge. Our solution is being deployed in production and cutting-edge 3DIC designs in the industry. 
Another new era showing great promise is our silicon life cycle management platform, which monitors, analyzes and optimizes chips throughout their lifespan. The adoption of key sensor IP accelerated during this year with 25 new logos, and we recently added AI-powered real-time system optimization for infield applications with the acquisition of ConcertIO. 
With the increase in systemic complexity to deliver Smart Everything, security and safety is a rapidly growing theme from chips to application software. About 7 years ago, we invested in software integrity to provide security and quality testing for the massive amounts of software in today's world. Synopsys has since built the broadest portfolio of products and consulting services in the market. This year, we were recognized for the fifth year in a row as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for application security testing.
Benefiting from the operational enhancements we've made, our Software Integrity business achieved 10% growth for the full year, with particularly strong order flow, exceeding our original expectations. We expect to return to our 15% to 20% revenue growth objective in 2022. 
During the year, our focus has been to scale our go-to-market strategy and execution. We launched a new partner program this year, adding dozens of channel partners and systems integrators. They're already expanding our reach into customer groups and geographies that we hadn't reached in the past. We successfully refined our sales structure and tuned our market priorities. One proof point is the substantial growth of multiyear, multimillion dollar agreements. This notably includes our largest ever Software Integrity order with a U.S. hyperscaler, as well as significant renewals in the networking, airline and enterprise software segments. 
We also made considerable progress with our Polaris Software Integrity Platform. We delivered intelligent orchestration, which automates security testing within a company's specific protocols. This makes it easier and more efficient to integrate directly into their development pipeline. We enhanced our Black Duck software composition analysis solution, which positions us very well for software supply chain risk cases. Finally, the addition of risk management products that automate and accelerate discovery and remediation of software vulnerabilities through Code DX rounds out our solution beyond what competitors provide. 
In summary, we delivered excellent results in 2021, substantially greater than our original plan with strength in all product groups and all geographies. We're entering 2022 with strong technical and market momentum. We are seeing significantly expanded customer commitments and collaborations as our wave of innovations crucial to help catalyze the era of Smart Everything. And as a result, we are raising our long term financial objectives. 
Let me say thank you to our entire Synopsys staff for another great year. I'm looking forward to an exciting journey into our next phase of growth. 
Finally, I'm sure you all saw our other news earlier today that our CFO, Trac Pham, has decided to retire in fiscal 2022. Trac has been a wonderful partner and excellent leader. And while we understand and support his desire to time with his family, we will miss him. He will, of course, remain a good friend to the company and to all of us personally. Trac will stay with Synopsys until a successor is in place to ensure a seamless transition. Trac, to you and your family, we wish you the very best. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Trac."

I'm confident in the leadership team and I will manage the transition well. I'll be here for a while still, and I look forward to talking to many of you. 
Turning to our results, FY '21 was excellent year and featured record results in all key metrics, including revenue, non-GAAP earnings and operating cash flow. Looking to FY '22 and beyond, we have seen a step-up in revenue growth due to the following: first, strong execution and compelling new innovations; second, expanding customer commitments; and third, the new market era  and opportunity that Aart referred to earlier. 
Additionally, because of the essential nature of our customers' R&D priorities and our business model, which results in nearly 90% recurring revenue and significant noncancelable backlog, we are position to have a high level of stability as well. Ending backlog for Q4 was $6.9 billion. These dynamics give us the confidence to raise our long-term financial objectives, which I'll describe in greater detail momentarily. 
First, some highlights of our full year 2021 results. We generated total revenue of $4.2 billion, up 14% from the prior year with double-digit growth across all products and geographies. Total GAAP costs for $3.5 billion and total non-GAAP cost and expenses were $2.9 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 30.5%. GAAP earnings per share $4.81 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $6.84, up 23% over the prior year. 
Semiconductor & System Design revenue was $3.8 billion, driven by broad-based strength across all product groups and geographies. Software Integrity segment revenue was $394 million, up 10% over the prior year and exceeded our original plan. We expect to return to our 15% to 20% growth objective in 2022. In addition, following the investment and operational adjustments we made this past year. We expect to expand adjusted operating margin in 2022. 
Turning to cash. Operating cash flow for the was a record of $1.49 billion, reflecting our strong results and robust collections. We ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $1.58 billion and total debt of $100 million. During the year, we completed buybacks of $788 million, or 56% of free cash flow. 
Now to our targets. Based on our current assessment of the timing of hardware and IP deliveries, we expect Q1 to be our highest revenue quarter and roughly evenly split for the balance of the year. We expect an expense profile similar to that in revenue for Q2 through Q4. For fiscal year 2022, the full year targets are: revenue of $4.725 billion to $4.775 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between and $3.778 billion and $3.835 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $3.225 billion and $3.255 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin improvement of more than 100 basis points; non-GAAP tax of 18%; GAAP earnings of $5.39 to of $5.65 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $7.73 to  $7.80 per share, representing mid-teen growth despite the higher tax rate; cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. 
I'd like to offer some additional thoughts regarding long-term tax rate assumption. Based on preliminary modeling, we believe the non-GAAP tax rate of 18% is potentially sustainable beyond 2022. However, given the uncertain outcome of tax reform, it is premature for us to confirm a longer-term tax rate at this time. 
Now to the targets for the first quarter: Revenue of $1.25 billion and $1.28 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $934 million and $964 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $802 million and $812 million; GAAP earnings of $1.75 to $1.92 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $2.35 to $2.40 per share. Our press release and financial supplement include additional targets and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
Finally, we are raising our long-term financial objectives, all of which are on a multiyear basis with the expectation that particular years will vary depending on the timing of deliverables and other commitments. Our goal is annual double-digit revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS growth in the mid-teens range, reflecting our continued focus on non-GAAP operating margin expansion of more than 100 basis points per year. In terms of product groups, our objective is to grow EDA revenue in the double digits, IP in the mid-teens and Software Integrity between 15% to 20%. 
In summary, our record results this year are a testament to our strong execution, to our focus on investing for long term scalability and shareholder value and to our commitment and ability to innovate to meet growing customer needs. This combination is driving a step up to a new level of growth for us, and our raised long-term financial objectives reflect confidence in our ability to succeed.

On the inside, we have a high degree of confidence because many of the investments that we've put in place over a number of years are really coming together well, because the vision of where our field towards -- heading towards is actually moving along. 
And so this notion of transforming the world towards smart capabilities in every vertical market requires a whole set of technologies that we've been investing in. And so be it in the area of design implementation, including the AI capabilities, be it in the verification and validation of entire systems, including intersection of hardware and software, but also in the deep investments in advanced technologies, in the overarching investments in quality of software and security, all of these trends are really manifesting themselves very actively. 
And we see it manifest itself in many collaborations and increased commitments of customers to us has also witnessed a strong backlog. And so right, that gives us a sense for the coming year. From the outside, it is very clearly visible that the semiconductor industry itself is doing well, not only because visible through some shortages that may be painful but illustrate how important semiconductors are. But because so many companies, including the ones you mentioned, hyperscalers, automotive companies, industrial companies, are all starting to invest in be it either architectures that contemplate the semiconductors or semiconductor development themselves. And so it's time where the alignment between our capabilities and the need of the market are very active."

Because as said earlier, a question related to the people that in the past were not necessarily big customers such as hyperscalers and automotive. These are people that fundamentally think down from the system. They have big objectives to run big, complex software. And now they need more compute, more capacity, better throughput and all that. And all of that's still the same thing, which is advanced chips or combination of chips. And so they intersect with us mostly in 2 areas. One is how can you predict how fast the system by actually running software on emulators or prototypes; and secondly, how can you actually make the actual chips then even faster by really implementing the latest state-of-the-art technology, optimizing your architecture for just the tasks that they want to do. 
And this is where the use of AI to the design flow becomes particularly interesting because very often, people start with chips that they already have. And then they move to a new node, technology node. And simultaneously they say, ""Oh, let me optimize for a specific set of staff."" And that optimization can then largely be automated through with our tools. And so you see an acceleration everywhere, and acceleration has always been the name of the game in our field.

To your broader question, I would just say that the results in '21 and the outlook that we have for '22 really reflects the strong momentum in both hardware and IP. We hit record -- we had record revenues for hardware in '21. And to my mind, that is compared to a year in '20, where it was pretty significantly back-end loaded. And so for us, grow on top of that is pretty significant. And then IP, as Aart mentioned earlier it's a $1 billion business, 220%. So it's really showing really good momentum"

I am actually going to do my best, [indiscernible] impersonation here with a multipart question. So on the  double-digit growth in EDA, I'm just curious what EDA market growth is assumed in that double digits? And are you planning on taking share? 
And then -- and second, what particular facets of the core EDA or whether you want to break it out as front end versus back end, or fusion or hardware or software. How do you want to break out like -- what or do you expect to maybe outgrow others?"

It's hard to predict how well others will do. And in many ways, we do well in the entire industry as well. But we do have so many positions where many of our technologies are extremely competitive at this",570,"Okay. Well, let's start with your whole question. It's hard to predict how well others will do. And in many ways, we do well in the entire industry as well. But we do have so many positions where many of our technologies are extremely competitive at this point in time. And it is a point in time a number of customers are looking to line up with suppliers that they trust over a longer haul, because they clearly see that the advances that are happening right now and coming and a lot of technology and a lot of support. 
Now you mentioned fusion, and I'm glad you did because as you well know, this area that we have invested in for many, many years with the concept being that instead of running succession of independent tools, having multiple tools essentially collaborate, if I can use that term, to get to  a better result, was the essence of Fusion. 
And Fusion is working very well. And as we mentioned in the preamble, growing very well. But it's doubly meaningful because Fusion is also a key ingredient in now layering on top of that, this notion of artificially driving autonomous design flows. And the fact that we can access many, many different technologies inside of Fusion to have an AI algorithm learn and get better results as being just astoundingly exciting to see in many ways, to me, feels like literally the early days of Synopsys, where at that time, synthesis was almost like a miracle. 
Well, it was not a miracle but it was a lot of hard work, but it was capabilities a computer had that exceeded what a human can do. And we see exactly the same here. So I expect that this will be an area that brings many of the things that we have together to drive things forward. 
Now not to repeat too much what I said earlier, the other half of that equation is what are the chips for? And the chips fundamentally are for executing task given by a system that runs software. And so the desire to make that software run faster is unstoppable. 
Well, one way to do that is to say, well, what if we designed the system, the hardware system, just for certain types of software? And that is what everybody is doing right now. They're essentially creating architecture for specific applications that then can run blindingly fast. And so the intersection between the application and the hardware is therefore a place where one needs to be able to predict how good the results will be. 
And that is what all these efforts have been in the, prototyping, being the emulation and so on. Now the third area I want to mention, and I understand it's slightly adjacent to EDA, although I would look at it as EDA surround it, is IP. And one of the great accelerators in the history of design has been to have more and more accomplished IP blocks that have enormous functionality in the most advanced silicon technologies, which are difficult to build. 
And so the combination of those things is -- gives us a sense that for the coming years, we're in a very strong position. And by the way, we are applying that same AI that I mentioned before, also to our IP blocks. So there's an integration of the whole solution space."

Using software consulting seems to be increasing. And at the purely technical level, you appear to have been increasing substantially in areas like synthesis and custom.

And your question had some of the answers in it. You mentioned essentially supporting thing. And I would put those together, which is that no matter what the business -- how the business grows, some of that grows with it. 
But on top of that, there is an additional benefit of using our consulting, which is that we bring skills that a number of our customers have a difficulty getting themselves or growing themselves. And if these skills can be used to actually help them reduce their time, delay until the chips are done, that is of extremely high value. So that will continue. 
You mentioned Synthesis and Custom. And of course, Synthesis was our very first product. So after 34 years, we're still investing in that because there's still upside, except that Synthesis is now more called super AI, right? That's the new version of this. 
Custom is an area that we have invested in for quite a while, actually has done well this year and continues to grow in an excellent fashion. So a good area. 
There's 2 things that you didn't mention. One is 3DIC, which is the ability to bring together very, very tightly complex chips and that will grow as the hunger for more transistors will be unabatable. And lastly, SLM, silicon life cycle management. This is an area for us. We have invested in it both organically and through some acquisitions. 
And it's particularly interesting because the notion of putting inside of chips, the sensors, that then can essentially diagnose if the chip is still healthy, grows in importance as systems become more complex, and as systems go into application that could be human endangering, such as autonomous driving car, for example. 
And so this is an area that's finding a lot of interest where we are making very rapid advances. And with the sensors that we put inside of the chip, we've also put some AI inside of the chip and some AI outside so that one can learn from chips over their life cycle. So this will take a little bit of time until it's really embedded in broad adoption, but it is rely powerful capability that we're very excited about."

And so while we have multiyear contracts with our customers, that is certainly an opportunity to gradually further up as we deliver value to this entire industry, that in itself is so seminal in what all the verticals will be able to do over the years to come. So I see that as a positive. 
I know that some of the point increases in pricing have just have to do with shortages. These will go away over time. That's not what builds value.

The timing of IP and hardware really reflects when they want those shipments and they want that IP. And that hasn't shifted from 1 quarter to another. That just happens to be what it matches up their development schedules. And so there's really no normalized profile of that. And that's why we kind of -- we often refer to it as being very lumpy. 
With regards to backlog, the $6.9 billion of backlog, we don't guide on what the projections are going forward. But as we said, that quarter-to-quarter will vary. In Q4, we saw strong growth in run rate on the deals that we booked, and we also saw significant or significant renewals. The duration during the quarter was a little bit longer than 3 years.

At the same time, many of our customers say, yes, that's great, because now I'm going to use the engineering time that I saved to become even more competitive against my competition. And this is a normal phenomenon in our field, which is a constant acceleration of how quick the race is run. 
And these accelerations invariably happen when there are great opportunities. And so we saw that definitely in the early days of computation and the networking, the mobility wave, the race was on for faster chips, lower powered chips. And now I think the race is absolutely on share of computation, share of AI and so on. 
And so our customers see a very positive future, but they understand perfectly well that their competitors see it too and therefore, the race is on again. Be that as it may, the fact that we have sometimes a discontinuous advances, these are great opportunity moments from a competitive point of view for us, for a differentiation point of view for our customers.

I'm happy to report that Synopsys delivered another record year, substantially exceeding our original goals. We grew revenue 14% to $4.2 billion, with double-digit growth in all product groups and geographies. We substantially expanded our non-GAAP operating margin with more than 20% earnings growth and generated record cash flow of $1.49 billion. In addition, disruptive innovation and collaborations accelerated our momentum as a number of large customers significantly expanded their commitments with Synopsys as visible in an outstanding orders year. As a result, we enter fiscal 2022 with momentum. 
Looking forward, we are raising our long-term financial objectives to strong double-digit revenue growth anchored in a step-up in EDA and IP targets, ongoing non-GAAP operating margin expansion and non-GAAP earnings per share growth in the mid-teens range, all of which is driving very strong cash flow. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail. 
Underlying our elevated outlook is not only a vigorous market but, just as importantly, a long-term growing demand for Smart Everything in every vertical segment. The enhanced technical challenges powering this new era are well aligned with Synopsys' strength. Specifically, the Smart Everything era brings together massive amounts of data with the new wonders of machine learning software. Combined with a metaverse outlook of human machine interaction, the role of chip-centric electronic systems has enormous potential. This requires highly complex semiconductor chips with massive compute capability, evolving semiconductors from system on a chip to tightly integrated systems of chips and increased need for security and safety across software and hardware; that is, across the entire system. 
From an economic perspective, new entrants are already designing their own specialized chips. Traditional vertical market leaders are taking on a more active role in influencing chip and system architecture and design. At all levels, investments and urgency are increasing. 
To deliver on this promise, our customers are transforming the way they approach design. Whether it's processor or mobile teams combining multiple compute storage and connectivity chips together in 3DIC structures or hyperscalers investing in their own chip architectures to increase their cloud differentiation or automotive OEMs dictating specific safety protocols or financial services companies inserting security testing into their development processes, all are driven by the urgency of the economic opportunity and the need for strong partners to master the complexity of the tasks. Synopsys connects with all of these and is uniquely equipped to help catalyze this new era. 
The center of gravity of the technical challenges is the intersection of hardware and software. A chip is only as good as its interaction with the software and vice versa. In other words, the system. This system focus has been at the core of Synopsys innovation for many years and is now fueling mounting customer and business momentum. 
Nowhere is systemic complexity more visible than in our IP business. The sophistication of our IP blocks requires reaching deep down into the understanding of the advanced silicon nodes and also high up to the system architecture and software. IP is thus a bellwether of systems leadership as new architectures are increasingly jump-started by selecting the most important IP building blocks and their configuration. 
Benefiting from this, we achieved another record year in IP with revenue surpassing $1 billion and growing approximately 20%. This momentum is maintained for 2 reasons. First, continued strong demand to outsource IP as customers need their most skilled resources to focus on the differentiating aspect of their chips. Second, an increasing number of new entrants in segments such as automotive, high-performance compute and AI accelerate their schedule by, whenever possible, selecting complex IP building blocks that are commercially available from a company they trust. 
As the #1 provider of interface, foundation and physical IP, Synopsys is in a unique position to provide complete solutions across multiple key segments. For example, we have the broadest IP portfolio for the fast-growing high-performance compute and data center markets, including PCI Express, HBM3, 400/800 gig Ethernet and many memory interfaces. We also see continued strength in automotive fueled by the electrification of cars, the push to autonomous driving and the explicit demand for higher safety, security and reliability. Our IP has been selected by approximately 50 automotive companies with nearly 500 IP wins to date. 
In addition, Synopsys has always driven the leading edge, providing IP and, of course, EDA, on the most advanced process nodes. With the mobile and compute companies, we're deeply engaged at 3-nanometer and had over 250 design wins at 5-nanometer this year. 
Let me talk a bit about system verification. Under our Synopsys logo, our tagline states silicon to software. Our unique strength is to sit at the intersection of validating hardware and software or, simply put, verifying that the chips and the system do what was intended. Building on our market-leading VCS chip simulation solution, we were at the forefront of delivering software- and hardware-based prototyping more than a decade ago. Since then, our offering has rapidly gained technical and market leadership. 
2021 was a record hardware year, with strength in both emulation and prototyping. Our solutions sit at the sweet spot of hardware-software co-verification and our emulators are the fastest machines with the highest capacity and the lowest cost of ownership. This year, we increased our differentiation. We introduced application-specific emulation products, ZeBu Empower and ZeBu EP1, that are significantly faster and higher capacity than any competitive solution in the market. Meanwhile, our new HAPS-100 prototyping system now delivers 2x faster performance and 4x better debug, driving accelerated growth. During the year, we achieved multiple competitive wins and significantly broadened our customer base as we added more than 50 new logos and 200 repeat orders. 
Obviously, at the center of enabling the Smart Everything era sits the promise of AI, which begs the question, what about applying AI to chip design? Today, machine learning enables significant capabilities and runtime advances in all of our key products. About 2 years ago, we delivered a fundamental disruptive technology at a very different magnitude: using AI to automate not just tools but entire design flows. The outcome is remarkable. 
Our award-winning DSO.ai solution is getting great results on production designs with a rapidly growing number of customer partners. DSO.ai, which stands for design space optimization using AI, does exactly what the name says. It explores many, many design options, learns from them using design and tool data and finds design configurations that a human is unlikely to ever find. Moreover, since design variables such as performance, power, size, yields, reliability and so on, all trade off against each other, DSO.ai can optimize well beyond what the design team can easily fathom. 
Through this year, results got better and better. Run by our customers on real production designs, DSO.ai has reduced design times from months to weeks with superior performance and power results. One notable example is Samsung, which relied on DSO.ai for multiple complex projects, the most recent being an advanced production design for a new mobile product. Applied at every stage of design implementation, DSO.ai delivered performance well beyond their speed target and substantially reduced power consumption, all while saving weeks of manual effort. 
Central to DSO.ai's results are the powerful engines underneath it: our Fusion Design Platform. The platform is centered around our Fusion Compiler product, the only solution today to seamlessly integrate market-leading synthesis and place and route, cross-checked and optimized by timing, power and physical sign-off all in a single tool. Fusion Compiler's full flow proliferation and competitive wins increased through the year, including major expansions and competitive displacements. Revenue more than doubled this year. 
Seminal to our sustainable differentiation is native integration of our golden sign-off products. As recognized by multiple awards from our foundry partners, our deep collaborations ensure that our mutual customers have well-honed and trusted design flows at the most advanced technologies. 
In addition to a continued push for smaller geometries, the Smart Everything hunger for much more compute, storage and data management is so high that the economics of physically abutting and stacking multiple chips or chiplets is driving a push towards so-called 3DIC design. This brings about many challenges, including architecting how to partition into multiple chiplets, making the connections between the chiplets blindingly fast and predicting and dissipating the heat of so much computation. 
Synopsys is at the forefront of this emerging wave. In 2020, we introduced 3DIC Compiler, which offers a modern differentiated approach to this complex design challenge. Our solution is being deployed in production and cutting-edge 3DIC designs in the industry. 
Another new era showing great promise is our Silicon Lifecycle Management Platform, which monitors, analyzes and optimizes chips throughout their life span. The adoption of key sensor IP accelerated during this year with 25 new logos, and we recently added AI-powered real-time system optimization for infield applications with the acquisition of ConcertIO. 
With the increase in systemic complexity to deliver Smart Everything, security and safety is a rapidly growing theme from chips to application software. About 7 years ago, we invested in software integrity to provide security and quality testing for the massive amounts of software in today's world. Synopsys has since built the broadest portfolio of products and consulting services in the market. This year, we were recognized for the fifth year in a row as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for application security testing. 
Benefiting from the operational enhancements we've made, our Software Integrity business achieved 10% growth for the full year, with particularly strong order flow, exceeding our original expectations. We expect to return to our 15% to 20% revenue growth objective in 2022. 
During the year, our focus has been to scale our go-to-market strategy and execution. We launched our new partner program this year, adding dozens of channel partners and systems integrators. They're already expanding our reach into customer groups and geographies that we hadn't reached in the past. We successfully refined our sales structure and tuned our market priorities. One proof point is the substantial growth of multiyear, multimillion-dollar agreements. This notably includes our largest-ever Software Integrity order with a U.S. hyperscaler as well as significant renewals in the networking, airline and enterprise software segments. 
We also made considerable progress with our Polaris Software Integrity Platform. We delivered Intelligent Orchestration, which automates security testing within a company's specific protocols. This makes it easier and more efficient to integrate directly into their development pipeline. We enhanced our Black Duck software composition analysis solution, which positions us very well for software supply chain risk cases. Finally, the addition of risk management products that automate and accelerate discovery and remediation of software vulnerabilities through Code DX rounds out our solution well beyond what competitors provide. 
In summary, we delivered excellent results in 2021, substantially greater than our original plan with strength in all product groups and all geographies. We're entering 2022 with strong technical and market momentum. We are seeing significantly expanded customer commitments and collaborations as our wave of innovations will be crucial to help catalyze the era of Smart Everything. And as a result, we are raising our long-term financial objectives. 
Let me say thank you to our entire Synopsys staff for another great year. I'm looking forward to an exciting journey into our next phase of growth. 
Finally, I'm sure you all saw our other news earlier today that our CFO, Trac Pham, has decided to retire in fiscal 2022. Trac has been a wonderful partner and excellent leader. And while we understand and support his desire to prioritize time with his family, we will miss him. He will, of course, remain a good friend to the company and to all of us personally. Trac will stay with Synopsys until a successor is in place to ensure a seamless transition. Trac, to you and your family, we wish the very best. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Trac."

I'm confident in the leadership team, and I will manage the transition well. I'll be here for a while still, and I look forward to talking to many of you. 
Turning to our results. FY '21 was an excellent year and featured record results in all key metrics, including revenue, non-GAAP earnings and operating cash flow. Looking to FY '22 and beyond, we have seen a step-up in revenue growth due to the following: first, strong execution and compelling new innovations; second, expanding customer commitments; and third, the new market era and opportunity that Aart referred to earlier. 
Additionally, because of the essential nature of our customers' R&D priorities and our business model, which results in nearly 90% recurring revenue and significant noncancelable backlog, we are in the position to have a high level of stability as well. Ending backlog for Q4 was $6.9 billion. These dynamics give us the confidence to raise our long-term financial objectives, which I'll describe in greater detail momentarily. 
First, some highlights of our full year 2021 results. We generated total revenue of $4.2 billion, up 14% from the prior year with double-digit growth across all products and geographies. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $3.5 billion, and total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $2.9 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 30.5%. GAAP earnings per share were $4.81, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $6.84, up 23% over the prior year. 
Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was $3.8 billion driven by broad-based strength across all product groups and geographies. Software Integrity segment revenue was $394 million, up 10% over the prior year and exceeded our original plan. We expect to return to our 15% to 20% growth objective in 2022. In addition, following the investments and operational adjustments we made this past year, we expect to expand adjusted operating margin in 2022. 
Turning to cash. Operating cash flow for the year was a record $1.49 billion, reflecting our strong results and robust collections. We ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $1.58 billion and total debt of $100 million. During the year, we completed buybacks of $788 million or 56% of free cash flow. 
Now to our targets. Based on our current assessment of the timing of hardware and IP deliveries, we expect Q1 to be our highest revenue quarter and roughly evenly split for the balance of the year. We expect an expense profile similar to that in revenue for Q2 through Q4. For fiscal year 2022, the full year targets are: revenue of $4.725 billion to $4.775 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $3.778 billion and $3.835 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $3.225 billion and $3.255 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin improvement of more than 100 basis points; non-GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP earnings of $5.39 to $5.65 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $7.73 to $7.80 per share, representing mid-teen growth despite a higher tax rate; cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. 
I'd like to offer some additional thoughts regarding the long-term tax rate assumption. Based on preliminary modeling, we believe the non-GAAP tax rate of 18% is potentially sustainable beyond 2022. However, given the uncertain outcome of tax reform, it is premature for us to confirm a longer-term tax rate at this time. 
Now to the targets for the first quarter: revenue of $1.25 billion and $1.28 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $934 million and $964 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $802 million and $812 million; GAAP earnings of $1.75 to $1.92 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $2.35 to $2.40 per share. Our press release and financial supplement include additional targets and GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliations. 
Finally, we are raising our long-term financial objectives, all of which are on a multiyear basis, with the expectation that particular years will vary depending on the timing of deliverables and other commitments. Our goal is to deliver annual double-digit revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS growth in the mid-teens range, reflecting our continued focus on non-GAAP operating margin expansion of more than 100 basis points per year. In terms of product groups, our objective is to grow EDA revenue in the double digits, IP in the mid-teens and Software Integrity between 15% to 20%. 
In summary, our record results this year are a testament to our strong execution, to our focus on investing for long-term scalability and shareholder value and to our commitment and ability to innovate to meet growing customer needs. This combination is driving a step-up to a new level of growth for us, and our raised long-term financial objectives reflect confidence in our ability to succeed.

On the inside, we have a high degree of confidence because many of the investments that we've put in place over a number of years are really coming together well because the vision of where our field towards -- heading towards is actually moving along. And so this notion of transforming the world towards smart capabilities in every vertical market requires a whole set of technologies that we've been investing in. 
And so be it in the area of design implementation, including the AI capabilities, be it in the verification and validation of entire systems, including the intersection of hardware and software but also in the deep investments in advanced technologies, in the overarching investments in quality of software and security, all of these trends are really manifesting themselves very actively. And we see it manifest itself in many collaborations and increased commitments of customers to us, as also witnessed in a strong backlog. And so right there, that gives us a sense for the coming year. 
From the outside, it is very clearly visible that the semiconductor industry itself is doing well, not only because -- visible through some shortages that may be painful but illustrate how important semiconductors are, but because so many companies, including the ones you mentioned, hyperscalers, automotive companies, industrial companies, are all starting to invest in -- be it either architectures that contemplate the semiconductors or semiconductor development themselves.

And now they need more compute, more capacity, better throughput and all that. And all of that's still the same thing, which is advanced chips or combination of chips. 
And so they intersect with us mostly in 2 areas. One is, how can you predict how fast the system will run by actually running software on emulators or prototypes? And secondly, how can you actually make the actual chips then even faster by really implementing the latest state-of-the-art technology and optimizing your architecture for just the tasks that they want to do?
And this is where the use of AI to the design flow becomes particularly interesting because very often, people start with chips that they already have, and then they move to a new node -- technology node. And simultaneously, they say, ""Oh, let me optimize for a specific set of staff."" And that optimization can largely be automated with our tools. 
And so you see an acceleration everywhere, and acceleration has always been the name of the game in our field. And I would say those are sort of the 2 biggest drivers of our business."

To your broader question, I would just say that the results in '21 and the outlook that we have for '22 really reflects strong momentum in both hardware and IP. We hit record -- we had record revenues for hardware in '21. And keep in mind, that is compared to a year in '20 where it was pretty significantly back-end loaded.

It's hard to predict how well others will do, and in many ways, we do well when the entire industry does well.

It's hard to predict how well others will do, and in many ways, we do well when the entire industry does well. But we do have so many positions where many of our technologies are extremely competitive at this point in time. And it is a point in time where a number of customers are looking to line up with suppliers that they trust over a longer haul because they clearly see that the advances that are happening right now and coming demand a lot of technology and a lot of support. 
Now you mentioned Fusion, and I'm glad you did because as you well know, this is an area that we have invested in for many, many years with the concept being that instead of running successions of independent tools, having multiple tools essentially collaborate, if I can use that term, to get to a better result was the essence of Fusion. 
And Fusion is working very well and, as we mentioned in the preamble, growing very well. But it's doubly meaningful because Fusion is also a key ingredient in now layering on top of that this notion of artificially driving autonomous design flows. And the fact that we can access many, many different technologies inside of Fusion to have an AI algorithm learn and get better results has basically been just astoundingly exciting to see. 
And in many ways, to me, it feels like literally the early days of Synopsys where at that time synthesis was almost like a miracle. Well, it was not a miracle. It was a lot of hard work, but it was capabilities a computer had that exceeded what a human can do. And we see exactly the same here. So I expect that this will be an area that brings many of what -- the things that we have together to drive things forward. 
Now not to repeat too much what I said earlier, the other half of that equation is, what are the chips for? And the chips are fundamentally for executing tasks given by a system that runs software. And so the desire to make that software run faster is unstoppable. Well, one way to do that is to say, well, what if we designed the system, the hardware system just for certain types of software? And that is what everybody is doing right now. They're essentially creating new architectures for specific applications that then can run blindingly fast. 
And so the intersection between the application and the hardware is therefore a place where one needs to be able to predict how good the results will be. And that is what all these efforts have been in the prototyping, the emulation and so on. 
Now the third area I want to mention, and I understand it's slightly adjacent to EDA, although I would look at it as EDA surrounds it, is IP. And one of the great accelerators in the history of design has been to have more and more accomplished IP blocks that have enormous functionality in the most advanced silicon technologies, which are difficult to build. 
And so the combination of those things is what gives us a sense that for the coming years, we're in a very strong position. And by the way, we are applying that same AI that I mentioned before also to our IP blocks. So there's an integration of the whole solution space."

And I would put those together, which is that no matter what the business -- how the business grows, some of that grows with it. But on top of that, there is an additional benefit of using our consulting, which is that we bring skills that a number of our customers have a difficulty getting themselves or growing themselves. And if these skills can be used to actually help them reduce their time, delay until the chips are done, that is of extremely high value. So that will continue. 
You mentioned synthesis and custom. And of course, synthesis was our very first product. So after 34 years, we're still investing in that because there's still upside except that synthesis is now more and more called super AI, right? That's the new version of this. Custom is an area that we have invested in for quite a while and actually has done well this year and continues to grow in an excellent fashion. So good area. 
There's 2 that you didn't mention. One is 3DIC, which is the ability to bring together very, very tightly, extremely complex chips, and that will grow as the hunger for more transistors will be unabatable. And lastly, SLM, Silicon Lifecycle Management. This is a new area for us. We have invested in it both organically and through some acquisitions. And it's particularly interesting because the notion of putting inside of chips the sensors that then can essentially diagnose if the chip is still healthy grows in importance as systems become more complex and as systems go into applications that could be human-endangering, such as autonomous driving car, for example. 
And so this is an area that's finding a lot of interest where we are making very rapid advances. And with the sensors that we put inside of the chips, we've also put some AI inside of the chip and some AI outside so that one can learn from chips over their life cycle. So this will take a little bit of time until it's really embedded in broad adoption, but it is extremely powerful capability that we're very excited about."

And so while we have multiyear contracts with our customers, that is certainly an opportunity to gradually feather up as we deliver more value to this entire industry, that in itself is so seminal in what all the verticals will be able to do over the years to come. So I see that as a positive.

The timing of IP and hardware really reflects when they want those shipments and when they want that IP. And that hasn't shifted from 1 quarter to another. That just happens to be when it matches up their development schedules. And so there's really no normalized profile of that. And that's why we kind of -- we often refer to it as being very lumpy. 
With regards to backlog, the $6.9 billion of backlog, we don't guide on what the projections are going forward. But as we said, that quarter-to-quarter, it will vary.

I noticed you did take down the number -- I mean, the year of average contract lands up around your supplement. But you just said that the duration seems to be a little bit longer than 3 years. Obviously, I understand maybe a few large -- very large contracts could skew that number. 
However, I want to ask you because -- since you mentioned your customers are expanding commitment with you, which partly resulted in the high backlog number. I wondered, is that like a long-term trend that the contract duration is going to be north of 3 years going forward? Or this is just maybe a 1-quarter phenomenon, and they will maybe go back to somewhere between 2 to 3 years?"

But as we've seen, if you look at our history, it tends to trend around that 3-year range. 
With regards to the expanded commitment, it is dollar size, it is the breadth of the products that they are purchasing, and in this case, in Q4, some of these deals, the length of the deal. But they are -- that's not typically the norm, and we don't necessarily see our business growing in terms of duration."

In terms of EDA and with regards to DSO.ai, you guys mentioned that DSO.ai can deliver results faster than human beings. I tried to understand EDA, you guys said it largely tracks the industry R&D spend. But if you say the use of AI can get results faster than human beings, I could imagine maybe you can go ask your customers, ""Hey, my product can really do things faster than human beings. Maybe the fixed R&D budget, you should allocate more to EDA tools."" Maybe that will change the trajectory of EDA growth. Maybe the high percentage can go -- R&D expenses can go into EDA. Is that the right way to think about, I mean, in terms of the impact of a DSO.ai going a little bit longer term?"

At the same time, many of our customers say, ""Yes, that's great because now I'm going to use the engineering time that I save to become even more competitive against my competition."" And this is a normal phenomenon in our field, which is a constant acceleration of how quick the race is run. And these accelerations invariably happen when there are great opportunities. 
And so we saw that definitely in the early days of computation and the networking, the mobility wave, the race was on for faster chips, lower-power chips. And now I think the race is absolutely on for share of computation, share of AI and so on. And so our customers see a very positive future, but they understand perfectly well that their competitors see it, too, and therefore, the race is on again. 
Be that as it may, the fact that we have sometimes discontinuous advances, these are great opportunity moments for -- from a competitive point of view for us, for a differentiation point of view for our customers. And so we will absolutely try to do as much as possible what you suggest. And this is one of the reasons why we have a positive confidence also in the coming not just year but years."
