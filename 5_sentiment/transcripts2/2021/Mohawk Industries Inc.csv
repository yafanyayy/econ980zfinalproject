First, I want to congratulate Jim on his new position. I've worked with him for more than 10 years, and look forward to Jim further enhancing our business strategies and results in his new role. We had a very strong first quarter and del",575,"Thank you, Frank. First, I want to congratulate Jim on his new position. I've worked with him for more than 10 years, and look forward to Jim further enhancing our business strategies and results in his new role. We had a very strong first quarter and delivered record sales of $2.6 billion, an increase of 9% as reported, with adjusted operating earnings and EPS of $305 million and $3.54.
The business was stronger than we had anticipated with residential markets outperforming around the globe. Our free cash flow for the fourth quarter was about $248 million, after capital investments of $160 million. For the year, we generated record cash flow of more than $1.3 billion.
In the first half of last year, our industry was under enormous stress as the pandemic spread. And we responded to the disruption by minimizing costs, lowering inventory levels, initiating restructuring actions and reinforcing our liquidity. In the second half, the residential flooring demand recovered significantly faster than expected as people spend more time at home. Meanwhile, commercial flooring demand remains depressed due to business and being postponed or canceled. Our inventory levels decreased in the second and third periods as sales strengthens and production was limited by capacity, workforce absenteeism and labor shortages.
SG&A investments and promotional activities were curtailed during the year to improve our margins. The pandemic created substantial differences between our segments that are varying restrictions, stimulus, consumer responses and our ability to raise production levels. Our revenues and operating income rebounded and surpassed the prior year for both the fourth quarter and the second half.
Our fourth quarter results exceeded our expectations as we posted our highest ever quarterly sales, even with increasing COVID cases around the world. All of our markets saw strengthening residential purchases with laminate, LVT and sheet vinyl, outperforming other flooring categories. Our residential performance was partially offset by a weak commercial market in the regions where we have more significant business in that channel. Our results were improved by higher volumes, restructuring and greater leverage on costs while being adversely affected by lower production runs in inventory, absenteeism and labor shortages in some operations.
We are also seeing greater inflationary pressures in many product categories, and we're increasing prices to recover. Our Flooring Rest of the World segment continue to outperform with significant sales growth, higher operating leverage and improved productivity. The segment delivered further improvements in LVT production and cost, which enhanced our performance in the period.
Our global ceramic and flooring North America segments also improved, although both experienced a greater impact from commercial headwinds.
Through the fourth quarter, we achieved about $50 million of the projected $100 million to $110 million in anticipated savings from our restructuring initiatives. We continue to assess some projects based on changing market conditions. After paying off our short-term debt and prefunding our longer-term maturities in the second quarter, our net debt leverage is at historical low. Our strong financial position gives us flexibility to pursue additional opportunities, including internal investments, acquisitions and stock purchases. Since the third quarter, we've acquired approximately 1 million shares of our stock for $130 million, as part of our share repurchase plan.
Since the pandemic began, our organization has been protecting one another and supporting our customers around the world. We are mitigating the spread of COVID, utilizing best practices while testing and tracking employees with potential contacts.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

I would like to add that I'm both honored and excited about the opportunity to lead Mohawk's very talented global finance team.Now let's review our financial performance for Q4 2020. Sales exceeded $2.6 billion for the quarter, a 9% inc",930,"Thank you, Jeff. I would like to add that I'm both honored and excited about the opportunity to lead Mohawk's very talented global finance team.
Now let's review our financial performance for Q4 2020. Sales exceeded $2.6 billion for the quarter, a 9% increase, as reported, or 5.5% on a constant basis, with our Flooring Rest of the World segment outperforming. Q4 had 2 additional shipping days in most businesses. And as you consider 2021's financial projections, please remember to take into account the following items. Across most of our businesses, Q1 has 3 additional days or approximately 5% more, and Q4 has 4 fewer days or approximately 6% less compared to prior year. This year's sales should continue higher growth and full year operating margin should improve. Our Q2 comps are very low, and the second half comps are more difficult with the rebound that occurred last year. Also last year, in Q3 and Q4, there was less time off for holidays for our customers and us. Time off should be greater this year.
Now coming back to the P&L. Gross margin was 27.9% as reported or 28.8%, excluding charges, increasing 120 basis points from 27.6% in the prior year. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher volume of $51 million, productivity of $50 million and lower inflation of $21 million, partially offset by price/mix of $30 million.
SG&A, as reported, was 17.2% or 17.3% versus 19.1% in the prior year, both excluding charges. The lower SG&A percent was driven by improved leverage on increased volume and stronger productivity of $21 million.
Operating income, as reported, was 10.7%. Restructuring charges for the quarter were $22 million, and our restructuring initiatives are on track, with year-to-date savings accounting for approximately $50 million of our announced $100 million to $110 million plan.
Operating margin, excluding charges, $305 million or 11.6%, improving from 8.4% last year or 320 basis points. This increase was driven by productivity of $71 million, stronger volume of $42 million and reduced inflation of $12 million, partially offset by the previously noted unfavorable price/mix of $30 million.
Interest expense of $16 million, including the impact of our new 2020 bond offerings, and we expect Q1 to be approximately $16 million to $16.5 million. Other income of $7 million, driven by favorable transactional FX and short-term investment returns.
Our Q4 on a non-GAAP tax rate at 14.8% versus 18.9% in the prior year, benefiting in part from the U.S. Cares Act. We expect Q1 2021 to be approximately 21%.
Earnings per share, as reported, of $3.49, or excluding charges of $3.54, growing 57% year-over-year.
Now turning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of $920 million, a 7% increase, as reported, with the business up 6% on a constant basis with growth across all geographies, the largest increase being in Brazil and Russia. Operating income, excluding charges of $88 million and 9.5% return. That's up 65% or 330 basis points versus prior year. The increase was from productivity of $28 million, volume of $16 million, and lower shutdown expense of $4 million, partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of $12 million and unfavorable FX of $4 million.
Flooring North America sales of $963 million or 3% increase, as reported, or flat on a constant basis, led by strength in our residential focused products, offset by the weakness in the commercial channel. Operating income, excluding charges of $91 million or 9.5%. That's an increase of 27% or 180 basis points compared to prior year. This increase was driven by higher productivity of $26 million, lower inflation of $7 million, an increased volume of $3 million, partially offset by price/mix of $18 million.
And Flooring Rest of the World with sales of $759 million, a 20% increase as reported or 13% on a constant basis. Driven by our resilient laminate and panels businesses in Europe and our carpet business in Australia and New Zealand. Operating income excluding charges of $138 million or 18.2%, up 420 basis points or 57% versus prior year. The main drivers were the higher volume of $23 million, improved productivity of $16 million and lower inflation of $8 million, partially offset by unfavorable FX of approximately $4 million. Corporate and eliminations came in at $12 million, and you would expect 2021 to be approximately $40 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments increased to over $1.3 billion, driven by the Q4 free cash flow of $248 million, bringing the full year 2020 -- full year cash flow -- free cash flow to approximately $1.3 billion. Receivables were just over $1.7 billion, with DSO improving to 59 days versus the prior year, 62 days. Inventories just over $1.9 billion, dropped almost $400 million or 16% from prior year, with a marginal sequential increase of approximately $30 million, adjusting for FX from Q3. Inventory days are at 103 days versus 134 days in the prior year.
Property, plant and equipment, just under $4.6 billion, with CapEx of $160 million for the quarter, in line with our D&A. And full year CapEx was $426 million with D&A of just over $600 million. We estimate that 2021 annual CapEx to be in line with our D&A of approximately $590 million.
And lastly, the balance sheet and cash flow remained very strong with gross debt of just over $2.7 billion. Total cash and short-term investments, as previously noted, over $1.3 billion, leading us to a leverage of 1x adjusted EBITDA.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris, who will provide details on our fourth quarter performance."

Sales for our flooring rest of World segment increased 20% in the period, as reported, or 13% on a constant basis, significantly exceeding our forecast. Margins expanded over last year to 17.5%, as reported, or 18.2%, excluding restructuring charges, due to higher volume and positive leverage on SG&A and operations, partially offset by currency headwinds. Sales and margins were strong in most categories and geographies with most of our plants operating near capacity in the fourth quarter. Raw material costs began to rise in many of our product categories and we are taking pricing actions to respond to the increases.
Laminate, the segment's largest flooring category delivered significant growth in the period across most of our markets. Our margins increased as higher volumes drove greater absorption of manufacturing and SG&A costs, while increased productivity and better throughput enhanced our results. We continue to focus on our premium collections that feature superior visuals and waterproof technology. Our service levels showed improvement during the period, though they remain below our standards. To satisfy higher demand for existing products, we chose to postpone introductions of our next-generation laminate collections in most markets.
Our LVT sales increased substantially in the quarter, led by accelerated growth of our rigid collections. Both our LVT margins and profitability improved due to increased volume, lower production cost and SG&A absorption. We have increased staffing to operate all LVT lines 7 days per week. We are introducing new collections with enhanced visuals and exclusive water type joints that better prevent water damage. We are implementing price increases in our LVT collections to compensate for rising material costs.
Our sheet vinyl business rebounded as our retailers reopened their shops and their export markets picked up. Our plants ran at high production levels that reduced our operating costs, though unfavorable currency partially offset. All of our European sheet vinyl plants were running your capacity, and we've announced price increases. Our greenfield Russian sheet vinyl plants volume has grown to a level that its margins are in line with our other businesses.
We have completed the consolidation of our wood operations in Malaysia, during the period, our production was impacted by equipment installation and transportation challenges due to COVID. The equipment from our closed European plant has now been installed, and we are improving our throughput and wood sourcing strategies.
Our wood panels performed well in the period with sales limited by our capacity and low inventories. Our productivity improved in the quarter, increasing our volume and throughput. Demand for our customized mezzanine floors is growing as greater e-commerce sales have increased the need for warehouse space. To cover rising material costs for our wood panels, we're also implementing price increases.
Product mix continues to improve due to a higher share of stylized products due to sales investments to increase project specifications. We are expanding our capacity in melamine products to further improve our margins.
In insulation, volume was good, though our margins were impacted by significant material inflation due to supply constraints. We have implemented a price increase and have announced another to keep pace with the rising cost. Demand for the category remains strong, enhanced by government incentives for energy savings.
Sales in Australia and New Zealand were strong in the fourth quarter and margins improved with higher volume and lower material costs from our longer supply chain. We enhanced our market position with more aggressive sales initiatives and by providing more consistent service under difficult circumstances. We have leveraged our relationship with carpet retailers to expand sales of our hard surface products. Our results are benefiting from upgrades to our carpet and hard surface offering, manufacturing assets and distribution capabilities that we've implemented since we acquired Godfrey Hirst.
For the quarter, our Global Ceramic segment sales rose 7% as reported, with improved results across the world, led by growth in the residential channel from heightened remodeling and home sales. Operating margins for this segment expanded to 8.7%, as reported, or 9.5%, excluding restructuring costs, due to higher volume and improved productivity, somewhat reduced by commercial product mix and currency.
Our Brazilian and Mexican businesses delivered record quarterly sales and expanded margins even with inflationary headwinds. Manufacturing constraints and low inventories limited growth in most of our regions. Material, energy and transportation costs are rising, and we are increasing prices in most markets to offset these pressures.
Our U.S. ceramic business delivered strong residential sales growth, while commercial remained challenged as businesses defer investments. Our service centers are experiencing improved customer traffic due to higher home sales and remodeling activity. The home center channel outperformed with increased demand and inventory replenishments. To provide additional features and benefits, we are expanding our higher-value collections with high gloss polish tiles, antimicrobial treatments and matching floor and wall combinations.
We have announced price increases across most of our collections to pass-through higher transportation costs. Our ceramic plant productivity and cost improved during the period due to higher volumes and continued process improvements. Our restructuring initiatives are progressing, and we should complete our ceramic plant consolidations by the end of the first quarter.
Our countertop business is increasing substantially, with sales of our ports products growing significantly. Our quartz countertop production, cost and margins continue to improve our results and we are increasing our mix with higher value stylized products.
Our Mexican ceramic business delivered its best quarterly sales and performance even with capacity constraints. Our margins improved with higher productivity, partially reduced by inflation and product mix. Our inventories declined and our backlog remains high as we ended the period. Our customers have opened 30 exclusive Daltile stores in the country which will enhance our sales and strengthen our brand. To cover rising inflation, we have announced price increases.
Brazil also delivered record sales in the period, with all channels performing well. Our margins improved due to increased volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation in product mix. Our Brazilian plants are operating at capacity and have been allocating production to customers. Our backlog remains high, and we are increasing price to recover inflation. We're investing to further upgrade our manufacturing assets this year. For the quarter, our European ceramic sales and profitability were above last year. Some Southern European economies were more affected by COVID and have remained softer than other regions. Our residential sales were stronger with more competitive pricing and lower commercial sales, negatively impacting our product mix and margins.
We are launching differentiated collections to improve our mix with small sizes, large porcelain slabs, Outdoor Products & Enhanced design technology. In the period, our service levels improved with the plants operating at higher rates, though inventories remain low due to higher demand.
Our Russian ceramic business delivered strong results during the period, even with inflation and currency headwinds. Sales rose significantly in all channels, led by new residential construction, which benefited from historically low interest rates. To meet higher demand, we ran more production by limiting holiday shutdowns. We are successfully ramping up our new premium sanitary ware manufacturing and will expand it further this year. The sanitary ware complements our ceramic tile collections and will enhance our product offering in our owned and franchised stores.
For the period, our Flooring North America sales increased 3%, as reported, and our adjusted margins expanded 8.6%, as reported, or 9.5%, excluding restructuring costs. We had strong growth in the residential channel, offset by lower commercial, which improved from its low base in prior periods. Our service levels improved as we increased production in the period, so high demand required allocating some products.
Due to higher demand in COVID disruption in our plants, our inventories did not grow as we anticipated. To improve our margin and mix, we're launching many innovative products that address the needs of family spending more time at home. We are taking pricing action in most products due to rising material, labor and transportation costs. We have executed a large part of our restructuring initiatives, which is benefiting our results with some of the savings flowing through inventory in future periods. Some of our operations were inhibited by increased absenteeism and labor shortages due to COVID, and we anticipate the higher production levels will improve our service and our inventory positions.
Our residential carpet sales grew during the period as comfort and noise reduction have become more important to consumers. The demand for residential carpet is strong, and our sales momentum should be solid. We have taken many actions to improve our productivity, including rationalizing our product offering and reducing our operational complexities. Our restructuring actions have lowered our overhead and improved our cost and yields. Our new carpet collections will provide improved margins while offering superior styling, features and value.
We're introducing smartstrand collections with the new patented hypoallergenic backing, making installation faster and recycling easier. We're adding new pattern technologies and expanding our unique continuum polyester collections made from recycled bottles. We've announced price increases due to increasing inflation in materials, labor and transportation.
Our commercial business has improved from its bottom, but remains depressed along with their retail, hospitality, office and aviation sectors. Our commercial hard surface sales are outperforming carpet, and we have improved our online tools to make it easier for designers to select and customize our products. We are managing our cost structures, which have been deleveraged by lower volume, and we have announced price increases across our product offering.
Our Laminate business is growing substantially in all channels as our unique visuals and waterproof technology have become desirable alternatives to both natural wood and LVT. Our plants are running at capacity to meet the exceptional demand, and we're supplementing domestic production with laminate source from our worldwide operations. We have executed numerous process enhancements to increase our laminate and board production. And by the end of the year, a new line should be operational with additional capabilities. We announced a price increase on our laminate collections because of rising cost.
We have repurposed a plant in Virginia to manufacture a premium wood flooring collection that has been in development for 4 years. Applying our exclusive technologies, we created a truly waterproof wood flooring with dramatically improved scratch, dent and wear resistant for today's active households. We've also updated our other wood collections to align with evolving market trends.
Sales of both our LVT and sheet vinyl improved substantially during the period, supported by strength in new housing starts and residential remodeling. We have multiple engineers from our European business working in our U.S. operations to implement demonstrated improvements to increase output, reduce material costs and enhance product visuals and performance. We're introducing updated residential and commercial products with our new water technology that will improve our mix and margins. As in other categories, we've announced price increases due to rising material and transportation costs.
With that, I'll return the call to Jeff."

Our fourth quarter sales and operating performance were much stronger than we anticipated. We ran our plants around the world at high levels during the period, but fell short of the inventory build we anticipated. Our operations are taking actions to optimize throughput and reach our desired service levels. Given present trends, the momentum of our residential business should remain strong, while commercial should slowly improve from its trough. We will benefit from structural improvements in our costs and innovative new products that will enhance our mix. Most of the COVID restrictions around the world have not directly impacted the sales or installation of our products. Continued government subsidies and low interest rates should support economic recoveries, new home construction and residential remodeling. We see increasing inflation in most of our product categories and are raising prices in response.
Assuming current conditions continue, we anticipate our first quarter adjusted EPS to be between $2.69 and $2.79, excluding restructuring charges. The strength of our organization was demonstrated by our management of last year's historic decline in sales and the subsequent spike in demand while protecting our employees and customers. Our strategies and initiatives remain flexible to adapt to changing economic conditions.
With improving sales and cash flow and a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities.

Residential remains strong and commercial continues at depressed levels. As we go through the year, we anticipate the economy strengthening more and housing trends remaining positive. At this point, we see commercial coming off the trough but we do not expect it to rebound to prior levels this year. Our commercial margins, to remind you, are higher than our residential and has a significant impact on our Flooring North America and Global ceramic segments.
Our SG&A spending, we expect to stay in line this year with the sales growth and full year margins should expand with improved cost and mix. Our production and productivity should be higher with less interruptions, absenteeism improving and increased inventory and cost-saving initiatives. All the businesses that we have, have upside from last year, but it's not unlimited, and we do not have the normal inventory of the cushion to help us as we go through the year. A weaker dollar will also improve our foreign translated results, and the tax rate should go back to normal at around 21%.
If you look at the first quarter, it's going to be seasonally stronger than historical, and it's going to have 5% more days in it. As we said, we're raising prices 3% to 8%, and sometimes even more, given the inflationary pressures that are going on. In a period, we're also still managing absenteeism that's at high rates in some places as well as some supply disruptions in various markets and products.
As we go into the second quarter, it has low comps, and you guys need to adjust the sales relative to the trend line rather than last year. And then last year, as we look at the third and fourth quarters, it rebounded significantly, which is making our comps more difficult in the second half. As COVID gets under control, we'll have to see how spending on remodeling of homes changes, if at all. We and our customers during those second half periods of third and fourth quarter, reduced the holiday time off. That positively impacted revenues as well as margins for both periods. We anticipate more normal conditions in the second half of this year. Then we get to the fourth quarter, again, it has the 6% fewer days this year than last year. So that's to try to help you with some of the quarterly trends."

The LVT in Europe is in line with our rest of our profitability, and we're expecting it to catch up this year with the engineers here executing as we speak, to change the problems in the United States.
At the same time, we had some of our own internal and organizational problems. You know we changed the management and organization of the Flooring North America business at the same time.

And so all the sectors are under pressure and they haven't come out. You have the new construction part of the business, which people stock. So there's going to be a void in between, between the new construction projects that are ending. That's helped some of our businesses as they kept flowing through. But the new ones that there's a void in between, and we're having a hard time gauging, how they're going to pick up and where they're going to come through. And then just as one more part in our commercial business in the category, we're the last thing to go in. So everything else has to be done before ours comes in and we fill the pickup.

The 2 businesses that we have that where we have the most -- the big parts of commercial are in our Flooring North America Carpet business, our LVT business, our U.S. Ceramic business and our European Ceramic business is where the largest pieces are the other businesses are much more heavier and residential and don't have the same impact that they're having in those three.

So looking at the margins in the back half of the year of '20, certainly, fourth quarter benefited more than expected from the stronger sales and the less time off.

You're still looking for strong, if not stronger year-over-year growth particularly against easier comps. And hopefully, some of the manufacturing efficiencies are reduced and maybe commercially, even comes back a little bit, we'll see. But certainly, probably wouldn't get worse from here.
So are we to think that you can hold on to these types of low double-digit consolidated operating margins? Or are there some adjustments we need to make based on, again, either time off? Certainly, your plants should still be running at pretty high levels.

And to tell you the truth, we have a big question mark on our piece, we don't know.
We're assuming that the third quarter will be more difficult with the comps because we're assuming we'll get back to closer vacation schedules and timing.

At the same time, the markets expanded into other channels because of it, it's now being used in new construction, it's being accepted as an alternative to wood, it's being used in the retail remodeling business at a much higher level, and it's still doing well and growing in the home center channels. So all the parks are coming together. And the same thing is happening in the European business with our unique position in the marketplace. With that, we have a new line coming in that will be operating at the end of this year. We'll add about another $125 million of capacity to the U.S. market. We are importing product from our operations around the world to supplement it until that comes in. As we go through. So that's -- the business is doing well, and we're expanding it further.
The LVT business continues to do well. We are expanding our capacities by operating the plants well. And then at the same time, we're looking at various plans how to grow further long term."

I'm curious if there's any update to what we should be thinking about incremental margins across the various segments? And for instance, when we look at 1Q having a number of extra days and we think about the extra sales that will come with that, would it be reasonable to apply those same incremental margins to that improvement in sales and volume?"

I look forward to Jim further enhancing our business strategies and results in his new role. 
We had a very strong first quarter and delivered record sales of $2.6 billion, an increase of 9% as reported, with adjusted operating earning and EPS of $305 million and $3.54. The business was stronger than we had anticipated with residential markets outperforming around the globe. Our free cash flow for the fourth quarter was about $248 million, after capital investments of $160 million. For the year, we generated record cash flow of more than $1.3 billion. 
In the first half of last year, our industry was under enormous stress as the pandemic spread. And we responded to the disruption by minimizing costs, lowering inventory levels, initiating restructuring actions and reinforcing our liquidity. In the second half, the residential flooring demand recovered significantly faster than expected as people spend more time at home. Meanwhile, commercial flooring demand remains depressed due to business investments being postponed or canceled. Our inventory levels decreased in the second and third periods as sales strengthens and production was limited by capacity, workforce absenteeism and labor shortages. SG&A investments and promotional activities were curtailed during the year to improve our margins. The pandemic created substantial differences between our segments that are varying restrictions, stimulus, consumer responses and our ability to raise production levels. 
Our revenues and operating income rebounded and surpassed the prior year for both the fourth quarter and the second half. Our fourth quarter results exceeded our expectations as we posted our highest ever quarterly sales, even with increasing COVID cases around the world. All of our markets saw strengthening residential purchases with laminate, LVT and sheet vinyl outperforming other flooring categories. Our residential performance was partially offset by a weak commercial market in the regions where we have more significant business in that channel. Our results were improved by higher volumes, restructuring and greater leverage on costs while being adversely affected by lower production runs in inventory, absenteeism and labor shortages in some operations. We are also seeing greater inflationary pressures in many product categories, and we're increasing prices to recover. 
Our Flooring Rest of the World segment continue to outperform with significant sales growth, higher operating leverage and improved productivity. The segment delivered further improvements in LVT production and cost, which enhanced our performance in the period. Our global ceramic and flooring North America segments also improved, although both experienced a greater impact from commercial headwinds. 
Through the fourth quarter, we achieved about $50 million of the projected $100 million to $110 million in anticipated savings from our restructuring initiatives. We continue to assess some projects based on changing market conditions. After paying off our short-term debt and prefunding our longer-term maturities in the second quarter, our net debt leverage is at historical low. Our strong financial position gives us flexibility to pursue additional opportunities, including internal investments, acquisitions and stock purchases. Since the third quarter, we've acquired approximately 1 million shares of our stock for $130 million as part of our share repurchase plan. 
Since the pandemic began, our organization has been protecting one another and supporting our customers around the world. We are mitigating the spread of COVID, utilizing best practices while testing and tracking employees with potential contacts. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

I would like to add that I'm both honored and excited about the opportunity to lead Mohawk's very talented global finance team. 
Now let's review our financial performance for Q4 2020. Sales exceeded $2.6 billion for the quarter, a 9% increase as reported or 5.5% on a constant basis, with our Flooring Rest of the World segment outperforming. Q4 had 2 additional shipping days in most businesses. And as you consider 2021's financial projections, please remember to take into account the following items. Across most of our businesses, Q1 has 3 additional days or approximately 5% more, and Q4 has 4 fewer days or approximately 6% less compared to prior year. This year's sales should continue higher growth, and full year operating margin should improve. Our Q2 comps are very low, and the second half comps are more difficult with the rebound that occurred last year. Also last year, in Q3 and Q4, there was less time off for holidays for our customers and us. Time off should be greater this year. 
Now coming back to the P&L. Gross margin was 27.9% as reported or 28.8% excluding charges, increasing 120 basis points from 27.6% in the prior year. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher volume of $51 million, productivity of $50 million and lower inflation of $21 million, partially offset by price/mix of $30 million. SG&A as reported was 17.2% or 17.3% versus 19.1% in the prior year, both excluding charges. The lower SG&A percent was driven by improved leverage on increased volume and stronger productivity of $21 million. 
Operating income as reported was 10.7%. Restructuring charges for the quarter were $22 million, and our restructuring initiatives are on track with year-to-date savings accounting for approximately $50 million of our announced $100 million to $110 million plan. Operating margin, excluding charges, $305 million or 11.6%, improving from 8.4% last year or 320 basis points. This increase was driven by productivity of $71 million, stronger volume of $42 million and reduced inflation of $12 million, partially offset by the previously noted unfavorable price/mix of $30 million. 
Interest expense of $16 million, including the impact of our new 2020 bond offerings, and we expect Q1 to be approximately $16 million to $16.5 million. Other income of $7 million, driven by favorable transactional FX and short-term investment returns. Our Q4 on a non-GAAP tax rate at 14.8% versus 18.9% in the prior year, benefiting in part from the U.S. CARES Act. We expect Q1 2021 to be approximately 21%. Earnings per share as reported of $3.49 or excluding charges of $3.54, growing 57% year-over-year. 
Now turning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of $920 million, a 7% increase as reported, with the business up 6% on a constant basis with growth across all geographies, the largest increase being in Brazil and Russia. Operating income, excluding charges of $88 million and 9.5% return. That's up 65% or 330 basis points versus prior year. The increase was from productivity of $28 million, volume of $16 million and lower shutdown expense of $4 million, partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of $12 million and unfavorable FX of $4 million. 
Flooring North America, sales of $963 million or 3% increase as reported or flat on a constant basis, led by strength in our residential-focused products, offset by the weakness in the commercial channel. Operating income, excluding charges of $91 million or 9.5%. That's an increase of 27% or 180 basis points compared to prior year. This increase was driven by higher productivity of $26 million, lower inflation of $7 million, an increased volume of $3 million, partially offset by price/mix of $18 million. 
And Flooring Rest of the World with sales of $759 million, a 20% increase as reported or 13% on a constant basis. Driven by our resilient laminate and panels businesses in Europe and our carpet business In Australia and New Zealand. Operating income excluding charges of $138 million or 18.2%, up 420 basis points or 57% versus prior year. The main drivers were the higher volume of $23 million, improved productivity of $16 million and lower inflation of $8 million, partially offset by unfavorable FX of approximately $4 million. Corporate and eliminations came in at $12 million, and you would expect 2021 to be approximately $40 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments increased to over $1.3 billion, driven by the Q4 free cash flow of $248 million, bringing the full year 2020 -- full year cash flow -- free cash flow to approximately $1.3 billion. Receivables were just over $1.7 billion, with DSO improving to 59 days versus the prior year 62 days. Inventories, just over $1.9 billion, dropped almost $400 million or 16% from prior year with a marginal sequential increase of approximately $30 million adjusting for FX from Q3. Inventory days are at 103 days versus 134 days in the prior year. 
Property, plant and equipment, just under $4.6 billion with CapEx of $160 million for the quarter, in line with our D&A. And full year CapEx was $426 million with D&A of just over $600 million. We estimate that 2021 annual CapEx to be in line with our D&A of approximately $590 million. 
And lastly, the balance sheet and cash flow remained very strong with gross debt of just over $2.7 billion. Total cash and short-term investments, as previously noted, over $1.3 billion, leading us to a leverage of 1x adjusted EBITDA. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris, who will provide details on our fourth quarter performance."

Sales for our flooring Rest of World segment increased 20% in the period as reported or 13% on a constant basis, significantly exceeding our forecast. Margins expanded over last year to 17.5% as reported or 18.2%, excluding restructuring charges due to higher volume and positive leverage on SG&A and operations, partially offset by currency headwinds. Sales and margins were strong in most categories and geographies with most of our plants operating near capacity in the fourth quarter. Raw material costs began to rise in many of our product categories, and we are taking pricing actions to respond to the increases. 
Laminate, the segment's largest flooring category, delivered significant growth in the period across most of our markets. Our margins increased as higher volumes drove greater absorption of manufacturing and SG&A costs, while increased productivity and better throughput enhanced our results. We continue to focus on our premium collections that feature superior visuals and waterproof technology. Our service levels showed improvement during the period, though they remain below our standards. To satisfy higher demand for existing products, we chose to postpone introductions of our next-generation laminate collections in most markets. 
Our LVT sales increased substantially in the quarter led by accelerated growth of our rigid collections. Both our LVT margins and profitability improved due to increased volume, lower production cost and SG&A absorption. We have increased staffing to operate all LVT lines 7 days per week. We are introducing new collections with enhanced visuals and exclusive water-type joints that better prevent water damage. We are implementing price increases in our LVT collections to compensate for rising material costs. 
Our sheet vinyl business rebounded as our retailers reopened their shops and their export markets picked up. Our plants ran at high production levels that reduced our operating costs, though unfavorable currency partially offset. All of our European sheet vinyl plants were running near capacity, and we've announced price increases. Our greenfield Russian sheet vinyl plants volume has grown to a level that its margins are in line with our other businesses. 
We have completed the consolidation of our wood operations in Malaysia. During the period, our production was impacted by equipment installation and transportation challenges due to COVID. The equipment from our closed European plant has now been installed, and we are improving our throughput and wood sourcing strategies. 
Our wood panels performed well in the period with sales limited by our capacity and low inventories. Our productivity improved in the quarter, increasing our volume and throughput. Demand for our customized mezzanine floors is growing as greater e-commerce sales have increased the need for warehouse space. To cover rising material costs for our wood panels, we're also implementing price increases. Product mix continues to improve due to a higher share of stylized products due to sales investments to increase project specifications. We are expanding our capacity in melamine products to further improve our margins. 
In insulation, volume was good, though our margins were impacted by significant material inflation due to supply constraints. We have implemented a price increase and have announced another to keep pace with the rising cost. Demand for the category remains strong, enhanced by government incentives for energy savings. 
Sales in Australia and New Zealand were strong in  the fourth quarter, and margins improved with higher volume and lower material costs from our longer supply chain. We enhanced our market position with more aggressive sales initiatives and by providing more consistent service under difficult circumstances. We have leveraged our relationship with carpet retailers to expand sales of our hard surface products. Our results are benefiting from upgrades to our carpet and hard surface offering, manufacturing assets and distribution capabilities that we've implemented since we acquired Godfrey Hirst. 
For the quarter, our Global Ceramic segment sales rose 7% as reported with improved results across the world led by growth in the residential channel from heightened remodeling and home sales. Operating margins for this segment expanded to 8.7% as reported or 9.5% excluding restructuring costs due to higher volume and improved productivity, somewhat reduced by commercial product mix and currency. 
Our Brazilian and Mexican businesses delivered record quarterly sales and expanded margins even with inflationary headwinds. Manufacturing constraints and low inventories limited growth in most of our regions. Material, energy and transportation costs are rising, and we are increasing prices in most markets to offset these pressures. 
Our U.S. ceramic business delivered strong residential sales growth, while commercial remained challenged as businesses defer investments. Our service centers are experiencing improved customer traffic due to higher home sales and remodeling activity. The home center channel outperformed with increased demand and inventory replenishments. To provide additional features and benefits, we are expanding our higher-value collections with high gloss polish tiles, antimicrobial treatments and matching floor and wall combinations. 
We have announced price increases across most of our collections to pass through higher transportation costs. Our ceramic plant productivity and cost improved during the period due to higher volumes and continued process improvements. Our restructuring initiatives are progressing, and we should complete our ceramic plant consolidations by the end of the first quarter. 
Our countertop business is increasing substantially with sales of our quartz products growing significantly. Our quartz countertop production, cost and margins continue to improve our results, and we are increasing our mix with higher-value stylized products. 
Our Mexican ceramic business delivered its best quarterly sales and performance even with capacity constraints. Our margins improved with higher productivity, partially reduced by inflation and product mix. Our inventories declined, and our backlog remains high as we ended the period. Our customers have opened 30 exclusive Daltile stores in the country, which will enhance our sales and strengthen our brand. To cover rising inflation, we have announced price increases. 
Brazil also delivered record sales in the period with all channels performing well. Our margins improved due to increased volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation and product mix. Our Brazilian plants are operating at capacity and have been allocating production to customers. Our backlog remains high, and we are increasing price to recover inflation. We're investing to further upgrade our manufacturing assets this year. 
For the quarter, our European ceramic sales and profitability were above last year. Some Southern European economies were more affected by COVID and have remained softer than other regions. Our residential sales were stronger with more competitive pricing and lower commercial sales, negatively impacting our product mix and margins. We are launching differentiated collections to improve our mix with small sizes, large porcelain slabs, outdoor products and enhanced design technology. In the period, our service levels improved with the plants operating at higher rates, though inventories remain low due to higher demand. 
Our Russian ceramic business delivered strong results during the period even with inflation and currency headwinds. Sales rose significantly in all channels led by new residential construction, which benefited from historically low interest rates. To meet higher demand, we ran more production by limiting holiday shutdowns. We are successfully ramping up our new premium sanitary ware manufacturing and will expand it further this year. The sanitary ware complements our ceramic tile collections and will enhance our product offering in our owned and franchised stores. 
For the period, our Flooring North America sales increased 3% as reported, and our adjusted margins expanded 8.6% as reported or 9.5%, excluding restructuring costs. We had strong growth in the residential channel, offset by lower commercial, which improved from its low base in prior periods. Our service levels improved as we increased production in the period, though high demand required allocating some products. Due to higher demand and COVID disruption in our plants, our inventories did not grow as we anticipated. To improve our margin and mix, we're launching many innovative products that address the needs of family spending more time at home. We are taking pricing action in most products due to rising material, labor and transportation costs. We have executed a large part of our restructuring initiatives, which is benefiting our results with some of the savings flowing through inventory in future periods. Some of our operations were inhibited by increased absenteeism and labor shortages due to COVID, and we anticipate the higher production levels will improve our service and our inventory positions. 
Our residential carpet sales grew during the period as comfort and noise reduction have become more important to consumers. The demand for residential carpet is strong, and our sales momentum should be solid. We have taken many actions to improve our productivity, including rationalizing our product offering and reducing our operational complexities. Our restructuring actions have lowered our overhead and improved our cost and yields. Our new carpet collections will provide improved margins while offering superior styling, features and value. 
We're introducing SmartStrand collections with the new patented hypoallergenic backing, making installation faster and recycling easier. We're adding new pattern technologies and expanding our unique continuum polyester collections made from recycled bottles. We've announced price increases due to increasing inflation in materials, labor and transportation. 
Our commercial business has improved from its bottom but remains depressed along with their retail, hospitality, office and aviation sectors. Our commercial hard surface sales are outperforming carpet, and we have improved our online tools to make it easier for designers to select and customize our products. We are managing our cost structures, which have been deleveraged by lower volume, and we have announced price increases across our product offering. 
Our laminate business is growing substantially in all channels as our unique visuals and waterproof technology have become desirable alternatives to both natural wood and LVT. Our plants are running at capacity to meet the exceptional demand, and we're supplementing domestic production with laminate source from our worldwide operations. We have executed numerous process enhancements to increase our laminate and board production. And by the end of the year, a new line should be operational with additional capabilities. We announced a price increase on our laminate collections because of rising cost. 
We have repurposed a plant in Virginia to manufacture a premium wood flooring collection that has been in development for 4 years. Applying our exclusive technologies, we created a truly waterproof wood flooring with dramatically improved scratch, dent and wear resistant for today's active households. We've also updated our other wood collections to align with evolving market trends. 
Sales of both our LVT and sheet vinyl improved substantially during the period, supported by strength in new housing starts and residential remodeling. We have multiple engineers from our European business working in our U.S. operations to implement demonstrated improvements to increase output, reduce material costs and enhance product visuals and performance. We're introducing updated residential and commercial products with our new water technology that will improve our mix and margins. As in other categories, we've announced price increases due to rising material and transportation costs. 
With that, I'll return the call to Jeff."

Our fourth quarter sales and operating performance were much stronger than we anticipated. We ran our plants around the world at high levels during the period, but fell short of the inventory build we anticipated. Our operations are taking actions to optimize throughput and reach our desired service levels. 
Given present trends, the momentum of our residential business should remain strong, while commercial should slowly improve from its trough. We will benefit from structural improvements in our costs and innovative new products that will enhance our mix. Most of the COVID restrictions around the world have not directly impacted the sales or installation of our products. Continued government subsidies and low interest rates should support economic recoveries, new home construction and residential remodeling. We see increasing inflation in most of our product categories and are raising prices in response. Assuming current conditions continue, we anticipate our first quarter adjusted EPS to be between $2.69 and $2.79, excluding restructuring charges. 
The strength of our organization was demonstrated by our management of last year's historic decline in sales and the subsequent spike in demand while protecting our employees and customers. Our strategies and initiatives remain flexible to adapt to changing economic conditions. With improving sales and cash flow and a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities. 
We'll now be glad to take your questions."

Residential remains strong, and commercial continues at depressed levels. As we go through the year, we anticipate the economy strengthening more and housing trends remaining positive. At this point, we see commercial coming off the trough, but we do not expect it to rebound to prior levels this year. Our commercial margins, to remind you, are higher than our residential and has a significant impact on our Flooring North America and Global Ceramic segments. 
Our SG&A spending, we expect to stay in line this year with the sales growth, and full year margins should expand with improved cost and mix. Our production and productivity should be higher with less interruptions, absenteeism improving and increased inventory and cost-saving initiatives. All the businesses that we have, have upside from last year, but it's not unlimited, and we do not have the normal inventory of the cushion to help us as we go through the year. A weaker dollar will also improve our foreign translated results, and the tax rate should go back to normal at around 21%. 
If you look at the first quarter, it's going to be seasonally stronger than historical, and it's going to have 5% more days in it. As we said, we're raising prices 3% to 8%, and sometimes even more given the inflationary pressures that are going on. In the period, we're also still managing absenteeism that's at high rates in some places as well as some supply disruptions in various markets and products. 
As we go into the second quarter, it has low comps, and you guys need to adjust the sales relative to the trend line rather than last year. And then last year, as we look at the third and fourth quarters, it rebounded significantly, which is making our comps more difficult in the second half. As COVID gets under control, we'll have to see how spending on remodeling of homes changes, if at all. We and our customers, during those second half periods of third and fourth quarter, reduced the holiday time off. That positively impacted revenues as well as margins for both periods. We anticipate more normal conditions in the second half of this year. Then we get to the fourth quarter, again, it has the 6% fewer days this year than last year. So that's to try to help you with some of the quarterly trends."

And to tell you the truth, we have a big question mark on our piece. We don't know.

So laminate, historically, the laminate market was considered a low end market.

What's happened is that the premium part of the market that we're in, we have made it as an alternative that's seen as a good alternative to both wood and LVT, and so the market is growing. At the same time, the markets expanded into other channels because of it. It's now being used in new construction. It's being accepted as an alternative to wood. It's being used in the retail remodeling business at a much higher level, and it's still doing well and growing in the home center channels. So all the parks are coming together, and the same thing is happening in the European business with our unique position in the marketplace. 
With that, we have a new line coming in that will be operating at the end of this year. We'll add about another $125 million of capacity to the U.S. market.

In the first quarter, we had all-time record sales of almost $2.7 billion, an increase of 17% as reported or 9% on a constant basis with adjusted operating income of $329 million, our highest ever first quarter EPS of $3.49.Our business",587,"Thank you, Jim. In the first quarter, we had all-time record sales of almost $2.7 billion, an increase of 17% as reported or 9% on a constant basis with adjusted operating income of $329 million, our highest ever first quarter EPS of $3.49.
Our business continued to strengthen in the first quarter and did not reflect the industry's normal seasonality. Around the world, consumers are continuing to invest in their homes and new flooring plays a major role in most remodeling projects. We're also starting to see moderate improvement in commercial demand as global economies expand and businesses begin to invest in an anticipation of a return to normal. In most countries, construction is considered an essential business, so our sales have been less impacted by government restrictions. Those specific regions have interrupted our customers' businesses.
Our Flooring Rest of World segment continues to outperform with strong residential sales of our flooring, improved mix from our premium products and less exposure to commercial channels. The segment benefited from lower marketing expenses, product mix and increased days, which resulted in a greater margin in the first quarter.
Our other segments also performed well with strong growth in residential products and expanding operating margins, while their results were impacted by low commercial sales and severe storms in the United States.
Market demand strengthened as the period progressed, and our order backlog remains robust going into the second quarter. Most of our businesses are running at high production rates, though inventories remain lower than we would like. Our production and operating costs were impacted in the period by supply limitations in many of our markets as well as absenteeism, new employee training and severe winter weather in the United States.
Our margins have benefited from stronger consumer demand, our restructuring and productivity actions and leverage our SG&A costs. With increased prices in most product categories and geographies, reflecting inflation in raw materials, labor, energy and transportation.
Global transportation capacity has been limited, increasing our cost and delaying receipt of our imported products. We've seen similar constraints on local shipments and are increasing our freight rates to respond. The investments we made in our U.S. trucking fleet and local delivery systems have enabled us to provide our customers with more consistent service while improving our efficiencies.
Even with COVID surges in some markets, we anticipate continued strengthening of economies around the world. Government actions and monetary policies are stimulating higher economic growth rates and stronger housing markets, and vaccination program should reduce the risk of COVID related disruptions. Recent U.S. stimulus actions as well as proposed infrastructure spending should further expand economic growth and employment level. Though government investments are lower than in the U.S. Other countries are beginning to see their economies expand, which should support ongoing demand in our product categories.
We continue to implement our restructuring plans, which have achieved $75 million of our anticipated $100 million to $110 million in savings. The balance of the savings will be spread over the next 3 quarters as specific projects are completed. In the first quarter, we purchased $123 million of our stock at an average price of $179 for a total of $686 million since we initiated our purchasing program.
Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt less short-term investments of $1.3 billion. Our leverage is now below onetime adjusted EBITDA. Given our higher sales and operating levels, we are reviewing additional investment opportunities to expand our business and capacity.
Jim, will you review the first quarter financials."

Sales in Q1 2021 were $2,669 billion. That's a 17% increase as reported and 9% on a constant basis. All segments showed positive volume growth with Flooring Rest of the World being the strongest.

All segments showed positive volume growth with Flooring Rest of the World being the strongest. As a reminder, Q1 had 3 additional shipping days and Q4 will have 4 fewer days. Gross margin was 29.7% as reported or 30.1% excluding charges, increasing from 27.5% in the prior year.
The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher volume and productivity, greater manufacturing uptime, improved price mix and favorable FX, partially offset by increased inflation. The actual detailed amounts of these items will be included in the MD&A section of our 10-Q, which will be filed later today.
SG&A, as reported, was 17.8% or 17.7% versus 20.3% in the prior year, both excluding charges, as we saw strong leverage on the increased volume and productivity actions, partially offset by inflation in FX. Gives us an operating income, as reported, of 11.9% of sales. Restructuring charges for the quarter were $11 million, and our savings, as Jeff said, are on track as we have recorded approximately $75 million of the plan.
Operating margin excluding charges of 12.3%, improving from 7.2% in the prior year or 510 basis points. Similar to gross margin, the increase was driven by stronger volume productivity actions, improved price/mix and FX, greater manufacturing uptime, partially offset by the increased inflation. Interest expense of $15 million includes the full impact of the 2020 bond offerings. Other income of $2 million, mainly the result of favorable transactional FX.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 22% versus 20% in the prior year, and we expect the full year to be 21.5% to 22.5%. Giving us an earnings per share as reported of $3.36 or excluding charges, $3.49, which is 110% improvement versus prior year.
Now turning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of $930 million, a 10% increase as reported, or approximately 5% on a constant basis with strong geographic growth, especially in Brazil, Mexico and Russia, while the U.S. was unfavorably impacted by the February ice storm. Operating income, excluding charges of 9.6%, that's up 400 basis points versus prior year, and this improvement was from strengthening volume and price/mix increased manufacturing uptime and productivity, partially offset by unfavorable inflation.
In Flooring North America, sales of $969 million or a 14% increase as reported or 9% on a constant basis, driven by strong residential demand with commercial beginning to recover from its trough. Operating income excluding charges of 9.3%, that's an increase of 410 basis points versus prior year. The improvement similar to global ceramic was driven by increased volume and productivity, less temporary shutdowns, partially offset by higher inflation.
And finally, Flooring Rest of the World with sales of $770 million. That's an increase of 31% as reported or 15% on a constant basis as our focus on the residential channel drove improvement across product -- all our product groups led by laminate, LVT and soft surface business in Australia and New Zealand. The operating margin excluding charges of 20.9%, an increase of 740 basis points versus prior year, driven by the higher volume, favorable impact of price/mix and productivity, partially offset by the increase in inflation. Corporate and eliminations came in at $11 million, and I expect for the full year 2021 to be approximately $40 million to $45 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments are approximately $1.3 billion, with free cash flow in the quarter of $145 million. Receivables at just over $1.8 billion, giving us a DSO improvement to 54.4 days versus 57 days in the prior year. Inventories were just shy of $2 billion. That's a decrease of approximately $200 million or 9% from the prior year, with the marginal sequential increase of 4% from Q4 or approximately $80 million. Inventory days remained historically low at 105.5 days versus almost 130 in the prior year.
Property plant equipment just over $4.4 billion with CapEx for the quarter of $115 million versus D&A of $151 million. Full year CapEx is currently estimated at $620 million with us reevaluating our plan, and we will most likely see an increase from that level. Full year D&A is projected to be $583 million.
And lastly, the overall balance sheet and cash flow remained very strong with gross debt of $2.7 billion. As I said, total cash and short-term investments of over $1.3 billion, giving us a leverage of 0.9x adjusted EBITDA.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Chris for an operational overview of our first quarter. Chris?"

First quarter sales of our Flooring Rest of World segment increased 31% as reported or 15% on a constant basis, exceeding our expectations. Sales across all our product categories and geographies were strong as housing and residential renovation continued at a brisk pace. Margins expanded over last year to approximately 21% due to higher volume, favorable price and mix and positive leverage on SG&A, partially offset by inflation.
During the period, most of our facilities ran at high levels, though some supply constraints limited our utilization. At this point, we anticipate some material shortages continuing into the second quarter. Our backlog has increased as customer inventories remain low. We have raised prices across all product categories and have announced additional increases where material inflation has continued to expand.
Our laminate business, the segment's largest product category continues to record significant growth as consumers embrace our more realistic visuals and superior performance. Our leadership in premium laminate products and our higher volumes drove improved margins during the period. Our unique manufacturing methods create proprietary products that cannot be duplicated.
Our next-generation laminate technology provides premium wood consumers with features that exceed traditional wood in beauty and durability. In the second quarter, we are installing additional manufacturing assets to support future growth.
During the period, our LVT sales rose substantially with significant growth in rigid LVT. Our margins expanded from enhanced formulations and operational improvements that increased our production speeds. In the period, our sales were restricted by material supply disruptions that caused unscheduled shutdowns. We anticipate continued improvement in our operations as the material supply normalizes and production increases to expand our new rigid LVT collections.
Our sheet vinyl sales were limited in the period by COVID lockdowns of our retailers in Europe. We anticipate sheet vinyl sales improving as government restrictions are lifted and our customers reopen their shops. Our Russian sheet vinyl business continues to expand rapidly as we broaden our customer base and product offering. We have initiated a third shift at the plant to support higher sales volumes.
Our insulation business continues to grow as our panels provide the best option for energy conservation. Sales growth was robust in most of our geographies, though COVID restrictions in Ireland impacted our plant operations and results. Chemical supply problems have limited our production and dramatically increased our costs. We have announced our third price increase to offset the continued inflation and chemical shortages are expected to last through the second quarter.
Our wood panels business delivered improved performance with our plant running full and operating margins expanding. As market demand for panels grows, we are allocating our production. We improved our mix during the period with increased sales of our higher-value decorative products and mezzanine floors. We're installing a new melamine press to expand production of our higher-value products and increased efficiencies. Our new plant that uses waste to create energy for the facilities is operating well and benefiting our results.
Sales in both Australia and New Zealand increased significantly and margins expanded due to higher volume, improved productivity and favorable price mix, partially offset by inflation. Sales grew in soft and hard surfaces with a strong residential performance driven by high levels of remodeling and a solid housing market. Our updated carpet collections and SmartStrand and Wolf have enhanced our sales and mix. We increased our sales by leveraging our comprehensive soft and hard service collections, strong sales organization, and industry-leading service. The commercial performance was stronger, primarily driven by projects that were postponed.
For the period, our Flooring North America sales increased 14% as reported or 9% on a constant basis. Adjusted margins expanded to 9% due to higher volume, productivity gains and mix improvements, partially offset by inflation. Our performance was seasonally stronger than historical first quarters with consumers increasing investments in residential remodeling and new construction. Our commercial business continued to improve sequentially from its trough with growing investments in new projects. Our order rates remain strong and our backlog is higher than normal. We have increased prices as a material and transportation costs have escalated and we'll adjust further as required. All of our operations are maximizing their output to support higher sales and improve our service.
In the period, we managed through interference from labor shortages and supply constraints, which impacted our production levels. Our inventories and service levels have also been impacted by delayed shipment of our imported products due to bottlenecks in ocean freight. We are continuing to execute our restructuring initiatives, which will provide ongoing benefit to our results as they are completed this year.
Our residential carpet sales improved as consumers desire more comfortable, quieter spaces in their homes. Retail remodeling was our strongest channel, improving our mix through increased sales of our premium products. We are expanding our proprietary SmartStrand franchise with new collections that offer superior design and performance. We have significantly reduced operational complexity by simplifying our yarn and product strategies and reducing low-volume SKUs. So that our workforce to meet higher market demand, we have implemented extensive training processes and are relocating assets to increase production where necessary.
Our commercial sales are recovering as business remodeling increases along with the economic improvement. We are also seeing increasing volume of higher-value products as larger specified projects are commencing. The April Architectural Billing Index reflects the highest level of project inquiries since 2019. We have increased carpet tile production in anticipation of the commercial markets improving.
In our commercial LVT business, we are managing supply limitations and import delays. Our laminate sales are setting records as the appeal of our realistic visuals and waterproof performance expands across all channels. Through numerous process improvements, we have significantly increased our domestic production and are supplementing it with imports from our global operations. We are installing additional production at the end of this year to further expand our sales.
Our new line will also produce the next generation of Redwood, which is already being well accepted by European consumers. We have completed upgrades and streamlined our MDF board facility to enhance our volume and cost. We are ramping up production of our premium ultra wood, the first waterproof natural wood flooring that also features industry-leading scratch, dent and fade resistance. Ultra wood is being well received as a superior alternative to traditional engineered wood flooring.
Our LVT and sheet vinyl sales continue to increase in the new construction and residential retail channels. We are upgrading our LVT offering with enhanced visuals unique water type joints and improved stain and scratch resistance. Our local manufacturing has continued its improvement and production output increased as we implemented processes similar to those proven to work in our European operations. Our service has been impacted by material supply disruptions in the U.S. and delays in shipments of sourced products. We anticipate our supply will increase and we will see further improvements in our domestic offering and production output.
In the quarter, our Global Ceramic sales rose 10% as reported and 5% on a constant basis, with sales increases in each of our markets, driven by growth in residential remodeling and new construction. The segment's adjusted margin expanded to approximately 10% due to volume, price, mix and productivity gains, partially offset by inflation. Our Russian, Brazilian and Mexican ceramic businesses delivered strong results though they were limited by their capacities and are allocating production as necessary. All of our businesses are facing rising material, energy and transportation costs, and we have taken pricing actions to offset.
Our U.S. ceramic residential sales grew from remodeling and new construction and commercial sales are improving from their low levels. Our strongest growth was in new residential construction, and we are seeing activity strengthen with contractors at our service centers.
We are introducing higher-value products, including polished, mosaic, decorative wall and antimicrobial collections to improve our mix. We are focusing on the fastest-growing channels and implementing advanced technologies to make doing business with us faster, easier and more profitable for our customers. Across the business, our plants are running at higher levels, and we have increased our productivity with our restructuring actions. Escalating freight costs have hurt our margins, and we are raising prices to offset. Our quartz plant is improving its productivity, and we are introducing more sophisticated bank collections, which are increasing our mix and should enhance our margins.
In the period, the ice storm that hit the Southwest temporarily stopped production at most of our manufacturing facilities by interrupting our electricity and natural gas supply. The facilities have all recovered and are operating as expected, improving our service.
Our European ceramic business delivered a strong performance in the quarter, risk productivity, improving mix and greater consumer demand. Sales grew substantially in Southern Europe and in our export markets, led by a robust residential business and with some improvement in commercial projects. Our operations are running at high rates to satisfy the greater demand and improve service, leveraging our cost and enhancing our results. We are increasing our production levels through improvements in our processes and equipment as well as optimizing product flows to support growth and enhance our mix.
Our ceramic businesses in Mexico, Brazil and Russia are all benefiting from lower interest rates and expanded credit, which are driving greater home remodeling and housing sales. In all 3 businesses, our order backlog is high, and we are allocating production as necessary. We have streamlined our product offering and enhanced our planning strategies to optimize service. Our inventory levels are low, and we are maximizing our output by enhancing our manufacturing and scheduling processes.
In Brazil and Mexico, we are increasing capacity this year to improve our sales and mix. In Russia, we are optimizing our tile production and ramping up our new premium sanitary ware plant to meet growing demand. Sanitary Ware complements our floor and wall tile offering and allows our owned and franchised stores to provide a more complete solution to satisfy our customer needs. Given higher market demand and our increased sales, we are reviewing the expansion of our ceramic capacities.
With that, I'll return the call to Jeff."

As we progress through the year, we anticipate that historically low interest rates, government actions and fewer pandemic restrictions should improve our markets around the world, which we see the present robust residential trends continuing with commercial sales slowly improving in the second period. Across the enterprise, we will increase product introduction to provide additional features to strengthen our offering and margins. We're enhancing our manufacturing operations to increase our volume and efficiencies while executing our ongoing cost savings programs.
Our suppliers indicate that material availability should improve from the first quarter though some operations could still face supply constraints. We are managing challenging labor markets in some of our U.S. communities and supplemental federal unemployment programs could interfere with staffing to maximize those operations. If raw materials, energy and transportation costs continue to rise, further price increases could be required around the world. Given these factors, we anticipate our second quarter adjusted EPS to be $3.57 to $3.67, excluding any restructuring charges.
Currently, our strong backorder -- backlog reflects the escalated levels of residential demand across the globe. We're introducing new product innovations to enhance our offering and optimizing our production to improve our service.

As you look into the second half, the third quarter, we think residential sales will continue to remain good. We think commercial demand will improve. Our production rates should be able to increase. Those sales in some areas could be constrained by capacity or supply that we talked about a few minutes ago.
Last year, just to remind you, that market strengthened as it went in, it will make the comps higher in the third quarter. Also remember, in Europe, people take summer vacations in the third period, and it impacts both our resident -- both our Rest of World and ceramic segments, sales and margins as historical. Sales could also be impacted by changing consumer behavior or other government actions with COVID.
As you go into the fourth quarter, remember, we have 6 fewer days than last year, And we do expect more normal seasonality this year and production levels that occurred last year. For the full year, if you look at it, we expect strong improvement in sales and income. We see SG&A being leveraged and operational improvements also helping our margins. With the higher growth, we are evaluating -- raising the capital investments for both this year and next, and we're in the process of thinking it through.

In terms of the channel inventory, we do believe the inventory remains low with most of our customers, and this should actually help the near-term demand. In addition, we are working, obviously, to try to improve and increase our service as we go through the quarter as well. I spoke to several of our large customers this week, and their businesses is as strong as some have been in business for 40 years. It's as strong as I've ever seen it as it. The customers, some of them are being limited by their ability to install at most of them.
So in addition, so we haven't been able to fill the channel like they would like. And our service, instead of being immediate, in some cases, it's taking a little while to get there. It's not impacting them that much because they couldn't install it if we could ship it all the more. So I think the point is that the backlogs are good, the demand is good.

Some of the things from the first time we put in new machinery that hadn't been run by anybody was a learning curve. We went into new markets in products like countertops we never made before. We went into new geographies. We put up plants in Russia in a new product category, we had no more no customers. So it took us longer to get them. But I mean we put in port -- ceramic countertops in Europe. It's in our plan to expand it. Our Russian vinyl plant, we just put a third shift on, just making as much money as anything else that we have in the business.
So when we got them all together, it just took us longer. LVT, were in the last steps of it to get it up where we want to. So when you greenfield do stuff outside the normal, it's going to take longer. We haven't put the plans together. So far, the plans are all around how to expand existing businesses in existing geographies with an existing equipment that's operating. So we don't anticipate having the same things to overcome.

It affects anything that's the chemical from glues in 1 business to resins in another. And the indications are that it's getting better. What the hard part is, all the customers like us are ordering more so the capacities are constrained even though they're getting better. And it's difficult to tell whether you're going to get what percent of what you're going to get, when you're going to get is it? And we're just playing as that it goes and begin for everyone we can get. 
We appreciate you being on the call. The markets are strong. We're improving our performance of our businesses. We're well positioned in the business, and we're managing all the disruptions as best as possible. And we think we're going to have a good year, but we have to manage through all these things, which makes a little more unpredictable because of the supply base and all the things we've been talking about. We appreciate you joining us, and Have a good day."

In the first quarter, we had all-time record sales of almost $2.7 billion, an increase of 17% as reported or 9% on a constant basis with adjusted operating income of $329 million, our highest ever first quarter EPS of $3.49. Our business",587,"Thank you, Jim. In the first quarter, we had all-time record sales of almost $2.7 billion, an increase of 17% as reported or 9% on a constant basis with adjusted operating income of $329 million, our highest ever first quarter EPS of $3.49. 
Our business continued to strengthen in the first quarter and did not reflect the industry's normal seasonality. Around the world, consumers are continuing to invest in their homes and new flooring plays a major role in most remodeling projects. We're also starting to see moderate improvement in commercial demand as global economies expand and businesses begin to invest in an anticipation of a return to normal. In most countries, construction is considered an essential business, so our sales have been less impacted by government restrictions. Those specific regions have interrupted our customers' businesses. 
Our Flooring Rest of the World segment continues to outperform with strong residential sales of our flooring, improved mix from our premium products and less exposure to commercial channels. The segment benefited from lower marketing expenses, product mix and increased days, which resulted in a greater margin in the first quarter. 
Our other segments also performed well with strong growth in residential products and expanding operating margins, while their results were impacted by low commercial sales and severe storms in the United States. 
Market demand strengthened as the period progressed, and our order backlog remains robust going into the second quarter. Most of our businesses are running at high production rates, though inventories remain lower than we would like. Our production and operating costs were impacted in the period by supply limitations in many of our markets as well as absenteeism, new employee training and severe winter weather in the United States. 
Our margins have benefited from stronger consumer demand, our restructuring and productivity actions and leverage our SG&A costs, with increased prices in most product categories and geographies, reflecting inflation in raw materials, labor, energy and transportation. 
Global transportation capacity has been limited, increasing our cost and delaying receipt of our imported products. We've seen similar constraints on local shipments and are increasing our freight rates to respond. The investments we made in our U.S. trucking fleet and local delivery systems have enabled us to provide our customers with more consistent service while improving our efficiencies. 
Even with COVID surges in some markets, we anticipate continued strengthening of economies around the world. Government actions and monetary policies are stimulating higher economic growth rates and stronger housing markets, and vaccination program should reduce the risk of COVID-related disruptions. Recent U.S. stimulus actions as well as proposed infrastructure spending should further expand economic growth and employment level. 
Though government investments are lower than in the U.S., other countries are beginning to see their economies expand, which should support ongoing demand in our product categories. 
We continue to implement our restructuring plans, which have achieved $75 million of our anticipated $100 million to $110 million in savings. The balance of the savings will be spread over the next 3 quarters as specific projects are completed. In the first quarter, we purchased $123 million of our stock at an average price of $179 for a total of $686 million since we initiated our purchasing program. Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt less short-term investments of $1.3 billion. Our leverage is now below onetime adjusted EBITDA. Given our higher sales and operating levels, we are reviewing additional investment opportunities to expand our business and capacity. 
Jim, will you review the first quarter financials?"

Sales in Q1 2021 were $2,669,000. That's a 17% increase as reported and 9% on a constant basis. All segments showed positive volume growth with Flooring Rest of the World being the strongest.

All segments showed positive volume growth with Flooring Rest of the World being the strongest. As a reminder, Q1 had 3 additional shipping days and Q4 will have 4 fewer days. Gross margin was 29.7% as reported or 30.1% excluding charges, increasing from 27.5% in the prior year. 
The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by higher volume and productivity, greater manufacturing uptime, improved price mix and favorable FX, partially offset by increased inflation. The actual detailed amounts of these items will be included in the MD&A section of our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. 
SG&A, as reported, was 17.8% or 17.7% versus 20.3% in the prior year, both excluding charges, as we saw strong leverage on the increased volume and productivity actions, partially offset by inflation in FX, gives us an operating income, as reported, of 11.9% of sales. Restructuring charges for the quarter were $11 million, and our savings, as Jeff said, are on track as we have recorded approximately $75 million of the plan. 
Operating margin excluding charges was 12.3%, improving from 7.2% in the prior year or 510 basis points. Similar to gross margin, the increase was driven by stronger volume productivity actions, improved price/mix and FX, greater manufacturing uptime, partially offset by the increased inflation. Interest expense of $15 million includes the full impact of the 2020 bond offerings. Other income of $2 million, mainly the result of favorable transactional FX. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 22% versus 20% in the prior year, and we expect the full year to be 21.5% to 22.5%. Giving us an earnings per share as reported of $3.36, or excluding charges, $3.49, which is 110% improvement versus prior year. 
Now turning to the segments. Global Ceramic had sales of $930 million, a 10% increase as reported, or approximately 5% on a constant basis with strong geographic growth, especially in Brazil, Mexico and Russia, while the U.S. was unfavorably impacted by the February ice storm. Operating income, excluding charges of 9.6%, that's up 400 basis points versus prior year, and this improvement was from strengthening volume and price/mix, increased manufacturing uptime and productivity, partially offset by unfavorable inflation. 
In Flooring North America, sales of $969 million or a 14% increase as reported, or 9% on a constant basis, driven by strong residential demand with commercial beginning to recover from its trough. Operating income excluding charges of 9.3%, that's an increase of 410 basis points versus prior year. The improvement, similar to Global Ceramic, was driven by increased volume and productivity, less temporary shutdowns, partially offset by higher inflation. 
And finally, Flooring Rest of the World with sales of $770 million. That's an increase of 31% as reported or 15% on a constant basis as our focus on the residential channel drove improvement across product -- all our product groups led by laminate, LVT and soft surface business in Australia and New Zealand. The operating margin excluding charges of 20.9%, an increase of 740 basis points versus prior year, driven by the higher volume, favorable impact of price/mix and productivity, partially offset by the increase in inflation. Corporate and eliminations came in at $11 million, and I expect for the full year 2021 to be approximately $40 million to $45 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments are approximately $1.3 billion, with free cash flow in the quarter of $145 million. Receivables at just over $1.8 billion, giving us a DSO improvement to 54.4 days versus 57 days in the prior year. Inventories were just shy of $2 billion. That's a decrease of approximately $200 million or 9% from the prior year, with the marginal sequential increase of 4% from Q4 or approximately $80 million. Inventory days remained historically low at 105.5 days versus almost 130 in the prior year. 
Property plant equipment just over $4.4 billion with CapEx for the quarter of $115 million versus D&A of $151 million. Full year CapEx is currently estimated at $620 million with us reevaluating our plan, and we will most likely see an increase from that level. Full year D&A is projected to be $583 million. 
And lastly, the overall balance sheet and cash flow remained very strong with gross debt of $2.7 billion. As I said, total cash and short-term investments of over $1.3 billion, giving us a leverage of 0.9x adjusted EBITDA. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Chris for an operational overview of our first quarter. Chris?"

First quarter sales of our Flooring Rest of World segment increased 31% as reported or 15% on a constant basis, exceeding our expectations. Sales across all our product categories and geographies were strong as housing and residential renovation continued at a brisk pace. Margins expanded over last year to approximately 21% due to higher volume, favorable price and mix and positive leverage on SG&A, partially offset by inflation. 
During the period, most of our facilities ran at high levels, though some supply constraints limited our utilization. At this point, we anticipate some material shortages continuing into the second quarter. Our backlog has increased as customer inventories remain low. We have raised prices across all product categories and have announced additional increases where material inflation has continued to expand. 
Our laminate business, the segment's largest product category, continues to record significant growth as consumers embrace our more realistic visuals and superior performance. Our leadership in premium laminate products and our higher volumes drove improved margins during the period. Our unique manufacturing methods create proprietary products that cannot be duplicated. Our next-generation laminate technology provides premium wood consumers with features that exceed traditional wood in beauty and durability. In the second quarter, we are installing additional manufacturing assets to support future growth. 
During the period, our LVT sales rose substantially with significant growth in rigid LVT. Our margins expanded from enhanced formulations and operational improvements that increased our production speeds. In the period, our sales were restricted by material supply disruptions that caused unscheduled shutdowns. We anticipate continued improvement in our operations as the material supply normalizes and production increases to expand our new rigid LVT collections. 
Our sheet vinyl sales were limited in the period by COVID lockdowns of our retailers in Europe. We anticipate sheet vinyl sales improving as government restrictions are lifted and our customers reopen their shops. Our Russian sheet vinyl business continues to expand rapidly as we broaden our customer base and product offering. We have initiated a third shift at the plant to support higher sales volumes. 
Our insulation business continues to grow as our panels provide the best option for energy conservation. Sales growth was robust in most of our geographies, though COVID restrictions in Ireland impacted our plant operations and results. Chemical supply problems have limited our production and dramatically increased our costs. We have announced our third price increase to offset the continued inflation, and chemical shortages are expected to last through the second quarter. 
Our wood panels business delivered improved performance with our plant running full and operating margins expanding. As market demand for panels grows, we are allocating our production. We improved our mix during the period with increased sales of our higher-value decorative products and mezzanine floors. We're installing a new melamine press to expand production of our higher-value products and increased efficiencies. Our new plant that uses waste to create energy for the facilities is operating well and benefiting our results. 
Sales in both Australia and New Zealand increased significantly and margins expanded due to higher volume, improved productivity and favorable price mix, partially offset by inflation. Sales grew in soft and hard surfaces with a strong residential performance driven by high levels of remodeling and a solid housing market. Our updated carpet collections in SmartStrand and wool have enhanced our sales and mix. We increased our sales by leveraging our comprehensive soft and hard service collections, strong sales organization, and industry-leading service. The commercial performance was stronger, primarily driven by projects that were postponed. 
For the period, our Flooring North America sales increased 14% as reported or 9% on a constant basis. Adjusted margins expanded to 9% due to higher volume, productivity gains and mix improvements, partially offset by inflation. Our performance was seasonally stronger than historical first quarters with consumers increasing investments in residential remodeling and new construction. Our commercial business continued to improve sequentially from its trough with growing investments in new projects. Our order rates remain strong and our backlog is higher than normal. We have increased prices as our material and transportation costs have escalated, and we'll adjust further as required. All of our operations are maximizing their output to support higher sales and improve our service. 
In the period, we managed through interference from labor shortages and supply constraints, which impacted our production levels. Our inventories and service levels have also been impacted by delayed shipment of our imported products due to bottlenecks in ocean freight. We are continuing to execute our restructuring initiatives, which will provide ongoing benefit to our results as they are completed this year. 
Our residential carpet sales improved as consumers desire more comfortable, quieter spaces in their homes. Retail remodeling was our strongest channel, improving our mix through increased sales of our premium products. We are expanding our proprietary SmartStrand franchise with new collections that offer superior design and performance. We have significantly reduced operational complexity by simplifying our yarn and product strategies and reducing low-volume SKUs. 
To grow our workforce to meet higher market demand, we have implemented extensive training processes and are relocating assets to increase production where necessary. 
Our commercial sales are recovering as business remodeling increases along with the economic improvement. We are also seeing increasing volume of higher-value products as larger specified projects are commencing. The April Architectural Billing Index reflects the highest level of project inquiries since 2019. We have increased carpet tile production in anticipation of the commercial markets improving. 
In our commercial LVT business, we are managing supply limitations and import delays. Our laminate sales are setting records as the appeal of our realistic visuals and waterproof performance expands across all channels. Through numerous process improvements, we have significantly increased our domestic production and are supplementing it with imports from our global operations. We are installing additional production at the end of this year to further expand our sales. Our new line will also produce the next generation of Redwood, which is already being well accepted by European consumers. We have completed upgrades and streamlined our MDF board facility to enhance our volume and cost. We are ramping up production of our premium UltraWood, the first waterproof natural wood flooring that also features industry-leading scratch, dent and fade resistance. UltraWood is being well received as a superior alternative to traditional engineered wood flooring. 
Our LVT and sheet vinyl sales continue to increase in the new construction and residential retail channels. We are upgrading our LVT offering with enhanced visuals unique water-tight joints and improved stain and scratch resistance. Our local manufacturing has continued its improvement, and production output increased as we implemented processes similar to those proven to work in our European operations. Our service has been impacted by material supply disruptions in the U.S. and delays in shipments of sourced products. We anticipate our supply will increase and we will see further improvements in our domestic offering and production output. 
In the quarter, our Global Ceramic sales rose 10% as reported and 5% on a constant basis, with sales increases in each of our markets, driven by growth in residential remodeling and new construction. The segment's adjusted margin expanded to approximately 10% due to volume, price, mix and productivity gains, partially offset by inflation. Our Russian, Brazilian and Mexican ceramic businesses delivered strong results though they were limited by their capacities and are allocating production as necessary. All of our businesses are facing rising material, energy and transportation costs, and we have taken pricing actions to offset. 
Our U.S. ceramic residential sales grew from remodeling and new construction and commercial sales are improving from their low levels. Our strongest growth was in new residential construction, and we are seeing activity strengthen with contractors at our service centers. We are introducing higher-value products, including polished, mosaic, decorative wall and antimicrobial collections to improve our mix. We are focusing on the fastest-growing channels and implementing advanced technologies to make doing business with us faster, easier and more profitable for our customers. Across the business, our plants are running at higher levels, and we have increased our productivity with our restructuring actions. Escalating freight costs have hurt our margins, and we are raising prices to offset. Our quartz plant is improving its productivity, and we are introducing more sophisticated bank collections, which are increasing our mix and should enhance our margins. 
In the period, the ice storm that hit the Southwest temporarily stopped production at most of our manufacturing facilities by interrupting our electricity and natural gas supply. The facilities have all recovered and are operating as expected, improving our service. 
Our European ceramic business delivered a strong performance in the quarter, risk productivity, improving mix and greater consumer demand. Sales grew substantially in Southern Europe and in our export markets, led by a robust residential business and with some improvement in commercial projects. Our operations are running at high rates to satisfy the greater demand and improve service, leveraging our cost and enhancing our results. We are increasing our production levels through improvements in our processes and equipment as well as optimizing product flows to support growth and enhance our mix. 
Our ceramic businesses in Mexico, Brazil and Russia are all benefiting from lower interest rates and expanded credit, which are driving greater home remodeling and housing sales. In all 3 businesses, our order backlog is high, and we are allocating production as necessary. We have streamlined our product offering and enhanced our planning strategies to optimize service. Our inventory levels are low, and we are maximizing our output by enhancing our manufacturing and scheduling processes. In Brazil and Mexico, we are increasing capacity this year to improve our sales and mix. In Russia, we are optimizing our tile production and ramping up our new premium sanitary ware plant to meet growing demand. Sanitary Ware complements our floor and wall tile offering and allows our owned and franchised stores to provide a more complete solution to satisfy our customer needs. Given higher market demand and our increased sales, we are reviewing the expansion of our ceramic capacities. 
With that, I'll return the call to Jeff."

As we progress through the year, we anticipate that historically low interest rates, government actions and fewer pandemic restrictions should improve our markets around the world, which we see the present robust residential trends continuing with commercial sales slowly improving in the second period. Across the enterprise, we will increase product introduction to provide additional features to strengthen our offering and margins. We're enhancing our manufacturing operations to increase our volume and efficiencies while executing our ongoing cost savings programs.
Our suppliers indicate that material availability should improve from the first quarter though some operations could still face supply constraints. We are managing challenging labor markets in some of our U.S. communities and supplemental federal unemployment programs could interfere with staffing to maximize those operations. If raw materials, energy and transportation costs continue to rise, further price increases could be required around the world. Given these factors, we anticipate our second quarter adjusted EPS to be $3.57 to $3.67, excluding any restructuring charges.
Currently, our strong backorder -- backlog reflects the escalated levels of residential demand across the globe. We're introducing new product innovations to enhance our offering and optimizing our production to improve our service.

We've already provided the second quarter guidance in which we believe the present trends will continue into the second quarter. And that second quarter also included the expected supply limitations that are going on. We're raising our prices, and we expect to run all the facilities at high rates. 
As you look into the second half, the third quarter, we think residential sales will continue to remain good. We think commercial demand will improve. Our production rates should continue to increase, though sales in some areas could be constrained by capacity or supply that we talked about a few minutes ago. Last year, just to remind you, market strengthened as it went in, it will make the comps higher in the third quarter. 
Also remember, in Europe, people take summer vacations in the third period, and it impacts both our resident -- both our Rest of the World and Ceramic segments, sales and margins as historical. Sales could also be impacted by changing consumer behavior or other government actions with COVID.
As you go into the fourth quarter, remember, we have 6 fewer days than last year, and we do expect more normal seasonality this year and production levels that occurred last year. For the full year, if you look at it, we expect strong improvement in sales and income. We see SG&A being leveraged, and operational improvements also helping our margins. With the higher growth, we are evaluating -- raising the capital investments for both this year and next, and we're in the process of thinking it through.

What the hard part is, all the customers like us are ordering more, so the capacities are constrained even though they're getting better. And it's difficult to tell whether you're going to get what percent of what you're going to get, when you're going to get is it? And we're just playing as it goes and begging for every one we can get. 
We appreciate you being on the call. The markets are strong. We're improving our performance of our businesses. We're well positioned in the business, and we're managing all the disruptions as best as possible. And we think we're going to have a good year, but we have to manage through all these things, which makes it little more unpredictable because of the supply base and all the things we've been talking about. We appreciate you joining us, and have a good day."

In the second quarter, we generated revenue of approximately $3 billion, the highest quarterly sales of any period in our company's history. Our sales increased significantly over last year when the pandemic interrupted the global economy. Our adjusted EPS of $4.45 was the highest on record for any quarter. 
Our success is the result of the extraordinary efforts of all of our team members across the world. They have shown their dedication and resilience to overcome the challenges that we have faced. We greatly appreciate what they have been able to achieve. 
Our second quarter results were significantly stronger than we had anticipated across all of our businesses with sales building on a momentum from our first period. In the quarter, our operating margin expanded to their highest level in the last 4 years as we leveraged our operational and SG&A expenses. The actions we have taken to simplify our product offering, enhance our productivity and restructure our costs are benefiting our results. We've delivered almost $95 million of the anticipated $100 million to $110 million in savings for our restructuring initiatives. 
Across the enterprise, we continue to respond to rising material, energy and transportation costs by increasing prices and optimizing manufacturing and logistics. During the quarter, most of our manufacturing ran at capacity or we were limited by material supply and labor availability. Raw material constraints and many of our operations led to unplanned production shutdowns during the period. Overall, we successfully managed interruptions that impeded our normal operations as well as regional manufacturing and customer closings related to COVID regulations in local areas. 
Our inventory levels increased slightly in the period, primarily reflecting higher material costs. Rising freight cost and limited shipping capacity impacted our material costs, availability of imported products, local shipments to customers and international exports. Presently, we do not anticipate near-term abatement of these constraints. 
All of our markets continue to show strength, with robust housing sales and remodeling investments across the world. Commercial projects are increasing as the global economy improves and businesses gain confidence to expand and remodel. Inventory levels in most channels remain low, and our sales backlogs are above our historical levels. To improve our sales mix and efficiencies, we will introduce more new products with enhanced features and lower production complexity in the second half of the year. To alleviate manufacturing constraints, we have approved new capital investments of approximately $650 million to increase our production, with most taking 12 to 18 months to fully implement. 
In the second quarter, we purchased $142 million of our stock at an average price of $2.08 for a total amount of approximately $830 million since we initiated the program. With our strong balance sheet and historically low leverage, we're reviewing additional investments to expand our sales and profitability. 
Jim will now cover the second quarter financials."

For the quarter, our sales were $2.954 million, an increase of 44% as reported and 38% on a constant basis.

For the quarter, our sales were $2.954 million, an increase of 44% as reported and 38% on a constant basis. All segments showed significant year-over-year growth versus Q2 of 2020, which was a period we were most impacted by the pandemic shutdowns. Gross margin for the quarter was 30.5% as reported or 30.7%, excluding charges, increasing from 21.4% in the prior year. The increase in gross profit was a result of higher volume and productivity, improved price/mix, reduction of last year's temporary shutdowns due to the pandemic and favorable FX, partially offset by the increasing inflation. 
SG&A, as reported, was 16.9% of sales or 16.8% and versus 19.7% in the prior year, both excluding charges as a result of strong leverage by the business on the sharp increase in volume. The absolute year-over-year dollar increase was primarily due to higher volume, normal operating costs previously curtailed by the pandemic, impact of FX, increased product development costs and inflation. 
Operating margin as reported was 13.7%, with restructuring charges of approximately $7 million. Our restructuring savings are on track as we have recorded approximately $95 million of the planned  $100 million and $110 million of savings. Operating margin excluding charges, 13.9%, improving from 1.7% in the prior year. The increase was driven by the stronger volume, improved price/mix, productivity actions, the reduction of the temporary shutdowns and favorable FX, partially offset by the higher inflation and increased product development costs. 
Interest for the quarter was $15 million. Other income, other expense was $11 million income, primarily a result of a settlement of foreign non-income tax contingency and other miscellaneous items. Income tax rate, as reported, was 16% and 22.5% on a non-GAAP basis versus a credit of 2.5% in the prior year. We expect the full year rate to be between 21.5% and 22.5%. That leads us to a net earnings as reported of $336 million or an earnings per share of $4.82. Earnings per share excluding charges was $4.45 percent -- or $4.45. 
Turning to the segments. The Global Ceramic segment had sales of just over $1 billion, an increase of 38% as reported or 34% on a constant basis, with strong geographic growth across our business led by Mexico, Brazil and Europe. Operating margin, excluding charges, was 13.2%, a significant increase from the low point of 2020 at 0.5%. The earnings improvement was a result of strengthening volume and productivity, favorable price/mix and a reduction of temporary shutdowns, partially offset by increasing inflation. 
Flooring North America had sales of just under $1.1 billion for a 35% increase, driven by a strong residential demand with commercial channel continuing its growth versus prior year, but still below historic levels. The segment experienced solid growth across all product lines, led by residential carpet, LVT and laminate. 
Operating income, excluding charges, was 11.2% and similar to Global Ceramic, a significant increase from the 2020 margin trough. The operating income improvement was also driven by the increase in volume, strengthening productivity, improvement in price/mix, with the reduction in temporary shutdowns, partially offset by higher inflation. 
Lastly, Flooring Rest of the World, with sales of just over $830 million, a 68% improvement as reported or 50% on a constant basis, as continued strength in residential remodeling and new home construction drove improvement across all product groups, led by resilient, handles, laminate and our soft surface business in Australia and New Zealand. 
Operating margin, excluding charges of 19.7%, and similar to our other segments, was a significant increase from prior year's low point of 11.9%. And again, the main drivers were consistent in that they had higher volume, favorable impact from price/mix with the reduction of temporary shutdowns, favorable FX, partially offset by increasing inflation. Corporate eliminations came in at $12 million and expect full year 2021 to be approximately $45 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments are approximately $1.4 billion with free cash flow of $226 million in the quarter. Receivables of just over $2 billion, an improvement in DSO to 53 days versus 64 days in the prior year. Inventories for the quarter were just shy of $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately $160 million or 8% from the prior year or increasing $85 million or 4% compared to Q1 2021. Inventory days remain historically low at 99 days versus 126 in the prior year. 
Property, plant and equipment were just shy of $4.5 billion, and CapEx for the quarter was $113 million with D&A of $148 million. Full year CapEx has been increased to approximately $700 million to strengthen future growth with full year D&A projected to be approximately $580 million. Overall, the balance sheet and cash flow remained very strong, with gross debt of $2.7 billion, total cash and short-term investments of approximately $1.4 billion and a leverage at 0.7x to adjusted EBITDA. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Chris Wellborn to cover our operational review."

For the period, our Flooring Rest of World segment, sales increased 68% as reported and 50% on a constant basis. Operating margins expanded to 19.7% due to higher volume, pricing and mix improvements and reduction of COVID restrictions,",1687,"Thank you, Jim. 
For the period, our Flooring Rest of World segment, sales increased 68% as reported and 50% on a constant basis. Operating margins expanded to 19.7% due to higher volume, pricing and mix improvements and reduction of COVID restrictions, partially offset by inflation. Flooring Rest of World outperformed our other segments with all our major product categories significantly as residential sales expanded in all regions. 
We have implemented multiple price increases in most product categories to cover inflation in materials and freight. Raw material supplies are problematic and have impacted our LVT production in sales the most. We anticipate material and freight challenges will continue to impact our business in the third quarter. 
Sales of our high-end laminate continue to grow dramatically as our proprietary products are being widely accepted as waterproof alternative to LVT and wood. We are beginning to introduce our next-generation of laminate at premium levels with collections featuring handcrafted visuals. We are increasing our production in Europe, with new capacity coming online and further capacity expansion projects are being initiated. Our laminate business in Russia and Brazil are growing strongly as we enhance our offering and expand our distribution. 
We recently completed the acquisition of a laminate distributor in the U.K. that will improve our position in the market. 
Our LVT sales growth was strong during the period and would have been higher if material shortages had not interrupted manufacturing. To compensate for material inflation, we have increased prices and we expect further increases will be required as our costs continue to rise. We are significantly expanding sales of our rigid LVT collections with our patented water-type joints that prevent moisture from penetrating the floor. 
Our manufacturing operations have made substantial progress improving throughputs, material costs and yields. Our production in the third quarter will continue to be limited by material availability. 
Our sheet vinyl sales rebounded strongly as retail stores opened in our primary markets. Our sheet vinyl distribution in Russia has expanded, and we are maximizing production to meet the growing demand. 
Our wood plant in Malaysia has been idle since the government instituted lockdowns to address surging COVID rates. Wood is a small product category for us, so the sales impact in the third quarter will be limited. We are awaiting permits to complete the acquisition of a plant that reduces wood veneers to lower our cost. 
Our Australian and New Zealand Flooring businesses delivered excellent results with sales and margins exceeding our expectations. The residential business was strong, with hard surface products leading the growth. Carpet sales are strengthening with our national consumer advertising, enhanced merchandising and the launch of a new high-end wool and Triexta collections that improved our mix. 
Most of our facilities operated at a high level with increased volumes benefiting our results. As in all of our markets, commercial sales have not recovered to their pre-pandemic levels. Though the Australian government has locked down specific regions to contain the spread of COVID, it has not meaningfully impacted our business. 
Our European insulation sales grew even though chemical shortages limited our production. Our margins are recovering after we implemented price increases to cover rising material costs. We have announced an additional price increase for the third quarter to offset further raw material inflation. 
We anticipate chemical supplies to remain tight and could impact our future sales. To expand our existing insulation business in Ireland and the U.K., we have signed an agreement to acquire an insulation manufacturer, which is pending government approval. 
Our panels business is running at full capacity, and so far, we've been able to manage material shortages without interruptions to our operations. We have raised prices and improved our mix with higher value decorative products. To enhance our results, we are expanding our offering of premium products as well as our project specification team. To enhance our panel offering, we are commissioning a new line that creates unique surfaces and visuals to differentiate our offering in the market. 
For the period, our Flooring North America segment sales increased 35%, and adjusted margins expanded to 11.2% due to higher volume, productivity, pricing and mix improvements and fewer COVID interruptions, partially offset by inflation. Our business trends continued from the first quarter with sales growth being driven by residential remodeling and new construction. 
Commercial sales continued to improve, though the channel remains below pre-pandemic levels. Through the period, our order rate remains strong and our sales backlog remains above historical levels. We are maximizing output at our facilities to support higher sales and improve our service. 
During the quarter, our production levels were hindered by local labor shortages and material supply, particularly in LVT, sheet vinyl and carpet. Ocean freight constraints delayed receipt of our imported products, impacting our sales, inventories and service levels. We implemented price increases as a material and transportation cost 
increased, and we have announced additional pricing actions as inflation continues. Our restructuring initiatives are improving efficiencies as planned, and we should realize additional savings in the third quarter. 
Our residential carpet sales continued their growth trend across all channels with consumers investing in home improvement projects. Sales of our proprietary SmartStrand franchise expanded with our new collections being well accepted. 
Our EverStrand polyester collections are expanding by providing enhanced value, styling and environmental sustainability. Our carpet sales have been limited by personnel shortages in our operations, and we are implementing many actions to increase our staffing and productivity. We have improved our efficiencies by rationalizing low volume SKUs and streamlining our operational strategies. 
Our commercial sales have improved as businesses increase remodeling and new construction projects. Both carpet tile and hard surface products grew with health care, senior living, education and government recovering faster. 
Though down slightly from record levels, the June Architectural Billing Index had a fifth consecutive month of expansion, indicating the continued strengthening of new commercial development and renovation projects. 
With realistic visuals and waterproof performance, our premium laminate collections are growing substantially. To support higher demand, we have implemented many process improvements to maximize our U.S. production and our importing product from our global operations. Our laminate expansion remains on schedule and should be operational by the end of this year. Our new line will produce the next-generation of Revwood which is already being introduced in Europe. To support the growth of our laminate business, our U.S. MDF operation completed investments to increase our volume and lower our cost. 
Our new waterproof UltraWood collections are being launched as a high-performance alternative to typical engineered wood floors. Our LVT and sheet vinyl sales continue to increase, with growth in the residential, retail and new construction channels. Our LVT and sheet vinyl growth and plant productivity were impacted by disruptions in supply that stopped our operations and delays in imported LVT caused by transportation constraints. 
We have enhanced our LVT offering with more realistic visuals, proprietary water type joints and improve stain and scratch resistance. Our U.S. operations implemented process enhancements that have increased our speeds and throughput. When material availability increases, we should see further improvements in our domestic manufacturing, which will support our recent product launches. 
For the period, our Global Ceramic segment sales increased 38% as reported and 34% on a constant basis. Adjusted margins expanded to 13.2% due to higher volume, productivity, pricing and mix, improvements and fewer COVID disruptions, partially offset by inflation. 
Our ceramic businesses around the world have greatly improved with strength in the residential channel and increasing commercial sales. All of them have low inventories, which impacted our sales growth and service levels. We have initiated expansion plans to increase our capacity in mix in Mexico, Brazil, Russia and Europe. Our ceramic businesses continue to raise prices to cover material, energy and transportation inflation. 
Our U.S. Ceramic business is strengthening, and we are implementing price increases to cover material and freight inflation. We are improving our product mix with new shapes, sizes and service structures. We are reengineering our products to improve material cost and productivity. Our restructuring projects have been fully implemented and are growing the expected -- providing the expected benefits. 
Our countertop sales and mix continue to improve as we expand our premium offer with new technologies. In the period, a mechanical failure temporarily reduced production, which has been repaired. We have initiated the expansion of our plant to further grow our countertop business. 
Our Mexican and Brazilian Ceramic businesses are very strong, with our residential business in both regions at historically high levels and commercial still recovering. Due to capacity constraints, our facilities could not fulfill customer demand, so we are allocating our production. We have executed multiple price increases to offset energy and material inflation. We are expanding operations in Mexico this quarter, and we have initiated new investments to increase capacity in Brazil. 
Our European Ceramic business delivered strong sales and profitability as pricing, product mix, and productivity improved our margins. We increased sales of our premium products, including slabs, small sizes, outdoor and antibacterial collections. Commercial sales trends are starting to improve though they remain below historical levels. We are selectively increasing prices to recover material, energy and freight inflation. 
During the period, our operations ran at high levels with improved efficiencies and increased throughputs. We continue to rationalize low volume SKUs to optimize our operations. To support our sales of high-end collections, we have initiated expansion projects, some of which will take through next year to complete. 
Our ceramic sales in Russia were robust across all channels with our direct sales to customers through our own stores and new construction projects outperforming. We have announced price increases to cover rising inflation. During the period, our manufacturing operations ran at capacity to respond to accelerated sales with inventory remaining below historical levels. 
Due to present capacity limitations, we are focusing on optimizing our product mix. We have initiated expansion plans with new production expected in the second half of next year. Sales of our new sanitary ware products are expanding primarily through our owned and franchised retail stores as our manufacturing ramps up. 
With that, I'll return the call to Jeff."

The global economy should continue to improve due to low interest rates, government stimulus and the success of COVID vaccines. Around the world, flooring sales trends remain favorable, with residential remodeling and new construction at high levels and commercial projects strengthening. 
In the third quarter, we expect our strong sale to continue, with our typical seasonal slowing from the second quarter. We will expand the introduction of new products with additional features and increase our investments to enhance our future sales and mix. Material, energy and transportation inflation is expected to continue and will require further pricing actions to offset.
Most of our facilities will operate at high utilization rates, though ongoing material and local labor constraint to limit our production. Our Global Ceramic and Flooring Rest of the World segments will observe the European vacation schedules in the third quarter, which reduces production and increases cost in the period. 
In many countries, future government actions to contain COVID remain a risk and could impact our business. Given these factors, we anticipate our third quarter adjusted EPS to be between $3.71 and $3.81, excluding any restructuring charges. 
We entered this year with uncertainty about COVID, the economic recovery, home renovation and new construction. Our business is stronger than we had anticipated, and we are increasing investments to support additional growth and improve efficiencies. Longer term, housing sales and remodeling are expected to remain at historical high levels. Apartment renovation should accelerate as rent deferment expires, and investments in commercial projects should continue to strengthen. 
We're expanding our operations and introducing new innovations to maximize our results. Our balance sheet is strong, and we're exploring additional internal projects and acquisition opportunities. 
We'll now be glad to take your questions."

We're assuming the business and residential keep going and commercial improvement. Residential -- the European -- the non-U.S. business, especially Europe, always slow with the normal holiday period as we go through. And you might not know but -- the non-U.S. businesses over time have become a larger part of our results, and the holidays have become a bigger impact over many years as we keep expanding outside the U.S. 
So -- and with that, we still have material supply, labor, transportation that all are constraining the business. We don't think the pricing actions we have are enough. Our inflation keeps coming so we expect to keep putting in more increases in prices in it. And then just to try to other things. As you think of the third quarter, what you have is manufacturing costs in the United States are impacted by holiday in the 4th of July, which is in the third quarter rather than second. You have the holidays, which impacts not only the cost of not operating, but the sales also drop off as we go through it.

So we'll have to decide with what we're going to add more or less than we've already done as we go through. 
And again, just all through the original presentation we made, we tried to lay out for you the different pieces and I'll name a few. The ceramic businesses in Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Europe are all being increased. We have the laminate businesses in the United States and Russia -- I mean, in Europe are all being increased. We have the countertop business is being increased in the United States. And there's a number of other ones that are here.

Or is it neutral? Just a little more color on kind of order of magnitude of cost and whether or when you'll be back to price cost-neutral or positive?"

So that's causing it to grow. 
It's also been growing going into different channels. It's being used. If you watch any television shows, the remodeling piece is, they're using laminate and remodeling on new houses today, which they -- by a much higher rate than they have in the past.

And then this year, we have 6% less days and a 6% less days will impact the sales and the margins as we lose the absorption from the lower days in the period is it. Then this year versus last year, and this is a guess because we don't know what's going to happen, we're expecting at this point of more normal seasonality with more increased vacations, people taking, with lower holiday spending on remodeling and reduced utilization of the plants.

The second part is, there is a seasonality, which I'm not sure all of -- everyone understands, our European businesses have now -- European and non-U.S. businesses have become a much larger part of our business. They impact the business more today than they did 5 years ago or before because of the acquisitions and enhancements of the business we've done. 
So when they step down, that whole category steps down, which will reduced the sales level in total from the third quarter and had a negative impact on the sales and margins, and it will be lower because of it as it has been in prior years. And it's not the business changing, as the normal seasonality. 
Now separate from that, last year was also unusual. And what happened last year with COVID, we and our plants and our facilities and our customers, we shut down a lot in the second quarter. And what happened is many of the people, we have the people taking their vacations in the second quarter. So when the business started getting better in the third quarter, we didn't do the normal shutdowns because we used the vacation pays and things in the second quarter. And then the same thing happened, people didn't go on vacations like they did. So the third quarter was unusually high because the whole vacation structure of both our production, our customers, vacations for people was different.

So then you have different parts. So if you go back to some of the investments we've put in over the years, we put a new plant in Russia in sheet vinyl. While that plant is now running 7 days a week, 2 years ago -- we started up a few years ago, we bought the Australia/New Zealand business. We've been putting efforts to change their product line, upgrade their product offering. We -- they were just trying to get in hard surface. We have the hard surface business.

We also bought a few years when we bought IDC a few years ago, it's taken us a few years. They had a laminate business. We've been able to dramatically improve the sales and margins of it over the years, is it? 
The wood panel business that we have is running wide open. The margins are improving. It's at high levels because there's shortages in wood panels. So it's at a high level. Our insulation business, we've put in multiple plants. We've acquired other ones. So we have a strong insulation business, and it's doing well, even though we're chasing really high chemical costs. So we're benefiting from a lot of things."

But relative to historical, it should continue at high levels. The houses that were purchased over the last year, they are all in various stages of remodeling. When you buy a new home, an existing home, you typically don't remodel the whole thing. It goes in stages. So that will take a while to play out going forward. 
You have -- you have some things with policies with the government. People who haven't been paying their mortgages. At some point, some of those houses are going to turn over, and that's going to increase the remodeling sales somewhat. You have people in the rentals that haven't been paying rents. At some point, some of those are going to change over, and they're going to have to remodel them for the next people. 
You have the commercial parts of the business, companies are getting more confident or not, and they're starting to invest more. It takes time to put it in the budgets, takes time to start them. There's a void for a while on new construction that got stopped. So there's going to be a void to it comes back and there's a lot of upside in it, and it's a more profitable business because the products are more unique and differentiated. 
So all the trends look good as far as we can see them. On the other side, in the short term, we don't know if we have enough materials to run the place tomorrow in some cases. And so we wake up and the materials are supposed to come in and something happens when we just shut the plant down. We have -- you come in and we have -- people just aren't showing up for work, like they normally do. As the people we're hiring, it's more difficult to train and it takes longer and there's more turnover.

In the second quarter, we generated revenue of approximately $3 billion, the highest quarterly sales of any period in our company's history. Our sales increased significantly over last year when the pandemic interrupted the global economy. Our adjusted EPS of $4.45 was the highest on record for any quarter. Our success is the result of the extraordinary efforts of all of our team members across the world. They have shown their dedication and resilience to overcome the challenges that we have faced. We greatly appreciate what they have been able to achieve.
Our second quarter results were significantly stronger than we had anticipated across all of our businesses with sales building on a momentum from our first period. In the quarter, our operating margin expanded to their highest level in the last 4 years as we leveraged our operational and SG&A expenses. The actions we have taken to simplify our product offering, enhance our productivity and restructure our costs are benefiting our results. We've delivered almost $95 million of the anticipated $100 million to $110 million in savings for our restructuring initiatives.
Across the enterprise, we continue to respond to rising material, energy and transportation costs by increasing prices and optimizing manufacturing and logistics. During the quarter, most of our manufacturing ran at capacity or we were limited by material supply and labor availability. Raw material constraints and many of our operations led to unplanned production shutdowns during the period. Overall, we've successfully managed interruptions that impeded our normal operations as well as regional manufacturing and customer closings related to COVID regulations in local areas.
Our inventory levels increased slightly in the period, primarily reflecting higher material costs. Rising freight cost and limited shipping capacity impacted our material costs, availability of imported products, local shipments to customers and international exports. Presently, we do not anticipate near-term abatement of these constraints.  
All of our markets continue to show strength, with robust housing sales and remodeling investments across the world. Commercial projects are increasing as the global economy improves and businesses gain confidence to expand and remodel. Inventory levels in most channels remain low, and our sales backlogs are above our historical levels. To improve our sales mix and efficiencies, we will introduce more new products with enhanced features and lower production complexity in the second half of the year. To alleviate manufacturing constraints, we have approved new capital investments of approximately $650 million to increase our production, with most taking 12 to 18 months to fully implement.
In the second quarter, we purchased $142 million of our stock at an average price of $2.08 (sic) [ $208 ] for a total amount of approximately $830 million since we initiated the program. With our strong balance sheet and historically low leverage, we're reviewing additional investments to expand our sales and profitability.  
Jim will now cover the second quarter financials."

For the quarter, our sales were $2.954 million, an increase of 44% as reported and 38% on a constant basis. All segments showed significant year-over-year growth versus Q2 of 2020, which was a period we were most impacted by the pandemic",825,"Thank you, Jeff. For the quarter, our sales were $2.954 million, an increase of 44% as reported and 38% on a constant basis. All segments showed significant year-over-year growth versus Q2 of 2020, which was a period we were most impacted by the pandemic shutdowns. Gross margin for the quarter was 30.5% as reported or 30.7%, excluding charges, increasing from 21.4% in the prior year. The increase in gross profit was a result of higher volume and productivity, improved price/mix, reduction of last year's temporary shutdowns due to the pandemic and favorable FX, partially offset by the increasing inflation.
SG&A, as reported, was 16.9% of sales or 16.8% versus 19.7% in the prior year, both excluding charges as a result of strong leverage by the business on the sharp increase in volume. The absolute year-over-year dollar increase was primarily due to higher volume, normal operating costs previously curtailed by the pandemic, impact of FX, increased product development costs and inflation.
Operating margin as reported was 13.7%, with restructuring charges of approximately $7 million. Our restructuring savings are on track as we have recorded approximately $95 million of the planned  $100 million and $110 million of savings. Operating margin excluding charges, 13.9%, improving from 1.7% in the prior year. The increase was driven by the stronger volume, improved price/mix, productivity actions, the reduction of the temporary shutdowns and favorable FX, partially offset by the higher inflation and increased product development costs.  
Interest for the quarter was $15 million. Other income, other expense was $11 million income, primarily a result of a settlement of foreign non-income tax contingency and other miscellaneous items. Income tax rate, as reported, was 16% and 22.5% on a non-GAAP basis versus a credit of 2.5% in the prior year. We expect the full year rate to be between 21.5% and 22.5%. That leads us to a net earnings as reported of $336 million or an earnings per share of $4.82. Earnings per share excluding charges was $4.45 percent -- or $4.45, excuse me.  
Turning to the segments. The Global Ceramic segment had sales of just over $1 billion, an increase of 38% as reported or 34% on a constant basis, with strong geographic growth across our business led by Mexico, Brazil and Europe. Operating margin, excluding charges was 13.2%, a significant increase from the low point of 2020 at 0.5%. The earnings improvement was a result of strengthening volume and productivity, favorable price/mix and a reduction of temporary shutdowns, partially offset by increasing inflation.
Flooring North America had sales of just under $1.1 billion for a 35% increase, driven by a strong residential demand with commercial channel continuing its growth versus prior year, but still below historic levels. The segment experienced solid growth across all product lines, led by residential carpet, LVT and laminate. Operating income, excluding charges, was 11.2% and similar to Global Ceramic, a significant increase from the 2020 margin trough. The operating income improvement was also driven by the increase in volume, strengthening productivity, improvement in price/mix, with a reduction in temporary shutdowns, partially offset by higher inflation.
Lastly, Flooring Rest of the World with sales of just over $830 million, a 68% improvement as reported or 50% on a constant basis, as continued strength in residential remodeling and new home construction drove improvement across all product groups, led by resilient, panels, laminate and our soft surface business in Australia and New Zealand. Operating margin, excluding charges of 19.7%, and similar to our other segments, was a significant increase from prior year's low point of 11.9%. And again, the main drivers were consistent in that they had higher volume, favorable impact from price/mix with a reduction of temporary shutdowns, favorable FX, partially offset by increasing inflation.
Corporate and eliminations came in at $12 million and expect full year 2021 to be approximately $45 million.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments are approximately $1.4 billion with free cash flow of $226 million in the quarter. Receivables of just over $2 billion, an improvement in DSO to 53 days versus 64 days in the prior year. Inventories for the quarter were just shy of $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately $160 million or 8% from the prior year or increasing $85 million or 4% compared to Q1 2021. Inventory days remain historically low at 99 days versus 126 in the prior year.
Property, plant and equipment were just shy of $4.5 billion and CapEx for the quarter was $113 million with D&A of $148 million. Full year CapEx has been increased to approximately $700 million to strengthen future growth with full year D&A projected to be approximately $580 million. Overall, the balance sheet and cash flow remained very strong, with gross debt of $2.7 billion, total cash and short-term investments of approximately $1.4 billion and a leverage at 0.7x to adjusted EBITDA.  
And with that, I will turn it over to Chris Wellborn to cover our operational review."

For the period, our Flooring Rest of the World segment, sales increased 68% as reported and 50% on a constant basis. Operating margins expanded to 19.7% due to higher volume, pricing and mix improvements and a reduction of COVID restrictions, partially offset by inflation. Flooring Rest of the World outperformed our other segments with all our major product categories significantly as residential sales expanded in all regions.
We have implemented multiple price increases in most product categories to cover inflation in materials and freight. Raw material supplies are problematic and have impacted our LVT production and sales the most. We anticipate material and freight challenges will continue to impact our business in the third quarter.
Sales of our high-end laminate continue to grow dramatically as our proprietary products are being widely accepted as waterproof alternative to LVT and wood. We are beginning to introduce our next-generation of laminate at premium levels with collections featuring handcrafted visuals. We are increasing our production in Europe, with new capacity coming online and further capacity expansion projects are being initiated. Our laminate business in Russia and Brazil are growing strongly as we enhance our offering and expand our distribution. We recently completed the acquisition of a laminate distributor in the U.K. that will improve our position in the market.
Our LVT sales growth was strong during the period and would have been higher if material shortages had not interrupted manufacturing. To compensate for material inflation, we have increased prices and we expect further increases will be required as our costs continue to rise. We are significantly expanding sales of our rigid LVT collections with our patented water-tight joints that prevent moisture from penetrating the floor. Our manufacturing operations have made substantial progress improving throughputs, material costs and yields. Our production in the third quarter will continue to be limited by material availability. 
Our sheet vinyl sales rebounded strongly as retail stores opened in our primary markets. Our sheet vinyl distribution in Russia has expanded, and we are maximizing production to meet the growing demand.
Our wood plant in Malaysia has been idle since the government instituted lockdowns to address surging COVID rates. Wood is a small product category for us, so the sales impact in the third quarter will be limited. We are awaiting permits to complete the acquisition of a plant that reduces wood veneers to lower our cost.
Our Australian and New Zealand flooring businesses delivered excellent results with sales and margins exceeding our expectations. The residential business was strong, with hard surface products leading the growth. Carpet sales are strengthening with our national consumer advertising, enhanced merchandising and the launch of a new high-end wool and triexta collections that improved our mix. Most of our facilities operated at a high level with increased volumes benefiting our results. As in all of our markets, commercial sales have not recovered to their pre-pandemic levels. Though the Australian government has locked down specific regions to contain the spread of COVID, it has not meaningfully impacted our business. 
Our European insulation sales grew even though chemical shortages limited our production. Our margins are recovering after we implemented price increases to cover rising material costs. We have announced an additional price increase for the third quarter to offset further raw material inflation. We anticipate chemical supplies to remain tight and could impact our future sales. To expand our existing insulation business in Ireland and the U.K., we have signed an agreement to acquire an insulation manufacturer, which is pending government approval.
Our panels business is running at full capacity, and so far, we've been able to manage material shortages without interruptions to our operations. We have raised prices and improved our mix with higher value decorative products. To enhance our results, we are expanding our offering of premium products as well as our project specification team. To enhance our panel offering, we are commissioning a new line that creates unique surfaces and visuals to differentiate our offering in the market. 
For the period, our Flooring North America segment sales increased 35%, and adjusted margins expanded to 11.2% due to higher volume, productivity, pricing and mix improvements and fewer COVID interruptions, partially offset by inflation. Our business trends continued from the first quarter with sales growth being driven by residential remodeling and new construction. Commercial sales continued to improve, though the channel remains below pre-pandemic levels. Through the period, our order rate remains strong and our sales backlog remains above historical levels. We are maximizing output at our facilities to support higher sales and improve our service.
During the quarter, our production levels were hindered by local labor shortages and material supply, particularly in LVT, sheet vinyl and carpet. Ocean freight constraints delayed receipt of our imported products, impacting our sales, inventories and service levels. We implemented price increases as a material and transportation cost increase and we have announced additional pricing actions as inflation continues. Our restructuring initiatives are improving efficiencies as planned, and we should realize additional savings in the third quarter. 
Our residential carpet sales continued their growth trend across all channels with consumers investing in home improvement projects. Sales of our proprietary SmartStrand franchise expanded with our new collections being well accepted. Our EverStrand polyester collections are expanding by providing enhanced value, styling and environmental sustainability. Our carpet sales have been limited by personnel shortages in our operations, and we are implementing many actions to increase our staffing and productivity. We have improved our efficiencies by rationalizing low volume SKUs and streamlining our operational strategies.
Our commercial sales have improved as businesses increased remodeling and new construction projects. Both carpet, tile and hard surface products grew with health care, senior living, education and government recovering faster. Though down slightly from record levels, the June Architecture Billing Index had a fifth consecutive month of expansion, indicating the continued strengthening of new commercial development and renovation projects.
With realistic visuals and waterproof performance, our premium laminate collections are growing substantially. To support higher demand, we have implemented many process improvements to maximize our U.S. production and are importing product from our global operations. Our laminate expansion remains on schedule and should be operational by the end of this year. Our new line will produce the next-generation of RevWood which is already being introduced in Europe. To support the growth of our laminate business, our U.S. MDF operation completed investments to increase our volume and lower our cost.
Our new waterproof Ultrawood collections are being launched as a high-performance alternative to typical engineered wood floors. Our LVT and sheet vinyl sales continue to increase, with growth in the residential, retail and new construction channels. Our LVT and sheet vinyl growth and plant productivity were impacted by disruptions in supply that stopped our operations and delays in imported LVT caused by transportation constraints. We have enhanced our LVT offering with more realistic visuals, proprietary water-tight joints and improve stain and scratch resistance. Our U.S. operations implemented process enhancements that have increased our speeds and throughput. When material availability increases, we should see further improvements in our domestic manufacturing, which will support our recent product launches.
For the period, our Global Ceramic segment sales increased 38% as reported and 34% on a constant basis. Adjusted margins expanded to 13.2% due to higher volume, productivity, pricing and mix, improvements and fewer COVID disruptions, partially offset by inflation. Our ceramic businesses around the world have greatly improved with strength in the residential channel and increasing commercial sales. All of them have low inventories, which impacted our sales growth and service levels. We have initiated expansion plans to increase our capacity in mix in Mexico, Brazil, Russia and Europe. Our ceramic businesses continue to raise prices to cover material, energy and transportation inflation.
Our U.S. ceramic business is strengthening, and we are implementing price increases to cover material and freight inflation. We are improving our product mix with new shapes, sizes and service structures. We are reengineering our products to improve material cost and productivity. Our restructuring projects have been fully implemented and are growing the expected -- providing the expected benefits. Our countertop sales and mix continue to improve as we expand our premium offer with new technologies. In the period, a mechanical failure temporarily reduced production, which has been repaired. We have initiated the expansion of our plant to further grow our countertop business.
Our Mexican and Brazilian ceramic businesses are very strong, with our residential business in both regions at historically high levels and commercial still recovering. Due to capacity constraints, our facilities could not fulfill customer demand, so we are allocating our production. We have executed multiple price increases to offset energy and material inflation. We are expanding operations in Mexico this quarter, and we have initiated new investments to increase capacity in Brazil.
Our European ceramic business delivered strong sales and profitability as pricing, product mix, and productivity improved our margins. We increased sales of our premium products, including slabs, small sizes, outdoor and antibacterial collections. Commercial sales trends are starting to improve though they remain below historical levels. We are selectively increasing prices to recover material, energy and freight inflation. During the period, our operations ran at high levels with improved efficiencies and increased throughputs. We continue to rationalize low volume SKUs to optimize our operations. To support our sales of high-end collections, we have initiated expansion projects, some of which will take through next year to complete.
Our ceramic sales in Russia were robust across all channels with our direct sales to customers through our own stores and new construction projects outperforming. We have announced price increases to cover rising inflation. During the period, our manufacturing operations ran at capacity to respond to accelerated sales with inventory remaining below historical levels. Due to present capacity limitations, we are focusing on optimizing our product mix. We have initiated expansion plans with new production expected in the second half of next year. Sales of our new sanitaryware products are expanding primarily through our owned and franchised retail stores as our manufacturing ramps up.
With that, I'll return the call to Jeff."

The global economy should continue to improve due to low interest rates, government stimulus and the success of COVID vaccines. Around the world, flooring sales trends remain favorable, with residential remodeling and new construction at high levels and commercial projects strengthening. In the third quarter, we expect our strong sale to continue, with our typical seasonal slowing from the second quarter. We will expand the introduction of new products with additional features and increase our investments to enhance our future sales and mix. Material, energy and transportation inflation is expected to continue and will require further pricing actions to offset.
Most of our facilities will operate at high utilization rates, though ongoing material and local labor constraints will limit our production. Our Global Ceramic and Flooring Rest of the World segments will observe the European vacation schedules in the third quarter, which reduces production and increases cost in the period. In many countries, future government actions to contain COVID remain a risk and could impact our business. Given these factors, we anticipate our third quarter adjusted EPS to be between $3.71 and $3.81, excluding any restructuring charges.
We entered this year with uncertainty about COVID, the economic recovery, home renovation and new construction. Our business is stronger than we had anticipated, and we are increasing investments to support additional growth and improve efficiencies. Longer term, housing sales and remodeling are expected to remain at historical high levels. Apartment renovation should accelerate as rent deferment expires, and investments in commercial projects should continue to strengthen. We're expanding our operations and introducing new innovations to maximize our results. Our balance sheet is strong, and we're exploring additional internal projects and acquisition opportunities.
We'll now be glad to take your questions."

The third quarter, we expect sales trends to continue from the second quarter. The operations will still run strong. We're assuming that business and residential keep going and commercial improvement. Residential -- the European -- the non-U.S. business, especially Europe, always slow with the normal holiday period as we go through. And you might not know but -- the non-U.S. businesses over time have become a larger part of our results, and the holidays have become a bigger impact over many years as we keep expanding outside the U.S.
So -- and with that, we still have material supply, labor, transportation that all are constraining the business. We don't think the pricing actions we have are enough. Our inflation keeps coming so we expect to keep putting in more increases in prices in it. And then just to try other things. As you think of the third quarter, what you have is manufacturing costs in the United States are impacted by holiday in the 4th of July, which is in the third quarter rather than second. You have the holidays, which impacts not only the cost of not operating, but the sales also drop off as we go through.

And what's happened is in the marketplace, there are multiple options. And if you go into retailers today, they start talking about waterproof flooring as a category when they start showing products, of which our laminate, with the technologies we have, is a good or better alternative than many other ones in the waterproof category. So that's causing it to grow.
It's also been growing in -- going into different channels. It's being used -- if you watch any television shows, the remodeling pieces, they're using laminate and remodeling in new houses today, which they -- with a much higher rate than they have in the past. And then separate from all of that, we really do have unique technologies that give us differentiated features and visuals that separate our products from the market, and we have a much higher portion of the premium market because of it, both in the U.S. and Europe, as it."

With all the constraints, we don't know how they're going to happen in the third quarter. We've built in our best guesses of supply and labor and transportation, but it's a moving target, as it. As you go from there into the fourth quarter, it is typically softer as people go into the holidays. They don't tend to buy as much flooring during Christmas.
And then this year, we have 6% less days and a 6% less days will impact the sales and the margins as we lose the absorption from the lower days in the period, as it. Then this year versus last year, and this is a guess because we don't know what's going to happen, we're expecting at this point a more normal seasonality with more increased vacations, people taking, with lower holiday spending on remodeling and reduced utilization of the plants. But we're going to have to see how it happens at the end of the year compared to last year when we had the rebound that we did. But it's difficult to predict at this point.

The second part is, there is a seasonality, which I'm not sure all of -- everyone understands, our European businesses have -- European and non-U.S. businesses have become a much larger part of our business. They impact the business more today than they did 5 years ago or before because of the acquisitions and enhancements of the business we've done. So when they step down, that whole category steps down, which will reduce the sales level in total from the third quarter and have a negative impact on the sales and margins, and it will be lower because of it as it has been in prior years. And it's not the business changing, it's the normal seasonality.
Now separate from that, last year was also unusual. And what happened last year with COVID, we -- and our plants and our facilities and our customers, we shut down a lot in the second quarter. And what happened is many of the people -- we have the people taking their vacations in the second quarter. So when the business started getting better in the third quarter, we didn't do the normal shutdowns because we used the vacation pays and things in the second quarter. And then the same thing happened, people didn't go on vacations like they did. So the third quarter was unusually high because the whole vacation structure of both our production, our customers, vacations for people was different.

The wood panel business that we have is running wide open. The margins are improving. It's at high levels because there's shortages in wood panels. So it's at a high level.

But relative to historical, it should continue at high levels. The houses that were purchased over the last year, they are all in various stages of remodeling. When you buy a new home, an existing home, you typically don't remodel the whole thing. It goes in stages. So that will take a while to play out going forward. 
You have some things with policies with the government. People who haven't been paying their mortgages. At some point, some of those houses are going to turn over, and that's going to increase the remodeling sales somewhat. You have people in the rentals that haven't been paying rents. At some point, some of those are going to change over, and they're going to have to remodel them for the next people.
You have the commercial parts of the business, companies are getting more confident or not, and they're starting to invest more. It takes time to put it in the budgets, time to start them. There's a void for a while on new construction that got stopped. So there's going to be a void to when it comes back and there's a lot of upside in it, and it's a more profitable business because the products are more unique and differentiated. So all the trends look good as far as we can see them. 
On the other side, short term, we don't know if we have enough materials to run the place tomorrow in some cases. And so we wake up and the materials are supposed to come in and something happens, we just shut the plant down. We have -- you come in and we have -- people just aren't showing up for work like they normally do, as it.

Our third quarter results exceeded our expectations as net sales rose 9% over the prior year to approximately $2.8 billion. Our adjusted EPS was $3.95 per share.

Our third quarter results exceeded our expectations as net sales rose 9% over the prior year to approximately $2.8 billion. Our adjusted EPS was $3.95 per share. All of our businesses performed well, managing through a changing environment in a period COVID directly and indirectly impacted many economies, creating supply chain difficulties that disrupted production as well as leading the government lockdowns in Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia that halted manufacturing and retail. 
Despite these and other headwinds, our third quarter sales trends continued in most regions, with Europe's results reflecting more normal summer seasonality. Home sales were robust across most geographies and consumers continued remodeling investments at a strong pace. Year-over-year, the commercial sector showed improvement though at a slower rate as COVID concerns delayed the timing of some projects. 
Our strategies to enhance organizational flexibility, reduce product and operational complexity and align pricing with cost improved our results in the period. We continue to implement lean processes and reduce complexity in manufacturing and logistics. We're managing our investments in SG&A to support new products that will expand our future revenues and margins. 
Even with greater external constraints, we ran most of our operations at high levels and we successfully managed many interruptions across the enterprise. Rather than improving as we expected, the availability of labor, materials and transportation became more challenging, resulting in higher costs in the period. Tight chemical supplies, in particular, reduced the output of our LVT, carpet, laminate and board panels. 
While we are presently seeing COVID cases declining in most of the regions, many of our operations experienced increased absenteeism during the period, affecting our efficiencies in production. For the near term, we do not see any significant changes in these external pressures. 
Due to supply shortages, government regulations and political issues, natural gas costs in Europe are presently about 4x as high than they were earlier in the year. This has a temporary challenge to our European businesses as higher costs are reflected in gas, electricity and our materials. 
Though our inventories increased during the period, mostly due to higher material costs and transportation delays on customer orders, our service levels remained below historical norms. Most of our businesses are carrying significant order backlogs, and we plan to run our operations at high levels during the fourth quarter to improve our service and efficiencies. 
Currently, some of our fastest-growing products are being limited by material and capacity constraints. We have initiated additional investments to increase our production of those and increase our sales and service. Completion of those projects is being extended due to longer lead times on building materials and equipment. 
Our results have improved significantly during 2021 and we generated over $1.9 billion of EBITDA for the trailing 12 months. Given this in our current valuations, our Board increased our stock purchase program by an additional $500 million. Since the end of the second quarter, we bought approximately $250 million of our stock at an average price of $193 per share. With our current low leverage, we have the capital to pursue additional investments and acquisitions to expand our sales and profitability. 
Jim will now review our third quarter financials."

Sales for the quarter exceeded $2.8 billion, a 9.4% increase as reported and 8.7% on a constant basis. All segments showed growth, primarily due to price and mix actions as volume was generally constrained by supply, labor, transportation",851,"Thank you, Jeff. Sales for the quarter exceeded $2.8 billion, a 9.4% increase as reported and 8.7% on a constant basis. All segments showed growth, primarily due to price and mix actions as volume was generally constrained by supply, labor, transportation and COVID disruptions. 
Gross margin, as reported, was 29.7% or 29.8% excluding charges, increasing from 28.3% last year. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by improved price and mix, which offset the increasing rate of inflation. In addition, gains in productivity, less year-over-year downtime and favorable FX improved our margins. The actual detailed amounts of these items will be included in the MD&A section of our 10-Q, which will be filed after the call. 
SG&A as reported was 16.9% and flat versus prior year, excluding charges. Increased SG&A dollars versus prior year as a result of costs that were curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, higher sales, increased inflation, new product development and price and mix. Operating margin as reported was 12.8%. Restructuring charges were approximately $1 million, and we have reached our original savings goal exceeding $100 million in annual savings. We continue, though, to pursue other initiatives to lower our costs. 
Operating margins, excluding charges, were also 12.8%, improving from 11.5% in the prior year or 130 basis points. The increase was driven by improved price and mix, offsetting increasing inflation as well as gains in productivity, favorable FX and greater year-over-year manufacturing uptime, improving our results. We were partially offset by impact of constrained volume and increased cost in product development. 
Interest expense was $15 million in the quarter, flat versus prior year. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21.4% versus 16.9% in the prior year, and we still expect the full year rate to be between 21.5% and 22.5%. 
Earnings per share as reported were $3.93, and excluding charges were 3.95% -- $3.95, excuse me, increasing by 21% versus prior year. Now turning to the segments. 
Global ceramic sales came in just under $1 billion, a 9.6% increase as reported or approximately 9.1% on a constant basis, led by strengthening price and mix across our geographic regions. Brazil, Mexico and the U.S. countertop business saw the strongest volume gains while other products performed well against a difficult year-over-year Q3 comparison, which had an abnormal seasonality. 
Operating margin excluding charges was 11.9%, up 160 basis points versus prior year due to the favorable price/mix offsetting increasing inflation, which improved -- with improved productivity and limited year-over-year shutdowns strengthening our results, partially offset by increased costs in new product development. 
Flooring North America sales just exceeded $1 billion, a 6.9% increase as reported. The sales growth was driven by price and mix actions to offset rising costs as our sales volumes were impacted by supply, transportation and labor constraints. 
Operating margin excluding charges was 11.4%. That's an increase of 320 basis points versus prior year. The improvement was driven by positive price/mix offsetting the increasing inflation and volume constraints. In addition, productivity gains and less temporary shutdowns favorably impacted our results. 
In Flooring Rest of the World, sales exceeded $760 million, a 12.7% as reported increase or 10.5% on a constant basis, driven again by price and mix actions while volumes here were constrained by material disruptions, especially in LVT, are returned to a normal summer seasonality and COVID restrictions, which caused lockdowns in Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia. 
Operating margin, excluding charges, was 17.4%. This is a decrease versus prior year as a result of the return to a normal summer holiday, along with material constraints and COVID lockdowns which increased our costs and lower productivity, volume and increase the temporary shutdown. Improved price/mix, which offset the increase in inflation and favorable FX benefited our results. Corporate and eliminations were $11 million, and I would expect that to be $45 million for the full year. 
Taking a look at the balance sheet. Cash for the quarter exceeded $1.1 billion with free cash flow of $351 million in the quarter and over $720 million in third quarter year-to-date. Receivables were just shy of $1.9 billion with a DSO of just under 57 days. 
Inventories were just over $2.2 billion, an increase of approximately $374 million or 20% from the prior year. That's an increase of about 16% if you compare to the year-end balance. Inventory days just under 107 days compared to our low point last year at just under 100 days and 103 days at the year-end. 
Property, plant and equipment exceeded $4.4 billion with CapEx for the quarter at $148 million, in line with our D&A. Full year CapEx is currently projected to be $650 million, with D&A projected at $586 million. 
Looking at the current debt. One note on October 19, the company redeemed at par their January 2022 $500 million euro 2% senior notes plus unpaid interest, utilizing cash on hand. The balance sheet overall and cash flow remained very strong with gross debt as of the end of Q3 of $2.3 billion and leverage at 0.6x to adjusted EBITDA. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Chris to review our operational results."

For the period, our Flooring Rest of World segment sales increased 12.7% as reported and 10.5% on a constant basis. Operating margins were 17.4% as a result of pricing and mix improvements, offset by inflation and a return to more normal seasonality in the period. 
During the quarter, sales were strong across our product categories and geographies outside those affected by government lockdowns. Overall, raw material supplies continue to impact our operations, with LVT production affected the most during the quarter. We expect that material, energy and transportation inflation will continue and chemical costs that rely on gas will accelerate in upcoming periods. 
During the period, COVID shutdowns in Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand interrupted our production and sales. These restrictions have now been lifted, and we are ramping up production to meet demand. 
Our laminate collections continue to have strong sales growth with consumers embracing our proprietary waterproof products for their performance and realistic visuals. Our new premium laminate introductions feature unique services that replicate handcrafted wood floors. Our sales volume increased during the period, though our margins were pressured by higher-than-anticipated raw material and transportation inflation. 
We added new capacity in Europe to meet demand, and we are initiating other projects to support further sales growth. In Russia and Brazil, our laminate businesses are growing as we expand distribution with our leading collections. 
As anticipated, our LVT sales were lower during the period, given material shortages and lower production that reduced our output. We minimized the impact by improving our product mix and raising prices to pass through inflation. Sales of our higher-value rigid LVT collections with patented water-type joint outperformed and benefited our mix. We anticipate improved material availability in the fourth quarter to support higher LVT production levels and improve our service. We have announced additional price increases as our energy and material costs continue to rise. 
Our sheet vinyl production and sales were impacted by tight material supply and transportation bottlenecks and outbound shipments. Our Russian sheet vinyl business performed well with sales growing as our distribution expanded. 
Our wood plant in Malaysia resumed full operations in September after 12 weeks of government lockdowns due to COVID. Sales of our wood products will be down in both the third and fourth quarters as our inventories have been depleted. 
We have acquired a European wood veneer plant to improve supply, yields and cost of our wood flooring. We're introducing waterproof wood collections with our patented Wet Protect Technology in our markets after its successful launch in the U.S. 
Production stops in Australia and New Zealand reduced our sales and margins, and we are scaling up our operations to meet demand as the markets reopen. Our new premium collections, enhanced merchandising and consumer advertising will benefit our business as the markets return to normal. We are increasing pricing to offset inflation and transportation costs. 
Sales of our European installation panels grew in the period as we implemented another price increase to offset rising material inflation. Our income improved with disruptions in manufacturing due to tight material supplies. We acquired an insulation manufacturer in Ireland and have begun integrating their operations with our existing business. 
During the third quarter, our panels business grew and margins expanded as we increased our price -- mix and pricing. We're introducing a new decorative range to enhance our participation in specified markets. We have added new press that will increase our capacity and add more differentiated features to our products. Our ongoing pricing actions offset rapidly rising material prices, and we will increase prices further in response to inflation. 
In the fourth quarter, we will complete the acquisition of an MDF manufacturer in France to expand our capacity in Western Europe. The company is a pioneer in bio-based resins, which will enhance our sustainability position. 
In the third quarter period, our Flooring North America segment sales increased 6.9% and operating margins were 11.3% as reported as a result of productivity, pricing and mix improvements, partially offset by inflation. Flooring North America had strong results given the material, transportation and labor constraints impacting our sales and production during the period. 
Supplies of most oil-related chemicals were restricted, creating unscheduled production stops that lowered our sales and raised our costs. We implemented additional price increases across most product categories as inflationary pressures intensified. We continue to streamline our product portfolio and reduce operational complexity, benefiting our efficiencies and quality. 
In residential carpet, limited material and labor availability are affecting our production and manufacturing costs. We continue to increase prices to recover continued inflation. Volume and efficiencies are being negatively impacted by low inventories, shorter runs and labor challenges. 
We are replacing older assets with more efficient equipment, which is improving our labor productivity. We have an elevated backlog, and we plan to run our operations at high levels in the fourth quarter to improve service and replenish inventories. 
We are enhancing our sales and mix as consumers upgrade their homes with our premium SmartStrand and luxury nylon collections. 
Commercial sales improved in the period, though the rate of growth has slowed as COVID cases increased. The government, education and health care sectors outpaced office, retail and hospitality channels which are recovering more slowly. Our hard surface sales are growing as we expand our offering and increase specifications in commercial projects. We are investing in more efficient assets to improve cost, enhance styling and reduce labor requirements. 
Our laminate and wood business continues to grow, though our sales were restricted by our capacities. Our new laminate line should be operational by the end of this year to expand our sales and provide more advanced features. Chemical shortages limited our laminate production in the period as we responded by reengineering our formulations to maximize our output. 
We are reducing complexities to simplify our operations and improve our efficiencies and production. Our new high-performance UltraWood collections are increasing our mix in wood and the productivity of our new plant is improving as volume increases. 
Our LVT sales increased in the period, even with material supplies limiting production and shipping days in our sourced products. We have improved our mix with enhanced features and lowered our costs by streamlining our processes. Our plan has increased throughput and yields despite disruptions from a lack of material supply. 
To support future growth, we are expanding our LVT operations adding approximately $160 million of production, with the initial phase beginning at the end of this year. We are also increasing our sheet vinyl plants production to satisfy expanding sales of our collections. 
In the quarter, our Global Ceramic segment sales increased 9.6% as reported and 9.1% on a constant basis. Operating margins were 11.9% as a result of higher volume, productivity, pricing and mix improvements, partially offset by inflation. 
Our U.S. Ceramic business grew during the period with the residential sector remaining strong and commercial continuing to show improvement. Our margins improved in the quarter as we implemented price increases to offset higher transportation and raw material costs, enhanced our mix and increased output from our plants. 
Additional pricing actions are being taken to offset continuing inflation. We are reducing our manufacturing costs by reengineering our products, utilizing alternative materials and enhancing our logistics strategies. We are introducing higher-value products with new printing technologies, textured finishes and polished services to provide alternatives to premium imported tile. We are growing our studio direct program that focuses on high-end remodeling and exterior collections that sell through outdoor specialists and home centers. 
Our quartz countertop sales continue to grow substantially as our production recovered during the period. Our countertop mix is improving as sales of our higher-end visuals grow at a faster rate. 
Our Mexican and Brazilian ceramic businesses are growing as we increased prices to offset inflation in both countries. We are refining our product offering, improving our efficiencies and increasing our output. 
We have expanded our participation in residential projects and commercial sales. We are increasing the number of retailers that exclusively sell our products. We are investing in new manufacturing assets in both countries to expand our production and enhance our product offering. 
Sales in our European ceramic business remained strong as vacation schedules return to normal. Increases in price, mix and productivity enhanced our results, though they were more than offset by rising inflation. Our new products with enhanced visuals, unique shapes and large slabs increased our average selling price and improved our mix. 
We are upgrading production lines to further enhance our styling and improve our efficiencies. In the period, natural gas and electricity prices in Europe rose to unprecedented levels due to anticipated shortages. Our margins will be negatively impacted until our prices align with energy cost in the future. 
Sales and margins increased in our Russian ceramic business as enhanced mix and increased prices offset higher inflation. Lower inventories and capacity limitations impacted our sales volume in the period, and we will continue to manage our mix until new capacity is operational. 
Due to an equipment delay, our production expansion will not be ready until the third quarter of next year. Our sanitary ware sales are growing significantly as we expand production and operate -- in our operations. 
With that, I'll return the call to Jeff."

Throughout 2021, Mohawk has delivered exceptional results with higher sales growth, margin expansion and robust cash generation. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that industry seasonality will be more typical unlike last year when demand was unusually high. In the period, we'll run our operations at high levels to support our sales improve our service and increase our inventory. 
Our sales in some categories are being limited by our manufacturing capacities, and we're increasing investments to expand the production of these growing categories. We are continuing to implement additional price increases and manage staffing, supply and transportation constraints across the business. We're maintaining aggressive cost management, leveraging technology and enhancing our strategies across the enterprise. 
In Ceramic Europe, record gas prices are increasing the net cost by approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter, and it will take some time for the industry to adjust to the higher cost. In addition, our fourth quarter calendar had 6% fewer days than the prior year. Given these factors, we anticipate our fourth quarter adjusted EPS to be $2.80 to $2.90, excluding any restructuring charges. 
Despite temporary challenges from inflation and material availability, our long-term outlook remains optimistic with new home construction and residential remodeling projected to remain robust and the commercial sector improving as businesses invest in growth. Next year, our sales should grow with capacity expansions and new innovative product introductions. 
Our strategies to optimize our results continue to evolve with the economic and supply chain conditions. Our balance sheet is the strongest in history and it supports increased internal investments and strategic acquisitions. 
We'll now be glad to take your questions."

Our third quarter results exceeded our expectations as net sales rose 9% over the prior year to approximately $2.8 billion. Our adjusted EPS was $3.95 per share. All of our businesses performed well, managing through a changing environment in a period COVID directly and indirectly impacted many economies, creating supply chain difficulties that disrupted production as well as leading the government lockdowns in Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia that halted manufacturing and retail.
Despite these and other headwinds, our third quarter sales trends continued in most regions, with Europe's results reflecting more normal summer seasonality. Home sales were robust across most geographies and consumers continued remodeling investments at a strong pace. Year-over-year, the commercial sector showed improvement though at a slower rate as COVID concerns delayed the timing of some projects.
Our strategy is to enhance organizational flexibility, reduce product and operational complexity and align pricing with cost improved our results in the period. We continue to implement lean processes and reduce complexity in manufacturing and logistics. We're managing our investments in SG&A to support new products that will expand our future revenues and margins.
Even with greater external constraints, we ran most of our operations at high levels and we successfully managed many interruptions across the enterprise. Rather than improving as we expected, the availability of labor, materials and transportation became more challenging, resulting in higher costs in the period. Tight chemical supplies, in particular, reduced the output of our LVT, carpet, laminate and board panels.
While we are presently seeing COVID cases declining in most of the regions, many of our operations experienced increased absenteeism during the period, affecting our efficiencies in production. For the near term, we do not see any significant changes in these external pressures.
Due to supply shortages, government regulations and political issues, natural gas costs in Europe are presently about 4x as high than they were earlier in the year. This has a temporary challenge to our European businesses as higher costs are reflected in gas, electricity and other materials.
Though our inventories increased during the period, mostly due to higher material costs and transportation delays on customer orders, our service levels remained below historical norms. Most of our businesses are carrying significant order backlogs, and we plan to run our operations at high levels during the fourth quarter to improve our service and efficiencies.
Currently, some of our fastest-growing products are being limited by material and capacity constraints. We have initiated additional investments to increase our production of those and increase our sales and service. Completion of those projects is being extended due to longer lead times on building materials and equipment.
Our results have improved significantly during 2021 and we generated over $1.9 billion of EBITDA for the trailing 12 months. Given this in our current valuations, our Board increased our stock purchase program by an additional $500 million. Since the end of the second quarter, we bought approximately $250 million of our stock at an average price of $193 per share. With our current low leverage, we have the capital to pursue additional investments and acquisitions to expand our sales and profitability.
Jim will now review our third quarter financials."

Sales for the quarter exceeded $2.8 billion and 9.4% increase as reported and 8.7% on a constant basis. All segments showed growth, primarily due to price and mix actions as volume was generally constrained by supply, labor, transportation and COVID disruptions.
Gross margin, as reported, was 29.7% or 29.8% excluding charges, increasing from 28.3% last year. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by improved price and mix, which offset the increasing rate of inflation. In addition, gains in productivity, less year-over-year downtime and favorable FX improved our margins. The actual detailed amounts of these items will be included in the MD&A section of our 10-Q, which will be filed after the call.
SG&A as reported was 16.9% and flat versus prior year, excluding charges. Increased SG&A dollars versus prior year as a result of costs that were curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, higher sales, increased inflation, new product development and price and mix. Operating margin as reported was 12.8%. Restructuring charges were approximately $1 million, and we have reached our original savings goal exceeding $100 million in annual savings. We continue, though, to pursue other initiatives to lower our costs.
Operating margins, excluding charges, were also 12.8%, improving from 11.5% in the prior year or 130 basis points. The increase was driven by improved price and mix, offsetting increasing inflation as well as gains in productivity, favorable FX and greater year-over-year manufacturing uptime, improving our results. We were partially offset by impact of constrained volume and increased cost in product development.
Interest expense was $15 million in the quarter, flat versus prior year. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21.4% versus 16.9% in the prior year, and we still expect the full year rate to be between 21.5% and 22.5%.
Earnings per share as reported were $3.93, and excluding charges were 3.95% -- $3.95, excuse me, increasing by 21% versus prior year. Now turning to the segments.
Global ceramic sales came in just under $1 billion, a 9.6% increase as reported or approximately 9.1% on a constant basis, led by strengthening price and mix across our geographic regions. Brazil, Mexico and the U.S. countertop business saw the strongest volume gains while other products performed well against a difficult year-over-year Q3 comparison, which had an abnormal seasonality.
Operating margin excluding charges was 11.9%, up 160 basis points versus prior year due to the favorable price/mix offsetting increasing inflation, which improved -- with improved productivity and limited year-over-year shutdowns strengthening our results, partially offset by increased costs in new product development.
Flooring North America sales just exceeded $1 billion, a 6.9% increase as reported. The sales growth was driven by price and mix actions to offset rising costs as our sales volumes were impacted by supply, transportation and labor constraints.
Operating margin excluding charges was 11.4%. That's an increase of 320 basis points versus prior year. The improvement was driven by positive price and mix offsetting the increasing inflation and volume constraints. In addition, productivity gains and less temporary shutdowns favorably impacted our results.
In Flooring Rest of the World, sales exceeded $760 million, a 12.7% as reported increase or 10.5% on a constant basis, driven again by price and mix actions while volumes here were constrained by material disruptions, especially in LVT, a return to a normal summer seasonality and COVID restrictions, which caused lockdowns in Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia. 
Operating margin, excluding charges, was 17.4%. This is a decrease versus prior year as a result of the return to a normal summer holiday, along with material constraints and COVID lockdowns which increased our costs and lower productivity, volume and increased the temporary shutdown. Improved price and mix, which offset the increase in inflation and favorable FX benefited our results. Corporate and eliminations were $11 million, and I would expect that to be $45 million for the full year.
Taking a look at the balance sheet. Cash for the quarter exceeded $1.1 billion with free cash flow of $351 million in the quarter and over $720 million in third quarter year-to-date. Receivables were just shy of $1.9 billion with a DSO of just under 57 days.
Inventories were just over $2.2 billion, an increase of approximately $374 million or 20% from the prior year. That's an increase of about 16% if you compare to the year-end balance. Inventory days just under 107 days compared to our low point last year at just under 100 days and 103 days at the year-end.
Property, plant and equipment exceeded $4.4 billion with CapEx for the quarter at $148 million, in line with our D&A. Full year CapEx is currently projected to be $650 million, with D&A projected at $586 million.
Looking at the current debt. One note on October 19, the company redeemed at par their January 2022 EUR 500 million 2% senior notes plus unpaid interest, utilizing cash on hand.

For the period, our Flooring Rest of World segment sales increased 12.7% as reported and 10.5% on a constant basis. Operating margins were 17.4% as a result of pricing and mix improvements, offset by inflation and a return to more normal seasonality in the period.
During the quarter, sales were strong across our product categories and geographies outside those affected by government lockdowns. Overall, raw material supplies continue to impact our operations, with LVT production affected the most during the quarter. We expect that material, energy and transportation inflation will continue and chemical costs that rely on gas will accelerate in upcoming periods.
During the period, COVID shutdowns in Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand interrupted our production and sales. These restrictions have now been lifted, and we are ramping up production to meet demand.
Our laminate collections continue to have strong sales growth with consumers embracing our proprietary waterproof products for their performance and realistic visuals. Our new premium laminate introductions feature unique services that replicate handcrafted wood floors. Our sales volume increased during the period, though our margins were pressured by higher-than-anticipated raw material and transportation inflation.
We added new capacity in Europe to meet demand, and we are initiating other projects to support further sales growth. In Russia and Brazil, our laminate businesses are growing as we expand distribution with our leading collections.
As anticipated, our LVT sales were lower during the period, given material shortages and lower production that reduced our output. We minimized the impact by improving our product mix and raising prices to pass through inflation. Sales of our higher-value rigid LVT collections with patented water-type joint outperformed and benefited our mix. We anticipate improved material availability in the fourth quarter to support higher LVT production levels and improve our service. We have announced additional price increases as our energy and material costs continue to rise.
Our sheet vinyl production and sales were impacted by tight material supply and transportation bottlenecks and outbound shipments. Our Russian sheet vinyl business performed well with sales growing as our distribution expanded.
Our wood plant in Malaysia resumed full operations in September after 12 weeks of government lockdowns due to COVID. Sales of our wood products will be down in both the third and fourth quarters as our inventories have been depleted.
We have acquired a European wood veneer plant to improve supply, yields and cost of our wood flooring. We're introducing waterproof wood collections with our patented Wet Protect Technology in our markets after its successful launch in the U.S.
Production stops in Australia and New Zealand reduced our sales and margins, and we are scaling up our operations to meet demand as the markets reopen. Our new premium collections, enhanced merchandising and consumer advertising will benefit our business as the markets return to normal. We are increasing pricing to offset inflation and transportation costs.
Sales of our European insulation panels grew in the period as we implemented another price increase to offset rising material inflation. Our income improved with disruptions in manufacturing due to tight material supplies. We acquired an insulation manufacturer in Ireland and have begun integrating their operations with our existing business.
During the third quarter, our panels business grew and margins expanded as we increased our price mix and pricing. We're introducing a new decorative range to enhance our participation in specified markets. We have added new press that will increase our capacity and add more differentiated features to our products. Our ongoing pricing actions offset rapidly rising material prices, and we will increase prices further in response to inflation.
In the fourth quarter, we will complete the acquisition of an MDF manufacturer in France to expand our capacity in Western Europe. The company is a pioneer in bio-based resins, which will enhance our sustainability position.
In the third quarter period, our Flooring North America segment sales increased 6.9% and operating margins were 11.3% as reported as a result of productivity, pricing and mix improvements, partially offset by inflation. Flooring North America had strong results given the material, transportation and labor constraints impacting our sales and production during the period.
Supplies of most oil-related chemicals were restricted, creating unscheduled production stops that lowered our sales and raised our costs. We implemented additional price increases across most product categories as inflationary pressures intensified. We continue to streamline our product portfolio and reduce operational complexity, benefiting our efficiencies and quality. 
In residential carpet, limited material and labor availability are affecting our production and manufacturing costs. We continue to increase prices to recover continued inflation. Volume and efficiencies are being negatively impacted by low inventories, shorter runs and labor challenges.
We are replacing older assets with more efficient equipment, which is improving our labor productivity. We have an elevated backlog, and we plan to run our operations at high levels in the fourth quarter to improve service and replenish inventories.
We are enhancing our sales and mix as consumers upgrade their homes with our premium SmartStrand and luxury nylon collections.
Commercial sales improved in the period, though the rate of growth has slowed as COVID cases increased. The government, education and health care sectors outpaced office, retail and hospitality channels which are recovering more slowly. Our hard surface sales are growing as we expand our offering and increase specifications in commercial projects. We are investing in more efficient assets to improve cost, enhance styling and reduce labor requirements.
Our laminate and wood business continues to grow, though our sales were restricted by our capacities. Our new laminate line should be operational by the end of this year to expand our sales and provide more advanced features. Chemical shortages limited our laminate production in the period as we responded by reengineering our formulations to maximize our output.
We are reducing complexities to simplify our operations and improve our efficiencies and production. Our new high-performance UltraWood collections are increasing our mix in wood and the productivity of our new plant is improving as volume increases.
Our LVT sales increased in the period, even with material supplies limiting production and shipping days in our sourced products. We have improved our mix with enhanced features and lowered our costs by streamlining our processes. Our plant has increased throughput and yields despite disruptions from a lack of material supply.
To support future growth, we are expanding our LVT operations adding approximately $160 million of production, with the initial phase beginning at the end of this year. We are also increasing our sheet vinyl plant's production to satisfy expanding sales of our collections.
In the quarter, our Global Ceramic segment sales increased 9.6% as reported and 9.1% on a constant basis. Operating margins were 11.9% as a result of higher volume, productivity, pricing and mix improvements, partially offset by inflation.
Our U.S. Ceramic business grew during the period with the residential sector remaining strong and commercial continuing to show improvement. Our margins improved in the quarter as we implemented price increases to offset higher transportation and raw material costs, enhanced our mix and increased output from our plants.
Additional pricing actions are being taken to offset continuing inflation. We are reducing our manufacturing costs by reengineering our products, utilizing alternative materials and enhancing our logistics strategies. We are introducing higher-value products with new printing technologies, textured finishes and polished services to provide alternatives to premium imported tile. We are growing our studio direct program that focuses on high-end remodeling and exterior collections that sell-through outdoor specialists and home centers.
Our quartz countertop sales continue to grow substantially as our production recovered during the period. Our countertop mix is improving as sales of our higher-end visuals grow at a faster rate.
Our Mexican and Brazilian ceramic businesses are growing as we increased prices to offset inflation in both countries. We are refining our product offering, improving our efficiencies and increasing our output.
We have expanded our participation in residential projects and commercial sales. We are increasing the number of retailers that exclusively sell our products. We are investing in new manufacturing assets in both countries to expand our production and enhance our product offering.
Sales in our European ceramic business remained strong as vacation schedules return to normal. Increases in price, mix and productivity enhanced our results, though they were more than offset by rising inflation. Our new products with enhanced visuals, unique shapes and large slabs increased our average selling price and improved our mix.
We are upgrading production lines to further enhance our styling and improve our efficiencies. In the period, natural gas and electricity prices in Europe rose to unprecedented levels due to anticipated shortages. Our margins will be negatively impacted until our prices align with energy cost in the future.
Sales and margins increased in our Russian ceramic business as enhanced mix and increased prices offset higher inflation. Lower inventories and capacity limitations impacted our sales volume in the period, and we will continue to manage our mix until new capacity is operational.
Due to an equipment delay, our production expansion will not be ready until the third quarter of next year. Our sanitary ware sales are growing significantly as we expand production and operate -- and our operations. 
With that, I'll return the call to Jeff."

Throughout 2021, Mohawk has delivered exceptional results with higher sales growth, margin expansion and robust cash generation. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that industry seasonality will be more typical unlike last year when demand was unusually high. In the period, we'll run our operations at high levels to support our sales, improve our service and increase our inventory.
Our sales in some categories are being limited by our manufacturing capacities, and we're increasing investments to expand the production of these growing categories. We are continuing to implement additional price increases and manage staffing, supply and transportation constraints across the business. We're maintaining aggressive cost management, leveraging technology and enhancing our strategies across the enterprise.
In Ceramic Europe, record gas prices are increasing the net cost by approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter, and it will take some time for the industry to adjust to the higher cost. In addition, our fourth quarter calendar has 6% fewer days than the prior year. Given these factors, we anticipate our fourth quarter adjusted EPS to be $2.80 to $2.90, excluding any restructuring charges.
Despite temporary challenges from inflation and material availability, our long-term outlook remains optimistic with new home construction and residential remodeling projected to remain robust, and the commercial sector improving as businesses invest and grow. Next year, our sales should grow with capacity expansions and new innovative product introductions.
Our strategies to optimize our results continue to evolve with the economic and supply chain conditions. Our balance sheet is the strongest in history and it supports increased internal investments and strategic acquisitions.
We'll now be glad to take your questions."

Inflation is projected to moderate rate and the disruptions in supply and transportation are expected to decline. 
In Europe, we have the temporary problem with this rapid increase in electricity inflation which will impact both our energy and material costs across the businesses. The forward prices are expected to drop into half once we get through the winter. With Ceramic Europe, which is most impacted due to its gas use and margins, we're expecting them to recover by the third quarter as the industry aligns over time.
