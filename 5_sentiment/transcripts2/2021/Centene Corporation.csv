Personally and on behalf of the corporation, I am very pleased with the results we delivered in 2020. Early in 2020, we stated that the year would be choppy, and it was. We also told you that Centene would manage through the crisis we face, care for our stakeholders and emerge stronger for it, and we did. 
In 2020, we added over 10 million members, representing growth of 67%. We delivered full year revenue of $111 billion, representing 49% growth and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5, up 13% over the prior year. Importantly, we continue to invest and the foundational strength of our enterprise and create long-term pathways for growth. 
Turning now to 2021. While we continue to operate in a pandemic environment, we intend to demonstrate the same transparency and agility we did during this past year. On last night, we filed an 8-K announcing that the Board has authorized up to $1 billion of stock repurchase. This includes the unspent portion of the previous authorizations. Our capital deployment priorities include providing new subsidiaries, such as Oklahoma, with risk-based capital, reducing debt to further enhance our bond ratings and facilitating value creation through M&A. The repurchase will be done under a 10b5 with accretion being the key criteria. 
Our 2020 financial guidance now includes PANTHERx. 1 month into the first quarter, our view of 2021 remains largely consistent with what we shared at our December Investor Day. And we are reiterating our adjusted EPS guidance of $5 to $5.30. We are not changing our EPS guidance at this time. But in the spirit of our continued commitment to transparency, we want to provide the head and tailwinds impacting our operational landscape. Among the key potential headwinds, additional state rate actions due to COVID related reductions in utilization. Beyond the $400 million, we've already incorporated. We will remind you that CMS has not approved the previously submitted rate actions. However, as we have said, we have built them into our guidance and cash flows. And CMS maintains that rate actions must be actuarially sound. The potential for higher-than-anticipated overall COVID related costs is the second headwind; and third, a Medicare physician fee schedule update. 
Continued membership growth, talking about the tailwinds, continued membership growth as a result of the extension of the Medicaid redetermination suspension. I will note that CMS has indicated they will likely extend the public health emergency through the end of the year. Lower utilization trends in the first half of the year beyond our current projections is another tailwind. Further, the potential for a meaningful increase to the FMAP, which is unlikely to be in the COVID bill but will be part of subsequent reconciliation bills. And the marketplace special enrollment period beginning next week. We anticipate the impact of the fee schedule to be approximately $200 million, which is expected to be largely offset by the redetermination tailwind. The other head and tailwinds are difficult to quantify with certainty at this point in time. But taken together, we expect they will tend or trend to the positive. 
And with a new administration in place, the government's approach to additional pandemic measures may change, and we may see a more supportive environment for expansion of care. Was 1 month under our belt, much remains in motion, and any attempt to update guidance with lack precision. We anticipate being in a better position and that it would be more appropriate position to update our guidance at our first quarter earnings call. 
During 2021, we intend to further leverage the foundation that we have established in recent years and has set the stage for our next decade of growth and value creation, which will be measured by increasing margins. We will continue to drive growth from our position as a leader in government-sponsored health care through product and geographic expansion. We are pleased to have been selected for 2 statewide managed care contracts in Oklahoma, including a sole source contract in prostate care, both of which the state expects to start in October. 
In addition, we expect continued growth in our Medicare as we leverage our national scale. We have established in this business over the long-term and short to medium term. We expect to deliver above-market growth with significant additional opportunities for value creation. To meet our margin expectations and expansion objectives, and ensure organizational efficiency, we are also focusing on leveraging our size and scale to unlock the value inherent across our broader whole health platform. To that end, we have today announced an organizational restructuring initiative. That will include a reduction in workforce of approximately 3,000 employees and the elimination of 1,500 open positions. Overall, this represents a workforce reduction of roughly 6%. Please note that the elimination of the 1,500 positions was accounted for at our December Investor Day. 
The reductions are primarily in areas where we have significant overlap from acquisitions and where we have opportunities to leverage our size and scale for increased efficiency. Importantly, we remain focused on innovation, growth and agility, and we are continuing to invest in people and systems that align with key areas of growth for the company. 
As we look out over the next decade, we will continue to lead the industry by providing the highest level of care at the lowest cost to meet the evolving needs of our members, especially those with complex care requirements. We are transforming our health care model and making material advancements in our technology capabilities. Behavioral health is 1 of the most underserved areas in the population today. And through the planned addition of Magellan, we are investing in our specialty care capabilities while also focusing on improved integration of behavioral and physical health, resulting in better patient outcomes at lower costs. 
I'm pleased to note that we are making strong progress on the regulatory process for the Magellan acquisition and filed all the required form as within days of announcing the deal. We have also filed necessary papers for Hart-Scott-Rodino approval with the Department of Justice. 
Another area of focus is pharmacy, which represents a large and significant market opportunity. Our growing specialty pharmacy platform will provide enhanced insight into the specialty pharma pipeline, clinical requirements and cost management opportunities. Importantly, it will also drive additional opportunities for patient engagement, better adherence rates and ultimately, improved outcomes. We're also cementing the organizational structure of our health care enterprise platform, which is creating an environment to foster the revolutionary change that is overdue in our health care system. For example, Apixio and Interpreta are collaborating on a comprehensive predictive infrastructure that will serve as a foundation for future innovation. All of this, combined with our performance in 2020, the strength and scale of our diversified health care enterprise and our strong execution provides me and should provide you with great confidence in our outlook and ability to deliver any opportunities ahead. I also want to thank our employees who continue to move this company forward, while always remaining focused on serving our members. And we look forward to welcoming them back into our offices. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff."
26273,699741439,2200338,"Centene Corporation, 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2020 results that were in line with our expectations at Investor Day, reflecting solid execution during an extraordinary year. Fourth quarter revenues w",1317,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2020 results that were in line with our expectations at Investor Day, reflecting solid execution during an extraordinary year. Fourth quarter revenues were $28.3 billion, an increase of 50% over the fourth quarter of 2019 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.46 compared to $0.73 last year. 
I will start my comments this morning by providing a more in-depth review of the fourth quarter results, then I will offer an update around our financial outlook for 2021. Our updated guidance now includes PANTHERx, which closed at the end of 2020. 
Now some fourth quarter details. Total revenues grew by $9.4 billion over the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the acquisition of WellCare and growth in the Medicaid and health insurance marketplace business. This growth also includes the impact from the suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2020, partially offset by the divestiture of our Illinois health plan and retroactive state premium rate adjustments and risk-sharing mechanisms. 
Total membership increased to 25.5 million in the quarter, up 67% compared to a year ago. Since the pandemic began in March, we have added a total of 1.7 million Medicaid members, slightly higher than the 1.6 million members anticipated at our Investor Day in December. Our HBR, or health benefits ratio was 88.4% in the fourth quarter, consistent with last year's fourth quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, the HBR benefited from lower medical utilization trends due to the COVID pandemic and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee, offset by retroactive state premium rate adjustments and risk-sharing mechanisms and higher testing and treatment costs associated with COVID, particularly in the marketplace business. Within the marketplace business, we experienced an increase in testing and treatment costs related to COVID, specifically in regions where infection rates sharply increased during December. As a result of the increased COVID costs, our marketplace business performed slightly below our targeted pretax margin range of 5% to 10% for the full year. We expect our marketplace business to return to the targeted margins in 2021, reflecting our continued pricing discipline. 
Through year-end 2020, we have paid approximately $3.6 billion associated with COVID claims. This compares to the $2 billion we discussed on our third quarter call. Our full year figure applies consistent methodology and includes all of the COVID related claims codes consistent with CDC guidelines. Our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 9.7% in the fourth quarter this year compared to 9.5% last year and 8.9% in the third quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase was due to enhanced growth and profitability initiatives for our Medicare and health insurance marketplace business as we reinvested the risk corridor payment that we received in the third quarter. This was partially offset by the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues as a result of the WellCare transaction. 
Cash flow provided by operations was approximately $3 billion in the fourth quarter, impacted by the timing of certain state payments and an increase in payables related to the risk-sharing mechanisms. We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position of $1 billion of unregulated cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. Unregulated cash included approximately $500 million of items that are expected to reverse in early 2021. Debt at quarter end was $16.8 billion, which includes $97 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39%, excluding our nonrecourse debt, compared to 39.1% in the third quarter of 2020. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 37.5% when netting our unregulated cash with our debt at quarter end, which represents a 140 basis point decrease since March. 
As Michael mentioned earlier, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, with focus on funding of organic growth, value creation through M&A and leverage reduction. We will be opportunistic with share repurchases with accretion being the key criteria. Our medical claims liability totaled $12.4 billion at quarter end and represents 51 days in claims payable compared to 52 days in the third quarter of 2020. DCP was impacted by the timing of state directed payments. The WellCare integration continues to be on track, and we remain comfortable with our synergy capture efforts in 2021. While it is still early, we are making excellent progress toward the closure of Magellan. As Michael noted earlier, we have filed all the applicable regulatory approval documents, and we continue to have constructive dialogue around integration planning. 
Turning now to our 2021 expectations. As I mentioned at the beginning of my prepared remarks, we are updating guidance to include the acquisition of PANTHERx, which closed at the end of December 2020. This adjusted 2 of our guidance metrics for 2021 as follows: first, our total revenues increased at the midpoint by $2 billion, which is consistent with what we communicated at our Investor Day. And second, our SG&A ratio decreases by 20 basis points at the midpoint, reflecting Panther's low administrative cost ratio. Additionally, while not part of our formal guidance metrics, the cost of service ratio is expected to increase by approximately 200 basis points driven by PANTHERx being included in service revenue and cost of services. At this point, we have not included the impact of winning the 2 Oklahoma contracts into our guidance. The 2 contracts are estimated to begin October 1, which would potentially add $250 million to our 2021 total revenue. 
For the full year, we now expect our revenue to be within a range of $116.1 billion and $118.1 billion. We continue to expect mid-teens percentage Medicare Advantage enrollment in 2021, this strong growth underscores the rationale for the WellCare transaction as well as the effective integration efforts that have taken place over the last 12 months in the pandemic conditions. Marketplace enrollment results were slightly better than our previous projection. As both retention and effectuation rates were higher than anticipated. We continue to view marketplace as a long-term growth opportunity for Centene, which will drive our product development and positioning with the experience we have gained as the industry leader. 
Additionally, we continue to expect typical utilization to remain below the historical baseline during the first half of 2021, we're turning to normalized levels in the second half of the year. COVID utilization is expected to be elevated during the early part of the year, particularly offsetting the impact of lower traditional utilization. The duration and intensity of higher COVID costs will be impacted by the trajectory of the pandemic and vaccination rates. 
Finally, we have lowered our GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.14 at the midpoint. This is due to the inclusion of the estimated intangible amortization of PANTHERx and an additional charge related to the workforce reduction Michael previously mentioned. We intend to invest these savings into important growth and strategic initiatives, including investment for the upcoming special enrollment period as well as automation and technology development and incremental start-up costs associated with the Oklahoma contract. Taking all of these factors into account, our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at $5 to $5.30. As Michael highlighted, there are various potential headwinds and tailwinds for 2021 that we have not included in our guidance today as many of the items remain uncertain and difficult to quantify. Utilization and COVID expenses, in particular, are highly dependent on the trajectory of the pandemic, and we'll continue to provide investors with timely updates. 
I'll close by reiterating our confidence and the strength of our business, we're pleased with the significant growth we achieved in 2020. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we believe we have ample liquidity to meet our operational and strategic needs. We remain focused on executing against our strategic plans and are committed to delivering shareholder value. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Michael."

You have to remember in the marketplace business, over 90% of that population are adults, whereas in the Medicaid side, it's -- there's a lot of kids in there. So it was more acute in the marketplace, and it pulled us down right below our 5% to 10% range at the end of the year."

Now I'll just give you some details on that $1 billion. A piece of that was New York. We had an estimate in for New York, but we didn't have any details on it. We got those details in January.

But I don't believe we've really leveraged our scale and size, and it's something we've been talking about senior staff about. We've been making material investments in systems that really help improve the efficiency. So this -- and right now, very candidate, is a demand for health care employees and workers. So considering the -- taking this action, we're doing at a time when we believe individuals will be able to find and they're getting lock to support. There's $69 million of severance we built in there for everybody. So we're going to be very supported of that. But this is just the case of an at time now every time we bought some when people would come into old, we just added this, I need 5, 10, 15 more employees. And we've cut back. 
As we looked at it in legal and other areas, we have found that as we've gotten into our scale and size, and we've hired more confident people, we've been able to reduce the numbers. So this is something we've wanted to do for some time. And it reflects in combination with canceled positions, about 6% of our workforce, which we think is material.

We talked about how we just tested in Florida that when something is preauthorized and then the claim comes in, the nurses have to look at it and make sure it was justified. Well, we now have artificial intelligence. But used to take them 18 minutes to look at the claims, can now be done in 3.5 seconds. Now if it's say, no, it's not qualified, then we still want an individual to review it. You don't say no just primarily as we get experience with the AI. But that's the kind of thing that improves the efficiency and service. And that the claim gets paid faster, et cetera. That's where we're headed, and that's why the reduction in force.

Personally and on behalf of the corporation, I am very pleased with the results we delivered in 2020. Early in 2020, we stated that the year would be choppy, and it was. We also told you that Centene would manage through the crisis we face, care for our stakeholders and emerge stronger for it, and we did.
In 2020, we added over 10 million members, representing growth of 67%. We delivered full year revenue of $111 billion, representing 49% growth and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5, up 13% over the prior year. Importantly, we continue to invest in the foundational strength of our enterprise and create long-term pathways for growth.
Turning now to 2021. While we continue to operate in a pandemic environment, we intend to demonstrate the same transparency and agility we did during this past year. Last night, we filed an 8-K announcing that the Board has authorized up to $1 billion of stock repurchase. This includes the unspent portion of the previous authorizations.
Our capital deployment priorities include providing new subsidiaries, such as Oklahoma, with risk-based capital, reducing debt to further enhance our bond ratings and facilitating value creation through M&A. The repurchase will be done under a 10b5 with accretion being the key criteria.
Our 2020 financial guidance now includes PANTHERx. One month into the first quarter, our view of 2021 remains largely consistent with what we shared at our December Investor Day. And we are reiterating our adjusted EPS guidance of $5 to $5.30. We are not changing our EPS guidance at this time. But in the spirit of our continued commitment to transparency, we want to provide the head and tailwinds impacting our operational landscape.
Among the key potential headwinds, additional state rate actions due to COVID-related reductions in utilization beyond the $400 million we've already incorporated. We will remind you that CMS has not approved the previously submitted rate actions. However, as we have said, we have built them into our guidance and cash flows. And CMS maintains that rate actions must be actuarially sound. The potential for higher-than-anticipated overall COVID-related costs is the second headwind; and third, a Medicare physician fee schedule update.
Continued membership growth -- talking about the tailwinds, continued membership growth as a result of the extension of the Medicaid redetermination suspension. I will note that CMS has indicated they will likely extend the public health emergency through the end of the year. Lower utilization trends in the first half of the year beyond our current projections is another tailwind. Further, the potential for a meaningful increase to the FMAP, which is unlikely to be in the COVID bill but will be part of subsequent reconciliation bills. And the Marketplace special enrollment period beginning next week.
We anticipate the impact of the fee schedule to be approximately $200 million, which is expected to be largely offset by the redetermination tailwind. The other head and tailwinds are difficult to quantify with certainty at this point in time. But taken together, we expect they will tend or trend to the positive.
And with a new administration in place, the government's approach to additional pandemic measures may change, and we may see a more supportive environment for expansion of care. With 1 month under our belt, much remains in motion, and any attempt to update guidance would lack precision. We anticipate being in a better position and that it -- we'd be in more appropriate position to update our guidance at our first quarter earnings call.
During 2021, we intend to further leverage the foundation that we have established in recent years and have set the stage for our next decade of growth and value creation, which will be measured by increasing margins. We will continue to drive growth from our position as a leader in government-sponsored health care through product and geographic expansion. We are pleased to have been selected for 2 statewide-managed care contracts in Oklahoma, including a sole source contract in foster care, both of which the state expects to start in October.
In addition, we expect continued growth in our Medicare as we leverage our national scale we have established in this business over the long term and short to medium term. We expect to deliver above-market growth with significant additional opportunities for value creation.
To meet our margin expectations and expansion objectives and ensure organizational efficiency, we are also focusing on leveraging our size and scale to unlock the value inherent across our broader whole health platform. To that end, we have today announced an organizational restructuring initiative. That will include a reduction in workforce of approximately 3,000 employees and the elimination of 1,500 open positions. Overall, this represents a workforce reduction of roughly 6%. Please note that the elimination of the 1,500 positions was accounted for at our December Investor Day.
The reductions are primarily in areas where we have significant overlap from acquisitions and where we have opportunities to leverage our size and scale for increased efficiency. Importantly, we remain focused on innovation, growth and agility. And we are continuing to invest in people and systems that align with key areas of growth for the company.
As we look out over the next decade, we will continue to lead the industry by providing the highest level of care at the lowest cost to meet the evolving needs of our members, especially those with complex care requirements. We are transforming our health care model and making material advancements in our technology capabilities.
Behavioral health is one of the most underserved areas in the population today. And through the planned addition of Magellan, we are investing in our specialty care capabilities while also focusing on improved integration of behavioral and physical health, resulting in better patient outcomes at lower costs.
I'm pleased to note that we are making strong progress on the regulatory process for the Magellan acquisition and filed all the required Form As within days of announcing the deal. We have also filed necessary papers for Hart-Scott-Rodino approval with the Department of Justice.
Another area of focus is pharmacy, which represents a large and significant market opportunity. Our growing specialty pharmacy platform will provide enhanced insight into the specialty pharma pipeline, clinical requirements and cost management opportunities. Importantly, it will also drive additional opportunities for patient engagement, better adherence rates, and ultimately, improved outcomes.
We're also cementing the organizational structure of our health care enterprise platform, which is creating an environment to foster the revolutionary change that is overdue in our health care system. For example, Apixio and Interpreta are collaborating on a comprehensive predictive infrastructure that will serve as a foundation for future innovation. All of this, combined with our performance in 2020, the strength and scale of our diversified health care enterprise and our strong execution provides me and should provide you with great confidence in our outlook and ability to deliver on the opportunities ahead.
I also want to thank our employees who continue to move this company forward, while always remaining focused on serving our members. And we look forward to welcoming them back into our offices.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff."
26273,699741439,2200684,"Centene Corporation, 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2020 results that were in line with our expectations at Investor Day, reflecting solid execution during an extraordinary year. Fourth quarter revenues w",1318,"Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2020 results that were in line with our expectations at Investor Day, reflecting solid execution during an extraordinary year. Fourth quarter revenues were $28.3 billion, an increase of 50% over the fourth quarter of 2019; and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.46 compared to $0.73 last year.
I will start my comments this morning by providing a more in-depth review of the fourth quarter results, then I will offer an update around our financial outlook for 2021. Our updated guidance now includes PANTHERx, which closed at the end of 2020.
Now some fourth quarter details. Total revenues grew by $9.4 billion over the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the acquisition of WellCare and growth in the Medicaid and Health Insurance Marketplace business. This growth also includes the impact from the suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2020, partially offset by the divestiture of our Illinois health plan and retroactive state premium rate adjustments and risk-sharing mechanisms.
Total membership increased to 25.5 million in the quarter, up 67% compared to a year ago. Since the pandemic began in March, we have added a total of 1.7 million Medicaid members, slightly higher than the 1.6 million members anticipated at our Investor Day in December.
Our HBR, or health benefits ratio, was 88.4% in the fourth quarter, consistent with last year's fourth quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, the HBR benefited from lower medical utilization trends due to the COVID pandemic and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee, offset by retroactive state premium rate adjustments and risk-sharing mechanisms and higher testing and treatment costs associated with COVID, particularly in the Marketplace business.
Within the Marketplace business, we experienced an increase in testing and treatment costs related to COVID, specifically in regions where infection rates sharply increased during December. As a result of the increased COVID costs, our Marketplace business performed slightly below our targeted pretax margin range of 5% to 10% for the full year. We expect our Marketplace business to return to the targeted margins in 2021, reflecting our continued pricing discipline.
Through year-end 2020, we have paid approximately $3.6 billion associated with COVID claims. This compares to the $2 billion we discussed on our third quarter call. Our full year figure applies consistent methodology and includes all of the COVID-related claims codes consistent with CDC guidelines.
Our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 9.7% in the fourth quarter this year compared to 9.5% last year and 8.9% in the third quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase was due to enhanced growth and profitability initiatives for our Medicare and Health Insurance Marketplace business as we reinvested the risk corridor payment we received in the third quarter. This was partially offset by the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues as a result of the WellCare transaction.
Cash flow provided by operations was approximately $3 billion in the fourth quarter, impacted by the timing of certain state payments and an increase in payables related to the risk-sharing mechanisms. We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position of $1 billion of unregulated cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. Unregulated cash included approximately $500 million of items that are expected to reverse in early 2021.
Debt at quarter end was $16.8 billion, which includes $97 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39%, excluding our nonrecourse debt, compared to 39.1% in the third quarter of 2020. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 37.5% when netting our unregulated cash with our debt at quarter end, which represents a 140 basis point decrease since March.
As Michael mentioned earlier, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, with focus on funding of organic growth, value creation through M&A and leverage reduction. We will be opportunistic with share repurchases with accretion being the key criteria.
Our medical claims liability totaled $12.4 billion at quarter end and represents 51 days in claims payable compared to 52 days in the third quarter of 2020. DCP was impacted by the timing of state-directed payments.
The WellCare integration continues to be on track, and we remain comfortable with our synergy capture efforts in 2021. While it is still early, we are making excellent progress toward the closure of Magellan. As Michael noted earlier, we have filed all the applicable regulatory approval documents, and we continue to have constructive dialogue around integration planning.
Turning now to our 2021 expectations. As I mentioned at the beginning of my prepared remarks, we are updating guidance to include the acquisition of PANTHERx, which closed at the end of December 2020. This adjusted two of our guidance metrics for 2021 as follows: first, our total revenues increased at the midpoint by $2 billion, which is consistent with what we communicated at our Investor Day. And second, our SG&A ratio decreases by 20 basis points at the midpoint, reflecting Panther's (sic) [ PANTHERx's ] low administrative cost ratio.
Additionally, while not part of our formal guidance metrics, the cost of service ratio is expected to increase by approximately 200 basis points, driven by PANTHERx being included in service revenue and cost of services. At this point, we have not included the impact of winning the 2 Oklahoma contracts into our guidance. The 2 contracts are estimated to begin October 1, which would potentially add $250 million to our 2021 total revenue.
For the full year, we now expect our revenue to be within a range of $116.1 billion and $118.1 billion. We continue to expect mid-teens percentage Medicare Advantage enrollment in 2021. This strong growth underscores the rationale for the WellCare transaction as well as the effective integration efforts that have taken place over the last 12 months in the pandemic conditions.
Marketplace enrollment results were slightly better than our previous projection as both retention and effectuation rates were higher than anticipated. We continue to view Marketplace as a long-term growth opportunity for Centene, which will drive our product development and positioning with the experience we have gained as the industry leader.
Additionally, we continue to expect typical utilization to remain below the historical baseline during the first half of 2021. We're turning to normalized levels in the second half of the year. COVID utilization is expected to be elevated during the early part of the year, particularly offsetting the impact of lower traditional utilization. The duration and intensity of higher COVID costs will be impacted by the trajectory of the pandemic and vaccination rates.
Finally, we have lowered our GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.14 at the midpoint. This is due to the inclusion of the estimated intangible amortization of PANTHERx and an additional charge related to the workforce reduction Michael previously mentioned. We intend to invest these savings into important growth and strategic initiatives, including investment for the upcoming special enrollment period as well as automation and technology development and incremental start-up costs associated with the Oklahoma contract.
Taking all of these factors into account, our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at $5 to $5.30. As Michael highlighted, there are various potential headwinds and tailwinds for 2021 that we have not included in our guidance today as many of the items remain uncertain and difficult to quantify. Utilization and COVID expenses, in particular, are highly dependent on the trajectory of the pandemic, and we'll continue to provide investors with timely updates.
I'll close by reiterating our confidence and the strength of our business. We're pleased with the significant growth we achieved in 2020. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we believe we have ample liquidity to meet our operational and strategic needs. We remain focused on executing against our strategic plans and are committed to delivering shareholder value.
With that, I will now turn it back to Michael."

I mean there's 9 million people that they estimate that are uninsured. And we want to remind you that it's not all Marketplace. A lot of these individuals will qualify for Medicaid.

The FMAP gives the states the funding they need to cover those employees, which is an additional positive as well as adding additional SSI and other coverages that we've seen states doing.

As it relates to the total platform, we're going to be adding significant assets through the Magellan acquisition. We have various platforms out there.

But it's -- we see it as very positive. We have -- I know we're purchasing prior to this over $30 billion a year in pharmaceuticals, working with various platforms and pull it all together. So it's a long-winded answer, but it's -- to give you as much transparency, and it's a great opportunity. And Drew is working through and will determine how best to capitalize on.

But when you look at the year we came off of, before, I think, it was 59% or some significant number, I don't think I'll have -- we'll see that next year, but who knows? And I say that tongue in cheek.
But the restructuring, it's been a hobby horse of ours for some time. And we've done these acquisitions. And they're very effective, and they're accretive. But I don't believe we've really leveraged our scale and size, and it's something we've been talking to our senior staff about. We've been making material investments in systems that really help improve the efficiency. So this -- and right now, the very candidate is the demand for health care employees and workers.
So in -- considering the -- taking this action, we're doing it at a time when we believe individuals will be able to find, and they're getting lots of support. There's $69 million of severance we built in there for everybody. So we're going to be very supportive of that. But this is just the case of, say, at a time now. Every time, we brought some, people would come in and say, we just added this, I need 5, 10, 15 more employees. And we've cut back.
As we looked at it in legal and other areas, we have found that as we've gotten into our scale and size and we've hired more confident people, we've been able to reduce the numbers. So this is something we've wanted to do for some time. And it reflects, in combination with canceled positions, about 6% of our workforce, which we think is material. And a lot of it is going to be improved technology that could be going to give us -- I gave an example. I know I'm getting long-winded, but I want to give you an example.
We talked about how we just tested in Florida that when something is preauthorized and then the claim comes in, the nurses have to look at it and make sure it was justified. Well, we now have artificial intelligence. What used to take them 18 minutes to look at a claim, can now be done in 3.5 seconds. Now if it's a -- no, it's not qualified, then we want -- we still want an individual to review it. You don't say no just primarily -- as we get experience with the AI. But that's the kind of thing that improves the efficiency and service and that the claim gets paid faster, et cetera. That's where we're headed, and that's why the reduction in force.

I think -- and I'm not saying it's going to be billions and billions, but the point is, I think, we're going to see behavioral health grow.

Good morning, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter Earnings Call. Today, on the call today, I will review our first quarter performance, provide an update on our markets and products and discuss how we are positioned to sustain our momentum in the ongoing pandemic environment. While we have made great progress in working our way out of pandemic, nationally, as we have seen recently, it is not yet over. We are off to a strong start in 2021, with solid revenue and earnings growth. It was a good quarter. Our teams continue to execute well, generating revenue of $30 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Membership was $25.1 million at the quarter end. This represents an increase of $1.3 million compared to the year ago quarter. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.63 compared to $0.86 in the prior year quarter, representing an increase of 90%. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and the trajectory of our business. And today, we are updating our full year guidance. This is primarily driven by several tailwinds. These include first, continued Medicaid membership growth, amid suspended eligibility redeterminations. Our current guidance anticipates the suspension continuing to at least August 1 based on the fact that is renewed 90 days at a time. 
Second, the marketplace special enrollment period, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. And third, the hold on the Medicare sequestration. Our results to date also reflect a decrease in normal utilization, offset by COVID-19 expenses and stake recoupment of premiums, which Jeff will provide additional detail on shortly. As we have done throughout pandemic, we continue to monitor the headwinds and tailwinds we anticipate will impact our operating landscape for the remainder of the year and possibly into 2022. Consistent with past quarters, I will provide you with updates based on the facts as we know them today. When taken together, we believe the essence of these factors to be positive. Anticipated tailwinds include continued lower than normal utilization. 
Overall, the first quarter was lower compared to the prior quarter. Although we saw an increase in non-COVID utilization in our marketplace business. While the trajectory of utilization depends on the pandemic and remains uncertain. We continue to expect utilization to come in below historical averages during the second quarter, with the potential for some normalization starting to occur in the second half of the year. Other key possible tailwinds we see include: potential for continued growth resulting in higher-than-anticipated membership in our marketplace business from the special enrollment period. And a probable extension of the Medicaid eligibility redetermination suspension beyond August and through the end of the year, possibly into the beginning of 2022. 
As a potential headwind, we continue to monitor additional state rate adjustments. For 2021, we anticipate a $550 million revenue impact of state revenue actions and rate actions. Jeff will provide some additional color on this shortly. But I will share that we have seen only 1 action in the first quarter of the year. And we are not currently aware of any additional planned adjustments or quarters. In fact, some quarters may we believe may be allowed to expire. To reiterate, overall, as we see them today, we believe these factors balance in our favor. As we conclude the first quarter of 2021, we are pleased with our ability to drive significant growth and our updated guidance reflects the strength of our business through the year. 
We also remain vigilant that this is a year with unique drivers, including the suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and the marketplace special enrollment period, which we cannot be certain will continue throughout all of 2022. Consistent with prior years, at our June Investor Day, we will provide an update on these factors in 2022. We recognize a lot of factors as we see them today, balance to the positive, the outlook remains fluid and dependent on the prevalent policy landscape. 
The strength of our diversified business is apparent across our product portfolio. In our Medicaid business, we continue to participate in an active RFP pipeline. We successfully renewed our contract in Hawaii at the end of March. And North Carolina and Oklahoma both remain on track to go live later this year. For 2021, we continue to expect a composite rate adjustment of 1.7%, consistent with our initial guidance. Our Medicare business delivered continued growth. Medicare grew by over $1 billion year-over-year in the first quarter, representing growth of 41% and demonstrating the strength of the platform and our ability to leverage our national scale going forward. In our marketplace business, we are pleased to be operating in a supportive environment. 
The administration continues to invest in the product. And just last week, announced an additional $80 million for navigators to boost enrollment. Based on data released by CMS, Centene is a clear leader in new enrollment on the federal exchange. And since the beginning of the year, we have enrolled over 320,000 new members in our market case product. We believe these results demonstrate the strength of our strategy to provide consistent quality care and not to participate in a price-related race to the bottom with narrow network coverage. I will remind you that now networks often encourage out-of-network utilization, which tends to be uncontrolled and expensive. We see opportunity to further grow with the enhanced advanced premium tax credits that took effect April 1. The impact of which we believe will encourage consumers to prioritize quality, consistent consistency and experience over premium loan. Moving ahead, we intend to maintain and consider building additional products around this strategy. 
On the technology front, we're making meaningful progress to advance our capabilities to provide high-quality integrated care for our members. We look forward to providing you more details on our unique technology strategy at our investors than in June. We continue to advance towards the completion of the Magellan Health acquisition and remain on track to close the transaction early in the second half of 2021. The Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period expired in mid-March, and we're working diligently towards obtaining the necessary state approvals. Our integration planning efforts are in full swing, and we are enthusiastic about the combination, which will enable us to expand access to special care and nurture -- to specialty care and nurture a fully integrated model across behavioral and physical health. I will remind you that Magellan will be part of our health care enterprise portfolio, which will allow them to maintain independent and serve third-party customers. I would like to take a moment to comment on the situation in Ohio. We are still an active RFP process where we finished second out of 11 bidders. According to a scoring summary released by the Ohio Department of Medicaid. Regarding the legal and regulatory landscape, Centene has been clear that we maintain the claims to be unfounded. For additional information about our position on this matter, I want to direct you to our website for links to our court filings. 
We look forward to answering any questions from our governmental partners regarding this issue and remain committed to the highest levels of quality and transparency and how we serve our state partners. 
Before I close, I'd like to talk about Centene's role in COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Over the past few months, our data and care management teams. Have worked tirelessly to identify members at the highest list for COVID-19 and provide those individuals with personalized and culturally sensitive outreach. In addition, we have partnered with Lyft to support individuals with transportation to vaccine appointments. And with the gold jackets of the pro football Hall fame, with whom we have had an ongoing partnership, we created PSA's focus on increasing awareness about the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines. 
This type of innovative work is happening across the organization, and I want to recognize and thank our employees for their unwavering commitment and dedication. In closing, we started the year strong and look forward to carrying this positive momentum through the remainder of 2021 as we experience a supportive environment in expanding access to care. We continue to see long-term opportunities to drive growth in our top and bottom line and enhance margins as we provide the highest level of care to our members at the lowest cost. I look forward to seeing all of you, albeit virtually at our investor event on June 16. Thank you for your continued interest in Centene. I'll now hand the call over to Jeff."

This morning, we reported first quarter 2021 results and what was a good start to the year. First quarter revenues were $30 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the first quarter of 2020, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.63 compared to $0.86 last year. As a result of the strong first quarter performance, we increased our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 per share to a range of $5.05 to $5.35. I will provide further comments related to our updated financial guidance shortly. 
First, let me provide additional details for the first quarter. Total revenues grew by $4 billion over the first quarter of 2020 due to a full quarter of contribution from WellCare and the ongoing suspension of Medicaid Eligibility Redeterminations partially offset by an overall decrease in marketplace membership, state rate and risk-sharing actions and the repeal of the health insurer fee in 2021. Our marketplace membership decline in the quarter was less significant than previously expected as a result of membership gains achieved during the special enrollment period. 
Total membership increased to 25.1 million in the quarter, up 5% compared to a year ago. Since the pandemic began in March of 2020, we have added a total of 2 million Medicaid members. Our HBR was 86.8% in the first quarter compared to 88% in the first quarter of 2020. The HBR benefited from lower overall medical utilization trends due to COVID pandemic and lower costs associated with the flu. This was partially offset by COVID related costs, state risk-sharing mechanisms and higher COVID and traditional utilization in the marketplace business. 
Our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 8.1% in the first quarter this year compared to 8.6% last year and 9.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The adjusted SG&A expense ratio benefited from the ongoing suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues due to recent acquisitions. Cash flow provided by operations was $43 million in the first quarter. The lower operating cash flow for the quarter was primarily driven by a delay in premium payments of $910 million from the state of New York due to the end of their fiscal year, which was collected in April. 
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position of $369 million of unregulated cash on our balance sheet at quarter end, debt at quarter end was $16.8 billion, which includes $152 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38.5%, excluding our nonrecourse debt, compared to 39% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38% when netting our unregulated cash with our debt at quarter end, which represents a 90 basis point decrease since March of 2020. 
Our medical claims liability totaled $12.8 billion at quarter end and represents 49 days in claims payable compared to 51 days in the fourth quarter of 2020. DCP was impacted by the timing of medical and pharmacy claim payments. We are making excellent progress toward the closure of Magellan, and we remain comfortable with our previously communicated accretion targets. Over the last several months, we have gained increased visibility into a number of important factors and have included those items in our updated 2021 financial guidance. These factors specifically include the ongoing suspension of Medicaid Eligibility Redeterminations through August 1. The delay in the California pharmacy carve out until July 1, and and the delay in the New York pharmacy carve out through year-end 2022. 
The new business win in Oklahoma with an assumed go-live date of October 1, expected marketplace membership gains through the special enrollment period, Medicare membership fee schedule increase and sequestration delay and updated expectations of state rate and risk-sharing mechanisms. These changes increased our total revenue guidance for the year by $4 billion at the midpoint to be within a range of $120.1 million and $122.1 billion. 
Our HBR guidance increased by 50 basis points at the midpoint due to the mix of items such as the Medicare fee schedule, increased state risk-sharing mechanisms and Medicaid growth, which all carry a higher HBR. Taken all together, this has an overall neutral effect to earnings, and the dynamics are consistent with the headwinds and tailwinds we provided on our fourth quarter earnings call. Additionally, as I highlighted earlier, we have increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the full year at the midpoint by $0.05, reflecting our strong first quarter performance. Let me highlight some more details on some of these items. We now expect Medicare Advantage enrollment growth to exceed 20% in 2021. This strong growth demonstrates the value of the WellCare acquisition provides positive momentum for the organization to build off of as we formulate our bids for Medicare Advantage in 2022. 
As Michael mentioned, marketplace enrollment expectations for 2021 are better than our previous estimates. As the special enrollment period provides Centene with an opportunity to reach many more eligible consumers. This strong growth demonstrates our organizational commitment to leadership in this product. We continue to view marketplace as a long-term growth opportunity for Centene. We have increased our estimate for state rate and risk-sharing mechanisms from our previous guidance to $550 million for 2021. 
In the first quarter, the state of New York implemented a risk corridor retroactive to April 1, 2020, that increased our payback by $40 million. At this time, we are not aware of any new corridors or retroactive rates and the increase in our full year estimate reflects the performance of risk mitigation programs enacted last year. 
As Michael noted, we continue to monitor utilization. During the first quarter, we saw overall utilization that continues to be below the historical baseline and also slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2020. The COVID inpatient admissions and costs peaked in January and decreased throughout the quarter. We continue to see a diverging pattern of COVID and non-COVID utilization. The updated financial guidance reflects typical utilization that remains below the historical baseline during the first half of 2021, continuing to trend to normalized levels by the end of the year. COVID utilization, including testing and treatment costs, are expected to partially offset the impact of lower traditional utilization. The duration and intensity of higher COVID costs will be impacted by the trajectory of the pandemic and vaccination rates. 
Finally, as Michael discussed, we continue to monitor some additional factors that are not in our updated guidance today. They include the potential for the additional SEP membership gains in marketplace above our expectations driven by the enhanced advanced premium tax credits. The potential for Medicaid Redeterminations to be extended beyond August 1, any additional state rate and risk-sharing actions and the uncertainty associated with both COVID and traditional medical utilization for the remainder of the year. We believe these additional factors represent a net tailwind to the company for the remainder of 2021. The seasonality of our earnings remains unchanged with approximately 60% in the first half of the year. 
I'll close by reiterating our confidence in the strength of our business, our balance sheet remains strong, and we believe we have ample liquidity to meet our operational and strategic needs. We remain focused on executing against our strategic plans and are committed to delivering shareholder value. That concludes my remarks and operator, you may now open the line for questions."

We'll give you more guidance in June at our Investor Day, which is our practice, particularly on the top line. These are unusual years. We think that the redetermination will continue throughout the balance of the year, but we'll report a quarter -- 90 days at a time as the federal government does it. And that's in the interest of being reasonably conservative. So we're being cautious there. 
Marketplace, where we've demonstrated this past quarter with the growth that we've had that we are the leader in the field and are in a very strong position to continue that growth. And we're going to continue it through the balance of this year as we see it. And we see some upside there. I think what's also important as it relates to the redetermination. 
If they do drop off the redetermination, people who maybe lose Medicaid coverage could pick up the marketplace because once again, the cost structure is such with the tax allowances that they can do that without any cause. And so I think we're going to see -- I'm hearing a bird somewhere in the background. I'm hearing. So I think we will see growth continue. But as we said, governmental policies do have something to play, and it is a fluid situation, and we work very well both sides as we've talked about in the past. We're working with them now in various policies and approaches. 
And as that unfolds, I think, between now and June, I hope to have more insight than we do as to what it will mean for the balance of this year and going into 2022. The essence is positive."

So I would say nothing unusual on the development front from our perspective, which is, I think we've had a consistent practice over a long number of years. 
On the marketplace business, on the cost side, what we did see was just a little bit higher inpatient authorizations on COVID, specifically in January. And then a little higher non-inpatient, really just compared to our expectations. So it doesn't really change the margin profile for the year.

Good morning, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter Earnings Call. On today -- on the call today, I will review our first quarter performance, provide an update on our markets and products and discuss how we are position",1433,"Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter Earnings Call. 
On today -- on the call today, I will review our first quarter performance, provide an update on our markets and products and discuss how we are positioned to sustain our momentum in the ongoing pandemic environment. While we have made great progress in working our way out of the pandemic, nationally, as we have seen recently, it is not yet over. 
We are off to a strong start in 2021, with solid revenue and earnings growth. It was a good quarter. Our teams continue to execute well, generating revenue of $30 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Membership was 25.1 million at the quarter end. This represents an increase of 1.3 million compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.63 compared to $0.86 in the prior year quarter, representing an increase of 90%. 
Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and the trajectory of our business. And today, we are updating our full year guidance. This is primarily driven by several tailwinds. These include: first, continued Medicaid membership growth amid suspended eligibility redeterminations. Our current guidance anticipates the suspension continuing to at least August 1 based on the fact that it is renewed 90 days at a time. Second, the marketplace special enrollment period, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. And third, the hold on the Medicare sequestration. 
Our results to date also reflect a decrease in normal utilization, offset by COVID-19 expenses and state recoupment of premiums, which Jeff will provide additional detail on shortly. 
As we have done throughout pandemic, we continue to monitor the headwinds and tailwinds we anticipate will impact our operating landscapes for the remainder of the year and possibly into 2022. Consistent with past quarters, I will provide you with updates based on the facts as we know them today. When taken together, we believe the essence of these factors to be positive. Anticipated tailwinds include: continued lower than normal utilization. Overall, the first quarter was lower compared to the prior quarter. Although we saw an increase in non-COVID utilization in our marketplace business. While the trajectory of utilization depends on the pandemic and remains uncertain, we continue to expect utilization to come in below historical averages during the second quarter with the potential for some normalization starting to occur in the second half of the year. 
Other key possible tailwinds we see include: potential for continued growth resulting in higher-than-anticipated membership in our marketplace business from the special enrollment period; and a probable extension of the Medicaid eligibility redetermination suspension beyond August and through the end of the year, possibly into the beginning of 2022.  
As a potential headwind, we continue to monitor additional state rate adjustments. For 2021, we anticipate a $550 million revenue impact of state revenue actions and rate actions. Jeff will provide some additional color on this shortly. But I will share that we have seen only one action in the first quarter of the year. And we are not currently aware of any additional planned adjustments or quarters. In fact, some quarters, we believe, may be allowed to expire. To reiterate, overall, as we see them today, we believe these factors balance in our favor. 
As we conclude the first quarter of 2021, we are pleased with our ability to drive significant growth and our updated guidance reflects the strength of our business through the year.  
We also remain vigilant that this is a year with unique drivers, including the suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and the marketplace special enrollment period, which we cannot be certain will continue throughout all of 2022. Consistent with prior years, at our June Investor Day, we will provide an update on these factors and 2022. We recognize a lot of factors, as we see them today, balance to the positive, the outlook remains fluid and dependent on the prevalent policy landscape.  
The strength of our diversified business is apparent across our product portfolio. In our Medicaid business, we continue to participate in an active RFP pipeline. We successfully renewed our contract in Hawaii at the end of March. And North Carolina and Oklahoma both remain on track to go live later this year. For 2021, we continue to expect a composite rate adjustment of 1.7%, consistent with our initial guidance. 
Our Medicare business delivered continued growth. Medicare grew by over $1 billion year-over-year in the first quarter, representing growth of 41% and demonstrating the strength of the platform and our ability to leverage our national scale going forward. 
In our Marketplace business, we are pleased to be operating in a supportive environment. The administration continues to invest in the product and just last week, announced an additional $80 million for navigators to boost enrollment.  Based on data released by CMS, Centene is a clear leader in new enrollment on the federal exchange. And since the beginning of the year, we have enrolled over 320,000 new members in our Marketplace product. We believe these results demonstrate the strength of our strategy to provide consistent quality care and not to participate in a price-related race to the bottom with narrow network coverage. I will remind you that narrow networks often encourage out-of-network utilization, which tends to be uncontrolled and expensive. 
We see opportunity to further grow with the enhanced advanced premium tax credits that took effect April 1, the impact of which, we believe, will encourage consumers to prioritize quality, consistency and experience over premium [ growth ]. Moving ahead, we intend to maintain and consider building additional products around this strategy.  
On the technology front, we're making meaningful progress to advance our capabilities to provide high-quality integrated care for our members. We look forward to providing you more details on our unique technology strategy at our Investors event in June. 
We continued to advance towards the completion of the Magellan Health acquisition and remain on track to close the transaction early in the second half of 2021. The Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period expired in mid-March, and we're working diligently towards obtaining the necessary state approvals. Our integration and planning efforts are in full swing, and we are enthusiastic about the combination, which will enable us to expand access to special care and nurture -- to specialty care and nurture a fully integrated model across behavioral and physical health. 
I will remind you that Magellan will be part of our Health Care Enterprise portfolio, which will allow them to maintain independence and serve third-party customers. 
I would like to take a moment to comment on the situation in Ohio. We are still an active RFP process, where we finished second out of 11 bidders, according to a scoring summary released by the Ohio Department of Medicaid. Regarding the legal and regulatory landscape, Centene has been clear that we maintain these claims to be unfounded. For additional information about our position on this matter, I will direct you to our website for links to our court filings.  
We look forward to answering any questions from our governmental partners regarding this issue and remain committed to the highest levels of quality and transparency in how we serve our state partners.  
Before I close, I'd like to talk about Centene's role in COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Over the past few months, our data and care management teams have worked tirelessly to identify members at the highest list for COVID-19 and provide those individuals with personalized and culturally sensitive outreach. In addition, we have partnered with Lyft to support individuals with transportation to vaccine appointments. And with the Gold Jackets of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, with whom we have had an ongoing partnership, we created PSA's focus on increasing awareness about the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines.  
This type of innovative work is happening across the organization, and I want to recognize and thank our employees for their unwavering commitment and dedication. 
In closing, we started the year strong and look forward to carrying this positive momentum through the remainder of 2021 as we experience a supportive environment in expanding access to care. We continue to see long-term opportunities to drive growth in our top and bottom line and enhance margins as we provide the highest level of care to our members at the lowest cost. 
I look forward to seeing all of you, albeit virtually, at our Investor event on June 16. Thank you for your continued interest in Centene. I'll now hand the call over to Jeff."

This morning, we reported first quarter 2021 results in what was a good start to the year. First quarter revenues were $30 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the first quarter of 2020, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.63 compared to $0.86 last year. 
As a result of the strong first quarter performance, we increased our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 per share to a range of $5.05 to $5.35. I will provide further comments related to our updated financial guidance shortly.  
First, let me provide additional details for the first quarter. Total revenues grew by $4 billion over the first quarter of 2020 due to a full quarter of contribution from WellCare and the ongoing suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations partially offset by an overall decrease in marketplace membership, state rate and risk-sharing actions and the repeal of the health insurer fee in 2021. Our marketplace membership decline in the quarter was less significant than previously expected as a result of membership gains achieved during the special enrollment period.  
Total membership increased to 25.1 million in the quarter, up 5% compared to a year ago. Since the pandemic began in March of 2020, we have added a total of 2 million Medicaid members. Our HBR was 86.8% in the first quarter compared to 88% in the first quarter of 2020. The HBR benefited from lower overall medical utilization trends due to COVID pandemic and lower costs associated with the flu. This was partially offset by COVID-related costs, state risk-sharing mechanisms and higher COVID and traditional utilization in the marketplace business.  
Our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 8.1% in the first quarter this year compared to 8.6% last year and 9.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The adjusted SG&A expense ratio benefited from the ongoing suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues due to recent acquisitions. 
Cash flow provided by operations was $43 million in the first quarter. The lower operating cash flow for the quarter was primarily driven by a delay in premium payments of $910 million from the state of New York due to the end of their fiscal year, which was collected in April.  
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position of $369 million of unregulated cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. Debt at quarter end was $16.8 billion, which includes $152 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38.5%, excluding our nonrecourse debt, compared to 39% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38% when netting our unregulated cash with our debt at quarter end, which represents a 90 basis point decrease since March of 2020.  
Our medical claims liability totaled $12.8 billion at quarter end and represents 49 days in claims payable compared to 51 days in the fourth quarter of 2020. DCP was impacted by the timing of medical and pharmacy claim payments. 
We are making excellent progress toward the closure of Magellan, and we remain comfortable with our previously communicated accretion targets. 
Over the last several months, we have gained increased visibility into a number of important factors and have included those items in our updated 2021 financial guidance. These factors specifically include: the ongoing suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations through August 1; the delay in the California pharmacy carve-out until July 1; and the delay in the New York pharmacy carve-out through year-end 2022; the new business win in Oklahoma with an assumed go-live date of October 1; expected marketplace membership gains through the special enrollment period; Medicare membership, fee schedule increase and sequestration delay; and updated expectations of state rate and risk-sharing mechanisms. These changes increased our total revenue guidance for the year by $4 billion at the midpoint to be within a range of $120.1 million and $122.1 billion.  
Our HBR guidance increased by 50 basis points at the midpoint due to the mix of items such as the Medicare fee schedule, increased state risk-sharing mechanisms and Medicaid growth, which all carry a higher HBR. Taken all together, this has an overall neutral effect to earnings, and the dynamics are consistent with the headwinds and tailwinds we provided on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
Additionally, as I highlighted earlier, we have increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the full year at the midpoint by $0.05, reflecting our strong first quarter performance. 
Let me highlight some more details on some of these items. We now expect Medicare Advantage enrollment growth to exceed 20% in 2021. This strong growth demonstrates the value the WellCare acquisition provides positive momentum for the organization to build off of as we formulate our bids for Medicare Advantage in 2022.  
As Michael mentioned, Marketplace enrollment expectations for 2021 are better than our previous estimates as the special enrollment period provides Centene with an opportunity to reach many more eligible consumers. This strong growth demonstrates our organizational commitment to leadership in this product. We continue to view Marketplace as a long-term growth opportunity for Centene. 
We have increased our estimate for state rate and risk-sharing mechanisms from our previous guidance to $550 million for 2021. In the first quarter, the state of New York implemented a risk corridor retroactive to April 1, 2020 that increased our payback by $40 million. At this time, we are not aware of any new corridors or retroactive rates and the increase in our full year estimate reflects the performance of risk mitigation programs enacted last year.  
As Michael noted, we continue to monitor utilization. During the first quarter, we saw overall utilization that continues to be below the historical baseline and also slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2020. The COVID inpatient admissions and costs peaked in January and decreased throughout the quarter. We continue to see a diverging pattern of COVID and non-COVID utilization. The updated financial guidance reflects typical utilization that remains below the historical baseline during the first half of 2021, continuing to trend to normalized levels by the end of the year. COVID utilization, including testing and treatment costs, are expected to partially offset the impact of lower traditional utilization. The duration and intensity of higher COVID costs will be impacted by the trajectory of the pandemic and vaccination rates.  
Finally, as Michael discussed, we continued to monitor some additional factors that are not in our updated guidance today. They include: the potential for the additional SCP membership gains in Marketplace above our expectations driven by the enhanced advanced premium tax credits; the potential for Medicaid redeterminations to be extended beyond August 1; any additional state rate and risk-sharing actions; and the uncertainty associated with both COVID and traditional medical utilization for the remainder of the year. 
We believe these additional factors represent a net tailwind to the company for the remainder of 2021. The seasonality of our earnings remains unchanged with approximately 60% in the first half of the year.  
I'll close by reiterating our confidence in the strength of our business. Our balance sheet remains strong and we believe we have ample liquidity to meet our operational and strategic needs. We remain focused on executing against our strategic plans and are committed to delivering shareholder value. 
That concludes my remarks and operator, you may now open the line for questions."

My real question is Medicare revenues up 41% in the quarter. I know some of that was anniversarying of WellCare. But MA lives were up 19% sequentially. It sounds like the outlook for the year is closer to 20%. So that's up from previous expectations.

We'll give you more guidance in June at our Investor Day, which is our practice, particularly on the top line. These are unusual years. We think that the redetermination will continue throughout the balance of the year, but we'll report to you a quarter -- 90 days at a time as the federal government does it. And that's in the interest of being reasonably conservative. So we're being cautious there. 
Marketplace, we've demonstrated this past quarter, with the growth that we've had, that we are the leader in the field and are in a very strong position to continue that growth. And we're going to continue it through the balance of this year as we see it. And we see some upside there. 
I think what's also important, as it relates to the redetermination. If they do drop off the redetermination, people who maybe lose Medicaid coverage could pick up the Marketplace because once again, the cost structure is such with the tax allowances that they can do that without any costs. And so I think we're going to see -- I'm hearing a bird somewhere in the background. I'm hearing -- so I think we will see growth continue. But as we said, governmental policies do have something to play, and it is a fluid situation, and we work very well both sides, as we've talked about in the past. We're working with them now into these various policies and approaches. 
And as that unfolds, I think, between now and June, I hope to have more insight than we do as to what it will mean for the balance of this year and going into 2022. The essence is positive."

On the Marketplace business, on the cost side, what we did see was just a little bit higher inpatient authorizations on COVID, specifically in January.

When you're trying to go in against somebody that's a clear leader in the marketplace, which we were in a category, the only way you can hope to try and come in is on price.

Good morning, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter Earnings Call. On today -- on the call today, I will review our first quarter performance, provide an update on our markets and products and discuss how we are position",1433,"Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter Earnings Call. 
On today -- on the call today, I will review our first quarter performance, provide an update on our markets and products and discuss how we are positioned to sustain our momentum in the ongoing pandemic environment. While we have made great progress in working our way out of the pandemic, nationally, as we have seen recently, it is not yet over. 
We are off to a strong start in 2021, with solid revenue and earnings growth. It was a good quarter. Our teams continue to execute well, generating revenue of $30 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Membership was 25.1 million at the quarter end. This represents an increase of 1.3 million compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.63 compared to $0.86 in the prior year quarter, representing an increase of 90%. 
Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and the trajectory of our business. And today, we are updating our full year guidance. This is primarily driven by several tailwinds. These include: first, continued Medicaid membership growth amid suspended eligibility redeterminations. Our current guidance anticipates the suspension continuing to at least August 1 based on the fact that it is renewed 90 days at a time. Second, the marketplace special enrollment period, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. And third, the hold on the Medicare sequestration. 
Our results to date also reflect a decrease in normal utilization, offset by COVID-19 expenses and state recoupment of premiums, which Jeff will provide additional detail on shortly. 
As we have done throughout pandemic, we continue to monitor the headwinds and tailwinds we anticipate will impact our operating landscapes for the remainder of the year and possibly into 2022. Consistent with past quarters, I will provide you with updates based on the facts as we know them today. When taken together, we believe the essence of these factors to be positive. Anticipated tailwinds include: continued lower than normal utilization. Overall, the first quarter was lower compared to the prior quarter. Although we saw an increase in non-COVID utilization in our marketplace business. While the trajectory of utilization depends on the pandemic and remains uncertain, we continue to expect utilization to come in below historical averages during the second quarter with the potential for some normalization starting to occur in the second half of the year. 
Other key possible tailwinds we see include: potential for continued growth resulting in higher-than-anticipated membership in our marketplace business from the special enrollment period; and a probable extension of the Medicaid eligibility redetermination suspension beyond August and through the end of the year, possibly into the beginning of 2022.  
As a potential headwind, we continue to monitor additional state rate adjustments. For 2021, we anticipate a $550 million revenue impact of state revenue actions and rate actions. Jeff will provide some additional color on this shortly. But I will share that we have seen only one action in the first quarter of the year. And we are not currently aware of any additional planned adjustments or quarters. In fact, some quarters, we believe, may be allowed to expire. To reiterate, overall, as we see them today, we believe these factors balance in our favor. 
As we conclude the first quarter of 2021, we are pleased with our ability to drive significant growth and our updated guidance reflects the strength of our business through the year.  
We also remain vigilant that this is a year with unique drivers, including the suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and the marketplace special enrollment period, which we cannot be certain will continue throughout all of 2022. Consistent with prior years, at our June Investor Day, we will provide an update on these factors and 2022. We recognize a lot of factors, as we see them today, balance to the positive, the outlook remains fluid and dependent on the prevalent policy landscape.  
The strength of our diversified business is apparent across our product portfolio. In our Medicaid business, we continue to participate in an active RFP pipeline. We successfully renewed our contract in Hawaii at the end of March. And North Carolina and Oklahoma both remain on track to go live later this year. For 2021, we continue to expect a composite rate adjustment of 1.7%, consistent with our initial guidance. 
Our Medicare business delivered continued growth. Medicare grew by over $1 billion year-over-year in the first quarter, representing growth of 41% and demonstrating the strength of the platform and our ability to leverage our national scale going forward. 
In our Marketplace business, we are pleased to be operating in a supportive environment. The administration continues to invest in the product and just last week, announced an additional $80 million for navigators to boost enrollment.  Based on data released by CMS, Centene is a clear leader in new enrollment on the federal exchange. And since the beginning of the year, we have enrolled over 320,000 new members in our Marketplace product. We believe these results demonstrate the strength of our strategy to provide consistent quality care and not to participate in a price-related race to the bottom with narrow network coverage. I will remind you that narrow networks often encourage out-of-network utilization, which tends to be uncontrolled and expensive. 
We see opportunity to further grow with the enhanced advanced premium tax credits that took effect April 1, the impact of which, we believe, will encourage consumers to prioritize quality, consistency and experience over premium [ growth ]. Moving ahead, we intend to maintain and consider building additional products around this strategy.  
On the technology front, we're making meaningful progress to advance our capabilities to provide high-quality integrated care for our members. We look forward to providing you more details on our unique technology strategy at our Investors event in June. 
We continued to advance towards the completion of the Magellan Health acquisition and remain on track to close the transaction early in the second half of 2021. The Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period expired in mid-March, and we're working diligently towards obtaining the necessary state approvals. Our integration and planning efforts are in full swing, and we are enthusiastic about the combination, which will enable us to expand access to special care and nurture -- to specialty care and nurture a fully integrated model across behavioral and physical health. 
I will remind you that Magellan will be part of our Health Care Enterprise portfolio, which will allow them to maintain independence and serve third-party customers. 
I would like to take a moment to comment on the situation in Ohio. We are still an active RFP process, where we finished second out of 11 bidders, according to a scoring summary released by the Ohio Department of Medicaid. Regarding the legal and regulatory landscape, Centene has been clear that we maintain these claims to be unfounded. For additional information about our position on this matter, I will direct you to our website for links to our court filings.  
We look forward to answering any questions from our governmental partners regarding this issue and remain committed to the highest levels of quality and transparency in how we serve our state partners.  
Before I close, I'd like to talk about Centene's role in COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Over the past few months, our data and care management teams have worked tirelessly to identify members at the highest list for COVID-19 and provide those individuals with personalized and culturally sensitive outreach. In addition, we have partnered with Lyft to support individuals with transportation to vaccine appointments. And with the Gold Jackets of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, with whom we have had an ongoing partnership, we created PSA's focus on increasing awareness about the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines.  
This type of innovative work is happening across the organization, and I want to recognize and thank our employees for their unwavering commitment and dedication. 
In closing, we started the year strong and look forward to carrying this positive momentum through the remainder of 2021 as we experience a supportive environment in expanding access to care. We continue to see long-term opportunities to drive growth in our top and bottom line and enhance margins as we provide the highest level of care to our members at the lowest cost. 
I look forward to seeing all of you, albeit virtually, at our Investor event on June 16. Thank you for your continued interest in Centene. I'll now hand the call over to Jeff."

This morning, we reported first quarter 2021 results in what was a good start to the year. First quarter revenues were $30 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the first quarter of 2020, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.63 compared to $0.86 last year. 
As a result of the strong first quarter performance, we increased our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 per share to a range of $5.05 to $5.35. I will provide further comments related to our updated financial guidance shortly.  
First, let me provide additional details for the first quarter. Total revenues grew by $4 billion over the first quarter of 2020 due to a full quarter of contribution from WellCare and the ongoing suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations partially offset by an overall decrease in marketplace membership, state rate and risk-sharing actions and the repeal of the health insurer fee in 2021. Our marketplace membership decline in the quarter was less significant than previously expected as a result of membership gains achieved during the special enrollment period.  
Total membership increased to 25.1 million in the quarter, up 5% compared to a year ago. Since the pandemic began in March of 2020, we have added a total of 2 million Medicaid members. Our HBR was 86.8% in the first quarter compared to 88% in the first quarter of 2020. The HBR benefited from lower overall medical utilization trends due to COVID pandemic and lower costs associated with the flu. This was partially offset by COVID-related costs, state risk-sharing mechanisms and higher COVID and traditional utilization in the marketplace business.  
Our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 8.1% in the first quarter this year compared to 8.6% last year and 9.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The adjusted SG&A expense ratio benefited from the ongoing suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues due to recent acquisitions. 
Cash flow provided by operations was $43 million in the first quarter. The lower operating cash flow for the quarter was primarily driven by a delay in premium payments of $910 million from the state of New York due to the end of their fiscal year, which was collected in April.  
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position of $369 million of unregulated cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. Debt at quarter end was $16.8 billion, which includes $152 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38.5%, excluding our nonrecourse debt, compared to 39% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38% when netting our unregulated cash with our debt at quarter end, which represents a 90 basis point decrease since March of 2020.  
Our medical claims liability totaled $12.8 billion at quarter end and represents 49 days in claims payable compared to 51 days in the fourth quarter of 2020. DCP was impacted by the timing of medical and pharmacy claim payments. 
We are making excellent progress toward the closure of Magellan, and we remain comfortable with our previously communicated accretion targets. 
Over the last several months, we have gained increased visibility into a number of important factors and have included those items in our updated 2021 financial guidance. These factors specifically include: the ongoing suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations through August 1; the delay in the California pharmacy carve-out until July 1; and the delay in the New York pharmacy carve-out through year-end 2022; the new business win in Oklahoma with an assumed go-live date of October 1; expected marketplace membership gains through the special enrollment period; Medicare membership, fee schedule increase and sequestration delay; and updated expectations of state rate and risk-sharing mechanisms. These changes increased our total revenue guidance for the year by $4 billion at the midpoint to be within a range of $120.1 million and $122.1 billion.  
Our HBR guidance increased by 50 basis points at the midpoint due to the mix of items such as the Medicare fee schedule, increased state risk-sharing mechanisms and Medicaid growth, which all carry a higher HBR. Taken all together, this has an overall neutral effect to earnings, and the dynamics are consistent with the headwinds and tailwinds we provided on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
Additionally, as I highlighted earlier, we have increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the full year at the midpoint by $0.05, reflecting our strong first quarter performance. 
Let me highlight some more details on some of these items. We now expect Medicare Advantage enrollment growth to exceed 20% in 2021. This strong growth demonstrates the value the WellCare acquisition provides positive momentum for the organization to build off of as we formulate our bids for Medicare Advantage in 2022.  
As Michael mentioned, Marketplace enrollment expectations for 2021 are better than our previous estimates as the special enrollment period provides Centene with an opportunity to reach many more eligible consumers. This strong growth demonstrates our organizational commitment to leadership in this product. We continue to view Marketplace as a long-term growth opportunity for Centene. 
We have increased our estimate for state rate and risk-sharing mechanisms from our previous guidance to $550 million for 2021. In the first quarter, the state of New York implemented a risk corridor retroactive to April 1, 2020 that increased our payback by $40 million. At this time, we are not aware of any new corridors or retroactive rates and the increase in our full year estimate reflects the performance of risk mitigation programs enacted last year.  
As Michael noted, we continue to monitor utilization. During the first quarter, we saw overall utilization that continues to be below the historical baseline and also slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2020. The COVID inpatient admissions and costs peaked in January and decreased throughout the quarter. We continue to see a diverging pattern of COVID and non-COVID utilization. The updated financial guidance reflects typical utilization that remains below the historical baseline during the first half of 2021, continuing to trend to normalized levels by the end of the year. COVID utilization, including testing and treatment costs, are expected to partially offset the impact of lower traditional utilization. The duration and intensity of higher COVID costs will be impacted by the trajectory of the pandemic and vaccination rates.  
Finally, as Michael discussed, we continued to monitor some additional factors that are not in our updated guidance today. They include: the potential for the additional SCP membership gains in Marketplace above our expectations driven by the enhanced advanced premium tax credits; the potential for Medicaid redeterminations to be extended beyond August 1; any additional state rate and risk-sharing actions; and the uncertainty associated with both COVID and traditional medical utilization for the remainder of the year. 
We believe these additional factors represent a net tailwind to the company for the remainder of 2021. The seasonality of our earnings remains unchanged with approximately 60% in the first half of the year.  
I'll close by reiterating our confidence in the strength of our business. Our balance sheet remains strong and we believe we have ample liquidity to meet our operational and strategic needs. We remain focused on executing against our strategic plans and are committed to delivering shareholder value. 
That concludes my remarks and operator, you may now open the line for questions."

We think that the redetermination will continue throughout the balance of the year, but we'll report to you a quarter -- 90 days at a time as the federal government does it. And that's in the interest of being reasonably conservative. So we're being cautious there. 
Marketplace, we've demonstrated this past quarter, with the growth that we've had, that we are the leader in the field and are in a very strong position to continue that growth. And we're going to continue it through the balance of this year as we see it. And we see some upside there. 
I think what's also important, as it relates to the redetermination. If they do drop off the redetermination, people who maybe lose Medicaid coverage could pick up the Marketplace because once again, the cost structure is such with the tax allowances that they can do that without any costs. And so I think we're going to see -- I'm hearing a bird somewhere in the background. I'm hearing -- so I think we will see growth continue. But as we said, governmental policies do have something to play, and it is a fluid situation, and we work very well both sides, as we've talked about in the past. We're working with them now into these various policies and approaches. 
And as that unfolds, I think, between now and June, I hope to have more insight than we do as to what it will mean for the balance of this year and going into 2022. The essence is positive."

In our view, it's very consistent with what we've seen in the past. Now you have to obviously account for the acquisition of WellCare. But roughly around that 1% range of prior year medical costs. So I would say nothing unusual on the development front from our perspective, which is, I think we've had a consistent practice over a long number of years. 
On the Marketplace business, on the cost side, what we did see was just a little bit higher inpatient authorizations on COVID, specifically in January. And then a little higher non-inpatient, really just compared to our expectations. So it doesn't really change the margin profile for the year.

I'm wondering if you think about the membership and what's happening with the membership, I know it's a membership that's prone to switch, but it's not driven by premiums because there's a lot of subsidies.

So what we've done is we've maintained our network. We have the subsidies that are necessary that have really taken price off the table, in my opinion. Where people will look at the quality, the service that Brent talked about. And that's where we're seeing the growth and return of membership to us as well as the incremental new membership. 
And so I think what we're very focused on is how to continue to grow it. And I learned a long time ago when I was in consumer packaged goods. When you're trying to go in against somebody that's a clear leader in the marketplace, which we were in a category, the only way you can hope to try and come in is on price. And I think we had a strategic positioning that they are -- people are able to take some membership away in price in a COVID environment as we come out of it. As I think we've demonstrated in the first quarter of this year, we've recouped all that we've lost and then some, and we'll be giving you guidance in June that shows continued growth."

Good morning, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter Earnings Call. On today -- on the call today, I will review our first quarter performance, provide an update on our markets and products and discuss how we are position",1433,"Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter Earnings Call. 
On today -- on the call today, I will review our first quarter performance, provide an update on our markets and products and discuss how we are positioned to sustain our momentum in the ongoing pandemic environment. While we have made great progress in working our way out of the pandemic, nationally, as we have seen recently, it is not yet over. 
We are off to a strong start in 2021, with solid revenue and earnings growth. It was a good quarter. Our teams continue to execute well, generating revenue of $30 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Membership was 25.1 million at the quarter end. This represents an increase of 1.3 million compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.63 compared to $0.86 in the prior year quarter, representing an increase of 90%. 
Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and the trajectory of our business. And today, we are updating our full year guidance. This is primarily driven by several tailwinds. These include: first, continued Medicaid membership growth amid suspended eligibility redeterminations. Our current guidance anticipates the suspension continuing to at least August 1 based on the fact that it is renewed 90 days at a time. Second, the marketplace special enrollment period, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. And third, the hold on the Medicare sequestration. 
Our results to date also reflect a decrease in normal utilization, offset by COVID-19 expenses and state recoupment of premiums, which Jeff will provide additional detail on shortly. 
As we have done throughout pandemic, we continue to monitor the headwinds and tailwinds we anticipate will impact our operating landscapes for the remainder of the year and possibly into 2022. Consistent with past quarters, I will provide you with updates based on the facts as we know them today. When taken together, we believe the essence of these factors to be positive. Anticipated tailwinds include: continued lower than normal utilization. Overall, the first quarter was lower compared to the prior quarter. Although we saw an increase in non-COVID utilization in our marketplace business. While the trajectory of utilization depends on the pandemic and remains uncertain, we continue to expect utilization to come in below historical averages during the second quarter with the potential for some normalization starting to occur in the second half of the year. 
Other key possible tailwinds we see include: potential for continued growth resulting in higher-than-anticipated membership in our marketplace business from the special enrollment period; and a probable extension of the Medicaid eligibility redetermination suspension beyond August and through the end of the year, possibly into the beginning of 2022.  
As a potential headwind, we continue to monitor additional state rate adjustments. For 2021, we anticipate a $550 million revenue impact of state revenue actions and rate actions. Jeff will provide some additional color on this shortly. But I will share that we have seen only one action in the first quarter of the year. And we are not currently aware of any additional planned adjustments or quarters. In fact, some quarters, we believe, may be allowed to expire. To reiterate, overall, as we see them today, we believe these factors balance in our favor. 
As we conclude the first quarter of 2021, we are pleased with our ability to drive significant growth and our updated guidance reflects the strength of our business through the year.  
We also remain vigilant that this is a year with unique drivers, including the suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and the marketplace special enrollment period, which we cannot be certain will continue throughout all of 2022. Consistent with prior years, at our June Investor Day, we will provide an update on these factors and 2022. We recognize a lot of factors, as we see them today, balance to the positive, the outlook remains fluid and dependent on the prevalent policy landscape.  
The strength of our diversified business is apparent across our product portfolio. In our Medicaid business, we continue to participate in an active RFP pipeline. We successfully renewed our contract in Hawaii at the end of March. And North Carolina and Oklahoma both remain on track to go live later this year. For 2021, we continue to expect a composite rate adjustment of 1.7%, consistent with our initial guidance. 
Our Medicare business delivered continued growth. Medicare grew by over $1 billion year-over-year in the first quarter, representing growth of 41% and demonstrating the strength of the platform and our ability to leverage our national scale going forward. 
In our Marketplace business, we are pleased to be operating in a supportive environment. The administration continues to invest in the product and just last week, announced an additional $80 million for navigators to boost enrollment.  Based on data released by CMS, Centene is a clear leader in new enrollment on the federal exchange. And since the beginning of the year, we have enrolled over 320,000 new members in our Marketplace product. We believe these results demonstrate the strength of our strategy to provide consistent quality care and not to participate in a price-related race to the bottom with narrow network coverage. I will remind you that narrow networks often encourage out-of-network utilization, which tends to be uncontrolled and expensive. 
We see opportunity to further grow with the enhanced advanced premium tax credits that took effect April 1, the impact of which, we believe, will encourage consumers to prioritize quality, consistency and experience over premium [ growth ]. Moving ahead, we intend to maintain and consider building additional products around this strategy.  
On the technology front, we're making meaningful progress to advance our capabilities to provide high-quality integrated care for our members. We look forward to providing you more details on our unique technology strategy at our Investors event in June. 
We continued to advance towards the completion of the Magellan Health acquisition and remain on track to close the transaction early in the second half of 2021. The Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period expired in mid-March, and we're working diligently towards obtaining the necessary state approvals. Our integration and planning efforts are in full swing, and we are enthusiastic about the combination, which will enable us to expand access to special care and nurture -- to specialty care and nurture a fully integrated model across behavioral and physical health. 
I will remind you that Magellan will be part of our Health Care Enterprise portfolio, which will allow them to maintain independence and serve third-party customers. 
I would like to take a moment to comment on the situation in Ohio. We are still an active RFP process, where we finished second out of 11 bidders, according to a scoring summary released by the Ohio Department of Medicaid. Regarding the legal and regulatory landscape, Centene has been clear that we maintain these claims to be unfounded. For additional information about our position on this matter, I will direct you to our website for links to our court filings.  
We look forward to answering any questions from our governmental partners regarding this issue and remain committed to the highest levels of quality and transparency in how we serve our state partners.  
Before I close, I'd like to talk about Centene's role in COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Over the past few months, our data and care management teams have worked tirelessly to identify members at the highest list for COVID-19 and provide those individuals with personalized and culturally sensitive outreach. In addition, we have partnered with Lyft to support individuals with transportation to vaccine appointments. And with the Gold Jackets of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, with whom we have had an ongoing partnership, we created PSA's focus on increasing awareness about the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines.  
This type of innovative work is happening across the organization, and I want to recognize and thank our employees for their unwavering commitment and dedication. 
In closing, we started the year strong and look forward to carrying this positive momentum through the remainder of 2021 as we experience a supportive environment in expanding access to care. We continue to see long-term opportunities to drive growth in our top and bottom line and enhance margins as we provide the highest level of care to our members at the lowest cost. 
I look forward to seeing all of you, albeit virtually, at our Investor event on June 16. Thank you for your continued interest in Centene. I'll now hand the call over to Jeff."

This morning, we reported first quarter 2021 results in what was a good start to the year. First quarter revenues were $30 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the first quarter of 2020, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.63 compared to $0.86 last year. 
As a result of the strong first quarter performance, we increased our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 per share to a range of $5.05 to $5.35. I will provide further comments related to our updated financial guidance shortly.  
First, let me provide additional details for the first quarter. Total revenues grew by $4 billion over the first quarter of 2020 due to a full quarter of contribution from WellCare and the ongoing suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations partially offset by an overall decrease in marketplace membership, state rate and risk-sharing actions and the repeal of the health insurer fee in 2021. Our marketplace membership decline in the quarter was less significant than previously expected as a result of membership gains achieved during the special enrollment period.  
Total membership increased to 25.1 million in the quarter, up 5% compared to a year ago. Since the pandemic began in March of 2020, we have added a total of 2 million Medicaid members. Our HBR was 86.8% in the first quarter compared to 88% in the first quarter of 2020. The HBR benefited from lower overall medical utilization trends due to COVID pandemic and lower costs associated with the flu. This was partially offset by COVID-related costs, state risk-sharing mechanisms and higher COVID and traditional utilization in the marketplace business.  
Our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 8.1% in the first quarter this year compared to 8.6% last year and 9.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The adjusted SG&A expense ratio benefited from the ongoing suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations and the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues due to recent acquisitions. 
Cash flow provided by operations was $43 million in the first quarter. The lower operating cash flow for the quarter was primarily driven by a delay in premium payments of $910 million from the state of New York due to the end of their fiscal year, which was collected in April.  
We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position of $369 million of unregulated cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. Debt at quarter end was $16.8 billion, which includes $152 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38.5%, excluding our nonrecourse debt, compared to 39% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 38% when netting our unregulated cash with our debt at quarter end, which represents a 90 basis point decrease since March of 2020.  
Our medical claims liability totaled $12.8 billion at quarter end and represents 49 days in claims payable compared to 51 days in the fourth quarter of 2020. DCP was impacted by the timing of medical and pharmacy claim payments. 
We are making excellent progress toward the closure of Magellan, and we remain comfortable with our previously communicated accretion targets. 
Over the last several months, we have gained increased visibility into a number of important factors and have included those items in our updated 2021 financial guidance. These factors specifically include: the ongoing suspension of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations through August 1; the delay in the California pharmacy carve-out until July 1; and the delay in the New York pharmacy carve-out through year-end 2022; the new business win in Oklahoma with an assumed go-live date of October 1; expected marketplace membership gains through the special enrollment period; Medicare membership, fee schedule increase and sequestration delay; and updated expectations of state rate and risk-sharing mechanisms. These changes increased our total revenue guidance for the year by $4 billion at the midpoint to be within a range of $120.1 million and $122.1 billion.  
Our HBR guidance increased by 50 basis points at the midpoint due to the mix of items such as the Medicare fee schedule, increased state risk-sharing mechanisms and Medicaid growth, which all carry a higher HBR. Taken all together, this has an overall neutral effect to earnings, and the dynamics are consistent with the headwinds and tailwinds we provided on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
Additionally, as I highlighted earlier, we have increased our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the full year at the midpoint by $0.05, reflecting our strong first quarter performance. 
Let me highlight some more details on some of these items. We now expect Medicare Advantage enrollment growth to exceed 20% in 2021. This strong growth demonstrates the value the WellCare acquisition provides positive momentum for the organization to build off of as we formulate our bids for Medicare Advantage in 2022.  
As Michael mentioned, Marketplace enrollment expectations for 2021 are better than our previous estimates as the special enrollment period provides Centene with an opportunity to reach many more eligible consumers. This strong growth demonstrates our organizational commitment to leadership in this product. We continue to view Marketplace as a long-term growth opportunity for Centene. 
We have increased our estimate for state rate and risk-sharing mechanisms from our previous guidance to $550 million for 2021. In the first quarter, the state of New York implemented a risk corridor retroactive to April 1, 2020 that increased our payback by $40 million. At this time, we are not aware of any new corridors or retroactive rates and the increase in our full year estimate reflects the performance of risk mitigation programs enacted last year.  
As Michael noted, we continue to monitor utilization. During the first quarter, we saw overall utilization that continues to be below the historical baseline and also slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2020. The COVID inpatient admissions and costs peaked in January and decreased throughout the quarter. We continue to see a diverging pattern of COVID and non-COVID utilization. The updated financial guidance reflects typical utilization that remains below the historical baseline during the first half of 2021, continuing to trend to normalized levels by the end of the year. COVID utilization, including testing and treatment costs, are expected to partially offset the impact of lower traditional utilization. The duration and intensity of higher COVID costs will be impacted by the trajectory of the pandemic and vaccination rates.  
Finally, as Michael discussed, we continued to monitor some additional factors that are not in our updated guidance today. They include: the potential for the additional SCP membership gains in Marketplace above our expectations driven by the enhanced advanced premium tax credits; the potential for Medicaid redeterminations to be extended beyond August 1; any additional state rate and risk-sharing actions; and the uncertainty associated with both COVID and traditional medical utilization for the remainder of the year. 
We believe these additional factors represent a net tailwind to the company for the remainder of 2021. The seasonality of our earnings remains unchanged with approximately 60% in the first half of the year.  
I'll close by reiterating our confidence in the strength of our business. Our balance sheet remains strong and we believe we have ample liquidity to meet our operational and strategic needs. We remain focused on executing against our strategic plans and are committed to delivering shareholder value.

My real question is Medicare revenues up 41% in the quarter. I know some of that was anniversarying of WellCare. But MA lives were up 19% sequentially. It sounds like the outlook for the year is closer to 20%. So that's up from previous expectations. 
So can you break out how much of that revenue growth was organic in the quarter? Maybe a sense of what revenues will do this year? And where are you seeing that success in terms of geographies and products and whether it's coming from competitors or fee-for-service?"

We'll give you more guidance in June at our Investor Day, which is our practice, particularly on the top line. These are unusual years. We think that the redetermination will continue throughout the balance of the year, but we'll report to you a quarter -- 90 days at a time as the federal government does it. And that's in the interest of being reasonably conservative. So we're being cautious there. 
Marketplace, we've demonstrated this past quarter, with the growth that we've had, that we are the leader in the field and are in a very strong position to continue that growth. And we're going to continue it through the balance of this year as we see it. And we see some upside there. 
I think what's also important, as it relates to the redetermination. If they do drop off the redetermination, people who maybe lose Medicaid coverage could pick up the Marketplace because once again, the cost structure is such with the tax allowances that they can do that without any costs. And so I think we're going to see -- I'm hearing a bird somewhere in the background. I'm hearing -- so I think we will see growth continue. But as we said, governmental policies do have something to play, and it is a fluid situation, and we work very well both sides, as we've talked about in the past. We're working with them now into these various policies and approaches. 
And as that unfolds, I think, between now and June, I hope to have more insight than we do as to what it will mean for the balance of this year and going into 2022. The essence is positive."

So I would say nothing unusual on the development front from our perspective, which is, I think we've had a consistent practice over a long number of years. 
On the Marketplace business, on the cost side, what we did see was just a little bit higher inpatient authorizations on COVID, specifically in January. And then a little higher non-inpatient, really just compared to our expectations. So it doesn't really change the margin profile for the year.

And then when we think about you're saying utilization is below baseline, I assume that, that related to core utilization as well, but maybe you can give us a little bit more color on how it's trending per market? And do you think that because you're now seeing sort of a mix towards more of an MA population that that's impacting sort of utilization trends that you're seeing versus Medicaid in the market?"

So what we've done is we've maintained our network. We have the subsidies that are necessary that have really taken price off the table, in my opinion. Where people will look at the quality, the service that Brent talked about. And that's where we're seeing the growth and return of membership to us as well as the incremental new membership. 
And so I think what we're very focused on is how to continue to grow it. And I learned a long time ago when I was in consumer packaged goods. When you're trying to go in against somebody that's a clear leader in the marketplace, which we were in a category, the only way you can hope to try and come in is on price. And I think we had a strategic positioning that they are -- people are able to take some membership away in price in a COVID environment as we come out of it.

You've heard me say, we make decisions based on the facts as they are today. And today, with the continued rise in the highly virulent Delta strain of COVID-19, I must open our call with similar comments to those made this time last year. The environment has changed again in just the last week or so, and the Delta variant is causing a new wave of pandemic. It's a pandemic of the unvaccinated. According to a leading epidemiologist our team has been working with for the past 18-plus months, the Delta variant has 1,260 times greater concentration in respiratory material than the original variant. An individual infected with the Delta strain can spread the virus to an average of 5 to 8 individuals, up from an average of 2.4 individuals from the original strain. 83% of the COVID cases today in the U.S. are Delta, up from 10% just a month ago. 
Hospitalizations are up 57% in the last month. The deaths have increased by 19% in the last week alone. And importantly, 97% of people currently hospitalized for COVID-19 are unvaccinated, and 99.5% of the COVID-related deaths are among the unvaccinated. Our additional concern because of the high concentration in respiratory droplets, this variance seems to be transmissible or transmissible among children and is more dangerous than the original virus. It is clear that one of the issues we must address is vaccine hesitancy to stop the transmission of the virus and to protect those who cannot safely receive the inoculation, including our young children. The variant is real, and we are taking it very seriously. You have seen us execute strongly throughout the pandemic, and that will not change, especially as it remains clear that the pandemic is not over and the environment could remain choppy for the balance of the year. 
Turning to our second quarter performance. Results met our expectations and were consistent with the update we provided in mid-June. We generated revenue of $31 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.25 versus $2.40 last year. As a reminder, last year's utilization rate in the second quarter was significantly lower as a result of the pandemic. 
We ended the quarter with membership of 25.4 million as several tailwinds we have previously discussed remain in place. These include the suspension of redetermination, which we expect will continue into 2022. And we are aware of recessions extending beyond that into 2023. 
We continue to participate in an active RFP pipeline. In addition, we are pleased that the Missouri Supreme Court unanimously upheld the will of the people, and their Medicaid will be expanded in Missouri. We have been preparing for expansion for months and are fully prepared to bring health care access to hundreds of thousands of citizens here in our home state of Missouri. 
Additionally, yesterday, North Carolina announced the winners of the Tailored Health Plan awards. We are pleased that our provider-led entity, Carolina Complete Health with the North Carolina Medical Society, was selected to work with 2 of the LMEs. And our health plan, WellCare North China, was selected to work with 3 of them. 
In Medicare, we delivered another quarter of healthy growth with membership growing approximately 25% since the beginning of the year. In addition, preparations are well underway for open enrollment beginning this fall. 
In Marketplace, we added a net 110,000 lives since the beginning of the year. While typically, we would have lost members during this period. This represents 6% growth. 
To this point, Medicaid and Medicare are performing very well and are continuing to normalize in line with our expectations. We talked last month about the dynamics in the Marketplace business where we are witnessing continuing COVID-related costs and increased non-COVID utilization, which we believe is still largely driven by some pent-up demand. Drew will provide additional details on non-COVID utilization. Although this is impacting our margins in the short term, we continue to view this environment as transitory, driven by the various dynamics of the pandemic. Importantly, where possible, these trends have been factored into our pricing and strategy for 2022. 
Overall, we remain confident in the long-term opportunity of our Marketplace business. We expect to continue to offer a competitive product and to be in a strong position as the leading provider. And as you look at the healthy growth across our portfolio today, you can see we have the size, scale and strength to continue to execute on our objectives. 
With the first half of the year behind us, we are maintaining our full year 2021 adjusted EPS. This reflects the underlying strength of our business and our demonstrated ability to manage through a dynamic environment. We will continue to provide you transparent updates as the second half of the year unfolds. 
We remain focused on our business, and we continue to make progress against the margin expansion goals we outlined last month. While we are at the beginning of this process, I'm encouraged to see strong alignment across our enterprise and initial transit -- traction towards these goals, as Drew will discuss. 
We are also making progress on the Magellan acquisition and remain on track to close on the deal in the second half of 2021, having received Justice Department approval, an approval in all but 1 state. 
Before I hand the call over to Drew to discuss our results in more detail, I'd like to reiterate a few points that I touched on today. First, the Delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is creating a new set of dynamics, particularly for the unvaccinated. We are taking this very seriously and watching the short-term impact on our business. As a health care company, our absolute priority is to ensure our members, employees and communities are healthy, and we are making every effort to provide our members and workforce with opportunities to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. We have made outreach phone calls to nearly 9.5 million members to support them in accessing the vaccine, created PSAs that will air on [ 150 ] TV stations across the country and directly participated in over 80 vaccination events. In addition, our teams have formed innovative partnerships with organizations including NASCAR, the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Walmart, Lift and the White House to increase awareness and accessibility of the vaccine. We also continue to evaluate when we can safely return to in-person work and are ensuring that our office return-to-work time line gives employees sufficient time to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. 
I want to make you aware that this still may not be enough. And if we do not effectively manage the strain, the next one could be even worse. And there may need -- there may be a need for vaccination requirement implementation by government and industry. 
As we have done for the past 1.5 years, we will continue to manage through the dynamic landscape and will provide you with transparent updates based on the information as we see and know it. Our size and scale enable us to navigate an evolving environment as we pursue growth and most importantly, margin expansion. Together with our margin expansion goals, our capital allocation priorities discussed at our June investor event remain in place. 
Thank you for your continued interest and support of Centene. I will now hand the call over to Drew."

This morning, we reported second quarter 2021 results of $31 billion in revenue, an increase of 12% compared to the second quarter of 2020, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.25. Before I get into the Q2 earnings drivers and",1509,"Thank you, Michael. This morning, we reported second quarter 2021 results of $31 billion in revenue, an increase of 12% compared to the second quarter of 2020, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.25. Before I get into the Q2 earnings drivers and insights, let's start with revenue. 
Total revenue grew by $3.3 billion compared to the second quarter of 2020 due to Medicaid membership growth resulting from the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations, strong membership growth in the Medicare business and our late 2020 acquisition of PANTHER. Total membership increased to 25.4 million, up 3% compared to a year ago. 
While I will touch on all of our major business lines, the primary topic to cover for the quarter and the full year outlook is the Marketplace business. Recall, we gave an update at our June Investor Day regarding a few of the negative drivers in April and May for this line of business. Our Q2 consolidated HBR was 88.3%, which was higher than our expectation driven by the Marketplace business. Let me provide an update on the 3 Marketplace pressure points we covered at Investor Day. 
Number one. As a reminder, we incurred a $175 million or $0.22 headwind compared to our prior expectations in the second quarter related to the 2020 risk adjustment year. For the 2021 risk adjustment year, we received Wakely data in June, and it was largely consistent with our expectations of shifting from being in a large payable position for 2020 to a slight receivable position for 2021. 
Number two, COVID costs. We previously provided insight that while COVID costs were falling from Q1, they were still higher on an absolute basis from what we had forecasted in April and May. We saw the COVID costs continue to decline in June, consistent with our expectation but we will be watching external trends closely as COVID costs could reverse course and increase based upon macro COVID trends, as Michael indicated. 
Number three, pent-up demand. As previously disclosed, March and April Marketplace results were impacted by a broad return to the doctor's office in the outpatient setting, after which, we saw a slight utilization downtick in May. We had expected a continued downdraft in June and the remainder of the year. Instead, June Marketplace medical costs trended higher compared to May. We now expect pent-up demand to subside at a slower rate in the back half of 2021. The activity is in the area of outpatient services for continuing members as well as members who are new to [ West ] in 2021 with a higher cost per claim due to mix of services as these member cohorts access healthcare. And though our SCP members only represent 20% of our membership, we are also seeing higher non-COVID-related inpatient utilization for this cohort who now has access to health care due to the expanded SCP rules. We expect these recently added SCP members to return to expected levels of utilization after initially accessing services. 
Our team has isolated the heavier utilizing cohorts through our real-time data and is taking action, where possible, including a slate of clinical initiatives designed to improve quality and curb trend. However, we do expect a higher HBR in Marketplace to drive the consolidated 2021 HBR, as we will cover in a minute, since some of the deferred demand will just have to work its way through the system during 2021. 
The remainder of our business as a whole performed consistent with our expectations in Q2. In Medicaid, we're seeing strong performance and a steady march toward normalized utilization, with this benefit largely offset by state rate actions and risk corridors. In Q1, we disclosed $550 million of such actions for 2021. This annual view increased in Q2 to $675 million. 
In Medicare Advantage, we continue to grow during the year, and we see a similar trend towards normal utilization. We have grown membership organically 25% since 12/31/2020. 
Moving to other P&L and balance sheet items. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 7.7% in the second quarter compared to 8.5% last year and 8.1% in the first quarter of 2021. The adjusted SG&A expense ratio benefited from lower short-term variable compensation costs and the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues due to increased Medicaid membership and recent acquisitions. This was partially offset by increased sales and marketing costs as a result of the Marketplace SCP and growth in Medicare. Let me go deeper into the first item since it's important for you to understand drivers. 
Think of the HBR pressure caused by our Marketplace business and our short-term variable compensation as somewhat offsetting toggles. You'll also see this in our full year guidance elements. If the deferred demand bubble in Marketplace causes us to land toward the high end of our consolidated HBR guidance range, we would be toward the low end of our SG&A range because of a reduction in our short-term incentive plan for 2021. Think of this as a potential 35 basis point swing in those metrics. On the other hand, if pent-up demand and high new member utilization settles quickly and we come in toward the bottom of our HBR range, we would incur typical short-term incentives, which would have a corresponding effect of putting us toward the top of our SG&A range, and the outcome could be in between those bookend scenarios. 
While we recognize the current challenges in Marketplace, we have implemented a slate of mitigating initiatives, including operational, clinical and available pricing actions. Current performance does not change our perspective as we look out to our long-term margin goals. 
Continuing on highlights of the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations was $1.7 billion in the second quarter, primarily driven by net earnings before the legal settlement reserve, which is expected to be paid in future periods. We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position of $1.1 billion of unregulated cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. Approximately $700 million of that was deployed on July 1, as we completed the acquisition of the remainder of Circle Health. Recall, we acquired 40% of Circle in 2019 and 2020 with the intention to subsequently acquire the remaining portion. Circle is a very well-positioned and leading ambulatory surgery center business in the U.K. and comes with a strong management team. We expect Circle to be above our company-targeted adjusted net income margin by 2023. 
Debt at quarter end was $16.8 billion. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 38.9%, excluding our nonrecourse debt. Our medical claims liability totaled $12.8 billion at quarter end and represents 48 days in claims payable compared to 49 in Q1. DCP was mechanically impacted by the timing of state-directed payments. 
We updated a few of the 2021 guidance elements based upon what we've seen through the second quarter and for the items we just discussed. While we are maintaining the same wide adjusted EPS range of $5.05 to $5.35, you will notice some changes in the underlying metrics, including higher revenue from continued growth in Medicare and Marketplace; delayed state pharmacy carve-outs; higher state pass-throughs of approximately $1 billion and a continued suspension of redeterminations; a higher HBR range, as we just discussed, solely due to our Marketplace business; a lower SG&A range due to the potential reduction of the short-term incentive plan, depending on how Marketplace pent-up demand plays out. But in addition, we are also getting some leverage on the higher revenue base. 
Overall, this continues to be a relatively wide range as we referenced at Investor Day, given the choppiness in our Marketplace product. We still have 6 months of the year to play out, especially with varying scenarios around the subsidence of pent-up demand and the unknowns with COVID. The guidance continues to exclude Magellan. It excludes our recent Magellan financing and Circle Health. 
We are determined to execute on our multiyear value-creation plan laid out at the recent Investor Day and achieve our long-term adjusted net income margin target of at least 3.3%. We have launched a formal program internally, encompassing all aspects of the organization marching in unison toward pulling the necessary levers to achieve the value-creation plan. We have developed some of these muscles over the past couple of years, such as the Centene Forward program for discrete initiatives, our HBR office for clinical quality and cost initiatives and the integration skills from past large acquisitions. 
As I said at Investor Day, this journey won't be a straight line, and the fruits of our labor are expected to show up more so in 2023 and 2024 than in 2022. But we know how to do this, and we are committed on taking the actions to deliver value creation to shareholders. What matters most is pulling the levers in the next 12 to 18 months to bear fruit in 2023 and 2024. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect it to strengthen even further as we improve margins and generate cash flow.

That was consistent with our expectations, and that largely represents, Josh, the members that rolled into this year and incurred claims during the first 4 months. So that's consistent with our expectations. 
On the pent-up demand, certainly, it's the nature of the services, the outpatient nature. We've seen orthopedics, joint degeneration, unfortunately, some psychiatry and chemical dependency drivers in marketplace. And really, the outpatient pressure coming into a little bit in March and then April and May, and then it popped in June. 
The SCP members, I think I mentioned this in my script as well, we're seeing them access inpatient services. And then quickly -- while it's early, quickly returning to a more normalized utilization. It's early, so we're tracking that, and we're sort of managing this in those 4 cohorts."

But once again, these are transitory things and not something that we see as fundamental and something will continue. And that's the COVID really spikes again and people end up not going to hospital and doctors as we historically saw. So there are unknowns out there.

So I'm interested if you're going to approach 2022 pricing really sort of based on actual expected cost trends and you're willing to sacrifice memberships, if necessary to do that. With the risk adjustment, do you feel that, that would be able to protect you against potential adverse selection that could occur?

You've heard me say, we make decisions based on the facts as they are today. And today, with the continued rise in the highly virulent Delta strain of COVID-19, I must open our call with similar comments to those made this time last year. The environment has changed again in just the last week or so, and the Delta variant is causing a new wave of pandemic. It's a pandemic of the unvaccinated. According to a leading epidemiologist our team has been working with for the past 18-plus months, the Delta variant has 1,260 times greater concentration in respiratory material than the original variant. An individual infected with the Delta strain can spread the virus to an average of 5 to 8 individuals, up from an average of 2.4 individuals from the original strain. 83% of the COVID cases today in the U.S. are Delta, up from 10% just a month ago. 
Hospitalizations are up 57% in the last month. The deaths have increased by 19% in the last week alone. And importantly, 97% of people currently hospitalized for COVID-19 are unvaccinated, and 99.5% of the COVID-related deaths are among the unvaccinated. Our additional concern because of the high concentration in respiratory droplets, this variance seems to be transmissible or transmissible among children and is more dangerous than the original virus. It is clear that one of the issues we must address is vaccine hesitancy to stop the transmission of the virus and to protect those who cannot safely receive the inoculations, including our young children. The variant is real, and we are taking it very seriously. You have seen us execute strongly throughout the pandemic, and that will not change, especially as it remains clear that the pandemic is not over and the environment could remain choppy for the balance of the year. 
Turning to our second quarter performance. Results met our expectations and were consistent with the update we provided in mid-June. We generated revenue of $31 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.25 versus $2.40 last year. As a reminder, last year's utilization rate in the second quarter was significantly lower as a result of the pandemic. We ended the quarter with membership of 25.4 million as several tailwinds we have previously discussed remain in place. These include the suspension of redetermination, which we expect will continue into 2022. And we are aware of discussions extending beyond that into 2023. 
We continue to participate in an active RFP pipeline. In addition, we are pleased that the Missouri Supreme Court unanimously upheld the will of the people, and their Medicaid will be expanded in Missouri. We have been preparing for expansion for months and are fully prepared to bring health care access to hundreds of thousands of citizens here in our home state of Missouri. Additionally, yesterday, North Carolina announced the winners of the tailored health plan awards. We are pleased that our provider-led entity, Carolina Complete Health with the North Carolina Medical Society, was selected to work with 2 of the LMEs and our health plan, WellCare of North Carolina, was selected to work with 3 of them. 
In Medicare, we delivered another quarter of healthy growth with membership growing approximately 25% since the beginning of the year. In addition, preparations are well underway for open enrollment beginning this fall. In Marketplace, we added a net 110,000 lives since the beginning of the year while typically, we would have lost members during this period. This represents 6% growth. To this point, Medicaid and Medicare are performing very well and are continuing to normalize in line with our expectations. We talked last month about the dynamics in the Marketplace business where we are witnessing continuing COVID-related costs and increased non-COVID utilization, which we believe is still largely driven by some pent-up demand. 
Drew will provide additional details on non-COVID utilization. Although this is impacting our margins in the short term, we continue to view this environment as transitory, driven by the various dynamics of the pandemic. Importantly, where possible, these trends have been factored into our pricing and strategy for 2022. Overall, we remain confident in the long-term opportunity of our Marketplace business. We expect to continue to offer a competitive product and to be in a strong position as the leading provider. And as you look at the healthy growth across our portfolio today, you can see we have the size, scale and strength to continue to execute on our objectives. 
With the first half of the year behind us, we are maintaining our full year 2021 adjusted EPS. This reflects the underlying strength of our business and our demonstrated ability to manage through a dynamic environment. We will continue to provide you with transparent updates as the second half of the year unfolds. We remain focused on our business, and we continue to make progress against the margin expansion goals we outlined last month. While we are at the beginning of this process, I'm encouraged to see strong alignment across our enterprise and initial transit -- traction towards these goals, as Drew will discuss. We are also making progress on the Magellan acquisition and remain on track to close on the deal in the second half of 2021, having received Justice Department approval and approval in all but 1 state. 
Before I hand the call over to Drew to discuss our results in more detail, I'd like to reiterate a few points that I touched on today. First, the Delta wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is creating a new set of dynamics, particularly for the unvaccinated. We are taking this very seriously and watching the short-term impact on our business. As a health care company, our absolute priority is to ensure our members, employees and communities are healthy, and we are making every effort to provide our members and workforce with opportunities to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. We have made outreach phone calls to nearly 9.5 million members to support them in accessing the vaccine, created PSAs that will air on 160 TV stations across the country and directly participated in over 80 vaccination events. 
In addition, our teams have formed innovative partnerships with organizations including NASCAR, the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Walmart, Lyft and the White House to increase awareness and accessibility of the vaccine. We also continue to evaluate when we can safely return to in-person work and are ensuring that our office return-to-work time line gives employees sufficient time to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. I want to make you aware that this still may not be enough. And if we do not effectively manage the strain, the next one could be even worse. And there may need -- there may be a need for vaccination requirement implementation by government and industry. 
As we have done for the past 1.5 years, we will continue to manage through the dynamic landscape and will provide you with transparent updates based on the information as we see and know it. Our size and scale enable us to navigate an evolving environment as we pursue growth and most importantly, margin expansion. Together with our margin expansion goals, our capital allocation priorities discussed at our June investor event remain in place. 
Thank you for your continued interest and support of Centene. I will now hand the call over to Drew."

This morning, we reported second quarter 2021 results of $31 billion in revenue, an increase of 12% compared to the second quarter of 2020, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.25. Before I get into the Q2 earnings drivers and",1507,"Thank you, Michael. This morning, we reported second quarter 2021 results of $31 billion in revenue, an increase of 12% compared to the second quarter of 2020, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.25. Before I get into the Q2 earnings drivers and insights, let's start with revenue. Total revenue grew by $3.3 billion compared to the second quarter of 2020 due to Medicaid membership growth resulting from the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations, strong membership growth in the Medicare business and our late 2020 acquisition of PANTHER. Total membership increased to 25.4 million, up 3% compared to a year ago. 
While I will touch on all of our major business lines, the primary topic to cover for the quarter and the full year outlook is the Marketplace business. Recall, we gave an update at our June Investor Day regarding a few of the negative drivers in April and May for this line of business. Our Q2 consolidated HBR was 88.3%, which was higher than our expectation driven by the Marketplace business. Let me provide an update on the 3 Marketplace pressure points we covered at Investor Day. Number one. As a reminder, we incurred a $175 million or $0.22 headwind compared to our prior expectations in the second quarter related to the 2020 risk adjustment year. For the 2021 risk adjustment year, we received Wakely data in June, and it was largely consistent with our expectations of shifting from being in a large payable position for 2020 to a slight receivable position for 2021. 
Number two, COVID costs. We previously provided insight that while COVID costs were falling from Q1, they were still higher on an absolute basis from what we had forecasted in April and May. We saw the COVID costs continue to decline in June, consistent with our expectation. But we will be watching external trends closely as COVID costs could reverse course and increase based upon macro COVID trends, as Michael indicated. 
Number three, pent-up demand. As previously disclosed, March and April Marketplace results were impacted by a broad return to the doctor's office in the outpatient setting, after which we saw a slight utilization downtick in May. We had expected a continued downdraft in June and the remainder of the year. Instead, June Marketplace medical costs trended higher compared to May. We now expect pent-up demand to subside at a slower rate in the back half of 2021. The activity is in the area of outpatient services for continuing members as well as members who are new to us in 2021 with a higher cost per claim due to mix of services as these member cohorts access health care. And though our SEP members only represent 20% of our membership, we are also seeing higher non-COVID-related inpatient utilization for this cohort who now has access to health care due to the expanded SEP rules. We expect these recently added SEP members to return to expected levels of utilization after initially accessing services.
Our team has isolated the heavier-utilizing cohorts through our real-time data and is taking action, where possible, including a slate of clinical initiatives designed to improve quality and curb trend. However, we do expect a higher HBR in Marketplace to drive the consolidated 2021 HBR, as we will cover in a minute, since some of the deferred demand will just have to work its way through the system during 2021. 
The remainder of our business as a whole performed consistent with our expectations in Q2. In Medicaid, we're seeing strong performance and a steady march toward normalized utilization, with this benefit largely offset by state rate actions and risk corridors. In Q1, we disclosed $550 million of such actions for 2021. This annual view increased in Q2 to $675 million. In Medicare Advantage, we continue to grow during the year, and we see a similar trend towards normal utilization. We have grown membership organically 25% since 12/31/2020. 
Moving to other P&L and balance sheet items. Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 7.7% in the second quarter compared to 8.5% last year and 8.1% in the first quarter of 2021. The adjusted SG&A expense ratio benefited from lower short-term variable compensation costs and the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues due to increased Medicaid membership and recent acquisitions. This was partially offset by increased sales and marketing costs as a result of the Marketplace SEP and growth in Medicare. Let me go deeper into the first item since it's important for you to understand drivers. 
Think of the HBR pressure caused by our Marketplace business and our short-term variable compensation as somewhat offsetting toggles. You'll also see this in our full year guidance elements. If the deferred demand bubble in Marketplace causes us to land toward the high end of our consolidated HBR guidance range, we would be toward the low end of our SG&A range because of a reduction in our short-term incentive plan for 2021. Think of this as a potential 35 basis point swing in those metrics. On the other hand, if pent-up demand and high new member utilization settles quickly and we come in toward the bottom of our HBR range, we would incur typical short-term incentives, which would have a corresponding effect of putting us toward the top of our SG&A range, and the outcome could be in between those bookend scenarios. While we recognize the current challenges in Marketplace, we have implemented a slate of mitigating initiatives, including operational, clinical and available pricing actions. Current performance does not change our perspective as we look out to our long-term margin goals. 
Continuing on highlights of the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations was $1.7 billion in the second quarter primarily driven by net earnings before the legal settlement reserve, which is expected to be paid in future periods. We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position of $1.1 billion of unregulated cash on our balance sheet at quarter end. Approximately $700 million of that was deployed on July 1, as we completed the acquisition of the remainder of Circle Health. Recall, we acquired 40% of Circle in 2019 and 2020 with the intention to subsequently acquire the remaining portion. Circle is a very well-positioned and leading ambulatory surgery center business in the U.K. and comes with a strong management team. We expect Circle to be above our company-targeted adjusted net income margin by 2023. Debt at quarter end was $16.8 billion. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 38.9%, excluding our nonrecourse debt. Our medical claims liability totaled $12.8 billion at quarter end and represents 48 days in claims payable compared to 49 in Q1. DCP was mechanically impacted by the timing of state-directed payments. 
We updated a few of the 2021 guidance elements based upon what we've seen through the second quarter and for the items we just discussed. While we are maintaining the same wide adjusted EPS range of $5.05 to $5.35, you will notice some changes in the underlying metrics, including higher revenue from continued growth in Medicare and Marketplace; delayed state pharmacy carve-outs; higher state pass-throughs of approximately $1 billion and a continued suspension of redeterminations; a higher HBR range, as we just discussed, solely due to our Marketplace business; a lower SG&A range due to the potential reduction of the short-term incentive plan, depending on how Marketplace pent-up demand plays out. But in addition, we are also getting some leverage on the higher revenue base. 
Overall, this continues to be a relatively wide range as we referenced at Investor Day, given the choppiness in our Marketplace product. We still have 6 months of the year to play out, especially with varying scenarios around the subsidence of pent-up demand and the unknowns with COVID. The guidance continues to exclude Magellan. It excludes our recent Magellan financing and Circle Health. 
We are determined to execute on our multiyear value-creation plan laid out at the recent Investor Day and achieve our long-term adjusted net income margin target of at least 3.3%. We have launched a formal program internally, encompassing all aspects of the organization marching in unison toward pulling the necessary levers to achieve the value-creation plan. We have developed some of these muscles over the past couple of years, such as the Centene Forward program for discrete initiatives, our HBR office for clinical quality and cost initiatives and the integration skills from past large acquisitions. As I said at Investor Day, this journey won't be a straight line, and the fruits of our labor are expected to show up more so in 2023 and 2024 than in 2022. But we know how to do this, and we are committed on taking the actions to deliver value creation to shareholders. What matters most is pulling the levers in the next 12 to 18 months to bear fruit in 2023 and 2024. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect it to strengthen even further as we improve margins and generate cash flow.

So that's consistent with our expectations. 
On the pent-up demand, certainly, it's the nature of the services, the outpatient nature. We've seen orthopedics, joint degeneration, unfortunately, some psychiatry and chemical dependency drivers in Marketplace and really, the outpatient pressure coming into a little bit in March and then April and May, and then it popped in June. 
The SEP members, I think I mentioned this in my script as well, we're seeing them access inpatient services. And then quickly -- while it's early, quickly returning to a more normalized utilization. It's early, so we're tracking that, and we're sort of managing this in those 4 cohorts."

One, I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that there's a possibility that redeterminations holiday get extended into 2022. I know at the Investor Day, you gave a guidance range for -- on revenues for 2022, your current expectations. Would the delay in redeterminations materially impact that revenue outlook if indeed that happened? And then the other thing I was going to just ask about is, as you're talking about this variation and because of the Delta variant, on your risk corridors on the Medicaid side, are you well into those now so that if there's a little variation in utilization, it's not going to really matter because you're sort of already at a point where you've given back to the state? Or those risk corridors not really lengthy to provide much protection in the back half of the year?"

So I'm interested if you're going to approach 2022 pricing really sort of based on actual expected cost trends and you're willing to sacrifice memberships, if necessary to do that. With the risk adjustment, do you feel that, that would be able to protect you against potential adverse selection that could occur?

26273,1681325251,2412540,"Centene Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2021",2021-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Centene Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and thank you for joining Centene's third quarter earnings call today.

Good morning, and thank you for joining Centene's third quarter earnings call today. As you will notice today, we are evolving our presentation format to a streamline version and with essential facts and commentary. I'm pleased to have Sarah London and Drew Asher joining me today. Brent Layton has a conflict that could not be avoided, but you can expect him to join us on future calls. 
First, on the quarter. We were pleased with the results and the fact that the matrix were straightforward with minimum noise. In the quarter, we generated revenue of $32.4 billion, an HBR of 88.1% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.26. Drew will provide additional context. 
Overall, the numbers reflect a return towards normal utilization, while still covering reasonable amounts of COVID costs, which seemed to have peaked in August. Importantly, our performance provides a strong foundation for our value creation plan, and we remain committed to our margin goals.
Further supporting our strategic progress during the quarter, we announced a series of organizational changes, including appointing Sarah London as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and Brent Layton as the company's President and Chief Operating Officer. 
I would also like to acknowledge that David Sort, an 18-year veteran of our Board of Directors, retired to pursue personal business interest. We do not plan to replace his position as we continue to work on refreshing and streamlining the Board to a size of 9 to 13 members.
Turning to the current landscape. Overall, the portfolio is performing well. We delivered a strong membership increase in Medicaid, are positioned for continued growth in Medicare, and we continue to stay the course in the marketplace. Sarah will provide further details. 
We are working closely with states on the timing of redetermination, which has so far been extended until January with the opportunity for additional extensions 3 months at a time. As redeterminations resume, I would like to remind you that not all states will be doing so at the same time.
In addition, we look forward to offering members who no longer qualify for Medicaid the opportunity to enroll in our marketplace product. We expect that advanced premium tax credits will keep costs in line for these members, and we value the opportunity to support continuity of care and preserve provider relationships, which, in the long term, leads to higher quality of care, which is much more cost effective.
Looking ahead to 2022, there are several additional factors we continue to monitor and evaluate. These include the pace of the RFP pipeline, ongoing growth in Medicare, the opportunity for improvement in marketplace launches as well as the COVID landscape overall. We will provide full detail on these factors and their potential impact as headwinds and tailwinds at our Investor Day in December.
In addition, we are committed to achieving an investment-grade rating and a disciplined capital allocation framework that takes into consideration our priorities, including investing in our business, debt management and share repurchases.
Before I close, I would like to highlight the importance of vaccine mandates in stopping the transmission of COVID and protecting those who cannot yet safely receive inoculations, particularly the immunologically compromised and young children for whom vaccine access is getting closer, but still pending. Centene has been a leader on this critical issue mandating vaccinations as a condition of employment. We also continue to support our members in assessing the vaccine to national outreach and campaigns and creative participation, such as the Football Hall of Fame and NASCAR. 
I would also like to remind you that this platform for vaccines has been in development for the past 25 years, and scientists are indicating is likely one of the safest vaccines ever development. 
In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter results and the sustained momentum across the enterprise. We remain focused on executing across the value creation playbook we have in place. As always, we intend to continue to provide transparent updates as we progress through our initiatives, and I look forward to seeing many of you at our December Investor Day.
Finally, I'd like to thank all our employees for their unwavering commitment and service throughout this unprecedented times. Thank you for your continued interests in Centene, and I would turn the call over to Sarah."

I'm going to provide highlights of our product line performance before touching on the early progress we are making around our value creation plan. During the quarter, we continued to build on our market-leadi",711,"Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide highlights of our product line performance before touching on the early progress we are making around our value creation plan. 
During the quarter, we continued to build on our market-leading position and are experiencing solid growth and good outcomes. In Medicaid, our business continues to perform well. Membership increased to $14.8 million, aided by continued suspension of redeterminations and the go-live of our business in North Carolina.
In Marketplace, with more than 90% of our membership receiving some form of subsidy, we maintained our low income focus and our commitment to providing health care access and affordability to our members. At the end of the third quarter, our Marketplace membership was 2.2 million, and we are pleased with the progress of our clinical initiatives as we head into the fourth quarter.
Looking ahead, our 2022 Marketplace offerings reflect the diverse and evolving needs of end better consumers. We are introducing a group of new products designed to optimize flexibility, access and affordability. In addition, we plan to grow our coverage map by entering 5 new states with Marketplace products.
As we continue to monitor policies and plans around the return of Medicaid redeterminations, we believe that our enhanced footprints within both Medicaid and Marketplace position Centene well to support our members with options for coverage continuity.
In Medicare Advantage, we continue to see a compelling growth opportunity for the company. We are expanding Centene's footprint to reach 48 million Medicare-eligible adults across the country, which is more than 75% of eligible beneficiaries. Today, Centene serves more than 1.2 million Medicare Advantage members across 33 states. Beginning in 2022, the company expects to offer plans in 327 new counties, representing a 26% increase and 3 new states, including Massachusetts, Nebraska and Oklahoma.
Now turning to our value creation plan. As we outlined this past June, we have embarked on our strategy to leverage Centene's size and scale and drive margin expansion through SG&A efficiencies, medical management initiatives and strategic capital deployment. We are focused on generating sustained growth and margin expansion. And although it is still very early, seeing the enterprise-wide commitment from the outset has given me confidence that we are on the right track to achieve our goal. Brent, Drew and I are leading this effort, and we believe we now have an organizational structure in place to drive this forward across our business and functions.
On the SG&A front, we have identified opportunities across the company where we believe we can be more efficient. This isn't about cost-cutting, it's about positioning the company for long-term success. For example, we piloted new technology within our call centers for use by Centene employees. This technology trial yielded significant reductions in cycle times and now will be rolled out enterprise-wide.
Another opportunity we've mentioned as a value creation target is pharmacy. As we alluded to in June, we are now taking steps toward consolidating down to a single PBM platform and rationalizing those platforms we view as nonessential. We began this work in Q3 and look forward to providing more detail around this overall program in December.
In addition, we are progressing on the review and potential sale of certain non-core assets as part of our portfolio optimization process, which has taken on an increased focus as part of the value creation plan. Again, we are in the very early stages. And as we continue to leverage our size and scale to our benefit, these are just a few of the many levers we are pulling to achieve our adjusted net income margin target of at least 3.3%. Let me remind you that as we progress through these and other initiatives, particularly in 2023 and 2024, we anticipate seeing a greater impact pushing us toward our goal.
Before handing the call over to Drew, let me provide a quick update on the Magellan transaction. We are still awaiting one final regulatory approval in California and continue to expect the deal to close by the end of 2021. We continue to work with the regulators to move the transaction to completion. 
Now let me turn the call over to Drew to provide more details on our third quarter performance and our updated outlook."

This morning, we reported third quarter 2021 results, including $32.4 billion in revenue, an increase of 11% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.26.  Revenue grew by $3.3 billion compared t",816,"Thank you, Sarah. This morning, we reported third quarter 2021 results, including $32.4 billion in revenue, an increase of 11% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.26.  Revenue grew by $3.3 billion compared to the third quarter of 2020 and total membership increased of 26.5 million, up 5% compared to a year ago. Our Q3 consolidated HBR was 88.1%, right on track with our full year guidance.
At a webcast presentation in mid-September, we provided insights into the first 2 months of the quarter. As a reminder, in July, we saw subsidence in pent-up demand in our Marketplace business, followed in August by a spike in COVID costs due to the Delta variant. Consistent with national data, our COVID costs peaked in late August, dropped throughout September and the sharp drop of COVID cost continues in October. While the Delta variant had a higher peak, as measured in authorizations compared to January 2021, it peaked and fell rather quickly. With our diversified enterprise, we were able to manage through this given our steady performance in Medicaid and Medicare. Accordingly, we are maintaining the midpoint of our consolidated HBR range for 2021, just shrinking the width of the range since we're 3 quarters through the year.
Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.6% in the third quarter, with higher short-term variable incentive compensation costs compared to Q2 given the positive trajectory of the business. While we are getting some SG&A leverage on our growth in 2021, there's a lot more to come over the next few years as we execute on the value creation plan.
One item to point out from a mix standpoint circle a well-positioned ASC like hospital enterprise in England has an SG&A rate in the 30s on service fee revenue of approximately $1.4 billion. This has an approximate 30 basis point mathematical impact on our consolidated SG&A rate for Q3 2021 and going forward. 
Continuing on highlights of the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations in the third quarter was strong at $1.8 billion. With respect to unregulated cash, we had $2.7 billion at quarter end, which includes the $1.8 billion we borrowed to partially fund the Magellan transaction. We expect to need approximately $2.3 billion of unregulated cash to close Magellan in the fourth quarter.
Debt at quarter end was $18.8 billion. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 41.2%, inclusive of Magellan financing and excluding our nonrecourse debt. Our medical claims liability totaled $14.1 billion at quarter end and represents 51 days in claims payable compared to 48 in Q2. This 3-day increase was driven by the timing of state-directed payments claims payments and state fee schedule changes.
You'll see a couple of items in our GAAP to adjusted EPS reconciliation, a $309 million onetime gain as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 60% of Circle in early July 2021 and a write-down of our investment in RxAdvance of $229 million in the quarter as we are simplifying our pharmacy operations. Both of these are noncash items.
Before we get to updated 2021 guidance, I want to comment on the recently announced rating year 2022 Star scores. This will drive 2023 Medicare revenue. We are certainly pleased with over 50% of membership and 4-star contracts and our first 5-star contract. Rating year 2022 benefited from the continuation of disaster provisions due to COVID. With an expectation of those provisions sunsetting and upon reviewing the in-process results of our quality program, we expect rating year 2023 scores to drop followed by a subsequent jump in rating year 2024 scores. This essentially has the effect of providing some fungible investment dollars for calendar year 2023.
We've updated our full year 2021 outlook, including a narrowed adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.05 to $5.15. This outlook incorporates revenues within a range of $125.2 billion to $126.4 billion, increased by the inclusion of Circle and expected state-related pass-through payments of $500 million. It includes an expected HBR of 87.6% to 88.0% and an SG&A ratio of 8.2% to 8.6%, 20 basis points higher than the prior guidance, with the largest driver being the mixed math on Circle as we just discussed.
While we still have a quarter to go to finish 2021, the strength of our diversified enterprise has enabled us to manage through the volatility of COVID, pent-up demand and resulting 2021 Marketplace pressure. This enterprise strength will only improve as we execute on the value creation plan over the next few years.
With regards to 2022, consistent with our public comments in September, we continue to expect modest adjusted EPS growth next year. We look forward to providing more details around 2022 expectations and going more in depth into the long-term value creation drivers during our December 10 Investor Day.

With respect to the quarter, as I mentioned, we saw subsidence in pent-up demand in July, which was good to see.

But you're right, the strength of Medicare and Medicaid were carried through the portfolio as a whole.

As Michael said, look, this is a choppy and difficult year in Marketplace with the various COVID impacts, including the pent-up demand in Q2 and the risk adjustment changes that CMS made earlier this year.

So making sure that we have the right talent and we have the right tools. Obviously, APYXEO is a piece of that, but we think there are others. There are pieces of that, that we are developing ourselves. So that, I think, is a real foundational piece of all of this. And then being able to reinvest the savings that we get from those efficiencies to continue sort of the flywheel of value creation is also part of the plan.
And then relative to the divestitures, I think the answer varies -- will vary on a case-by-case basis. And in some cases, that has to do with positioning assets in such a way that we think they will be beneficial to longer-term strategy in different areas, whether that's around provider enablement further domains that we think are important as we move to value-based arrangements or core tools that we think will have a greater benefit to the broader industry.

Good morning, and thank you for joining Centene's Third Quarter Earnings Call today. As you will notice today, we are evolving our presentation format to a streamline version and with essential facts and commentary. I'm pleased to have Sarah London and Drew Asher joining me today. Brent Layton has a conflict that could not be avoided, but you can expect him to join us on future calls. 
First, on the quarter. We were pleased with the results and the fact that the matrix were straightforward with minimum noise. In the quarter, we generated revenue of $32.4 billion, an HBR of 88.1% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.26. Drew will provide additional context. 
Overall, the numbers reflect a return towards normal utilization, while still covering reasonable amounts of COVID costs, which seemed to have peaked in August. Importantly, our performance provides a strong foundation for our value creation plan, and we remain committed to our margin goals.
Further supporting our strategic progress during the quarter, we announced a series of organizational changes, including appointing Sarah London as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and Brent Layton as the company's President and Chief Operating Officer.  
I would also like to acknowledge that David Steward, an 18-year veteran of our Board of Directors, retired to pursue personal business interest. We do not plan to replace his position as we continue to work on refreshing and streamlining the Board to a size of 9 to 13 members.
Turning to the current landscape. Overall, the portfolio is performing well. We delivered a strong membership increase in Medicaid, our position for continued growth in Medicare, and we continue to stay the course in the marketplace. Sarah will provide further details. 
We are working closely with states on the timing of redetermination, which has so far been extended until January with the opportunity for additional extensions 3 months at a time. As redeterminations do resume, I would like to remind you that not all states will be doing so at the same time.
In addition, we look forward to offering members who no longer qualify for Medicaid the opportunity to enroll in our marketplace product. We expect that advanced premium tax credits will keep costs in line for these members, and we value the opportunity to support continuity of care and preserve provider relationships, which, in the long term, leads to higher quality of care, which is much more cost effective.
Looking ahead to 2022, there are several additional factors we continue to monitor and evaluate. These include the pace of the RFP pipeline, ongoing growth in Medicare, the opportunity for improvement in marketplace launches as well as the COVID landscape overall. We will provide full detail on these factors and their potential impact as headwinds and tailwinds at our Investor Day in December.
In addition, we are committed to achieving an investment-grade rating and a disciplined capital allocation framework that takes into consideration our priorities, including investing in our business, debt management and share repurchases. 
Before I close, I would like to highlight the importance of vaccine mandates in stopping the transmission of COVID and protecting those who cannot yet safely receive inoculations, particularly the immunologically compromised and young children for whom vaccine access is getting closer, but still pending. Centene has been a leader on this critical issue mandating vaccinations as a condition of employment. We also continue to support our members in assessing the vaccine to national outreach and campaigns and creative participation, such as the Pro Football Hall of Fame and NASCAR.  
I would also like to remind you that this platform for vaccines has been in development for the past 25 years, and scientists are indicating it's likely one of the safest vaccines ever developed. 
In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter results and the sustained momentum across the enterprise. We remain focused on executing across the value creation playbook we have in place. As always, we intend to continue to provide transparent updates as we progress through our initiatives, and I look forward to seeing many of you at our December Investor Day.
Finally, I'd like to thank all our employees for their unwavering commitment and service throughout this unprecedented times. Thank you for your continued interests in Centene, and I would turn the call over to Sarah."

I'm going to provide highlights of our product line performance before touching on the early progress we are making around our value creation plan. During the quarter, we continued to build on our market-leading",711,"Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide highlights of our product line performance before touching on the early progress we are making around our value creation plan. During the quarter, we continued to build on our market-leading position and are experiencing solid growth and good outcomes. In Medicaid, our business continues to perform well. Membership increased to 14.8 million, aided by continued suspension of redeterminations and the go-live of our business in North Carolina.
In Marketplace, with more than 90% of our membership receiving some form of subsidy, we maintained our low income focus and our commitment to providing health care access and affordability to our members. At the end of the third quarter, our Marketplace membership was 2.2 million, and we are pleased with the progress of our clinical initiatives as we head into the fourth quarter. 
Looking ahead, our 2022 Marketplace offerings reflect the diverse and evolving needs of end better consumers. We are introducing a group of new products designed to optimize flexibility, access and affordability. In addition, we plan to grow our coverage map by entering 5 new states with Marketplace products.
As we continue to monitor policies and plans around the return of Medicaid redeterminations, we believe that our enhanced footprints within both Medicaid and Marketplace position Centene well to support our members with options for coverage continuity.
In Medicare Advantage, we continue to see a compelling growth opportunity for the company. We are expanding Centene's footprint to reach 48 million Medicare-eligible adults across the country, which is more than 75% of eligible beneficiaries. Today, Centene serves more than 1.2 million Medicare Advantage members across 33 states. Beginning in 2022, the company expects to offer plans in 327 new counties, representing a 26% increase and 3 new states, including Massachusetts, Nebraska and Oklahoma.
Now turning to our value creation plan. As we outlined this past June, we have embarked on our strategy to leverage Centene's size and scale and drive margin expansion through SG&A efficiencies, medical management initiatives and strategic capital deployment. We are focused on generating sustained growth and margin expansion. And although it is still very early, seeing the enterprise-wide commitment from the outset has given me confidence that we are on the right track to achieve our goal. Brent, Drew and I are leading this effort, and we believe we now have an organizational structure in place to drive this forward across our business and functions. 
On the SG&A front, we have identified opportunities across the company where we believe we can be more efficient. This isn't about cost-cutting, it's about positioning the company for long-term success. For example, we piloted new technology within our call centers for use by Centene employees. This technology trial yielded significant reductions in cycle times and now will be rolled out enterprise-wide. 
Another opportunity we've mentioned as a value creation target is pharmacy. As we alluded to in June, we are now taking steps toward consolidating down to a single PBM platform and rationalizing those platforms we view as nonessential. We began this work in Q3 and look forward to providing more detail around this overall program in December. 
In addition, we are progressing on the review and potential sale of certain non-core assets as part of our portfolio optimization process, which has taken on an increased focus as part of the value creation plan. Again, we are in the very early stages and as we continue to leverage our size and scale to our benefit, these are just a few of the many levers we are pulling to achieve our adjusted net income margin target of at least 3.3%. Let me remind you that as we progress through these and other initiatives, particularly in 2023 and 2024, we anticipate seeing a greater impact pushing us toward our goal.
Before handing the call over to Drew, let me provide a quick update on the Magellan transaction. We are still awaiting one final regulatory approval in California and continue to expect the deal to close by the end of 2021. We continue to work with the regulators to move the transaction to completion.  
Now let me turn the call over to Drew to provide more details on our third quarter performance and our updated outlook."

This morning, we reported third quarter 2021 results, including $32.4 billion in revenue, an increase of 11% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.26. Revenue grew by $3.3 billion compared to",815,"Thank you, Sarah. This morning, we reported third quarter 2021 results, including $32.4 billion in revenue, an increase of 11% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.26. Revenue grew by $3.3 billion compared to the third quarter of 2020 and total membership increased to 26.5 million, up 5% compared to a year ago. Our Q3 consolidated HBR was 88.1%, right on track with our full year guidance. 
At a webcast presentation in mid-September, we provided insights into the first 2 months of the quarter. As a reminder, in July, we saw subsidence in pent-up demand in our Marketplace business, followed in August by a spike in COVID cost due to the Delta variant. Consistent with national data, our COVID cost peaked in late August, dropped throughout September and the sharp drop of COVID cost continues in October. While the Delta variant had a higher peak, as measured in authorizations compared to January 2021, it peaked and fell rather quickly. With our diversified enterprise, we were able to manage through this given our steady performance in Medicaid and Medicare. Accordingly, we are maintaining the midpoint of our consolidated HBR range for 2021, just shrinking the width of the range since we're 3/4 through the year. 
Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.6% in the third quarter, with higher short-term variable incentive compensation costs compared to Q2 given the positive trajectory of the business. While we are getting some SG&A leverage on our growth in 2021, there's a lot more to come over the next few years as we execute on the value creation plan. 
One item to point out from a mix standpoint, Circle, a well-positioned ASC like hospital enterprise in England has an SG&A rate in the 30s on service fee revenue of approximately $1.4 billion. This has an approximate 30 basis point mathematical impact on our consolidated SG&A rate for Q3 2021 and going forward.  
Continuing on highlights of the quarter. Cash flow provided by operations in the third quarter was strong at $1.8 billion. With respect to unregulated cash, we had $2.7 billion at quarter end, which includes the $1.8 billion we borrowed to partially fund the Magellan transaction. We expect to need approximately $2.3 billion of unregulated cash to close Magellan in the fourth quarter. 
Debt at quarter end was $18.8 billion. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 41.2%, inclusive of Magellan financing and excluding our nonrecourse debt. Our medical claims liability totaled $14.1 billion at quarter end and represents 51 days in claims payable compared to 48 in Q2. This 3-day increase was driven by the timing of state-directed payments, claims payments and state fee schedule changes. 
You'll see a couple of items in our GAAP to adjusted EPS reconciliation, a $309 million onetime gain as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 60% of Circle in early July 2021 and a write-down of our investment in RxAdvance of $229 million in the quarter as we are simplifying our pharmacy operations. Both of these are noncash items. 
Before we get to updated 2021 guidance, I want to comment on the recently announced rating year 2022 Star scores. This will drive 2023 Medicare revenue. We are certainly pleased with over 50% of membership and 4-star contracts and our first 5-star contract. Rating year 2022 benefited from the continuation of disaster provisions due to COVID with an expectation of those provisions sunsetting and upon reviewing the in-process results of our quality program, we expect rating year 2023 scores to drop followed by a subsequent jump in rating year 2024 scores. This essentially has the effect of providing some fungible investment dollars for calendar year 2023.
We've updated our full year 2021 outlook, including a narrowed adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.05 to $5.15. This outlook incorporates revenues within a range of $125.2 billion to $126.4 billion, increased by the inclusion of Circle and expected state-related pass-through payments of $500 million. It includes an expected HBR of 87.6% to 88.0% and an SG&A ratio of 8.2% to 8.6%, 20 basis points higher than the prior guidance, with the largest driver being the mixed math on Circle as we just discussed. 
While we still have a quarter to go to finish 2021, the strength of our diversified enterprise has enabled us to manage through the volatility of COVID, pent-up demand and resulting 2021 Marketplace pressure. This enterprise strength will only improve as we execute on the value creation plan over the next few years. 
With regards to 2022, consistent with our public comments in September, we continue to expect modest adjusted EPS growth next year. We look forward to providing more details around 2022 expectations and going more in depth into the long-term value creation drivers during our December 10 Investor Day.

And then being able to reinvest the savings that we get from those efficiencies to continue sort of the flywheel of value creation is also part of the plan.
And then relative to the divestitures, I think the answer varies -- will vary on a case-by-case basis. And in some cases, that has to do with positioning assets in such a way that we think they will be beneficial to longer-term strategy in different areas, whether that's around provider enablement further domains that we think are important as we move to value-based arrangements or core tools that we think will have a greater benefit to the broader industry. So it really is on a case-by-case basis. And as we get through those, our intention would be to provide a broader rationale for all of that decision-making."

Now if it's a no, there will still be human intervention because we're not going to have that. But I think we were talking yesterday in technology. Probably 2/3 of these cases are approved using the AI. We've rolled it out to 5 or 6 states now. So it's well tested. 
But that's an example. So all of a sudden, we now have the ability to take a nurse and move her from the routine -- from the monotonous reading charts to doing things in case managing, and that creates a much more productive environment. I just used that as an example that makes it real as to how we're overcoming the labor issues."
