Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start from taking a look back to 2020, which we all know was a very different year for all of us, to say the least. in preparation for today call, I briefly reviewed what we were thinking and what we were sharing during the last year, starting from 12 months back and then 9, 6 and just 3 months ago. 
I think it tells an interesting story. February last year, still full of hope for another practically normal year for us with 20-plus percent organic growth, focusing on our adaptive enterprise story and in short, looking optimistically into 2020. Just 3 months later, we are still reporting 26% constant currency growth for Q1. We, like everybody else at the time, didn't understand at all where we would end up and what we would have to do to go over this very uncertain and very fast worsening situation. The situation, when more than 30% of our client portfolio experienced some form of revenue impact, we practically had to reorganize ourselves on the line and to start preparation for a very defensive play for protecting as a first priority will be in power people and ensuring continued liquidity and viability of our business. 
When thinking about the time now, really would like to share again our deep appreciation to the thousand EPAMers who did everything possible to support each other as a company, to our clients for trusting us with their most critical issues, and to our many extended communities around the world. 
At that point, we really didn't know how the 2020 would end up for us and for our clients. In another 3 months, to our surprise, we saw the first signs of some stabilization and client realization of new reality and necessity to start preparing for the future, which will be impacted by such new reality for a long enough period, if not forever. It pushed our drive for agility and an urgent need to adaptive enterprise transformation even further. Time was very condensed and made us as a company become much more closely connected by sharing information and making decision much faster than ever before. At this point, we also realized that while our original plans for 2020 will not be in line with our financial performance realities, most of these planned changes, which we outlined for ourselves back in normal times, will be very much accelerating from strategic transformational standpoints. 
During the period, we ended also several large new logos and started to see that we will take an increasingly larger share of our portfolio across several existing strategic for our clients, which was encouraging. Finally, just 3 months ago, while seeing many new geopolitical turbulences in locations where we operate and have significant presence, we still become comfortable enough to remind everybody again and to our sales, first of all, the goal we stated 12 months back in our last Investor Day, the goal of turning EPAM into a truly adaptive company. We become comfortable simply because of our realization of how much we advance for -- to the growth during those all around very challenging 9 months. 
Thanks to our investments into integrated consulting with EPAM Continuum, into cloud-enabled business transformation efforts and data analytics, AI and the test set of capabilities, strongly supported by our engineering DNA and be much more flexible, scalable and distributed delivery locations and delivery models, enabled in turn by our digital tie in productivity knowledge and educational platform or our EPAM anywhere per time. 
We believe all those investments are paying back and preparing us strongly for the future growth. In regard to EPAM Continuum, I would like to mention also that today, we see not only recognition of these new service offerings from leading analysts, but encouraging take of the new proposition from a broad base of clients around the world and across our verticals in insurance and financial services, consumer and life sciences, to name a few. 
Our approach to EPAM Continuum goes beyond our working market, but extended very much into cross-pollination of all EPAM capabilities and experiences through network organizational approach comprised of people, tools and shared ways of working, which should enable us to build global, agile and expert teams more quickly and more efficiently. 
While this work is ongoing and represents a significant portion of our investment agenda, we are seeing strong results today in our current portfolio, results that are driving higher value for customers and that enable -- enabling EPAM to scale larger and complex program faster than ever in the past. 
During last year, we shared several specific studies already. Those included at [indiscernible] story as well as a large health care technology platform, which not just became our fastest-growing client in 2020, but is already among our top 10 clients currently. 
In addition to those, let us share 2 short new stories. The first one started just over a year ago as an agile engineering program as a top 10 global property and casualty insurance giant. Since then, EPAM has become the go-to transformation and IT strategy and implementation partner, helping the company to transform its IT and digital project functions to accelerate cloud transformation journey and to position the company for innovation through a combination of the strategy consulting and engineering implementation services. 
The second is very recent engagement for global retail and wholesale pharmacy leader. EPAM provides full value stream services, including product management, design, end-to-end engineering. The client is building an omnichannel care management product, including clinical, physical services, device and digital elements and is making full use of our integrated research experience, consulting physical digital product design, on top of our traditional engineering capabilities. 
So everything I've mentioned is made possible by the ongoing investment in our business, which will remain our consistent priority, and we do expect indeed even higher levels of investment in 2021 to keep place with our growth needs. 
Moving on to our numbers, and let's start from 2020 results. For fiscal 2020, we ended at close to $2.7 billion in revenues, reflecting 16% year-over-year constant currency growth, which included double-digit growth in the majority of our industry verticals. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.34, a 17% increase over fiscal 2019. Lastly, we generated $476 million of free cash flow for the year. A result, it was more than 2.5x the average of our last 4 years. 
For the people front, for the year, we welcomed more than 4,400 new net employees to EPAM across our client-facing teams and corporate functions. At this point, I would like to remind also that during all 2020, we were very consistently repeating the very simple statement. We strongly believe our position as a leading provider of digital product and platform engineering services, combined with our maturing consulting expertise, is our key differentiator. And we are confident in our ability to come out of this challenging time, a more value-based and result-driven company that will continue growing as the post-pandemic environment at a 20%-plus organic growth rate again. 
It wasn't an obvious statement, especially at the beginning. But we think that what was happening during the past 12 months is very telling. From our practically worst quarter ever with a sequential drop in revenue in Q2 to probably the best sequential growth we saw during the last decade when we increased revenue in Q4 2020 by almost 11% in comparison with our Q3 result. So looking ahead to 2021, we see a market that continues to be very active and want to demonstrate strong demand for our services. With the events of the past year, our clients are adapting to changing landscape, which requires hybrid business models and different ways of interacting with their customers in the end market. This requires even faster pace of transformation. The organization of application as well as the building of expansion of the platform with connect and power enterprise, enabled first by the cloud and the need for really co-innovation partners. It means that we will have to lead large-scale transformation with consulting, product development engagement with design, data monetization and process optimization engagement with analytics, digital technology and custom platform development engagement with engineering. And all of those to be led by strong alignment with our clients and some other key platform partners. 
Regarding market size. In the past, we spoke about EPAM positioning in the fast-growing digital platform product engineering segment, which analysts estimate to be more than $150 billion. While we still firmly position us with such a segment, we are seeing enhanced opportunities for EPAM to play in the broad application development and cloud integration services market, which leading analysts are to projecting be resurging in the post-pandemic environment, in comparison -- in combination of custom software development, cloud-native integration work, technology consulting and training services, and which represents a total over $700 billion in 2021 alone or about 60% of the total global IT services market. 
While thinking about this in context of new demand for EPAM and the lagging effect of the pandemic to our customers, we still anticipate some continued disruption in a few of our customers and markets and probably longer-term damage for certain industries. However, today, when 2020 is already in the past and while we are obviously still not being out of post-pandemic timezone and specific geopolitical risks, we do believe the 2021 will be a year of to 20-plus percent growth organically. 
With that, let me hand the call over to Jason to provide more specifics in our 2020 results and our annual business outlook, which we are presuming for fiscal 2021."
4773318,701217828,2215209,"EPAM Systems, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","EPAM Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone.

We are pleased with our 2020 fiscal year performance, especially given the dynamic environment. Our results demonstrate the durability of our portfolio, adaptability of our people and highlight EPAM's ability to meet the needs of clients even during challenging times. 
In the fourth quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $723.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 14.3% on a reported basis and 13.7% in constant currency terms, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately 60 basis points. Revenue came in higher than previously guided due to our ability to expand our delivery capacity in response to a stronger-than-anticipated demand environment. Revenues also benefited somewhat from the aforementioned foreign exchange contribution. 
Our industry vertical performance in Q4 produced very strong sequential improvement, driven by a higher level of growth from both new work and existing clients and revenue from new customer relationships established over the last 12 months. 
Looking at year-over-year performance across this group. Life Sciences & Healthcare grew 24%. Growth in the quarter was driven by data and analytics, platform development to support new business models and client investments to improve R&D efficiency. Business information and media delivered 16.2% growth in the quarter. 
Financial services grew 16.1% with growth coming from traditional banking, insurance and, to a lesser degree, wealth management. Software & Hi-Tech grew 14.3% in the quarter. Travel and Consumer returned to growth and increased 5.4% year-over-year. In Q4, we saw strong growth from our consumer clients, along with solid and improving performance within retail as clients made investments in response to the dramatic changes in their operating environments. 
Finally, our emerging vertical delivered 13.1% growth, driven by clients in telecommunications, automotive and materials. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 59.9% of our Q4 revenues, grew 14% year-over-year or 13.7% in constant currency. Europe, representing 32% of our Q4 revenues, grew 11.8% year-over-year or 7.5% in constant currency. CIS, representing 5.2% of our Q4 revenues, grew 22.9% year-over-year and 45.2% in constant currency. Similar to Q3, growth in the CIS region was driven primarily by clients in financial services and materials. 
And finally, APAC grew 39.4% year-over-year or 35.7% in constant currency terms and now represents 2.9% of our revenues. APAC growth in the quarter was primarily driven by clients in financial services. In the fourth quarter, year-over-year growth in our top 20 clients was 16.6%, and growth outside our top 20 clients was 12.8%. 
And moving down the income statement. As mentioned last quarter, we continue to run the business with a cost base that is lower than previous levels. While the lower cost base is driven by operational efficiencies we have delivered across the business, there are also temporary contributors, including reduced travel, relocations and certain administrative expenses producing lower levels of SG&A spend over the last 3 quarters. 
Looking forward, we expect a higher level of cost in a post-pandemic environment, but anticipate that some of the efficiency benefits may be maintained longer term. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.6% compared to 35.2% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 36.9% compared to 36.7% for the same quarter last year. 
GAAP SG&A was 17.8% of revenue compared to 19.8% in Q4 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 16.2% of revenue compared to 18.1% in the same period of last year. Our SG&A results continue to see short-term benefits from the previously mentioned items. 
GAAP income from operations was $112 million or 15.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $84.7 million or 13.4% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $135.9 million or 18.8% of revenue in the quarter compared to $107.6 million or 17% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 16.2%, which includes a lower-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 22.6%. 
Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.46. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.81, reflecting a 19.9% increase over the same quarter in fiscal 2019. In Q4, there were approximately 58.8 million diluted shares outstanding. 
Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $159.3 million compared to $124.6 million in the same quarter for 2019. Free cash flow was $140.9 million compared to $77.6 million in the same quarter last year, resulting in a 133% conversion of adjusted net income. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
In Q4, DSO was 64 days, the lowest in at least 5 years, and compares to 70 days at the end of Q3 2020 and 72 days in the same quarter last year. We are very pleased with this performance and believe we can manage future DSO levels in the upper 60s. 
Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended this quarter with approximately 36,700 engineers, designers and consultants, a year-over-year increase of 12.8% and a sequential increase of 8.8%, our highest quarterly increase in the last 5 years. Our total headcount for Q4 was more than 41,100 employees, a net addition of more than 3,100 EPAMers from the previous quarter. Utilization was 77.9%, consistent with Q4 of last year and down from 78.2% in Q3 2020. 
Turning to results for the 2020 full fiscal year. Revenues closed at $2.66 billion or 15.9% reported growth over 2019 and 16% on a constant currency basis. During fiscal 2020, our acquisitions contributed approximately 100 basis points to our growth. 
GAAP income from operations was $379.3 million, an increase of 25.3% year-over-year and represented 14.3% of revenue. Our non-GAAP income from operations was $472.7 million, an increase of 21.5% over the prior year and represented 17.8% of revenue. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year came in at 13.6%. Excluding the impact of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and certain onetime adjustments, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.6%. 
Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $5.60. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and other certain onetime items, was $6.34, reflecting a 17% increase over fiscal 2019 and higher than our prepandemic expectations of $6.30. 
In fiscal 2020, there were approximately 58.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And finally, cash flow from operations was $544.4 million compared to $287.5 million for fiscal 2019. And free cash flow was $475.6 million, reflecting a 128% adjusted net income conversion. 
Now let's turn to guidance. Given the relative stability as well as improved visibility across the portfolio, we are resuming our full year guidance for fiscal 2021. While we anticipate growth patterns across the industry verticals to vary throughout the year, we expect our diversified portfolio to drive growth more in line with prepandemic levels. At the same time, we will be investing at elevated levels across the business to make certain we have sufficient resources to meet renewed demand. Additionally, we will increasingly be investing in new geographies to support our long-term growth. One area of focus in 2021 will be the creation of the infrastructure to support a larger and increasingly global EPAM. 
Starting with our full year outlook. Revenue growth will be at least 23% on a reported basis and in constant currency terms will be at least 22% after factoring in a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. Our income from operations reflects a higher level of investment in the planned expansion of our capabilities and geographies in 2021. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 12% and and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. 
For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.65 to $6.86 for the full year and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $7.20 to $7.41 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 59 million fully diluted shares outstanding. 
For Q1 of FY '21, we expect revenues to be in the range of $757 million to $765 million, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 17% at the midpoint of the range. In Q1, we expect the favorable impact of foreign exchange on revenue growth to be approximately 2%. 
For the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 1% and non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. We anticipate our GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter will be impacted by a higher level of excess tax benefits related to the vesting of restricted stock units in connection to our annual compensation cycle. 
For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.66 to $1.74 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.70 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59 million diluted shares outstanding. 
Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expenses is expected to be approximately $86.5 million, with $22.5 million in Q1, $20 million in q2 and $22 million in the remaining quarters. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $12.5 million for the year, evenly spread across each quarter. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $5.5 million loss for the year, with $1 million for Q1 and the balance evenly spread across each remaining quarter. The tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $21.6 million for the year, with $5.1 million for Q1 and Q2 and $5.7 million in each remaining quarter. 
And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $51.5 million for the full year, with approximately $24.5 million in Q1, $13.5 million in Q2 and $6.8 million in each remaining quarter. In summary, we are pleased with the high-quality results we delivered in fiscal 2020 and are encouraged by what lies ahead in 2021.

Should we start to think about verticals that -- like FI growing a lot faster than some of your other verticals? Or how should we think about the mix kind of going forward?"

And again, we believe that with still with our size, which is definitely growing, this type of volatility depending on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 large accounts could be still in place. So it's, I think, difficult to say. 
And if you look at it quarter-by-quarter, it was changing champions practically all the time. So I think in general, it would be something similar at least for this year. And there is unpredictability, but some industries which is the most impacted by COVID might actually start to invest even more like we see in retail, for example. Or even travels might start investing more to prepare for common work. 
So sorry, but difficult to predict."

So I think the first thing I would say is that our guide is expected to communicate that we do feel that sort of the middle point of the guided range of 16.5% to 17.5% or 17% is really kind of how we're thinking about the business next year.

And if I sort of break it into 2 components, we expect that SG&A will go up somewhat as a percentage of revenue. So I think we exited the full year at about 16.4%. I think for the full year of 2021, you'd be looking at something heading towards 17%. And some of that is additional investments in the business, and some of that is the return to some amount of normalcy in spending later in the year. But you can see that there's still some benefit that results from that because prior to the pandemic, we were running at over 18%. 
Now from a gross margin standpoint, what we expect is that we'll continue to see strong growth as evidenced by our guide on the top line. We do think that we'll continue to make investments in growing the business. That will include traditional sort of headcount additions and all the infrastructure that's required to attract talent and bring talent into the company. But then it also will include an expansion in geographies, Poland, India, Mexico, maybe other places in Latin America and other places in Europe. And so those investments, at least probably in 2021, have a somewhat negative impact on gross margin. With the idea that they're subscale at this point, we need to grow them rapidly. And then as they get closer to scale, they'll have more consistent profitability. 
And so the guide kind of incorporates, again, a somewhat elevated level of SG&A, maybe a slightly lower level of gross margin, again, as we invest in our infrastructure so that we can increasingly become a much larger and, of course, more global company."

So as Ark indicated, so we would grow more naturally -- we've grown more rapidly naturally in some of these other geographies. But Belarus is part of what we're looking at this point. And we probably will see some employees who may help us stand up operations in Lithuania and may help us grow pull and even further. From a gross margin standpoint, when you start a brand-new facility from scratch, kind of the way we did in Lithuania, it is going to have -- initially, you'll have very low utilization, you'll have additional infrastructure costs that aren't necessarily carried by rates. But again, those are relatively modest facilities. In the case of Poland, where we're still subscale, it's got somewhat lower levels of profitability than a couple of our at-scale operations like you would find in Belarus and Ukraine. So that's part of -- again, it's a more rapid growth rate in those entities, which have a somewhat lower level of profitability. And then, David, I think, longer term, as we get those countries and those individual delivery centers up to a more appropriate scale, I think you'll see an evening out of the profitability and the gross margin."

First of all, like prediction of changes was like multiple years ago. Even internally, we started very specific programs how to establish a much more flexible environment for people and to support high distribution, but not to lose in quality and how to find the right talent like in any locations around the world. And we started this like practically 3 years ago here. And COVID become a real accelerator for this source, and we felt probably a little bit more prepared than we expected before. So -- and that's one part of the story. And clearly, client-by-client there are different situation. But for sure, there are more acceptance than it was 12 months ago. And it helps to experiment and kind of to build additional proofs for much more distributed model. That's all happening. 
On another side, when you're talking about cost factors, it's also has a multiple attributes there because there are simple thinking that which cost will be saved, but you have to invest more in this distributed virtual infrastructure. Sometimes it's increase in wage inflation because acceptance of distributed model becoming bigger, and actually, competition for the talent growing as well. So there are too many moving parts right now to say how it would change the cost model."

And I think that does kind of distort the top 20 growth rate. I do think that you will see some growth from some of the larger customers in the top 20 in fiscal year 2021. And at the same time, from -- internally, when we look at the statistics for new logo revenues, in new customer revenues, which are customers that began generating revenue within the last 12 months, we're seeing that those are increasing as a percentage of total revenue.

And so again, what we -- it's interesting, as many of you have noted, is that we're already seeing growth again in our Travel and Hospitality. And it's not because travel has improved, but because there are retailers and consumer goods companies who are making quite significant investments right now to revisit their business while either to expand an existing e-commerce strategy, to create one, to find different ways to connect with customers, to deliver products with customers. So you are seeing a lot of lot of spending in that area. You're seeing a lot of spending in manufacturing, again, with more sort of a digital connection. And so I think you will see growth in some of these customers that are relatively small for us.

Wage inflation in 2020 was probably more in the 5% to 6% range and probably would stay in the 5% to 6% range in 2021, and so maybe a somewhat elevated level of wage inflation. And pricing is, again, it's kind of a mixed environment where newer engagements, particularly with the high demand for resources and again the robust demand for the type of work that we do provides some opportunities.

And I think Ark said it at the very beginning of the call, which is, it's a little bit hard to predict which customer is going to drive the growth with absolute certainty in a given fiscal year. We certainly are seeing some customers in the top 20 that we think are still going to have high levels of growth. We're seeing a few that are going to slow down. One thing I could call out is that we've had very high growth with large customers in the business information media space. We continue to have very significant relationships with a number of those clients who are now very much in our top 10. We think that we might not see as much growth in fiscal year 2021 as we -- certainly as we saw in 2020. We've got growth coming from some new manufacturing customers. We've got some growth coming from some IT customers with more of a health care flavor to them. And so again, I think you are going to see a little bit more of a return to the EPAM traditional growth rate in the below 20, but it may not be quite the way it was 3 or 4 years ago because I do think as we continue to have established relationships with large companies and are seen as that as a vendor that can get things done inside those companies, you do get growth inside those portfolios."

And I think that, particularly, there's interesting opportunities in the Singapore market. And so I think kind of longer term, I think you will see greater revenue.

And that's what was happening during the last probably 7, 8 years when we came to China because of UBS, for example, and starting to expand. So I think it would be growth in APAC even with some local clients, but again, it's not going to be really significant. But the growth with the global clients, which we serve in North America, Western Europe and extension to different markets from APAC, to potentially Latin America is, well, very much anticipated.

In preparation for today's call, I briefly reviewed wh",1625,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start from taking a look back to 2020, which we all know was a very different year for all of us, to say the least. In preparation for today's call, I briefly reviewed what we were thinking and what we were sharing during the last year, starting from 12 months back and then 9, 6 and just 3 months ago.  
I think it tells an interesting story. February last year, still full of hope for another practically normal year for us with 20-plus percent organic growth, focusing on our adaptive enterprise story and in short, looking optimistically into 2020. Just 3 months later, we are still reporting 26% constant currency growth for Q1. We, like everybody else at the time, didn't understand at all where we would end up and what we would have to do to go over this very uncertain and very fast worsening situation. The situation, when more than 30% of our client portfolio experienced some form of revenue impact. We practically had to reorganize ourselves on the fly and to start preparation for a very defensive play for protecting as a first priority will be in the power of people and ensuring continued liquidity and viability of our business.  
When thinking about the time now, really would like to share again our deep appreciation to the thousand EPAMers who did everything possible to support each other as a company, to our clients for trusting us with their most critical issues and to our many extended communities around the world.  
At that point, we really didn't know how the 2020 would end up for us and for our clients. In another 3 months, to our surprise, we saw the first signs of some stabilization and client realization of new reality and necessity to start preparing for the future, which will be impacted by such new reality for a long enough period, if not forever. It pushed our drive for agility and an urgent need to adaptive enterprise transformation even further. Time was very condensed and made us, as a company, become much more closely connected by sharing information and making decision much faster than ever before. At this point, we also realized that while our original plans for 2020 will not be in line with our financial performance realities, most of these planned changes, which we outlined for ourselves back in normal times, will be very much accelerating from strategic transformational standpoints.  
During the period, we landed also several large new logos and started to see that we will take an increasingly larger share of our portfolio across several existing strategy for our clients, which was encouraging. 
Finally, just 3 months ago, while seeing many new geopolitical turbulences in locations where we operate and have significant talent presence, we still become comfortable enough to remind everybody again and to ourselves, first of all, the goal we stated 12 months back in our last Investor Day, the goal of turning EPAM into a truly adaptive company. We become comfortable simply because of our realization of how much we advance for -- to the growth during those all around very challenging 9 months.  
Thanks to our investments into integrated consulting with EPAM Continuum, into cloud-enabled business transformation efforts and data analytics, AI and their test set of capabilities, strongly supported by our engineering DNA and by much more flexible, scalable and distributed delivery locations and delivery models, enabled in turn by our digital talent, productivity knowledge and educational platform for our EPAM Anywhere paradigm.  
We believe all those investments are paying back and preparing us strongly for the future growth. In regard to EPAM Continuum, I would like to mention also that today, we see not only recognition of these new service offerings from leading analysts, but encouraging take of the new proposition from a broad base of clients around the world and across our verticals, in insurance and financial services, consumer and life sciences, to name a few.  
Our approach to EPAM Continuum goes beyond our working market, but extended very much into cross-pollination of all EPAM capabilities and experiences through network organizational approach comprised of people, tools and shared ways of working, which should enable us to build global, agile and expert teams more quickly and more efficiently.  
While this work is ongoing and represents a significant portion of our investment agenda, we are seeing strong results today in our current portfolio, results that are driving higher value for customers and that enable -- enabling EPAM to scale larger and complex program faster than ever in the past.  
During last year, we shared several specific stories already. Those included Epic Games  story as well as a large health care and technology platform, which not just became our fastest-growing client in 2020, but is already among our top 10 clients currently.  
In addition to those, let us share 2 short new stories. The first one started just over a year ago as an agile engineering program, as a top 10 global property and casualty insurance giant. Since then, EPAM has become their go-to transformation and IT strategy and implementation partner, helping the company to transform its IT and digital project functions to accelerate cloud transformation journey and to position the company for innovation through a combination of the strategy consulting and engineering implementation services.  
The second is very recent engagement for a global retail and wholesale pharmacy leader. EPAM provides full value stream services, including product management design and end-to-end engineering. The client is building an omnichannel care management product, including clinical, physical services, device and digital elements and is making full use of our integrated research experience, consulting, physical and digital product design on top of our traditional engineering capabilities.  
So everything I've mentioned is made possible by the ongoing investment in our business, which will remain our consistent priority, and we do expect indeed even higher levels of investment in 2021 to keep pace with our growth needs.  
Moving on to our numbers, and let's start from 2020 results. For fiscal 2020, we ended at close to $2.7 billion in revenues, reflecting 16% year-over-year constant currency growth, which included double-digit growth in the majority of our industry verticals. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.34, a 17% increase over fiscal 2019. Lastly, we generated $476 million of free cash flow for the year, a result that was more than 2.5x the average of our last 4 years.  
For the people front, for the year, we welcomed more than 4,400 new net employees to EPAM across our client-facing teams and corporate functions. At this point, I would like to remind also that during all 2020, we were very consistently repeating the very simple statement. We strongly believe our position as a leading provider of digital product and platform engineering services, combined with our maturing consulting expertise, is our key differentiator. And we are confident in our ability to come out of this challenging time, a more value-based and result-driven company that will continue growing at the post-pandemic environment at a 20%-plus organic growth rate again.  
It wasn't obvious statement especially at the beginning. But we think that what was happening during the past 12 months is very telling. From our practically worst quarter ever with a sequential drop in revenue in Q2 to probably the best sequential growth we saw during the last decade when we increased revenue in Q4 2020 by almost 11% in comparison with our Q3 result. So looking ahead to 2021, we see a market that continues to be very active and one that demonstrate strong demand for our services. With the events of the past year, our clients are adapting to changing landscape, which requires hybrid business models and different ways of interacting with their customers in the end market. This requires even faster pace of transformation, the organization of application as well as the building of expansion of the platform with connect and powered enterprise, enabled first by the cloud and the need for really co-innovation partners. It means that we will have to lead large-scale transformation with consulting, product development engagement with design, data monetization and process optimization engagement with analytics, digital technology architecture and custom platform development engagement with engineering. And all of those to be led by strong alignment with our clients and some other key platform partners.  
Regarding market size. In the past, we spoke about EPAM positioning in the fast-growing digital platform product engineering segment, which analysts estimate to be more than $150 billion. While we still firmly position us with such a segment, we are seeing enhanced opportunities for EPAM to play in the broad application development and cloud integration services market, which leading analysts are projecting to be resurging in the post-pandemic environment. In comparison -- in combination of custom software development, cloud-native integration work, technology consulting and training services, and which represents a total over $700 billion in 2021 alone or about 60% of the total global IT services market.  
While thinking about this in context of near-term demand for EPAM and the lagging effect of the pandemic on our customers, we still anticipate some continued disruption in a few of our customers and markets and probably longer-term damage for certain industries. However, today, when 2020 is already in the past and while we are obviously still not being out of post-pandemic time zone and specific geopolitical risks, we do believe that 2021 will be a year of return to 20-plus percent growth organically.  
With that, let me hand the call over to Jason to provide more specifics in our 2020 results and our annual business outlook, which we are resuming for fiscal 2021."

We are pleased with our 2020 fiscal year performance, especially given the dynamic environment.

In the fourth quarter, EPAM generated revenue of $723.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 14.3% on a reported basis and 13.7% in constant currency terms, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately 60 basis points. Revenue came in higher than previously guided due to our ability to expand our delivery capacity in response to a stronger-than-anticipated demand environment. Revenues also benefited somewhat from the beforementioned foreign exchange contribution.  
Our industry vertical performance in Q4 produced very strong sequential improvement, driven by a higher level of growth from both new work and existing clients and revenue from new customer relationships established over the last 12 months.  
Looking at year-over-year performance across this group. Life Sciences & Healthcare grew 24%. Growth in the quarter was driven by data and analytics, platform development to support new business models and client investments to improve R&D efficiency. Business information and media delivered 16.2% growth in the quarter.  
Financial services grew 16.1% with growth coming from traditional banking, insurance and, to a lesser degree, wealth management. Software & Hi-Tech grew 14.3% in the quarter. Travel and Consumer returned to growth and increased 5.4% year-over-year. In Q4, we saw strong growth from our consumer clients, along with solid and improving performance within retail as clients made investments in response to the dramatic changes in their operating environments.  
Finally, our emerging vertical delivered 13.1% growth, driven by clients in telecommunications, automotive and materials. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 59.9% of our Q4 revenues, grew 14% year-over-year or 13.7% in constant currency. Europe, representing 32% of our Q4 revenues, grew 11.8% year-over-year or 7.5% in constant currency. CIS, representing 5.2% of our Q4 revenues, grew 22.9% year-over-year and 45.2% in constant currency. Similar to Q3, growth in the CIS region was driven primarily by clients in financial services and materials.  
And finally, APAC grew 39.4% year-over-year or 35.7% in constant currency terms and now represents 2.9% of our revenues. APAC growth in the quarter was primarily driven by clients in financial services. In the fourth quarter, year-over-year growth in our top 20 clients was 16.6%, and growth outside our top 20 clients was 12.8%.  
And moving down the income statement. As mentioned last quarter, we continue to run the business with a cost base that is lower than previous levels. While the lower cost base is driven by operational efficiencies we have delivered across the business, there are also temporary contributors, including reduced travel, relocations and certain administrative expenses producing lower levels of SG&A spend over the last 3 quarters.  
Looking forward, we expect a higher level of cost in a post-pandemic environment, but anticipate that some of the efficiency benefits may be maintained longer term. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.6% compared to 35.2% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 36.9% compared to 36.7% for the same quarter last year.  GAAP SG&A was 17.8% of revenue compared to 19.8% in Q4 of last year, and non-GAAP SG&A came in at 16.2% of revenue compared to 18.1% in the same period of last year. Our SG&A results continue to see short-term benefits from the previously mentioned items.  
GAAP income from operations was $112 million or 15.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $84.7 million or 13.4% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $135.9 million or 18.8% of revenue in the quarter compared to $107.6 million or 17% of revenue in Q4 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 16.2%, which includes a lower-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 22.6%.  Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.46. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.81, reflecting a 19.9% increase over the same quarter in fiscal 2019. In Q4, there were approximately 58.8 million diluted shares outstanding.  
Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $159.3 million compared to $124.6 million in the same quarter for 2019. The free cash flow was $140.9 million compared to $77.6 million in the same quarter last year, resulting in a 133% conversion of adjusted net income. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents.  
In Q4, DSO was 64 days, the lowest in at least 5 years, and compares to 70 days at the end of Q3 2020 and 72 days in the same quarter last year. We are very pleased with this performance and believe we can manage future DSO levels in the upper 60s.  
Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended this quarter with approximately 36,700 engineers, designers and consultants, a year-over-year increase of 12.8% and a sequential increase of 8.8%, our highest quarterly increase in the last 5 years. Our total headcount for Q4 was more than 41,100 employees, a net addition of more than 3,100 EPAMers from the previous quarter. Utilization was 77.9%, consistent with Q4 of last year and down from 78.2% in Q3 2020.  
Turning to results for the 2020 full fiscal year. Revenues closed at $2.66 billion or 15.9% reported growth over 2019 and 16% on a constant currency basis. During fiscal 2020, our acquisitions contributed approximately 100 basis points to our growth.  GAAP income from operations was $379.3 million, an increase of 25.3% year-over-year and represented 14.3% of revenue. Our non-GAAP income from operations was $472.7 million, an increase of 21.5% over the prior year and represented 17.8% of revenue. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the year came in at 13.6%. Excluding the impact of the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and certain onetime adjustments, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22.6%.  
Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $5.60. Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and other certain onetime items, was $6.34, reflecting a 17% increase over fiscal 2019 and higher than our pre-pandemic expectations of $6.30.  In fiscal 2020, there were approximately 58.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And finally, cash flow from operations was $544.4 million compared to $287.5 million for fiscal 2019. And free cash flow was $475.6 million, reflecting a 128% adjusted net income conversion.  
Now let's turn to guidance. Given the relative stability as well as improved visibility across the portfolio, we are resuming our full year guidance for fiscal 2021. While we anticipate growth patterns across the industry verticals to vary throughout the year, we expect our diversified portfolio to drive growth more in line with pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, we will be investing at elevated levels across the business to make certain we have sufficient resources to meet renewed demand. Additionally, we will increasingly be investing in new geographies to support our long-term growth. One area of focus in 2021 will be the creation of the infrastructure to support a larger and increasingly global EPAM.  
Starting with our full year outlook. Revenue growth will be at least 23% on a reported basis and in constant currency terms will be at least 22% after factoring in a 1% favorable foreign exchange impact. We expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. Our income from operations reflects a higher level of investment in the planned expansion of our capabilities and geographies in 2021. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 12% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%.  
For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.65 to $6.86 for the full year and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $7.20 to $7.41 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 59 million fully diluted shares outstanding.  
For Q1 of fiscal year '21, we expect revenues to be in the range of $757 million to $765 million, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 17% at the midpoint of the range. In Q1, we expect the favorable impact of foreign exchange on revenue growth to be approximately 2%.  
For the first quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 1% and non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. We anticipate our GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter will be impacted by a higher level of excess tax benefits related to the vesting of restricted stock units in connection to our annual compensation cycle.  
For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.66 to $1.74 for the quarter, and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.70 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59 million diluted shares outstanding.  
Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock compensation expenses is expected to be approximately $86.5 million, with $22.5 million in Q1, $20 million in Q2 and $22 million in the remaining quarters. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $12.5 million for the year, evenly spread across each quarter. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $5.5 million loss for the year, with $1 million for Q1 and the balance evenly spread across each remaining quarter. The tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $21.6 million for the year, with $5.1 million for Q1 and Q2 and $5.7 million in each remaining quarter.  
And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $51.5 million for the full year, with approximately $24.5 million in Q1, $13.5 million in Q2 and $6.8 million in each remaining quarter. In summary, we are pleased with the high-quality results we delivered in fiscal 2020 and are encouraged by what lies ahead in 2021.

Your -- Ark, you mentioned that you're seeing some COVID-related -- you're still seeing a little COVID-related impact for some of your clients. And I think you said potential longer-term adjustments to certain verticals kind of going forward. I guess the question is, how do you see your -- the post-pandemic sort of business mix for EPAM evolving? Should we start to think about verticals that -- like FI growing a lot faster than some of your other verticals? Or how should we think about the mix kind of going forward?"

And again, we believe that with still with our size, which is definitely growing, this type of volatility depending on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 large accounts could be still in place. So it's, I think, difficult to say.  
And if you look at it quarter by quarter, it was changing champions practically all the time. So I think in general, it would be something similar at least for this year. And there is unpredictability, but some industries which is the most impacted by COVID might actually start to invest even more like we see in retail, for example. Or even travels might start investing more to prepare for common work.  So sorry, but difficult to predict."

So I think the first thing I would say is that our guide is expected to communicate that we do feel that sort of the middle point of the guided range of 16.5% to 17.5% or 17% is really kind of how we're thinking about the business next year.

And if I sort of break it into 2 components, we expect that SG&A will go up somewhat as a percentage of revenue. So I think we exited the full year at about 16.4%.  I think for the full year of 2021, you'd be looking at something heading towards 17%. And some of that is additional investments in the business, and some of that is the return to some amount of normalcy in spending later in the year. But you can see that there's still some benefit that results from that because prior to the pandemic, we were running at over 18%.  
Now from a gross margin standpoint, what we expect is that we'll continue to see strong growth as evidenced by our guide on the top line. We do think that we'll continue to make investments in growing the business. That will include traditional sort of headcount additions and all the infrastructure that's required to attract talent and bring talent into the company. But then it also will include an expansion in geographies, Poland, India, Mexico, maybe other places in Latin America and other places in Europe. And so those investments, at least probably in 2021, have a somewhat negative impact on gross margin. With the idea that they're subscale at this point, we need to grow them rapidly. And then as they get closer to scale, they'll have more consistent profitability.  
And so the guide kind of incorporates, again, a somewhat elevated level of SG&A, maybe a slightly lower level of gross margin, again, as we invest in our infrastructure so that we can increasingly become a much larger and, of course, more global company."

From a gross margin standpoint, when you start a brand-new facility from scratch, kind of the way we did in Lithuania, it is going to have -- initially, you'll have very low utilization, you'll have additional infrastructure costs that aren't necessarily carried by rates. But again, those are relatively modest facilities. In the case of Poland, where we're still subscale, it's got somewhat lower levels of profitability than a couple of our at-scale operations like you would find in Belarus and Ukraine. So that's part of -- again, it's a more rapid growth rate in those entities, which have a somewhat lower level of profitability. And then, David, I think, longer term, as we get those countries and those individual delivery centers up to a more appropriate scale, I think you'll see an evening out of the profitability and the gross margin."

So -- and that's one part of the story. And clearly, client by client, there are different situation. But for sure, there are more acceptance than it was 12 months ago. And it helps to experiment and kind of to build additional proofs for much more distributed model. That's all happening. 
On another side, when you're talking about cost factors, it's also has a multiple attributes there because there are simple thinking that which cost will be saved, but you have to invest more in this distributed virtual infrastructure. Sometimes it's increase in wage inflation because acceptance of distributed model becoming bigger, and actually, competition for the talent growing as well.

So we haven't traditionally forecasted new customer revenues. Instead, we kind of look at the trends kind of historically. But I think as Ark pointed out at the end is that we are seeing a lot of customers begin their journey with EPAM and very rapidly move into the top 20. And so again, what we -- it's interesting, as many of you have noted, is that we're already seeing growth again in our Travel and Hospitality. And it's not because travel has improved, but because there are retailers and consumer goods companies who are making quite significant investments right now to revisit their business while either to expand an existing e-commerce strategy, to create one, to find different ways to connect with customers, to deliver products with customers. So you are seeing a lot of spending in that area. You're seeing a lot of spending in manufacturing, again, with more sort of a digital connection. And so I think you will see growth in some of these customers that are relatively small for us. But we also have a couple of large customers that we are expecting high levels of growth from in 2021."

What we are seeing, as Ark indicated, is wage inflation. Historically, I think I've talked about 4% to 5%. Wage inflation in 2020 was probably more in the 5% to 6% range and probably would stay in the 5% to 6% range in 2021, and so maybe a somewhat elevated level of wage inflation. And pricing is, again, it's kind of a mixed environment where newer engagements, particularly with the high demand for resources and again the robust demand for the type of work that we do provides some opportunities. But there are probably some existing customers, particularly in still impacted sectors of the economy, who are a little bit less open to the idea of a 2021 rate increase, that are signaling to us that they're more open and quite open to a 2022 rate increase."

And I think Ark said it at the very beginning of the call, which is, it's a little bit hard to predict which customer is going to drive the growth with absolute certainty in a given fiscal year. We certainly are seeing some customers in the top 20 that we think are still going to have high levels of growth. We're seeing a few that are going to slow down. One thing I could call out is that we've had very high growth with large customers in the business information and media space. We continue to have very significant relationships with a number of those clients who are now very much in our top 10. We think that we might not see as much growth in fiscal year 2021 as we -- certainly as we saw in 2020. We've got growth coming from some new manufacturing customers. We've got some growth coming from some IT customers with more of a health care flavor to them. And so again, I think you are going to see a little bit more of a return to the EPAM traditional growth rate in the below 20%, but it may not be quite the way it was 3 or 4 years ago because I do think as we continue to have established relationships with large companies and are seeing as a vendor that can get things done inside those companies, you do get growth inside those portfolios."

And from this point of view, I think during the last 2 years, we saw a very positive impact.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin my summary of the quarter. 
I want to acknowledge that the past month has been a stark reminder that we are still amid a deadly and very much global pandemic and that we must continue to be united in our efforts against COVID. As we have done over the last year, we will do everything possible to support our people on the ground and the communities in which we live and work. 
Now turning to our results. For the first quarter, we delivered $781 million in revenues, reflecting growth of 20% year-over-year as reported and 18% in constant currencies. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.81, a 27% increase over the same quarter in 2020. 
Book revenue growth, combined with a greater level of profitability, enabled us to continue to invest at higher levels across the business. 
Since we last talked mid-February, we have seen a meaningful increase in demand across our business, a notable acceleration at the end of the second half of the quarter. 
Again, our core services is very robust as clients double down on digital transformation and innovation journeys. 
Recently, [indiscernible] not only built new platforms also to consist new digital products and services as well as to modernize and transform their technology strategy and delivery models. 
The utilization trends are driving increasing interest in building strategy, new types of engaging platforms, cloud migration and modernization efforts, data engineering and data analytics engagements and, in turn, machine learning and AI applications. 
On an industry perspective, we are experiencing the dynamic most notably in life science and health care, financial services, insurance, CPG, retail and telecommunications. 
Today, we're focusing on building a strong vertical expertise to leverage even more effectively our market-leading capabilities in core engineering, data and cloud. 
As a result, while we still have much more work to do to continue building our integrated consultant propositions under EPAM continuum brand, with our increasing depth in vertical domains, we are already realizing the promise of delivering increasingly differentiated offerings to our global enterprise customers. 
As an example, EPAM health [indiscernible] is creating a platform, developing modern cloud-based applications, products and services and bringing their data workings to a new generation of consumers. It is a critical part of multiyear cloud and data-driven transformation for [indiscernible], where we are working together to build a Google cloud platform-based data fabric to enable [indiscernible] to organize it's just legacy data sources into single seamless structure while keeping all critical government and separation measures in place. 
Also worth mentioning about the variety system to be cloud-native would normally take years. EPAM successfully assisted and transformed [indiscernible] mainframe applications in less than 1 year. 
This is only one example, which is repeating across most of markets and verticals we serve. From financial services, we rebounded interest in retail and train platforms. We believe this underscores the amount of technology-led change that is pushing all industries into higher levels of activity. All these dynamics[indiscernible]  and hopefully soon in post-COVID environment, the number of business demands and processes which might be digitized is going to be rapidly increasing. 
Those market drivers, along with opportunities in cloud modernization, [indiscernible] architecture, data, ML and NI and cybersecurity will give us sizable room for continuous and sustainable growth. 
To meet this growing demand, we also continue to focus on scaling up our talent. 2020 challenged us to create a reliable and secure remote operations. 2021 has presented an opportunity to leverage those investments in infrastructure, modern target processes and touring across the globe to explore base in which we can activate broader talent markets and deploy a more diverse set of capabilities. The result is that our current net account growth is accelerating. For Q1, we welcomed approximately 2,300 net hires to EPAM, which included an increase of senior level hires coming to us with strong industry experience. Overall, since the beginning of Q4 2020, more than 5,400 net additions have joined the company, representing the highest level of EPAMers we have added in 2 consecutive quarters. So while the shortage of technical and deep industry talent is a nonindustry issue, we are confident that our investment in that area are waiting brand recognition and expanding employee great journey. We will continue to draw top talent to EPAM. 
Also part of EPAM's growth strategy is the expansion of our capabilities with very focused acquisition efforts. Recently, we closed 3 acquisitions, bringing to EPAM talent and experience in the areas of sales force, business intelligence and security. 
In April, we announced the acquisition of [indiscernible], a sales force consultancy with a talent concentration in the U.S., U.K. and Poland. We will still extend our sale force services patients as global footprint and provide consolidation for building additional expertise, IP and scale around sales force ecosystem. This acquisition builds on our earlier acquisition of [indiscernible] advance our sales force API capabilities and to enable customers to leverage a multi-cloud approach. Already working closely with [indiscernible] team to bring together a very different proposition enterprise clients by joining our expanded consulting and global engineering confidence and to become one of the top global players in the Salesforce services place. 
A few days ago we announced the acquisition of White Hat, a nice cybersecurity consultancy based in Israel. [indiscernible] expertise, methodologies and team of talented professionals drilling EPAM cyber defense capabilities and help clients to further improve cyber protection within their platforms. 
And lastly, we recently closed an acquisition of [indiscernible] data and analytics consultancy firm with offices in Europe and Asia, serving customers across retail consumer and [indiscernible]. This acquisition will be a team of trusted advisers and experts to provide the full spectrum of data and analytics consultancy, including strategy advisory, data management, market leader accelerators customers and end-to-end delivery because multi-vendor platforms and solutions. 
We are pleased to have the 3 companies during the half. 
In conclusion, we're were encouraged about the road ahead. During the last 12 months, we improved our leadership position within the digital segment of a very competitive global IT services market. 
The EPAM today is much more adaptable, diverse and global company with increasingly strong market offerings and all the necessary components of scalable talent ecosystem which are required for growth as we think about EPAM becoming a $5 billion to $10 billion. 
With that, let me hand the call over to Jason to provide more specifics in our Q1 results and an update to our 2021 business outlook."

We are pleased with our performance this quarter. As Ark mentioned, we delivered strong growth across a broad range of industry verticals and geographies.First quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $780.8 millio",1503,"Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our performance this quarter. As Ark mentioned, we delivered strong growth across a broad range of industry verticals and geographies.
First quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $780.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 19.9% on a reported basis and 17.8% in constant currency, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of 210 basis points. Revenues came in higher than previously guided due to stronger demand in the second half of the quarter, combined with our ability to accelerate hiring in response to the improving demand environment. 
Our industry vertical performance produced strong sequential growth across the majority of the portfolio, driven by a higher level of revenues from both new work and existing clients and new customer relationships established over the last 12 months. 
Looking at the year-over-year performance across our industry verticals, life science and healthcare grew 31.6%. Growth in the quarter was driven by platform development to support new business models and data and analytics to drive deeper customer insights. 
Financial services grew 28.3%. Growth coming from traditional banking, insurance and, to a lesser degree, wealth management. Growth was driven by our clients' need to transform beyond digital banking to modernize core processes and applications, leveraging the cloud. 
Software & hi-tech grew 20.7% in the quarter. 
Travel and consumer grew 16.3%, driven by strong growth from our consumer clients, along with solid and improving performance with retail. 
Business information and media delivered 6.5% growth in the quarter. Growth in the quarter reflected a tougher comparison with the same quarter last year. Several clients having experienced substantial growth in the first half of 2020 with revenues from those programs generally plateauing late last year. 
And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 23.6% growth, driven by clients in telecommunications, automotive and materials. 
From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 60.2% of our Q1 revenues, grew 20.6% year-over-year or 19.9% in constant currency. 
Europe, representing 33.2% of our Q1 revenues, grew 16.3% year-over-year or 10.9% in constant currency. 
CIS, representing 3.9% of our Q1 revenues, grew 21.2% year-over-year and 28.2% in constant currency. 
Finally, APAC grew 53.9% year-over-year or 48.4% in constant currency and now represents 2.7% of our revenues. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by clients and financial services. Additionally, the shutdown of economic activity in the region in March 2020 produced a beneficial year-over-year comparison. 
In Q1, revenue growth across the portfolio was more diverse than in previous quarters. There are top 20 clients growing 12.1%, while clients outside our top '20 grew 25.9%. Additionally, we saw good growth in both existing and new clients. 
Moving on the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.5% compared to 34.9% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.9% compared to 35.5% for the same quarter last year. The lower gross margin in the quarter was primarily the result of Q1 2021 having 1 less available day of capacity in Q1 2020. Additionally, we're beginning to see some degree of elevated labor costs in certain geographies. 
GAAP SG&A was 17.5% of revenue compared to 19.2% in Q1 of last year. Non GAAP SG&A came in at 15.5% of revenue compared to 17.6% in the same period last year. SG&A continues to reflect a lower level of corporate spend, which we believe will tick up as we progress throughout the year. 
GAAP income from operations was $107.3 million or 13.7% of revenue in the quarter compared to $87.5 million or 13.4% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $136.9 million or 17.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $105.3 million or 16.2% of revenue in Q1 of last year. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 5.1%, which includes a lower-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 22.7%. 
Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.86. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.81, reflecting a 26.6% increase over the same quarter in 2020. 
In Q1, there were approximately 58.8 million diluted shares outstanding. 
Turning to the cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q1 was $12.8 million compared to $63.3 million in the same quarter of 2020. Free cash flow was $1.6 million compared to $34.2 million in the same quarter last year. Lower level of cash flow in the quarter was a result of timing of payments related to our annual variable compensation programs returning to more historic norms. Additionally, income tax payments were higher compared to the same quarter in 2020. 
We ended the quarter with $1.37 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
Q1 DSO was 67 days and compares to 64 days in Q4 2020. 76 days in the same quarter last year. We believe we can continue managing DSO levels in the upper 60s. 
Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 38,800 engineers, designers and consultants, a year-over-year increase of 17.3% and a sequential increase of 5.7%. Total headcount for Q1 was 43,450 employees. Utilization was 81.4% compared to 79.5% in Q1 of last year and 77.9% in Q4 2020. 
Now let's turn to guidance. We continue to see strong demand across a broad range of our offerings. The elevated demand across the portfolio, combined with improvements in staffing capacity, we are raising our revenue and EPS outlook for 2021. 
I mentioned during our last earnings call, throughout 2021, we will be investing at elevated levels across the business to support growing demand, and we will continue our expansion into new geographies, underpinning our long-term growth objectives and goal of becoming a large -- both a larger and increasingly global EPAM. 
Starting with our full year outlook. Revenue growth will now be at least 29% on a reported basis, and in constant currency terms, will now be at least 28% after factoring in an approximate 1% favorable foreign exchange impact. We now expect approximately 200 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months. 
We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. As mentioned earlier, our income from operations reflects a higher level of investment in the planned expansion of our capabilities and geographies in 2021. 
We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 12%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to continue to be approximately 23%. 
Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.09 to $7.31 for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.54 to $7.76 for the full year. 
We expect weighted average share count of 59 million fully diluted shares outstanding. 
In Q2 of 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of $853 million to $861 million, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 35.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect a favorable impact of FX on revenue growth to be approximately 3%. Lastly, we now expect approximately 250 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months. 
In the Second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%.  We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 11% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to be approximately 23%. 
Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.76 to $1.83 for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.88 to $1.95 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59 million diluted shares outstanding. 
Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $21.8 million in Q2, $21.5 million in Q3 and $21.2 million in Q4. 
Monetization on intangibles is expected to [indiscernible] [ $3.1 million  ] for each of the remaining quarters. 
Impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $1.5 million loss for each of the remaining quarters. 
Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $5.7 million in Q2 and approximately $5.5 million in each remaining quarter. 
And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $14.2 million in Q2, [ $2.2 million ] in Q3 to $8.6 million in Q4. 
In summary, we are pleased with the high-quality results we delivered in the quarter, which combined with the broad-based strength we see across the business, provide support for strong 2021 performance.

And so what we are seeing is that there's a whole wave of modernization programs kicking off within the financial services industry. So a significant amount of growth expected, as you saw in Q1, but also probably further acceleration of growth in financial services in Q2 due to the modernization programs with large banks and then also with a much accelerated growth in insurance. 
We're seeing recovery in the travel and consumer section of our portfolio, quite strong growth with consumer-oriented programs, both in retail and with consumer goods companies. We're even beginning to see some sequential growth in the travel space. We're seeing strong growth in health care and life sciences. We're seeing a continued sort of solid growth in our traditional sort of high-tech software and high-technology clients. And we're seeing a reemergent kind of emerging verticals with very strong growth in telecommunications, automotive and materials, as we talked about. 
And again, where we expect between Q1 and Q2, we expect to see even stronger growth in financial services, even stronger growth than Q1 in the travel and hospitality vertical, and, again, even stronger growth in the emerging verticals. And so again, it is pretty broad-based. It's existing relationships. It's new relationships. So we're seeing some good new customer revenues. 
And then from a pricing environment, I think we're having more constructive conversations with clients. And I think both existing and new clients understand that with the wage inflation that's out there in the marketplace, that it is going to likely require somewhat higher pricing to support the addition of new teams. But for the most part, this is volume-based."

So in terms of what's the best offshore, onshore, we're still increasing -- increase in our onshore component. Especially with the complexity of the engagement, we're doing a necessity to have strong industry connectivity and consulting connectivity. So that's growing, but it's not drastically changing as well. So we're very careful managing the balance right now. 
So what is ideal? I don't think anybody knows. So it's very dynamically changing, even if you think about what's happened in 2020, continue in 2021. I don't think anybody talking about ideal right now."

However, I do think we are seeing somewhat elevated levels of wage inflation. And those could continue to elevate throughout the fiscal year. So I think that in the -- let's call it, in the -- throughout the remainder of the year, I think we might run below the approximate sort of 36% that we've kind of talked about over time from a gross margin standpoint. It is -- I think it's sort of generally stabilized at a slightly lower level than that 36%. But -- so I don't expect it to continue to decline.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin my summary of the quarter, I want to acknowledge that the past month has been a stark reminder that we are still amid a deadly and very much global pandemic and t",1096,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin my summary of the quarter, I want to acknowledge that the past month has been a stark reminder that we are still amid a deadly and very much global pandemic and that we must continue to be united in our efforts against COVID. As we have done over the last year, we will do everything possible to support our people on the ground and the communities in which we live and work.
Now turning to our results. For the first quarter, we delivered $781 million in revenues, reflecting growth of 20% year-over-year as reported and 18% in constant currencies. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.81, a 27% increase over the same quarter in 2020. Book revenue growth, combined with a greater level of profitability, enabled us to continue to invest at higher levels across the business.
Since we last talked mid-February, we have seen a meaningful increase in demand across our business, a notable acceleration at the end of the second half of the quarter. Demand for our core services is very robust as clients doubled down on digital transformation and innovation journeys. Increasingly, we [indiscernible] not only build new platforms also to consist new digital products and services as well as to modernize and transform the technology strategy and delivery models.
The utilization trends are driving increased interest in building strategy, new types of engagement platforms, cloud migration and modernization efforts, data engineering and data analytics engagements and, in turn, machine learning and AI applications.
On an industry perspective, we are experienced this dynamic most notably in life science and health care, financial services, insurance, CPG, retail and telecommunications. Today, we're focusing on building a strong vertical expertise to leverage even more effectively our market-leading capabilities in core engineering, data and cloud.
As a result, while we still have much more work to do to continue building our integrated consultant propositions under EPAM Continuum brand, with our increasing depth in vertical domains, we are already realizing the promise of delivering increasingly differentiated offerings to our global enterprise customers. As an example, EPAM health products is creating a platform, developing modern cloud-based applications products and services and bringing their data offerings to a new generation of consumers. It is a critical part of multiyear cloud and data-driven transformation for Equifax, where we are working together to build a Google Cloud platform-based data fabric to enable Equifax to organize its disparate, legacy data sources into a single seamless structure while keeping all critical government and separation measures in place.
Also worth mentioning while rewriting Equifax legacy system to be cloud-native would normally take years, EPAM successfully assisted and transformed Equifax mainframe applications in less than 1 year. This is only one example, which is repeating across most of markets and verticals we serve, from financial services, a rebounding interest in retail and wholesale platforms. 
We believe this underscores the amount of technology-led change that is pushing all industries into higher levels of activity. All these dynamics have led to the and hopefully soon in post-COVID environment, the number of business domains and processes which must be digitized is going to be rapidly increasing. Those market drivers, along with opportunities in cloud modernization, composable architecture, data, ML and AI and cybersecurity will give us sizable room for continuous and sustainable growth.
To meet this growing demand, we also continue to focus on scaling up our talent. 2020 challenged us to create a reliable and secure remote operations. 2021 has presented an opportunity to leverage those investments in infrastructure, modern talent processes and touring across the globe to explore base in which we can activate broader talent markets and deploy a more diverse set of capabilities. The result is that our current net head count growth is accelerating. 
For Q1, we welcomed approximately 2,300 net hires to EPAM, which included an increase of senior level hires coming to us with strong industry experience.And overall, since the beginning of Q4 2020, more than 5,400 net additions have joined the company, representing the highest level of EPAMers we have added in 2 consecutive quarters. So while the shortage of technical and deep industry talent is a known industry issue, we are confident that our investment in that area, our elevating brand recognition and expanding employee career journey will continue to draw top talent to EPAM.
Also part of EPAM's growth strategy is the expansion of our capabilities with very focused acquisition efforts. Recently, we closed 3 acquisitions, bringing to EPAM talent and experience in the areas of sales force, business intelligence and security. 
In April, we announced the acquisition of PolSource, a Salesforce Consultancy, with a talent concentration in the U.S., U.K. and Poland. We will extend our Saleforce services and opportunities as global footprint and provide a foundation for building additional expertise, IP and scale around Salesforce ecosystem. This acquisition builds on our earlier acquisition of Mulesoft partner, Ricston, advance our Salesforce API capabilities and to enable customers to leverage a multi-cloud approach. 
Already working closely with PolSource team to bring together a very different proposition enterprise clients by joining our expanded consulting and global engineering confidence and to become one of the top global players in the Salesforce services place. 
A few days ago we announced the acquisition of White-Hat, a niche cybersecurity consultancy based in Israel. White-Hat expertise, methodologies and team of talented professionals will intensify cyber defense capabilities and help clients to further improve cyber protection within their platforms.
And lastly, we recently closed an acquisition of [indiscernible], an analytics consultancy firm with offices in Europe and Asia, serving customers across retail, consumer. This acquisition will bring a team of trusted advisers and experts to provide the full spectrum of data and analytics consultancy, including strategy advisory, data management, market leader accelerators customers and end-to-end delivery across multi-vendor platforms and solutions. We are pleased to have the 3 companies into EPAM.  
In conclusion, we're were encouraged about the road ahead. During the last 12 months, we improved our leadership position within the digital segment of a very competitive global IT services market. The EPAM of today is much more adaptable, diverse and global company with increasingly strong market offerings and all the necessary components of scalable talent ecosystem which are required for growth as we think about EPAM becoming a $5 billion to $10 billion.
With that, let me hand the call over to Jason to provide more specifics in our Q1 results and an update to our 2021 business outlook."

First quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $780.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 19.9% on a reported basis and 17.8% in constant currency, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of 210 basis points. Revenues came in higher than previously guided due to stronger demand in the second half of the quarter, combined with our ability to accelerate hiring in response to the improving demand environment.
Our industry vertical performance produced strong sequential growth across the majority of the portfolio, driven by a higher level of revenues from both new work at existing clients and new customer relationships established over the last 12 months.  
Looking at the year-over-year performance across our industry verticals, Life Science & Healthcare grew 31.6%. Growth in the quarter was driven by platform development to support new business models and data and analytics to drive deeper customer insights.  Financial services grew 28.3%, growth coming from traditional banking, insurance and, to a lesser degree, wealth management. Growth was driven by our clients' need to transform beyond digital banking to modernize core processes and applications, leveraging the cloud.
Software & Hi-Tech grew 20.7% in the quarter. Travel and Consumer grew 16.3%, driven by strong growth from our consumer clients, along with solid and improving performance with retail. Business information and media delivered 6.5% growth in the quarter. Growth in the quarter reflected a tougher comparison with the same quarter last year, several clients having experienced substantial growth in the first half of 2020 with revenues from those programs generally plateauing late last year. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 23.6% growth, driven by clients in telecommunications, automotive and materials.
From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 60.2% of our Q1 revenues, grew 20.6% year-over-year or 19.9% in constant currency. Europe, representing 33.2% of our Q1 revenues, grew 16.3% year-over-year or 10.9% in constant currency. CIS, representing 3.9% of our Q1 revenues, grew 21.2% year-over-year and 28.2% in constant currency. Finally, APAC grew 53.9% year-over-year or 48.4% in constant currency and now represents 2.7% of our revenues. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by clients in financial services. Additionally, the shutdown of economic activity in the region in March 2020 produced a beneficial year-over-year comparison.
In Q1, revenue growth across the portfolio was more diverse than in previous quarters. There are top 20 clients growing 12.1%, while clients outside our top 20 grew 25.9%. Additionally, we saw good growth in both existing and new clients.  
Moving on the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.5% compared to 34.9% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.9% compared to 35.5% for the same quarter last year. The lower gross margin in the quarter was primarily the result of Q1 2021 having 1 less available day of capacity than Q1 2020. Additionally, we're beginning to see some degree of elevated labor costs in certain geographies.
GAAP SG&A was 17.5% of revenue compared to 19.2% in Q1 of last year. Non GAAP SG&A came in at 15.5% of revenue compared to 17.6% in the same period last year. SG&A continues to reflect a lower level of corporate spend, which we believe will tick up as we progress throughout the year.
GAAP income from operations was $107.3 million or 13.7% of revenue in the quarter compared to $87.5 million or 13.4% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $136.9 million or 17.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $105.3 million or 16.2% of revenue in Q1 of last year.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 5.1%, which includes a lower-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 22.7%.
Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.86. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.81, reflecting a 26.6% increase over the same quarter in 2020. In Q1, there were approximately 58.8 million diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to the cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q1 was $12.8 million compared to $63.3 million in the same quarter of 2020. Free cash flow was $1.6 million compared to $34.2 million in the same quarter last year. Lower level of cash flow in the quarter was a result of timing of payments related to our annual variable compensation programs returning to more historic norms. Additionally, income tax payments were higher compared to the same quarter in 2020. 
We ended the quarter with $1.37 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Q1 DSO was 67 days and compares to 64 days in Q4 2020. 76 days in the same quarter last year. We believe we can continue managing DSO levels in the upper 60s.
Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 38,800 engineers, designers and consultants, a year-over-year increase of 17.3% and a sequential increase of 5.7%. Total head count for Q1 was 43,450 employees. Utilization was 81.4% compared to 79.5% in Q1 of last year and 77.9% in Q4 2020. 
Now let's turn to guidance. We continue to see strong demand across a broad range of our offerings. The elevated demand across the portfolio, combined with improvements in staffing capacity, we are raising our revenue and EPS outlook for 2021. I mentioned during our last earnings call, throughout 2021, we will be investing at elevated levels across the business to support growing demand, and we will continue our expansion into new geographies, underpinning our long-term growth objectives and goal of becoming a large -- both a larger and increasingly global EPAM.
Starting with our full year outlook. Revenue growth will now be at least 29% on a reported basis, and in constant currency terms, will now be at least 28% after factoring in an approximate 1% favorable foreign exchange impact. We now expect approximately 200 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months.
We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. As mentioned earlier, our income from operations reflects a higher level of investment in the planned expansion of our capabilities and geographies in 2021. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 12%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to continue to be approximately 23%.  
Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.09 to $7.31 for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.54 to $7.76 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 59 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
In Q2 of 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of $853 million to $861 million, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 35.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect a favorable impact of FX on revenue growth to be approximately 3%. Lastly, we now expect approximately 250 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months.
In the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 11% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to be approximately 23%.
Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.76 to $1.83 for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.88 to $1.95 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59 million diluted shares outstanding. 
Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $21.8 million in Q2, $21.5 million in Q3 and $21.2 million in Q4. Monetization on intangibles is expected to approximately $3.1 million for each of the remaining quarters. Impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $1.5 million loss for each of the remaining quarters. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $5.7 million in Q2 and approximately $5.5 million in each remaining quarter. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $14.2 million in Q2, [ $2.2 million ] in Q3 to $8.6 million in Q4. 
In summary, we are pleased with the high-quality results we delivered in the quarter, which combined with the broad-based strength we see across the business, provide support for strong 2021 performance.

So a significant amount of growth expected, as you saw in Q",281,"Yes. So the upside would predominantly be generated by volume. And so what we are seeing is that there's a whole wave of modernization programs kicking off within the financial services industry. So a significant amount of growth expected, as you saw in Q1, but also probably further acceleration of growth in financial services in Q2 due to the modernization programs with large banks and then also with a much accelerated growth in insurance.
We're seeing recovery in the travel and consumer section of our portfolio, quite strong growth with consumer-oriented programs, both in retail and with consumer goods companies. We're even beginning to see some sequential growth in the travel space. We're seeing strong growth in health care and life sciences. We're seeing a continued sort of solid growth in our traditional sort of hi-tech, software and high-technology clients. And we're seeing reemergent kind of emerging verticals with very strong growth in telecommunications, automotive and materials, as we talked about.
And again, where we expect between Q1 and Q2, we expect to see even stronger growth in financial services, even stronger growth than Q1 in the travel and hospitality vertical, and, again, even stronger growth in the emerging verticals. And so again, it is pretty broad-based. It's existing relationships. It's new relationships. So we're seeing some good new customer revenues. 
And then from a pricing environment, I think we're having more constructive conversations with clients. And I think both existing and new clients understand that with the wage inflation that's out there in the marketplace, that it is going to likely require somewhat higher pricing to support the addition of new teams. But for the most part, this is volume-based."

But SG&A will also be somewhat lower. 
And so we're able to maintain the profitability in the 16.5% to 17.5% range that we've talked about with a real focus on the midpoint, 17%. But we are seeing somewhat elevated levels of compensation being required both to retain and bring staff into EPAM. And that's something that we're mindful of [indiscernible] as we produce the guidance and as obviously we try to drive the company throughout the remainder of the year."

So from this point of view, again, we, each year, are becoming more distributed and more rightly balanced and concentration is going down in Eastern Europe, so which is normal with the growth of the company and globalization of our clients as well. 
So in terms of what's the best offshore, onshore, we're still increasing our onshore component, especially with the complexity of the engagement. We're doing a necessity to have strong industry connectivity and consulting connectivity. So that's growing, but it's not drastically changing as well. So we're very carefully managing the balance right now. 
So what is ideal? I don't think anybody knows. So it's very dynamically changing, even if you think about what's happened in 2020 will continue in 2021. I don't think anybody is talking about ideal right now."

And so that's -- and it's just the way that Monday through Fridays fall in the calendar for Q1, it was 1 less day than what we would have traditionally seen in previous Q1s. However, I do think we are seeing somewhat elevated levels of wage inflation. And those could continue to elevate throughout the fiscal year.
So I think that in the, let's call it, throughout the remainder of the year, I think we might run below the approximate sort of 36% that we've kind of talked about over time from a gross margin standpoint. It is -- I think it's sort of generally stabilized at a slightly lower level than that 36%. But -- so I don't expect it to continue to decline. And I think the question mark is kind of what happens in 2022. 
Right now, again, I am feeling that we've kind of -- gross margin is going to stabilize. And then we'll kind of see what happens throughout the remainder of the year in terms of the pricing environment.

So in regards to pricing, I think Jason mentioned that at this point, majority of the revenue growth coming specifically from the volume of work we're doing. But there are conversation restarted to happen. And I think they're becoming right now much more realistic from both clients -- from client side as well.

And those companies continue to grow quite rapidly. 
I think this year, what you're beginning to see is some of the new relationships we established in 2020.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin my summary of the quarter, I want to acknowledge that the past month has been a stark reminder that we are still amid a deadly and very much global pandemic and that we must continue to be united in our efforts against COVID. As we have done over the last year, we will do everything possible to support our people on the ground and the communities in which we live and work.
Now turning to our results. For the first quarter, we delivered $781 million in revenues, reflecting growth of 20% year-over-year as reported and 18% in constant currencies. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.81, a 27% increase over the same quarter in 2020. Book revenue growth, combined with a greater level of profitability, enabled us to continue to invest at higher levels across the business.
Since we last talked mid-February, we have seen a meaningful increase in demand across our business, a notable acceleration at the end of the second half of the quarter. Demand for our core services is very robust as clients doubled down on digital transformation and innovation journeys. Increasingly, we [indiscernible] not only build new platforms also to consist new digital products and services as well as to modernize and transform the technology strategy and delivery models.
The utilization trends are driving increased interest in business strategy, new types of engagement platforms, cloud migration and modernization efforts, data engineering and data analytics engagements and, in turn, machine learning and AI applications.
On industry perspective, we are experiencing this dynamic most notably in life science and health care, financial services, insurance, CPG, retail and telecommunications. Today, we're focusing on building a strong vertical expertise to leverage even more effectively our market-leading capabilities in core engineering, data and cloud.
As a result, while we still have much more work to do to continue building our integrated consultant propositions under EPAM Continuum brand, with our increasing depth in vertical domains, we are already realizing the promise of delivering increasingly differentiated offerings to our global enterprise customers. As an example, EPAM health products is creating a platform, developing modern cloud-based applications products and services and bringing their data offerings to a new generation of consumers. It is a critical part of multiyear cloud and data-driven transformation for Equifax, where we are working together to build a Google Cloud platform-based data fabric to enable Equifax to organize its disparate, legacy data sources into a single seamless structure while keeping all critical government and separation measures in place.
Also worth mentioning that while rewriting Equifax legacy system to be cloud-native would normally take years, EPAM successfully assisted in transforming Equifax mainframe applications in less than 1 year. This is only one example, which is repeating across most of markets and verticals we serve, from financial services, a rebounding interest in retail and wholesale platforms. 
We believe this underscores the amount of technology-led change that is pushing all industries into higher levels of activity. All these dynamics have led to this. And hopefully, soon in post-COVID environment, the number of business domains and processes which must be digitized is going to be rapidly increasing. Those market drivers, along with opportunities in cloud modernization, composable architecture, data, ML and AI and cybersecurity will give us sizable room for continuous and sustainable growth.
To meet this growing demand, we also continue to focus on scaling up our talent. 2020 challenged us to create a reliable and secure remote operations. 2021 has presented an opportunity to leverage those investments in infrastructure, modern talent processes and touring across the globe to explore base in which we can activate broader talent markets and deploy a more diverse set of capabilities. The result is that our current net head count growth is accelerating. 
For Q1, we welcomed approximately 2,300 net hires to EPAM, which included an increase of senior level hires coming to us with strong industry experience. And overall, since the beginning of Q4 2020, more than 5,400 net additions have joined the company, representing the highest level of EPAMers we have added in 2 consecutive quarters. So while the shortage of technical and deep industry talent is a known industry issue, we are confident that our investment in that area, our elevating brand recognition and expanding employee career journey will continue to draw top talent to EPAM.
Also part of EPAM's growth strategy is the expansion of our capabilities with very focused acquisition efforts. Recently, we closed 3 acquisitions, bringing to EPAM talent and experience in the areas of sales force, business intelligence and security. 
In April, we announced the acquisition of PolSource, a Salesforce Consultancy, with a talent concentration in the U.S., U.K. and Poland. It will extend our Salesforce services and opportunities as global footprint and provide a foundation for building additional expertise, IP and scale around Salesforce ecosystem. This acquisition builds on our earlier acquisition of MuleSoft partner, Ricston, advance our Salesforce API capabilities and to enable customers to leverage a multi-cloud approach. 
Already working closely with PolSource team to bring together a very different proposition to enterprise clients by joining our expanded consulting and global engineering confidence and to become one of the top global players in the Salesforce services space. 
A few days ago, we announced the acquisition of White-Hat, a niche cybersecurity consultancy based in Israel. White-Hat's expertise, methodologies and team of talented professionals will intensify cyber defense capabilities and help clients to further improve cyber protection within their platforms.
And lastly, we recently closed an acquisition of [indiscernible], an analytics consultancy firm with offices in Europe and Asia, serving customers across retail, consumer and [indiscernible]. This acquisition will bring a team of trusted advisers and experts to provide the full spectrum of data and analytics consultancy, including strategy advisory, data management, market-leading accelerators custom [ apps ] and end-to-end delivery across multi-vendor platforms and solutions. We are pleased to have the 3 companies join EPAM.  
In conclusion, we're were encouraged about the road ahead. During the last 12 months, we improved our leadership position within the digital segment of a very competitive global IT services market. The EPAM of today is much more adaptable, diverse and global company with increasingly strong market offerings and all the necessary components of scalable talent ecosystem which are required for growth as we think about EPAM becoming a $5 billion to $10 billion company.
With that, let me hand the call over to Jason to provide more specifics in our Q1 results and an update to our 2021 business outlook."

We are pleased with our performance this quarter. As Ark mentioned, we delivered strong growth across a broad range of industry verticals and geographies. First quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $780.8 milli",1501,"Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our performance this quarter. As Ark mentioned, we delivered strong growth across a broad range of industry verticals and geographies. 
First quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $780.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 19.9% on a reported basis and 17.8% in constant currency, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of 210 basis points. Revenues came in higher than previously guided due to stronger demand in the second half of the quarter, combined with our ability to accelerate hiring in response to the improving demand environment.
Our industry vertical performance produced strong sequential growth across the majority of the portfolio, driven by a higher level of revenues from both new work at existing clients and new customer relationships established over the last 12 months.  
Looking at the year-over-year performance across our industry verticals, Life Science & Healthcare grew 31.6%. Growth in the quarter was driven by platform development to support new business models and data and analytics to drive deeper customer insights.  Financial services grew 28.3%, growth coming from traditional banking, insurance and, to a lesser degree, wealth management. Growth was driven by our clients' need to transform beyond digital banking to modernize core processes and applications, leveraging the cloud.
Software & Hi-Tech grew 20.7% in the quarter. Travel and Consumer grew 16.3%, driven by strong growth from our consumer clients, along with solid and improving performance with retail. Business information and media delivered 6.5% growth in the quarter. Growth in the quarter reflected a tougher comparison with the same quarter last year, several clients having experienced substantial growth in the first half of 2020 with revenues from those programs generally plateauing late last year. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 23.6% growth, driven by clients in telecommunications, automotive and materials.
From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 60.2% of our Q1 revenues, grew 20.6% year-over-year or 19.9% in constant currency. Europe, representing 33.2% of our Q1 revenues, grew 16.3% year-over-year or 10.9% in constant currency. CIS, representing 3.9% of our Q1 revenues, grew 21.2% year-over-year and 28.2% in constant currency. Finally, APAC grew 53.9% year-over-year or 48.4% in constant currency and now represents 2.7% of our revenues. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by clients in financial services. Additionally, the shutdown of economic activity in the region in March 2020 produced a beneficial year-over-year comparison.
In Q1, revenue growth across the portfolio was more diverse than in previous quarters with our top 20 clients growing 12.1%, while clients outside our top 20 grew 25.9%. Additionally, we saw good growth in both existing and new clients.  
Moving on the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.5% compared to 34.9% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.9% compared to 35.5% for the same quarter last year. The lower gross margin in the quarter was primarily the result of Q1 2021 having 1 less available day of capacity than Q1 2020. Additionally, we're beginning to see some degree of elevated labor costs in certain geographies.
GAAP SG&A was 17.5% of revenue compared to 19.2% in Q1 of last year. Non GAAP SG&A came in at 15.5% of revenue compared to 17.6% in the same period last year. SG&A continues to reflect a lower level of corporate spend, which we believe will tick up as we progress throughout the year.
GAAP income from operations was $107.3 million or 13.7% of revenue in the quarter compared to $87.5 million or 13.4% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $136.9 million or 17.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $105.3 million or 16.2% of revenue in Q1 of last year.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 5.1%, which includes a lower-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 22.7%.
Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.86. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.81, reflecting a 26.6% increase over the same quarter in 2020. In Q1, there were approximately 58.8 million diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to the cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q1 was $12.8 million compared to $63.3 million in the same quarter of 2020. Free cash flow was $1.6 million compared to $34.2 million in the same quarter last year. Lower level of cash flow in the quarter was a result of timing of payments related to our annual variable compensation programs returning to more historic norms. Additionally, income tax payments were higher compared to the same quarter in 2020. 
We ended the quarter with $1.37 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Q1 DSO was 67 days and compares to 64 days in Q4 2020. 76 days in the same quarter last year. We believe we can continue managing DSO levels in the upper 60s.
Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 38,800 engineers, designers and consultants, a year-over-year increase of 17.3% and a sequential increase of 5.7%. Total head count for Q1 was 43,450 employees. Utilization was 81.4% compared to 79.5% in Q1 of last year and 77.9% in Q4 2020. 
Now let's turn to guidance. We continue to see strong demand across a broad range of our offerings. The elevated demand across the portfolio, combined with improvements in staffing capacity, we are raising our revenue and EPS outlook for 2021. I mentioned during our last earnings call, throughout 2021, we will be investing at elevated levels across the business to support growing demand, and we will continue our expansion into new geographies, underpinning our long-term growth objectives and goal of becoming a large -- both a larger and increasingly global EPAM.
Starting with our full year outlook. Revenue growth will now be at least 29% on a reported basis, and in constant currency terms, will now be at least 28% after factoring in an approximate 1% favorable foreign exchange impact. We now expect approximately 200 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months.
We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. As mentioned earlier, our income from operations reflects a higher level of investment in the planned expansion of our capabilities and geographies in 2021. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 12%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to continue to be approximately 23%.  
Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.09 to $7.31 for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.54 to $7.76 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 59 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
In Q2 of 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of $853 million to $861 million, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 35.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect a favorable impact of FX on revenue growth to be approximately 3%. Lastly, we now expect approximately 250 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months.
In the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 11% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to be approximately 23%.
Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.76 to $1.83 for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.88 to $1.95 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59 million diluted shares outstanding. 
Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $21.8 million in Q2, $21.5 million in Q3 and $21.2 million in Q4. Monetization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $3.1 million for each of the remaining quarters. Impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $1.5 million loss for each of the remaining quarters. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $5.7 million in Q2 and approximately $5.5 million in each remaining quarter. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $14.2 million in Q2, $10.2 million in Q3 and $8.6 million in Q4. 
In summary, we are pleased with the high-quality results we delivered in the quarter, which combined with the broad-based strength we see across the business, provide support for strong 2021 performance.

And so what we are seeing is that it's a whole wave of modernization programs kicking off within the financial services industry. So a significant amount of growth expected, as you saw in Q1, but also probably further acceleration of growth in financial services in Q2 due to the modernization programs with large banks and then also with a much accelerated growth in insurance.
We're seeing recovery in the travel and consumer section of our portfolio, quite strong growth with consumer-oriented programs, both in retail and with consumer goods companies. We're even beginning to see some sequential growth in the travel space. We're seeing strong growth in health care and life sciences. We're seeing a continued sort of solid growth in our traditional sort of hi-tech, software and high-technology clients. And we're seeing reemergent kind of emerging verticals with very strong growth in telecommunications, automotive and materials, as we talked about.
And again, where we expect between Q1 and Q2, we expect to see even stronger growth in financial services, even stronger growth than Q1 in the travel and hospitality vertical, and, again, even stronger growth in the emerging verticals. And so again, it is pretty broad-based. It's existing relationships. It's new relationships. So we're seeing some good new customer revenues. 
And then from a pricing environment, I think we're having more constructive conversations with clients. And I think both existing and new clients understand that with the wage inflation that's out there in the marketplace, that it is going to likely require somewhat higher pricing to support the addition of new teams. But for the most part, this is volume-based."

And so we're able to maintain the profitability in the 16.5% to 17.5% range that we've talked about with a real focus on the midpoint, 17%. But we are seeing somewhat elevated levels of compensation being required both to retain and bring staff into EPAM.

So from this point of view, again, we, each year, are becoming more distributed and more rightly balanced and concentration is going down in Eastern Europe, so which is normal with the growth of the company and globalization of our clients as well. 
So in terms of what's the best offshore, onshore, we're still increasing our onshore component, especially with the complexity of the engagement. We're doing to -- a necessity to have strong industry connectivity and consulting connectivity. So that's growing, but it's not drastically changing as well. So we're very carefully managing the balance right now. 
So what is ideal? I don't think anybody knows. So it's very dynamically changing, even if you think about what's happened in 2020 will continue in 2021. I don't think anybody is talking about ideal right now."

However, I do think we are seeing somewhat elevated levels of wage inflation. And those could continue to elevate throughout the fiscal year.
So I think that in the, let's call it, throughout the remainder of the year, I think we might run below the approximate sort of 36% that we've kind of talked about over time from a gross margin standpoint. It is -- I think it's sort of generally stabilized at a slightly lower level than that 36%. But -- so I don't expect it to continue to decline.

However, we are beginning to see some degree of elevation and attrition at the end of the quarter in March and here again in April. And so again, we are below 15%. And again, I think, well within our expectations for the quarter as a whole. But beginning to see some increase in attrition, both at the end of Q1 and the beginning of Q2."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin my summary of the quarter, I want to acknowledge that the past month has been a stark reminder that we are still amid a deadly and very much global pandemic and t",1103,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin my summary of the quarter, I want to acknowledge that the past month has been a stark reminder that we are still amid a deadly and very much global pandemic and that we must continue to be united in our efforts against COVID. As we have done over the last year, we will do everything possible to support our people on the ground and the communities in which we live and work.
Now turning to our results. For the first quarter, we delivered $781 million in revenues, reflecting growth of 20% year-over-year as reported and 18% in constant currencies. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.81, a 27% increase over the same quarter in 2020. Book revenue growth, combined with a greater level of profitability, enabled us to continue to invest at higher levels across the business.
Since we last talked mid-February, we have seen a meaningful increase in demand across our business, a notable acceleration at the end of the second half of the quarter. Demand for our core services is very robust as clients doubled down on digital transformation and innovation journeys. Increasingly, we [indiscernible] not only build new platforms also to consist new digital products and services as well as to modernize and transform the technology strategy and delivery models.
The utilization trends are driving increased interest in business strategy, new types of engagement platforms, cloud migration and modernization efforts, data engineering and data analytics engagements and, in turn, machine learning and AI applications.
On industry perspective, we are experiencing this dynamic most notably in life science and health care, financial services, insurance, CPG, retail and telecommunications. Today, we're focusing on building a strong vertical expertise to leverage even more effectively our market-leading capabilities in core engineering, data and cloud.
As a result, while we still have much more work to do to continue building our integrated consultant propositions under EPAM Continuum brand, with our increasing depth in vertical domains, we are already realizing the promise of delivering increasingly differentiated offerings to our global enterprise customers. As an example, EPAM health products is creating a platform, developing modern cloud-based applications products and services and bringing their data offerings to a new generation of consumers. It is a critical part of multiyear cloud and data-driven transformation for Equifax, where we are working together to build a Google Cloud platform-based data fabric to enable Equifax to organize its disparate, legacy data sources into a single seamless structure while keeping all critical government and separation measures in place.
Also worth mentioning that while rewriting Equifax legacy system to be cloud-native would normally take years, EPAM successfully assisted in transforming Equifax mainframe applications in less than 1 year. This is only one example, which is repeating across most of markets and verticals we serve, from financial services, a rebounding interest in retail and wholesale platforms. 
We believe this underscores the amount of technology-led change that is pushing all industries into higher levels of activity. All these dynamics have led to this. And hopefully, soon in post-COVID environment, the number of business domains and processes which must be digitized is going to be rapidly increasing. Those market drivers, along with opportunities in cloud modernization, composable architecture, data, ML and AI and cybersecurity will give us sizable room for continuous and sustainable growth.
To meet this growing demand, we also continue to focus on scaling up our talent. 2020 challenged us to create a reliable and secure remote operations. 2021 has presented an opportunity to leverage those investments in infrastructure, modern talent processes and touring across the globe to explore base in which we can activate broader talent markets and deploy a more diverse set of capabilities. The result is that our current net head count growth is accelerating. 
For Q1, we welcomed approximately 2,300 net hires to EPAM, which included an increase of senior level hires coming to us with strong industry experience. And overall, since the beginning of Q4 2020, more than 5,400 net additions have joined the company, representing the highest level of EPAMers we have added in 2 consecutive quarters. So while the shortage of technical and deep industry talent is a known industry issue, we are confident that our investment in that area, our elevating brand recognition and expanding employee career journey will continue to draw top talent to EPAM.
Also part of EPAM's growth strategy is the expansion of our capabilities with very focused acquisition efforts. Recently, we closed 3 acquisitions, bringing to EPAM talent and experience in the areas of sales force, business intelligence and security. 
In April, we announced the acquisition of PolSource, a Salesforce Consultancy, with a talent concentration in the U.S., U.K. and Poland. It will extend our Salesforce services and opportunities as global footprint and provide a foundation for building additional expertise, IP and scale around Salesforce ecosystem. This acquisition builds on our earlier acquisition of MuleSoft partner, Ricston, advance our Salesforce API capabilities and to enable customers to leverage a multi-cloud approach. 
Already working closely with PolSource team to bring together a very different proposition to enterprise clients by joining our expanded consulting and global engineering confidence and to become one of the top global players in the Salesforce services space. 
A few days ago, we announced the acquisition of White-Hat, a niche cybersecurity consultancy based in Israel. White-Hat's expertise, methodologies and team of talented professionals will intensify cyber defense capabilities and help clients to further improve cyber protection within their platforms.
And lastly, we recently closed an acquisition of [indiscernible], an analytics consultancy firm with offices in Europe and Asia, serving customers across retail, consumer and [indiscernible]. This acquisition will bring a team of trusted advisers and experts to provide the full spectrum of data and analytics consultancy, including strategy advisory, data management, market-leading accelerators custom [ apps ] and end-to-end delivery across multi-vendor platforms and solutions. We are pleased to have the 3 companies join EPAM.  
In conclusion, we're were encouraged about the road ahead. During the last 12 months, we improved our leadership position within the digital segment of a very competitive global IT services market. The EPAM of today is much more adaptable, diverse and global company with increasingly strong market offerings and all the necessary components of scalable talent ecosystem which are required for growth as we think about EPAM becoming a $5 billion to $10 billion company.
With that, let me hand the call over to Jason to provide more specifics in our Q1 results and an update to our 2021 business outlook."
4773318,710055220,2324653,"EPAM Systems, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","EPAM Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our performance this quarter. As Ark mentioned, we delivered strong growth across a broad range of industry verticals and geographies. First quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $780.8 milli",1501,"Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our performance this quarter. As Ark mentioned, we delivered strong growth across a broad range of industry verticals and geographies. 
First quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $780.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 19.9% on a reported basis and 17.8% in constant currency, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of 210 basis points. Revenues came in higher than previously guided due to stronger demand in the second half of the quarter, combined with our ability to accelerate hiring in response to the improving demand environment.
Our industry vertical performance produced strong sequential growth across the majority of the portfolio, driven by a higher level of revenues from both new work at existing clients and new customer relationships established over the last 12 months.  
Looking at the year-over-year performance across our industry verticals, Life Science & Healthcare grew 31.6%. Growth in the quarter was driven by platform development to support new business models and data and analytics to drive deeper customer insights.  Financial services grew 28.3%, growth coming from traditional banking, insurance and, to a lesser degree, wealth management. Growth was driven by our clients' need to transform beyond digital banking to modernize core processes and applications, leveraging the cloud.
Software & Hi-Tech grew 20.7% in the quarter. Travel and Consumer grew 16.3%, driven by strong growth from our consumer clients, along with solid and improving performance with retail. Business information and media delivered 6.5% growth in the quarter. Growth in the quarter reflected a tougher comparison with the same quarter last year, several clients having experienced substantial growth in the first half of 2020 with revenues from those programs generally plateauing late last year. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 23.6% growth, driven by clients in telecommunications, automotive and materials.
From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 60.2% of our Q1 revenues, grew 20.6% year-over-year or 19.9% in constant currency. Europe, representing 33.2% of our Q1 revenues, grew 16.3% year-over-year or 10.9% in constant currency. CIS, representing 3.9% of our Q1 revenues, grew 21.2% year-over-year and 28.2% in constant currency. Finally, APAC grew 53.9% year-over-year or 48.4% in constant currency and now represents 2.7% of our revenues. Growth in the quarter was driven primarily by clients in financial services. Additionally, the shutdown of economic activity in the region in March 2020 produced a beneficial year-over-year comparison.
In Q1, revenue growth across the portfolio was more diverse than in previous quarters with our top 20 clients growing 12.1%, while clients outside our top 20 grew 25.9%. Additionally, we saw good growth in both existing and new clients.  
Moving on the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.5% compared to 34.9% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.9% compared to 35.5% for the same quarter last year. The lower gross margin in the quarter was primarily the result of Q1 2021 having 1 less available day of capacity than Q1 2020. Additionally, we're beginning to see some degree of elevated labor costs in certain geographies.
GAAP SG&A was 17.5% of revenue compared to 19.2% in Q1 of last year. Non GAAP SG&A came in at 15.5% of revenue compared to 17.6% in the same period last year. SG&A continues to reflect a lower level of corporate spend, which we believe will tick up as we progress throughout the year.
GAAP income from operations was $107.3 million or 13.7% of revenue in the quarter compared to $87.5 million or 13.4% of revenue in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $136.9 million or 17.5% of revenue in the quarter compared to $105.3 million or 16.2% of revenue in Q1 of last year.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 5.1%, which includes a lower-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 22.7%.
Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.86. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.81, reflecting a 26.6% increase over the same quarter in 2020. In Q1, there were approximately 58.8 million diluted shares outstanding.
Turning to the cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q1 was $12.8 million compared to $63.3 million in the same quarter of 2020. Free cash flow was $1.6 million compared to $34.2 million in the same quarter last year. Lower level of cash flow in the quarter was a result of timing of payments related to our annual variable compensation programs returning to more historic norms. Additionally, income tax payments were higher compared to the same quarter in 2020. 
We ended the quarter with $1.37 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Q1 DSO was 67 days and compares to 64 days in Q4 2020. 76 days in the same quarter last year. We believe we can continue managing DSO levels in the upper 60s.
Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 38,800 engineers, designers and consultants, a year-over-year increase of 17.3% and a sequential increase of 5.7%. Total head count for Q1 was 43,450 employees. Utilization was 81.4% compared to 79.5% in Q1 of last year and 77.9% in Q4 2020. 
Now let's turn to guidance. We continue to see strong demand across a broad range of our offerings. The elevated demand across the portfolio, combined with improvements in staffing capacity, we are raising our revenue and EPS outlook for 2021. I mentioned during our last earnings call, throughout 2021, we will be investing at elevated levels across the business to support growing demand, and we will continue our expansion into new geographies, underpinning our long-term growth objectives and goal of becoming a large -- both a larger and increasingly global EPAM.
Starting with our full year outlook. Revenue growth will now be at least 29% on a reported basis, and in constant currency terms, will now be at least 28% after factoring in an approximate 1% favorable foreign exchange impact. We now expect approximately 200 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months.
We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. As mentioned earlier, our income from operations reflects a higher level of investment in the planned expansion of our capabilities and geographies in 2021. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 12%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to continue to be approximately 23%.  
Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.09 to $7.31 for the full year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.54 to $7.76 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 59 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
In Q2 of 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of $853 million to $861 million, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 35.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect a favorable impact of FX on revenue growth to be approximately 3%. Lastly, we now expect approximately 250 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months.
In the second quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 11% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to be approximately 23%.
Earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.76 to $1.83 for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.88 to $1.95 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59 million diluted shares outstanding. 
Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $21.8 million in Q2, $21.5 million in Q3 and $21.2 million in Q4. Monetization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $3.1 million for each of the remaining quarters. Impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $1.5 million loss for each of the remaining quarters. Tax effective non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $5.7 million in Q2 and approximately $5.5 million in each remaining quarter. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $14.2 million in Q2, $10.2 million in Q3 and $8.6 million in Q4. 
In summary, we are pleased with the high-quality results we delivered in the quarter, which combined with the broad-based strength we see across the business, provide support for strong 2021 performance.

So the upside would predominantly be generated by volume. And so what we are seeing is that it's a whole wave of modernization programs kicking off within the financial services industry. So a significant amount of growth expected, as you saw in Q1,",281,"Yes. So the upside would predominantly be generated by volume. And so what we are seeing is that it's a whole wave of modernization programs kicking off within the financial services industry. So a significant amount of growth expected, as you saw in Q1, but also probably further acceleration of growth in financial services in Q2 due to the modernization programs with large banks and then also with a much accelerated growth in insurance.
We're seeing recovery in the travel and consumer section of our portfolio, quite strong growth with consumer-oriented programs, both in retail and with consumer goods companies. We're even beginning to see some sequential growth in the travel space. We're seeing strong growth in health care and life sciences. We're seeing a continued sort of solid growth in our traditional sort of hi-tech, software and high-technology clients. And we're seeing reemergent kind of emerging verticals with very strong growth in telecommunications, automotive and materials, as we talked about.
And again, where we expect between Q1 and Q2, we expect to see even stronger growth in financial services, even stronger growth than Q1 in the travel and hospitality vertical, and, again, even stronger growth in the emerging verticals. And so again, it is pretty broad-based. It's existing relationships. It's new relationships. So we're seeing some good new customer revenues. 
And then from a pricing environment, I think we're having more constructive conversations with clients. And I think both existing and new clients understand that with the wage inflation that's out there in the marketplace, that it is going to likely require somewhat higher pricing to support the addition of new teams. But for the most part, this is volume-based."

But SG&A will also be somewhat lower. 
And so we're able to maintain the profitability in the 16.5% to 17.5% range that we've talked about with a real focus on the midpoint, 17%. But we are seeing somewhat elevated levels of compensation being required both to retain and bring staff into EPAM. And that's something that we're mindful of both as we produce the guidance and as obviously we try to drive the company throughout the remainder of the year."

Actually, India, probably the fastest-growing for us components -- in talent composition right now. 
So from this point of view, again, we, each year, are becoming more distributed and more rightly balanced and concentration is going down in Eastern Europe, so which is normal with the growth of the company and globalization of our clients as well. 
So in terms of what's the best offshore, onshore, we're still increasing our onshore component, especially with the complexity of the engagement. We're doing to -- a necessity to have strong industry connectivity and consulting connectivity. So that's growing, but it's not drastically changing as well. So we're very carefully managing the balance right now. 
So what is ideal? I don't think anybody knows. So it's very dynamically changing, even if you think about what's happened in 2020 will continue in 2021. I don't think anybody is talking about ideal right now."

So let me try to be -- so on the, I guess, the 34.9% adjusted gross margin that we booked here in Q1, the lower level gross margin was in part the result of there being 1 less available day at capacity in the quarter.

And so that's -- and it's just the way that Monday through Fridays fall in the calendar for Q1, it was 1 less day than what we would have traditionally seen in previous Q1s. However, I do think we are seeing somewhat elevated levels of wage inflation. And those could continue to elevate throughout the fiscal year.
So I think that in the, let's call it, throughout the remainder of the year, I think we might run below the approximate sort of 36% that we've kind of talked about over time from a gross margin standpoint. It is -- I think it's sort of generally stabilized at a slightly lower level than that 36%. But -- so I don't expect it to continue to decline. And I think the question mark is kind of what happens in 2022. 
Right now, again, I am feeling that we've kind of -- gross margin is going to stabilize. And then we'll kind of see what happens throughout the remainder of the year in terms of the pricing environment.

And those companies continue to grow quite rapidly. 
I think this year, what you're beginning to see is some of the new relationships we established in 2020.

And at the same time, it's pushed a lot of these believers in this highly distributed way of working and had to accept it, which is making all of this to work even better. So I think that would stay.

by more than $100 million, and we finished another quarter with very strong sequential growth. The reason for demand is [indiscernible] orders. By now we all know that application development and cloud and data integration services are growing postpandemic very strongly and driving corporate budget for us. But In addition, it has become very visible with the current client transformation efforts are continuous and multidimensional and carries uncertainty of them now. And that is the reason while on top of application development and cloud integration is large, we are seeing very fast expanding demand for software-enabled business in scenarios coming our way, too. Overall and across all our industry verticals as a portfolio of both new and current customers, we see progression into new and larger multiyear engagement with our customers who look to fulfill both engineering demand as well as demand for new collaboration models that bring in greater stake in design and product [indiscernible] 
In short, clients really need simultaneous help with both strategy and implementations today. This means that we will have to smartly blend not only industry in [indiscernible] consulting perspective, but a good portion of managing consulting capabilities, together with very scalable and tough merchants needing in technology delivery services, which have been maturing over years. 
All that requires us to remain with new approaches to source different type of talent, manage numerous risk and find very new ways of working [indiscernible] And we're doing all of them. 
First, certain operation practices introduced in response to COVID that made us nimble and responding to new customer demands. And we have created an even more adaptable internal digital platforms to manage our increasingly global business operation. Additionally, throughout 2021, we have focused on establishing repeatable approaches to drive growth across a more globally diversified delivery base while also expanding our domain capability and geographical footprint, both organically and through acquisitions. 
Finally, we are constantly [indiscernible] our partner ecosystem disclosed and modestly aligned working with position EPAM as a partner of choice for our cloud, digital and industry solutions relations. That includes, for example, the EPAM active participation in [indiscernible] and continuous contribution of over 4,500 EPAMers to open-source projects, which makes EPAM the #1 services company in the open-source community and among top 20 global contributors overall. 
Let's bring now some highlights on expanding our EPAM market, which remains one of our core priorities, including the addition of strategy advisory services on top of already established industry and functional consulting capabilities. It's become an important [indiscernible] because of growing client demand for software-enabled business scenarios. And we seek now to help clients [indiscernible] in their fast-changing businesses with both strategy implementation simultaneously. 
During the last several calls, we were sharing specific client stories to restate our progress in the end-to-end solution and increasing part of our consulting to our overall base. The good examples from the gaming industry, which was one of the few that performed well even at the beginning of pandemic uncertainty; in the health care industry, where we are helping this lifestyle technology platform transformation effort; and data and analytics segment, where we assisted to one of the most sophisticated global information providers with a massive cloud modernization story. 
Today, we would like to highlight a client from the retail industry where we have delivered across the range of [indiscernible] program. This American multinational manufacturing who market skin care, makeup, fragrance and haircare products is undergoing their own transformation to drive a deeper connection to their customers, optimize operations and shorten the supply chain. They're responding to consumer changes because of the global pandemic with the wider shift in the luxury and retail business model. We are working with the company to develop a control to equivalent of their supply chain, connect several internal and external data plans, including product performance across geographic regions, competitor analysis, consumer engagement index, social media and even [indiscernible] to create a predictive view important realtime production in placement [indiscernible] This supply chain optimization project, leveraging our business consulting, data analytics and engineering capabilities. 
With a blending of physical and digital consumer buying behaviors, we developed a virtual trial platform along the consumer to apply a cosmetic using AR/VRtechnology. In addition to create a virtual consultation and [indiscernible] with the consumer in new ways, the platform can be repurposed because there are also cosmetic brands. 
The digital engagement platform strengthened the user journey during the pandemic months when stores were closed across the world and has driven better conversion rates and sold for consumer acquisitions [indiscernible] It's already the major consumer [indiscernible] happened and are here to stay so the company and EPAM believe that the future sales will be largely driven by digital platforms and the increased functionality based on the latest technology trends. 
Let's move now to the type of clients. While the [indiscernible] continues to be the major challenge that is faced by all of the players in our sector, the EPAM continues to grow rapidly in Central and Eastern Europe and in India. Additionally, we opened a new delivery location in Ontario, Canada and are also expanding our operations in Latin America with the acquisition of [indiscernible] Company, which we just have closed a couple of days ago. We'll share more details just in couple of minutes. 
In total, in Q2, [indiscernible] more than 3,800 net hires organically to EPAM. This talent journey as a company from our new programs, lateral hires in our delivery location and increasing the senior level hires in our in-market geographies is [indiscernible] industry experience. The last one allow us to expand EPAM continued penetration of North American market with the addition of business experience consulting teams in 1/2 dozen new locations. While in Europe, we also brought new consulting capability  [indiscernible] 
total, in the first half of 2021, approximately 6,700 net additions have joined EPAM, a number greater than what we've historically ever had added on a full year base. As in the past, we maintain high end and accelerated rate. We continue to make significant investments in our global talent development, upskilling and educational programs. We believe that in addition to this investment, our internal platform progression in talent, analysis and AI will continue to bring us a new level of engagement and capability to deploy increasing to higher value services to our global enterprise costs. We also believe that while all this should allow us to continuously scale. It will also ensure the quality standards of our delivery services with our company [indiscernible] 
Last time, we shared news about 3 companies in effort EPAM M&A efforts. Recently, we made 2 more acquisitions to extend our consulting capabilities, while also expanding our presence in several, for us, key geographies. Last week, we announced our acquisition of Corus, the consultancy specializing in strategy and technology-driven formations with presence in Berlin, Dubai, London and Zurich. Corus will strengthen EPAM's consultant pipeline and extend our talent footprint in the future. 
For this week, we also closed the acquisition of [indiscernible] a digital software engineering company. In addition to the [indiscernible] platform development expertise, the company is specialize in machine learning, data capture and [indiscernible] Located in Bogota, Colombia and with presence in Seattle, Washington, the acquisition of [indiscernible] expands EPAM's geographic presence in Latin America and [indiscernible] division. 
We are extremely pleased to extend EPAM's new talent and capabilities created by those 2 fronts. Regarding acquisitions, I would like to close with some additional comments related to our recent efforts in the area. We already see visible contribution from our recent M&A activities in such areas in cyber [indiscernible] specifically on [indiscernible] which is one of the largest deals today. You should say that we are rapidly shaping new EPAM ordering and accelerating our go-to-market activities within the fast-growing Salesforce [indiscernible]

We are very pleased with the Q2 results, which reflects strong growth across a broad range of industry verticals and geographies. In the second quarter, EPAM delivered revenues of [$881.4] million, a year-over-year increase of 39.4% on a reported basis and 35.9% in constant currency terms, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of 350 basis points. This quarter's revenue growth substantially driven by the continued improvement in the company's ability to expand delivery capacity in response to the extremely strong demand for EPAM services. 
Moving on to industry vertical performance. We delivered very strong sequential and year-over-year growth across the travel and consumer, financial services, telecommunications, in manufacturing and automotive industries. Looking at the year-over-year performance across each of our 
[Audio Gap] 
payment platform providers. Like last quarter, growth was driven by modernization and transformation for applications, in addition to new payment platforms issued with realtime payments. Software & Hi-Tech grew 33.2% in the quarter. Life Sciences & Healthcare grew 33.1%. Business information and media delivered 12.5% growth in the quarter. Growth in the quarter reflected a tougher comparison with the same quarter last year, with several clients having experienced substantial growth in the first half of 2020 with revenues from these programs generally plateauing late in 2020. 
And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 56.4% growth, driven by clients in telecommunications, energy, manufacturing and automotive. From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region, representing 59.8% of our Q2 revenues, grew 38.1% year-over-year or 36.9% in constant currency. Europe, representing 33% of our Q2 revenues, grew 38% year or 29.9% in constant currency. CIS, representing 4.4% of our Q2 revenues, grew 70.8% year-over-year and 74.6% in constant currency. Strong performance in both financial services and materials, in addition to Travel and Consumer contributed to growth in [indiscernible] And finally, APAC grew 44.4% year-over-year or 38.9% in constant currency terms and now represents 2.8% of our revenues. 
In Q2, revenue growth across the portfolio resulted in increased customer diversification with our top 20 clients growing 19% while our clients outside our top 20 grew 55%. And moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.8% compared to 33.7% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35% compared to 35.1% in the same quarter last year. Gross margin for the first half of 2021 reflect some degree of elevated labor costs in certain locations, which we expect to manage with rate increases and staffing rotation. 
GAAP SG&A was 17.2% of revenue compared to 18.1% in Q2 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.6% of revenue compared to 16% in the same period last year. While the absolute dollar spend of our SG&A have increased, the relative percentage of revenue remains lower than historical average. GAAP income from operations was $125.3 million or 14.2% of revenue in the quarter compared to $83.4 million or 13.2% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $155.2 million or 17.6% of revenues in the quarter compared to $108.2 million or 17.1% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 6.9%, which includes a higher-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 22.9%. 
Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.94. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.05, reflecting a 40.4% increase over the same quarter in 2020. In Q2, there were approximately 59 million diluted shares outstanding. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $68.8 million compared to $146.2 million in the same quarter of 2020. Free cash flow was $46.2 million compared to $134.7 million in the same quarter last year. The lower level of free cash flow in Q2 2021 relative to Q2 2020 was the result of changes in DSO in each quarter, higher levels of cash payments made in Q2 2021 associated with corporate income tax and the absence of tax payment deferral programs made available in Q2 2020 as part of government related programs. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
At the end of Q2, DSO was 70 days and compares to 67 days from Q1 2021 and 73 days in the same quarter last year. We expect to maintain DSO around the same level for the remainder of the year. 
Moving on to the operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 42,800 consultants, designers and engineers, a year-over-year increase of 32.6%. Our general headcount for Q2 was more than 47,850 employees. Both groups of employees grew just over 10% sequentially. Utilization was 80.2% compared to 83.9% from Q2 of last year and 81.4% in Q1 2021. 
Now let's turn to guidance. With a strong first half behind us, a robust demand environment and increased confidence in our ability to scale production headcount in order to meet this demand, we are raising our business outlook for 2021. Starting with our full year outlook. Revenue growth will now be at least 37% on a reported basis and in constant currency terms will now be at least 35%. After fact gearing in approximately 2% favorable foreign exchange impact, we now expect approximately 300 basis points of revenue contribution come from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months, including [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] We expect GAAP income from operations will now be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5% and non-GAAP income operations will now be in the range of 17% to 18% based on the strength of our first half and anticipated ongoing efficiencies in SG&A spending as a percentage of revenue. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate will now be approximately 11% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation to continue to be approximately 23%. Earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.70 to $7.89 for the full year and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $8.25 to $8.44 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 59 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For Q3 of 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of $957 million to $965 million, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 47% at the midpoint of the range. We expect the favorable impact of FX on revenue growth to be approximately 1%. Lastly, we now expect [indiscernible] 450 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions we closed in the last 
[Audio Gap]
For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.89 to $1.96 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.22 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.2 million diluted shares outstanding. 
Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately and $27.6 million in Q3 and $25.7 million in Q4. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $5.6 million for each of the remaining quarters. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $1.5 million loss for each of the remaining quarters. Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $7.6 million in Q3 and approximately $7.1 million in Q4. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $13.7 million in Q3 and $12.8 million in Q4. 
In summary, we are pleased with our Q2 and first half 2021 results, which, combined with the broad-based strength we see across the business, provides support for what we believe will be a very strong 2021 performance.

With this pressure around us, putting some extra efforts, and maybe we will find some opportunities. 
And the first question was about M&A. And I think here, there is not many changes. We were mentioning before that we were evaluating the pipeline all the time because we were looking for new capabilities in market expertise, consulting components and thinking what would be the best for us kind of the strategy of our delivery. So it's all applicable today. But we closed in like 5 deals this year. It just reflects that we found better companies leading to join us. But also from a pipeline point of view, it was pretty developed pipeline. In the past, we have a pretty well-developed pipeline. Right now, how many other transactions will be closing within the next 6 to 12 months? We need to like to wait and see. 
In general, I would like to say like we don't have a better year of kind of rolling up acquisitions. We specifically looking for some that should add capabilities and fill the gaps, which we need to fill. So -- and even right now more [indiscernible] pretty small. Again, I don't think we're going to hear anything new what we don't know. It's definitely the pressure to perform and to deliver is much higher now in -- I was trying to say post-COVID, post-COVID continuous COVID time versus pre-COVID time.

Certainly, that's helpful. And you are seeing an expansion of revenue per head.

We're helping understand obviously what conditions we're facing with somewhat elevated levels of wage inflation, which is in part then driving the conversation around meeting the higher rates. So I do want us to leave with the idea that we feel good about the demand environment. The demand environment helps us when it comes to rate increases. But at the same time, the 17% to 18% guide that we have for the full year is informed in part by the lower SG&A in 2021. And you're likely to see somewhat higher SG&A in 2022.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered a strong set of results for the second quarter with revenues of $881 million, reflecting reported year-over-year growth rate of 39% and 36% in constant currency ter",1493,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered a strong set of results for the second quarter with revenues of $881 million, reflecting reported year-over-year growth rate of 39% and 36% in constant currency terms.  
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.05, an increase of 40% over the same quarter in 2020. Growth was very much broad based. All our geographies and most of our industry verticals experienced strong demand, reflecting the robust market environment and pushing our growth rate to historically [indiscernible] levels.
On a sequential basis, quarterly revenues exceeded our Q1 results by more than $100 million, and we finished another quarter with very strong sequential growth. 
The reason for surge in demand is pretty obvious. By now we all know that application development and cloud and data integration services are growing postpandemic very strongly and driving corporate budgets forward. But in addition, it has become very visible that the current client transformation efforts are continuous and multidimensional and carries uncertainty of them now. And that is the reason why, on top of application development and cloud integration at large, we are seeing very fast expanding demand for software-enabled business scenarios coming our way, too. 
Overall and across all our industry verticals we have a portfolio of both new and current customers. We see progression into new and larger multiyear engagements as our customers look in part to fulfill both engineering demand as well as demand for new collaboration models that bring in greater stake in product design and product management.  
In short, clients really need simultaneous help with both strategy and implementations today. This means that we will have to smartly blend not only industry and functional consulting expertise, but a good portion of management consulting capabilities together with very scalable and tough notions we need in technology delivery services, which have been maturing over the years.  
All that requires us to experiment with new approaches to source different type of talent, manage numerous risk and find very new ways of work in general. And we're doing all of that.  
First, certain operation practices introduced in response to COVID that made us nimble and responding to new customer demands. And we have created an even more adaptable internal digital platforms to manage our increasingly global business operation. 
Additionally, throughout 2021, we have focused on establishing repeatable approaches to drive growth across a more globally diversified delivery base while also expanding our domain capability and geographical footprint both organically and through acquisitions.  
Finally, we are constantly incenting our partner ecosystem with closer and more vertically aligned [ working ] that position EPAM as a partner of choice for our cloud, digital and industry solution innovations. That includes, for example, EPAM active participation in the MACH Alliance and continuous contribution of over 4,500 EPAMers to open-source projects, which makes EPAM the #1 services company in the open-source community and among top 20 global contributors overall. 
Let's bring now some highlights on expanding our EPAM Continuum [ motion ], which remains one of our core priorities, including the addition of strategy advisory services on top of already established industry and functional consulting capabilities. It's becoming important exactly because of growing client demand for software-enabled business scenarios. And we seek now to help clients across a number of areas in their fast-changing businesses with both strategy implementations simultaneously.  
During the last several calls, we were sharing specific client stories to illustrate our progress in the end-to-end solution and increasing impact of our consulting [ quoting ] to our overall engagement. We brought examples from the gaming industry, which was one of the few that performed well even at the beginning of the pandemic uncertainty; and the health care industry, where we are helping with large-scale technology platform transformation efforts; and data and analytics segment, where we assisted to one of the most sophisticated global information providers with a massive cloud modernization story.  
Today, we would like to highlight a client from the retail industry where we have delivered across the range of end-to-end programs. This American multinational manufacturer and marketer of prestigious skincare, makeup, fragrance and haircare products is undergoing their own transformation to drive a deeper connection to their customers, optimize operations and shorten their supply chain. It's in part responding to consumer changes because of the global pandemic with a wider shift in the luxury and retail business model. 
We are working with the company to develop a control tower equivalent of their supply chain, connecting several internal and external data points, including product performance across geographic regions, competitor analysis, consumer engagement index, social media and even weather events to create a predictive view and form a real-time production and placement of their projects in consumer markets. This supply chain optimization project leveraging our business consulting, data analytics and engineering capabilities.  
With a blending of physical and digital consumer buying behaviors, we developed a virtual trial platform, allowing the consumer to apply a cosmetic using AR/VR technology, in addition to creating a virtual consultation and the ability to engage with their consumer in new ways. The platform can be repurposed across their multiple cosmetic brands.  
The digital engagement platform strengthened the user journey during the pandemic months when stores were closed across the world and had driven better conversion rates and results for consumer acquisitions online. It's already obvious that major consumer behavior shifts happened and are here to stay, so the company and EPAM believe that their future sales will be largely driven by digital platforms and the increased functionality based on the latest technology trends.  
Let's move now to the topic of talent. While the supply of talent continues to be the major challenge that is faced by all of the players in our sector, EPAM continues to grow rapidly in Central and Eastern Europe and in India. Additionally, we opened a new delivery location in Ontario, Canada and are also expanding our operations in Latin America with the acquisition in Colombia of a digital and engineering company, which we just have closed a couple of days ago. We'll share more details just in couple of minutes.  
In total, in Q2, we welcomed more than 3,800 net hires organically to EPAM, this talent joining the company from our university programs, lateral hires in our delivery locations and, increasingly, senior-level hires in our -- in market geographies with extensive industry experience. 
The last one allow us to expand our EPAM Continuum penetration of North American market with the addition of business experience and technology consulting teams in 1/2 dozen new locations. While in Europe, we also brought new consulting capability  via acquisition.  
In total, in the first half of 2021, approximately 6,700 net additions have joined EPAM, a number greater than what we historically ever had added on a full year basis. 
As in the past, to maintain hiring at an accelerated rate, we continue to make significant investments in our global talent development, upskilling and educational programs. We believe that in addition to these investments, our internal platform progression in talent, analysis and AI will continue to bring us a new level of engagement and capability to deploy increasingly higher-value services to our global enterprise customers. We also believe that while all this should allow us to continuously scale, it will also ensure the quality standards of our delivery services without compromising costs.
Last time, we shared news about 3 companies being added to EPAM via our M&A efforts. Recently, we made 2 more acquisitions to extend our consulting and engineering capabilities while also expanding our presence in several for us (sic) [ of our ] key geographies. 
Last week, we announced our acquisition of CORE SE, consultancy think tank specializing in IT strategy and technology-driven transformations with presence in Berlin, Dubai, London and Zurich. CORE will strengthen EPAM's strategy consulting footprint and extend our talent footprint in the DACH region. 
Earlier this week, we also closed the acquisition of S4N, a digital software engineering company. In addition to their primary application platform development expertise, the company specializes in machine learning, data architecture and cloud ops. Located in Bogota, Colombia and with presence in Seattle, Washington, the acquisition of S4N expands EPAM's geographic presence in Latin America and forms a second, for us, [indiscernible]. 
We are extremely pleased to extend EPAM's new talent and capabilities offered by those 2 firms. 
Regarding acquisitions, I would like to close with some additional comments related to our recent efforts in the area. 
We already see visible contribution from our recent M&A activities in such areas as cyber advanced analytics, specifically on PolSource, which is one of the largest deals to date. We should say that we are rapidly shaping new EPAM offering and accelerating our go-to-market activities within the fast-growing Salesforce [indiscernible].  
With that, let me hand the call over to Jason, who will provide more specifics on our Q2 results and update our 2021 business outlook."

We are very pleased with our Q2 results, which reflect strong growth across a broad range of industry verticals and geographies. 
In the second quarter, EPAM delivered revenues of $881.4 million, a year-over-year increase of 39.4% on a reported basis and 35.9% in constant currency terms, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of 350 basis points. This quarter's revenue growth was substantially driven by the continued improvement in the company's ability to expand delivery capacity in response to the extremely strong demand for EPAM's services. 
Moving on to industry vertical performance. We delivered very strong sequential and year-over-year growth across the travel and consumer, financial services, telecommunications, energy and  manufacturing and automotive industries. 
Looking at the year-over-year performance across each of our industry verticals, travel and consumer grew 59.9% driven by very strong growth from both our consumer and retail clients, who are initiating and expanding large-scale transformation programs as they look for different ways to connect to their end customers.  
Financial services grew 51.5% with very strong, broad-based growth coming from banking, insurance wealth management and payment platform providers. Like last quarter, growth was driven by modernization and transformation of core applications, in addition to new payment platforms associated with real-time payments. 
Software & hi-tech grew 33.2% in the quarter. 
Life sciences & health care grew 33.1%. 
Business information & media delivered 12.5% growth in the quarter. Growth in the quarter reflected a tougher comparison with the same quarter last year, with several clients having experienced substantial growth in the first half of 2020 with revenues from those programs generally plateauing late in 2020. 
And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 56.4% growth driven by clients in telecommunications, energy, manufacturing and automotive. 
From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region representing 59.8% of our Q2 revenues, grew 38.1% year-over-year or 36.9% in constant currency. 
Europe, representing 33% of our Q2 revenues, grew 38% year-over-year or 29.9% in constant currency. 
CIS, representing 4.4% of our Q2 revenues, grew 70.8% year-over-year and 74.6% in constant currency. Strong performance in both financial services and materials, in addition to travel & consumer contributing to growth in Q2. 
And finally, APAC grew 44.4% year-over-year or 38.9% in constant currency terms and now represents 2.8% of our revenues. 
In Q2, revenue growth across the portfolio resulted in increased customer diversification with our top 20 clients growing 19% while our clients outside our top 20 grew 55%. 
And moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.8% compared to 33.7% in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35% compared to 35.1% in the same quarter last year. Gross margin for the first half of 2021 reflects some degree of elevated labor costs in certain locations, which we expect to manage with rate increases and staffing rotation. 
GAAP SG&A was 17.2% of revenue compared to 18.1% in Q2 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.6% of revenue compared to 16% in the same period last year. While the absolute dollar spend of our SG&A has increased, the relative percentage of revenue remains lower than historical averages. 
GAAP income from operations was $125.3 million or 14.2% of revenue in the quarter compared to $83.4 million or 13.2% of revenue in Q2 last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $155.2 million or 17.6% of revenues in the quarter compared to $108.2 million or 17.1% of revenue in Q2 last year. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 6.9%, which includes a higher-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits, was 22.9%. 
Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.94. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.05, reflecting a 40.4% increase over the same quarter in 2020. 
In Q2, there were approximately 59 million diluted shares outstanding. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q2 was $68.8 million compared to $146.2 million in the same quarter of 2020. Free cash flow was $46.2 million compared to $134.7 million in the same quarter last year. The lower level of free cash flow in Q2 2021 relative to Q2 2020 was the result of changes in DSO in each quarter, higher levels of cash payments made in Q2 2021 associated with corporate income tax and the absence of tax payment deferral programs made available in Q2 2020 as part of government COVID-related programs. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. 
At the end of Q2, DSO was 70 days and compares to 67 days in Q1 2021 and 73 days in the same quarter last year. We expect to maintain DSO around the same level for the remainder of the year. 
Moving on to the operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 42,800 consultants, designers and engineers, a year-over-year increase of 32.6%. Our total headcount for Q2 was more than 47,850 employees. Both groups of employees grew just over 10% sequentially. Utilization was 80.2% compared to 83.9% in Q2 of last year and 81.4% in Q1 2021. 
Now let's turn to guidance. With a strong first half behind us, a robust demand environment and increased confidence in our ability to scale production headcount in order to meet this demand, we are raising our business outlook for 2021. 
Starting with our full year outlook. Revenue growth will now be at least 37% on a reported basis and in constant currency terms will now be at least 35% after factoring in approximate 2% favorable foreign exchange impact. 
We now expect approximately 300 basis points of revenue contribution coming from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months, including CORE SE and S4N. 
We expect GAAP income from operations will now be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%. And non-GAAP income from operations will now be in the range of 17% to 18% based on the strength of our first half and anticipated ongoing efficiencies in SG&A spending as a percentage of revenue. 
We expect our GAAP effective tax rate will now be approximately 11% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to continue to be approximately 23%. 
Earnings per share. We expect that GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.70 to $7.89 for the full year. And non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $8.25 to $8.44 for the full year. 
We expect weighted average share count of 59 million fully diluted shares outstanding. 
For Q3 of 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of $957 million to $965 million, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 47% at the midpoint of the range. We expect the favorable impact of FX on revenue growth to be approximately 1%. 
Lastly, we now expect approximately 450 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months.
For the third quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%, and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 17% to 18%. 
We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 13% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to be approximately 23%.
For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.89 to $1.96 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.22 for the quarter. 
We expect a weighted average share count of 59.2 million diluted shares outstanding. 
Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $27.6 million in Q3 and $25.7 million in Q4. 
Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $5.6 million for each of the remaining quarters. 
The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $1.5 million loss for each of the remaining quarters. 
Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $7.6 million in Q3 and approximately $7.1 million in Q4. 
And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $13.7 million in Q3 and $12.8 million in Q4. 
In summary, we are pleased with our Q2 and first half 2021 results, which, combined with the broad-based strength we see across the business, provides support for what we believe will be a very strong 2021 performance.

So like I do want us to leave with the idea that we're -- we feel good about the demand environment. The demand environment helps us when it comes to rate increases.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I think it would make sense to start today from the same reference point we used exactly 12 months ago, when we began to see the first positive turning signs after the pandemic",1530,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I think it would make sense to start today from the same reference point we used exactly 12 months ago, when we began to see the first positive turning signs after the pandemic hit us earlier in 2020. This reference point was our Investor and Analyst Day, which took place November 2019 in Boston, which was still done in the old-fashioned, in-person setting. 
On that day, we were reminding about EPAM's history during our post-IPO and our transformational journey from being a pure software engineering services firm to a much more diverse digital and product consultancy with a strong engineering [indiscernible]. 
Beginning in 2013, we set an aspirational goal to become one of the global leaders in product development services space. 3 years later, in 2016, we set out another one to become one of the global leaders in product and platform engineering services. We cited that practically every few years we focused on way for EPAM to evolve as an organization with our offerings and the specific elements that were essential to transform the company. These undertakings enabled us to innovate, remain relevant and stay ahead in ever-changing market during those initial post-IPO times. Each aspirational mission was done at a landing point in a longer journey of transformation and was validated by external views, namely industry analysts [indiscernible] sector and our ability to grow significantly faster than the market, which has resulted in doubling the company revenue practically every 3 years. 
In result, at our Investor and Analyst Day in 2019, we shared our aspiration for the next 3 years, targeting actually the end of 2021 and softly indicated that we might be able to double the size of the [indiscernible]. We also stated then that to achieve this goal, we will need to continue transforming EPAM into a different company with a strong capability to adapt people, platforms and processes into those that quickly respond to change, build and bring to life the digital platform that connects our people to work seamlessly and enables us to be efficient and effective in all what we do. We extend our leadership across integrated consulting and engineering services. And in result, open opportunities for transformation for everybody anywhere through net generation delivery, educational, social and innovation products. 
In short, we set our sights on becoming the transformation platform for those clients who would like to become adaptive enterprises themselves, which [indiscernible] indeed our current undertaking today as well. 
So last year, on our Q3 earnings call, we were reminded of all that and shared a good level of optimism or self-confidence, if you will, that we would be returning to our traditional 20-plus organic growth rate in post-pandemic environment. But we also were almost certain at that point that doubling our 2018 revenue by the end of 2021 would not be a realistic target anymore with everything we experienced in Q2 and Q3 of last year and [indiscernible] in general so the situation for 2021 back then in November of 2020. 
Now as we sit here today, we see how naive our post-pandemic assumptions were just a year ago, especially regarding the post-pandemic term itself. I guess, we were realizing today that we can drop the post portion of the term for some time in the future. 
But on the other side, we are now realizing that EPAM is in exciting growth route in its 28-year journey because while looking at the present, we have clear line of sight to a fiscal year which will be one of the highest-growing revenue years in our post-IPO history, that includes also breaking through to our $4 billion revenue quarter at the end of 2021 and actually still reaching out our aspirational goal of doubling the company for the third time since 2012. 
This result is an intersection of many factors that have led us to our current state and the next phase of our journey, a journey that has been as much about transforming EPAM as it has been about helping our clients [indiscernible] themselves. 
It's exactly through this latest ambition which we shared in Boston that we are developing ourselves to be one of the best in the areas of innovation and design, consulting, [indiscernible] and social responsibility in addition to driving even higher levels of excellence as one of the strongest engineering companies in our space. 
And today, EPAM is a substantially different company than we were just 6, 8 years ago, one that has much more diverse foundation to drive the next levels of value to the clients and our growth in result. So along the way, we have to and will continue to solve for the challenges of scaling for growth, geographical expansions and attracting new types of talent, which brings different experiences and different types of [indiscernible] to EPAM while complementing our strong technical and engineering teams. 
Additionally, at each conference with identifying capabilities that we needed to strengthen or build in order to transform EPAM to serve the market needs, and to be done in both ways, organically and through acquisitions, which continue to be an important part of our capability extension strategy. 
As we turn to the future and set our sights on growing to a $10 billion revenue company, our growth will come from the foundational building blocks we have assembled over the last years, some of which include an integrated consulting and engineering confidence, which brings together business and strategy, technology and experience consulting brought to the market through our EPAM Continuum modeling. High-value cloud services focused on cloud native development, application optimization and enabling the data-driven enterprise, helping our customers modernize [indiscernible] from inside out. Data and AI everywhere, leveraging our strong advances engineering and data heritage building the massive data structures and leveraging API technologies to drive fast insights. And enabled with our global talent pools connected by our digital platforms guided by a net generation delivery methodologies and supported by educational, social and innovation initiatives. 
Lastly, we will continue to focus on expanding our partner ecosystem aligned with our vision and mapped with our vertical and geographical focus developing joint solutions and going to market together. 
So pivot into the current moment. As I mentioned a short time ago, acquisitions will continue to be a prominent part of EPAM capabilities and geographical extension strategy. This year, we have already closed on 5 acquisitions which are enabling us to expand our current offerings in sales force, cybersecurity, analytics, strategy consulting and our presence in Latin America. 
You also may have seen recent regulatory filings about our intentions to acquire Emakina Group. Emakina is globally recognized digital marketing and experience agency or how they call themselves the user agency, specializing in a range of areas, including commerce and retail, media, planning and buy, service design, branding and content production across a number of parts, headquartered in Belgium and with more than 1,100 employees and studios across 18 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and North America. This acquisition will enhance EPAM's ability to deliver creative solutions, personalized experience and new-generation digital products which will increase in new opening to our global clients. 
So worth noting that while EPAM is already listed among [indiscernible] top 25 largest agencies in the world, Emakina will add very new capabilities to our agency working and significantly strengthen EPAM in market position across Europe and Middle East. 
With that, it seems like it's the right moment now to mention that just a few days ago, [indiscernible] published the 100 fastest-growing companies list for 2021 and included EPAM in the fourth time and third consecutive year, ranking us 25th overall and the #1 in information technology services category. Of note, we are actually is the only IT services company on the list. 
And in addition, Newsweek included EPAM for the first time in the 2021 America's Most Loved Workplace rank, placing us as #49 on the list. 
So before turning to Jason to provide an update on our third quarter results and our 2021 outlook, while I would like one more time to state the demand for our services continues to be very strong. And we see this across all market segments. We also very well understand that this is an overall strong demand environment. And this is precisely why we feel we cannot become overly confident. We need to continuously build on our breadth and continuously invest in our strong engineering culture, while constantly expanding our services into real end-to-end, higher complexity engagements across the globe to bring unquestionable value to the clients. 
We understand that everything about our future high growth is hard. But as before, we are not try to push into new areas because they are challenging, and we are committed to do so in a very thoughtful and sustainable way so as not to compromise on the quality of the delivery that EPAM is known for. And if anything, we are constantly looking for ways to establish differentiation for not only our customers, but also, as importantly, for EPAMers. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Jason."
4773318,1684382748,2424741,"EPAM Systems, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","EPAM Systems, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, EPM delivered very strong results, reflecting continued significant demand for the company's services across a wide range of industry verticals and geographies. During the quarter, EPAM g",1515,"Thank you, Ark, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, EPM delivered very strong results, reflecting continued significant demand for the company's services across a wide range of industry verticals and geographies. 
During the quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $988.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 51.6% on a reported basis and 50.7% in constant currency terms, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of 90 basis points. A continued robust demand environment, combined with our ability to recruit at record levels while retaining talent drove a higher-than-expected revenue results for the quarter. 
Customers continue to turn to EPAM for help transforming their businesses, and we continue to support our customers across a range of initiatives, including modernizing and transforming applications across the full range of industries we serve, creating new digital products and businesses and harnessing the resulting data to improve revenue growth, supply chain operations and end customer experiences. And finally, merging physical and digital to create superior retail experiences. 
Turning to the performance of our industry verticals. Travel & consumer grew 79.3% driven by very strong growth from both our consumer and retail clients. In addition, we saw renewed demand and return to growth across our travel customers. 
Financial services grew 68.9% with very strong broad-based growth coming from asset management, insurance, payments and banking. 
Software & hi-tech grew 46.6% in the quarter. Life sciences & healthcare grew 29.5%. Business information & media delivered 23.6% growth in the quarter. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 61.5% growth driven by clients in telecommunications, energy, manufacturing and automotive. 
From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region representing 60% of Q3 revenues, grew 51.6% year-over-year or 51.4% in constant currency. Europe, representing 33% of our Q3 revenues, grew 50.9% year-over-year or 49.5% in constant currency. CIS, representing 4% of our Q3 revenues, grew 49.7% year-over-year and 44.6% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 60.4% year-over-year or 58% in constant currency terms and now represents 3% of our revenues. 
In Q3, revenues from our top 20 customers grew 29%, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 69%, resulting in greater diversification across our revenue base. 
Moving down the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.9% compared to 35.1% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.1% compared to 36.8% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q3 2021 was impacted by higher levels of funding for our variable compensation programs given the company's outperformance versus targets established at the beginning of the 2021 fiscal year. 
GAAP SG&A was 17.1% of revenue compared to 17.9% in Q3 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.3% of revenue compared to 15.9% and in the same period last year. 
GAAP income from operations was $144.1 million or 14.6% of revenue in the quarter compared to $96.4 million or 14.8% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $179.6 million or 18.2% of revenue in the quarter compared to $123.3 million or 18.9% of revenue in Q3 of last year. 
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 14.6% versus our Q3 guide of 13% due to a lower-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and a onetime benefit related to certain tax credits. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits and includes the onetime benefit of the tax credit, was 21%. 
Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.95. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.42, reflecting a $0.77 increase or 46.7% growth over the same quarter in 2020. 
In Q3, there were approximately 59.2 million diluted shares outstanding. 
Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q3 was $206.1 million compared to $175.6 million in the same quarter of 2020. 
Free cash flow of $184.9 million produced a 129% conversion of adjusted net income compared to free cash flow of $165.8 million in the same quarter last year. 
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which does not include the restricted cash related to the acquisition of Emakina Group. 
Additionally, in October, we updated and expanded our unsecured credit facility which will allow for up to $700 million in funding plus an additional $300 million via accordion, giving us access to a total of $1 billion in borrowing capacity. This new credit facility replaces a 2017 facility which allowed for borrowing up to $300 million with an additional $100 million via accordion. 
At the end of Q3, DSO was 70 days and compares to 70 days for both Q2 2021 and the same quarter last year. We expect to maintain DSO around the same level or somewhat lower in Q4. 
Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 47,050 consultants, designers and engineers, a year-over-year increase of 39.4%. Our total head count for Q3 was more than 52,650 employees. In the first 3 quarters of 2021, we had approximately 11,500 net additions, a record number for EPAM over a 9-month period. Utilization was 77.1% compared to 78.2% in Q3 of last year and 80.2% in Q2 2021. 
Now let's turn to guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, combined with a robust demand environment and continued confidence in our ability to scale production headcount, we are raising our business outlook for 2021. 
So starting with our full year outlook. Revenue growth will now be at least 40% on a reported basis. And in constant currency terms, it will now be at least 38%, after factoring in an approximate 2% favorable foreign exchange impact. 
On an organic constant currency basis, revenue growth will be at least 34% after excluding an approximate 400 basis points of revenue contribution from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months, including Emakina. This compares to the previous full year revenue growth outlook of 37% reported, 35% constant currency and 32% in organic constant currency terms, which we provided during our Q2 earnings call. 
We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 17% to 18%. 
We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 11%, which includes the benefit of certain tax credits I mentioned previously. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will now be 22%. 
For earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.86 to $7.93 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $8.72 to $8.79 for the full year. 
We expect weighted average share count of 59.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. 
For Q4 of 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.075 billion to $1.085 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 49% at the midpoint of the range, with the favorable impact of foreign exchange on revenue growth expected to be minimal. 
Lastly, we expect approximately 800 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions closed over the last 12 months, including Emakina. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 14% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to be approximately 22%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.11 to $2.18 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.44 to $2.51 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.3 million diluted shares outstanding. 
Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in the fourth quarter. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $31.4 million. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $5.6 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $1.5 million loss. Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $8 million. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $13 million in the quarter. 
In summary, we are pleased with our Q3 results and the record growth we are producing in our 2021 fiscal year. While it is too early to give a detailed view of our business outlook for 2022, we believe the demand environment continues to support an elevated annual growth rate in excess of our traditional guidance of greater than 20%. However, we also believe it is important to establish and maintain a more sustainable growth rate in the coming year than that achieved in 2021. As we have done in the past, we'll provide a detailed view of 2022 guidance in February on our Q4 earnings call.

And so we expect that we will continue to add headcount at greater than historic rates. But currently, we're guiding to a somewhat lower increase in headcount in Q4 relative to Q3 based on what we think will be a little bit of slowdown in people joining the company in the month of December."

At the same time, like things changing from the point of view, how you were thinking about general operation level of distribution, how people were working just 2 years ago. So I'm just reminded exactly about kind of our nativity sometimes. And we've put, during the last couple of years and even starting to do before, a lot of efforts to make sure that we create an environment from digital ecosystem perspective as well to see how we can support the culture better in what we were thinking will be relevant probably not during the 2020, 2021, but later. It's all accelerated like we're always talking about it. 
But at the same time, that's exactly what Jason already mentioned, we don't believe that it's sustainable to grow with the growth which is happening right now for a relatively long period of time. So I think it might be better than what we were expecting a couple of years ago when we were talking about our growth, 20-plus percent organic growth, maybe it will be better in the future, but it's definitely not the rate which we grow in today. Because in this case, we will be kind of 50%, 60%, 70% of people will be new to the company which is very difficult to sustain culture and quality of the delivery.

But I think based on everything that people are seeing from a wage inflation standpoint, from I guess a global inflation standpoint and just the continued strong demand for resources, these are relatively easier conversations than we've had in the past, and I expect that we will see better price increase or rate increase in 2022 than we've seen in previous years."

For Q4, we expect that SG&A will come up a little bit between Q3 and Q4. We'll maintain gross margins kind of in and around the range that we saw in Q3. 
And then I think the other thing I should point out is that our recent acquisitions have somewhat lower levels of profit than our traditional EPAM business.

We expect utilization might come up a little bit in Q4, but not unhappy with the 77.1% that we had in Q3.

So you've got a few clients, one in the asset management space that was probably somewhat unprepared for the new digital kind of operating world. The pandemic sort of encouraged them to make investments and now there's a significant amount of investment around updating their infrastructure and the way they connect with their end clients. And so you've got, I would say, a number of companies who probably got additional religion via the pandemic and you're seeing quite accelerated investment. And then EPAM continues to bring that sort of trusted partner to the table. And so clients who are looking to make certain that their transformation journey is successful oftentimes are working with EPAM because of the track record that Ark has spoken about. So we did see some really strong growth in the 11 through 20. 
But we're also seeing very strong growth in the customers below 20. I would say probably, if you're an existing customer with strong demand, you probably have a little bit more of a say at the table. And so probably they are getting a little bit more of their share of resources than brand-new customers.

And just to sort of round it out, the variable compensation expense shows up throughout the year and then it's generally paid in the form of a variable payout to employees in -- at the end of the Q1 quarter and the beginning of the Q2 quarter."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I think it would make sense to start today from the same reference point we used exactly 12 months ago when we began to see the first positive turning signs after the pandemic hit us earlier in 2020. That reference point was our Investor and Analyst Day, which took place November 2019 in Boston, which was still done in the old-fashion, in-person setting.
On that day, we were reminding about EPAM's history during our post IPO years, and our transformational journey from being a pure software engineering services firm to a much more diverse, digital and product consultancy with a strong engineering offerings.
Beginning in 2013, we set an aspirational goal to become one of the global leaders in product development services space. Three years later, in 2016, we set out another one to become one of the global leaders in product and platform engineering services. We were excited that practically every few years we focused on the way EPAM needs to evolve as an organization with our offerings and the specific elements that were essential to transform the company.
These undertakings enabled us to innovate, remain relevant and stay ahead in ever-changing market during those initial post-IPO times. Each aspirational mission was done at a landing point in a longer journey of transformation and was validated by external views, namely industry analysts within the sector, in our ability to grow significantly faster than the market, which has resulted in doubling the company revenue practically every 3 years.
In result, at our Investor and Analyst Day in 2019, we shared our aspiration for the next 3 years, targeting actually the end of 2021 and softly indicated that we might be able to double the size of EPAM again. We also stated then that to achieve this goal, we will need to continue transforming EPAM into a different company with a strong capability to adapt people, platforms and processes into those that quickly respond to change, build and bring to life the digital platform that connects our people to work seamlessly and enables us to be efficient and effective in all what we do, to extend our leadership across integrated consulting and engineering services, and in result, open opportunities for transformation for everybody anywhere through next-generation delivery, educational, social and innovation products.
In short, we set our sights on becoming the transformation platform for those clients who would like to become adaptive enterprises themselves, which remains indeed our current undertaking today as well.
So last year, on our Q3 earnings call, we were reminding of all that and shared a good level of optimism or self-confidence, if you will, that we would be returning to our traditional 20-plus percent organic growth rate in post-pandemic environment. But we also were almost certain at that point that doubling our 2018 revenue by the end of 2021 would not be a realistic target anymore with everything we experienced in Q2 and Q3 of last year and how we, in general, saw the situation for 2021 back then in November of 2020.
Now as we sit here today, we see how naive our post-pandemic assumptions were just a year ago, especially regarding the post-pandemic term itself. I guess, we all are realizing today that we can drop the post portion of this term for some time in the future.
But on another side, we are now realizing that EPAM is in exciting growth route in its 28-year journey because while looking at the present, we have clear line of sight to a fiscal year, which will be one of the highest-growing revenue years in our post-IPO history, that includes also breaking through to our $4 billion revenue quarter at the end of 2021 and actually still reaching out our aspirational goal of doubling the company for the third time since 2012.
This result is an intersection of many factors that have led us to our current state and the next phase of our journey, a journey that has been as much about transforming EPAM as it has been about helping our clients transform themselves.
It's exactly through this latest ambition, which we shared in Boston, that we are developing ourselves to be one of the best in the areas of innovation and design, consulting, education and social responsibility in addition to driving even higher levels of excellence as one of the strongest engineering companies in our space.
And today, EPAM is a substantially different company than we were just 6, 8 years ago, one that has much more diverse foundation to drive the next levels of value to the clients and our growth in result. So along the way, we have to and will continue to solve for the challenges of scaling for growth, geographical expansions and attracting new types of talent, which brings different experiences and different types of think into EPAM, while complementing our strong technical and engineering teams.
Additionally, at each conference we're identifying capabilities that we needed to strengthen or build in order to transform EPAM to serve the market needs, and to be done in both ways, organically and through acquisitions, which continue to be an important part of our capability extension strategy.
As we turn to the future and set our sights on growing to a $10 billion revenue company, our growth will come from the foundational building blocks we have assembled over the last years, some of which include an integrated consulting and engineering offerings, which brings together business and strategy, technology and experience consulting brought to the market through our EPAM Continuum offerings; high-value cloud services focused on cloud native development, application optimization and enabling the data-driven enterprise, helping our customers modernize grow from inside out; data and AI everywhere, leveraging our strong advances in engineering and data heritage; building the massive data structures and leveraging API technologies to drive fast insights; and enabled with our global talent pool that connected by our digital platforms guided by a next-generation delivery methodologies and supported by educational, social and innovation initiatives.
Lastly, we will continue to focus on expanding our partner ecosystem aligned with our vision and mapped with our vertical and geographical focus developing joint solutions and go into market together.
So pivoting into the current moment, as I mentioned a short time ago, acquisitions will continue to be a prominent part of EPAM capabilities and geographical extension strategy. This year, we have already closed on 5 acquisitions, which are enabling us to expand our current offerings in sales force, cybersecurity, analytics, strategy consulting and our presence in Latin America.
You also may have seen recent regulatory filings about our intentions to acquire Emakina Group. Emakina is globally recognized digital marketing and experience agency, or how they call themselves the user agency, specializing in a range of areas, including commerce and retail, media planning and buying, service design, branding and content production across a number of others, headquartered in Belgium and with more than 1,100 employees and studios across 18 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and North America. This acquisition will enhance EPAM's ability to deliver creative solutions, personalized experience and next-generation digital products, which will increase our new offering to our global clients.
So worth noting that while EPAM is already listed among Ad Age Top 25 Largest Agencies in the World, Emakina will add very new capabilities to our agency working and significantly strengthen EPAM in market positioning across Europe and Middle East.
With that, it seems like it's the right moment now to mention that just a few days ago, Fortune Magazine published their 100 fastest-growing companies list for 2021 and included EPAM in it the fourth time and third consecutive year, ranking us 25th overall and, the #1 in information technology services category. Of note, we are actually is the only IT services company on the list. And in addition, Newsweek included EPAM for the first time in their 2021 America's Most Loved Workplace ranking, placing us as #49 on the list.
So before turning to Jason to provide an update on our third quarter results and our 2021 outlook, while I would like one more time to state the demand for our services continues to be very strong and we see this across all market segments. We also very well understand that this is an overall strong demand environment. And this is precisely why we feel we cannot become overly confident. We need to continuously build on our breadth and continuously invest in our strong engineering culture, while constantly expanding our services into real end-to-end, higher complexity engagements across the globe to bring unquestionable value to the clients.
We understand that everything about our future high growth is hard. But as before, we are not trying to push into new areas because they are challenging, and we are committed to do so in a very thoughtful and sustainable way so as not to compromise on the quality of the delivery that EPAM is known for. And if anything, we are constantly looking for ways to establish true differentiation for not only our customers, but also, as importantly, for EPAMers.
With that, let me turn the call over to Jason."

In the third quarter, EPAM delivered very strong results, reflecting continued significant demand for the company's services across a wide range of industry verticals and geographies. During the quarter, EPAM generated revenues of $988.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 51.6% on a reported basis and 50.7% in constant currency terms, reflecting a positive foreign exchange impact of 90 basis points. A continued robust demand environment, combined with our ability to recruit at record levels while retaining talent, drove a higher-than-expected revenue result for the quarter.
Customers continue to turn to EPAM for help transforming their businesses, and we continue to support our customers across a range of initiatives, including modernizing and transforming applications across the full range of industries we serve, creating new digital products and businesses and harnessing the resulting data to improve revenue growth, supply chain operations and end customer experiences. And finally, merging physical and digital to create superior retail experiences. 
Turning to the performance of our industry verticals. Travel & consumer grew 79.3% driven by very strong growth from both our consumer and retail clients. In addition, we saw renewed demand and return to growth across our travel customers.
Financial services grew 68.9% with very strong broad-based growth coming from asset management, insurance, payments and banking.
Software & hi-tech grew 46.6% in the quarter. Life sciences & healthcare grew 29.5%. Business information & media delivered 23.6% growth in the quarter. And finally, our emerging verticals delivered 61.5% growth, driven by clients in telecommunications, energy, manufacturing and automotive.
From a geographic perspective, North America, our largest region representing 60% of Q3 revenues, grew 51.6% year-over-year or 51.4% in constant currency. Europe, representing 33% of our Q3 revenues, grew 50.9% year-over-year or 49.5% in constant currency. CIS, representing 4% of our Q3 revenues, grew 49.7% year-over-year and 44.6% in constant currency. And finally, APAC grew 60.4% year-over-year or 58% in constant currency terms and now represents 3% of our revenues.
In Q3, revenues from our top 20 customers grew 29%, while revenues from clients outside our top 20 grew 69%, resulting in greater diversification across our revenue base.
Moving down to income statement. Our GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 33.9% compared to 35.1% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 35.1% compared to 36.8% for the same quarter last year. Gross margin in Q3 2021 was impacted by higher levels of funding for our variable compensation programs, given the company's outperformance versus targets established at the beginning of the 2021 fiscal year. GAAP SG&A was 17.1% of revenue compared to 17.9% in Q3 of last year. And non-GAAP SG&A came in at 15.3% of revenue compared to 15.9% in the same period last year.
GAAP income from operations was $144.1 million or 14.6% of revenue in the quarter compared to $96.4 million or 14.8% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP income from operations was $179.6 million or 18.2% of revenue in the quarter compared to $123.3 million or 18.9% of revenue in Q3 of last year.
Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 14.6% versus our Q3 guide of 13% due to a lower-than-expected level of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and a onetime benefit related to certain tax credits. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits and includes the onetime benefit of the tax credit, was 21%.
Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.95. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.42, reflecting a $0.77 increase or 46.7% growth over the same quarter in 2020. In Q3, there were approximately 59.2 million diluted shares outstanding.
Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations for Q3 was $206.1 million compared to $175.6 million in the same quarter of 2020. Free cash flow of $184.9 million produced a 129% conversion of adjusted net income compared to free cash flow of $165.8 million in the same quarter last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which does not include the restricted cash related to the acquisition of Emakina Group.
Additionally, in October, we updated and expanded our unsecured credit facility, which will allow for up to $700 million in funding plus an additional $300 million via accordion, giving us access to a total of $1 billion in borrowing capacity. This new credit facility replaces a 2017 facility, which allowed for borrowing up to $300 million with an additional $100 million via accordion.
At the end of Q3, DSO was 70 days and compares to 70 days for both Q2 2021 and the same quarter last year. We expect to maintain DSO around the same level or somewhat lower in Q4.
Moving on to a few operational metrics. We ended the quarter with more than 47,050 consultants, designers and engineers, a year-over-year increase of 39.4%. Our total head count for Q3 was more than 52,650 employees. In the first 3 quarters of 2021, we had approximately 11,500 net additions, a record number for EPAM over a 9-month period. Utilization was 77.1% compared to 78.2% in Q3 of last year and 80.2% in Q2 2021.
Now let's turn to guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, combined with a robust demand environment and continued confidence in our ability to scale production headcount, we are raising our business outlook for 2021. So starting with our full year outlook, revenue growth will now be at least 40% on a reported basis, and in constant currency terms, it will now be at least 38%, after factoring in an approximate 2% favorable foreign exchange impact.
On an organic constant currency basis, revenue growth will be at least 34% after excluding an approximate 400 basis points of revenue contribution from acquisitions we closed in the last 12 months, including Emakina. This compares to the previous full year revenue growth outlook of 37% reported, 35% constant currency and 32% in organic constant currency terms, which we provided during our Q2 earnings call. 
We expect GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to continue to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to continue to be approximately 11%, which includes the benefit of certain tax credits I mentioned previously. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, will now be 22%.
For earnings per share, we expect the GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $7.86 to $7.93 for the full year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS will now be in the range of $8.72 to $8.79 for the full year. We expect weighted average share count of 59.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
For Q4 of 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.075 billion to $1.085 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 49% at the midpoint of the range, with the favorable impact of foreign exchange on revenue growth expected to be minimal. Lastly, we expect approximately 800 basis points of revenue contribution to come from acquisitions closed over the last 12 months, including Emakina.
For the fourth quarter, we expect GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5% and non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We expect our GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 14% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate, which excludes excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, to be approximately 22%. For earnings per share, we expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.11 to $2.18 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.44 to $2.51 for the quarter. We expect a weighted average share count of 59.3 million diluted shares outstanding.
Finally, a few key assumptions that support our GAAP to non-GAAP measurements in the fourth quarter. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $31.4 million. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $5.6 million. The impact of foreign exchange is expected to be approximately a $1.5 million loss. Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be around $8 million. And finally, we expect excess tax benefits to be around $13 million in the quarter.
In summary, we are pleased with our Q3 results and the record growth we are producing in our 2021 fiscal year. While it is too early to give a detailed view of our business outlook for 2022, we believe the demand environment continues to support an elevated annual growth rate in excess of our traditional guidance of greater than 20%. However, we also believe it is important to establish and maintain a more sustainable growth rate in the coming year than that achieved in 2021.  As we have done in the past, we'll provide a detailed view of 2022 guidance in February on our Q4 earnings call.

It's all accelerated like we're always talking about it.
But at the same time, that's exactly what Jason already mentioned, we don't believe that it's sustainable to grow with the growth which is happening right now for a relatively long period of time. So I think it might be better than what we were expecting a couple of years ago when we were talking about our growth, 20-plus percent organic growth, maybe it will be better in the future, but it's definitely not the rate which we grow in today, because in this case, we will be kind of 50%, 60%, 70% of people will be new to the company, which is very difficult to sustain culture and quality of the delivery.

And then I think the other thing I should point out is that our recent acquisitions have somewhat lower levels of profit than our traditional EPAM business.

And maybe some of that, it speaks to sort of the trends we're seeing in the market. So you've got a few clients, one in the asset management space that was probably somewhat unprepared for the new digital kind of operating world. The pandemic sort of encouraged them to make investments and now there's a significant amount of investment around updating their infrastructure and the way they connect with their end clients.
And so you've got, I would say, a number of companies who probably got additional religion via the pandemic and you're seeing quite accelerated investment. And then EPAM continues to bring that sort of trusted partner to the table. And so clients who are looking to make certain that their transformation journey is successful oftentimes are working with EPAM because of the track record that Ark has spoken about. So we did see some really strong growth in the 11 through 20. 
But we're also seeing very strong growth in the customers below 20. I would say probably, if you're an existing customer with strong demand, you probably have a little bit more of a say at the table. And so probably they are getting a little bit more of their share of resources than brand-new customers. And again, we continue to be constrained by supply and are expecting that we'll continue to have very, very solid net additions in Q4 but at a somewhat lower level than in Q3, okay?

I just want to go back to a comment Ark made in your prepared remarks, you're talking about kind of pushing into new areas and capabilities. So a couple of questions around this. What are you doing in terms of figuring out which areas to invest in? Just given the breadth of tech innovation kind of across the space, which areas -- how are you deciding which areas to really kind of focus on and build capabilities in before there's commercial revenue opportunity?
And the second question is, how are you deciding what areas to kind of deemphasize? Are there certain areas where you're -- you don't see much growth? How are you deciding what areas to say like we're going to focus less on these areas."

I just would like to remind, like I'm not going to go to specific topics. But we do believe that one of the advantages which we have is that around probably 30%, 40% of our business is still working with software companies and technology companies and platform companies. 
And we're doing significant -- kind of sometimes significant portion of development of new products and platform for this type of clients which is giving us like very different exposure to what's happening in different areas. Like sometimes we do a new product or new concept like much earlier than it's going to the market. But then we are forced to help this type of clients to do implementation of this. So we have kind of organic internal barometer, if you will, to help us to select some areas and we build this capability sometimes in a very organic way. 
And as we design, we're trying to keep this proportion of such clients in our business portfolio to be able to continuously do this. This is from a technology standpoint.  And then from end-to-end solution standpoint, we definitely, with everything what we were sharing about consultants, we're going up and up in the chain and expanding business perspective of what we're building and how we can help clients.
And first consulting was for API technologies, and we added experience components, and we're talking about business now, we're talking about strategy, Emakina part of this, but we also did a couple more acquisitions in this area. And this is when we're talking about new areas. It's not only about new technology, it's also about the whole end-to-end story."

So as we talked about earlier in this call that we do continue to see elevated wage inflation. We are getting somewhat better increases in rates, okay, but probably not fully able to offset wage inflation. However, the one important point is that this year, we've had outperformed, I think you've seen, as we've taken up our guidance, I think, every quarter. And so we have a variable compensation element that is the expense is looked based on the strength of the company's performance and revenue growth and profitability, so you are booking the expense associated with variable compensation at a much, much higher level this year than we have in past years. So next year, you think that, that -- I would think that would normalize. And so that will have a positive impact on gross margin. And then you may continue to have some pressure with wage inflation. And hopefully, those 2 kind of offset each other.
And just to sort of round it out, the variable compensation expense shows up throughout the year and then it's generally paid in the form of a variable payout to employees in -- at the end of the Q1 quarter and the beginning of the Q2 quarter."
