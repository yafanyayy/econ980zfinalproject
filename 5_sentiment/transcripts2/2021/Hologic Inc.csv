We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We are off to a very strong start to the year across all our businesses and major geographies. Once again, our Diagnostics",2049,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We are off to a very strong start to the year across all our businesses and major geographies. Once again, our Diagnostics division delivered incredible performance by making a massive impact against COVID-19. And our Breast Health and Surgical businesses continue to strengthen, with each returning to growth in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. So our performance was strong and broad-based across both divisions and geographies. As a result, our financial results were exceptional in the first quarter. Let's provide a quick overview. 
Total revenue was $1.61 billion with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.86. Organic revenue more than doubled, up 104% while EPS increased more than fourfold as higher production volumes and diagnostics enabled us to leverage our fixed cost base. Both revenue and EPS came in well ahead of our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. 
With that introduction, I'd like to cover 3 main topics in my remarks today, which will echo some of the themes from our presentation at the JPMorgan conference earlier this month. First, how our purpose-driven culture is contributing to, and we believe, driving our excellent financial results. Second, how we're making a huge difference in the fight against COVID-19. And third, why we'll be a stronger company on the other side of the pandemic. 
To begin, many of you will recall that Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, wrote in early 2018 that companies, both public and private, should serve a social purpose. 3 years later, we would argue that Hologic is the epitome of such a company. We are an incredibly purpose-driven, highly engaged team that is waking up every day wanting to make a positive difference in the world. And we believe this culture is contributing to differentiated financial performance, both in terms of our COVID response and the faster than expected return to growth in our Breast Health and Surgical divisions. Our employees understand that the bigger our collective impact on the world, the more they and our shareholders benefit. 
What makes us tick is our strong purpose of enabling healthier lives everywhere, every day. Within this, we have a special passion, to champion women's health. But we don't just help women. If, for example, you're 1 one the tens of millions of people who have had a Hologic COVID test in the last year, you can rest assured that you're getting a high-quality, highly accurate result. That's the promise we make to our customers, which we call the science of sure. 
Our purpose, passion and promise have shown up in countless ways since the pandemic began. Some are visible externally, like extraordinarily rapid EUAs or massive increases in production capacity. But many are behind the scenes from how we rewarded our frontline employees for their heroic efforts during the pandemic, to how our Board and management team found safe ways to meet in person, to how we always try to under-promise and over-deliver on the COVID test commitments we made to customers and governments around the world. 
We talk about many of these topics in our second annual sustainability report titled, The Power of Purpose, which we just published on our website last week. I'd encourage all our investors, but especially those interested in ESG issues, to take a look. 
Now let us give you an update on our COVID testing efforts. As you can probably tell from our financial results, we continue to make good progress on our plans to expand manufacturing capacity for our 2 COVID assays out of our plants in San Diego and Manchester U.K. Total output increased sequentially compared to the September quarter, which enabled us to provide about 30 million COVID assays to customers, generating revenue of about $745 million. As we have said, we are now selling more COVID tests each quarter than we had ever produced of all of our molecular tests before the pandemic. And we are on track to meet our goal to produce at least $75 million total molecular diagnostic tests a quarter globally by January of 2022. This would represent more than 3.5x our total capacity pre COVID, a tremendous accomplishment, thanks to our employees, our suppliers and the U.S. government, which is providing financial support. 
In the first quarter, about 1/3 of our COVID test revenue came outside the United States, mainly from Europe. COVID testing continues to strengthen our international business, our relationships with customers, our future prospects in diagnostics and even market access for our other franchises. These COVID sales contributed to total international revenue of $472 million in the quarter, which represented tremendous growth of 145% on an organic basis. 
At the same time, we are also encouraged that demand for new Panther instruments remains very strong. You might recall that last fiscal year, we placed more than 500 new Panther systems worldwide, more than double our usual run rate. And we are off to an excellent start in fiscal '21 with another 150 shipments in the first quarter alone. We still have a long waiting list for instruments, which we believe reflects the longevity of COVID testing that our customers anticipate. Overall, our global installed base now stands at roughly 2,400 instruments, giving us a robust platform for future growth as more customers come to appreciate our systems' best-in-class capabilities. 
Now let us shift gears to our third major topic, why we believe our business will be much stronger on the other side of the pandemic. First, it's never been more clear to us that demand for highly accurate molecular COVID testing will remain robust for a while, while we may have become a little numb to infection rates that remain staggeringly high in the United States and globally. But as a reminder, the almost 2 million molecular tests that are being performed daily in the United States today would annualize to a market that's about 17x bigger than the single largest molecular market before COVID. So while demand will inevitably decline as vaccines roll out, nucleic acid testing is likely to have a long, meaningful tail that extends into fiscal '22 and beyond. With COVID likely remaining our biggest molecular product, for years to come. 
As we have seen, it will take time to manufacture and administer vaccines broadly, and many people will choose not to be vaccinated. The societal need for and focus on COVID testing far exceeds anything we have ever seen before. And the pandemic's emotional toll will last much longer, driving future demand. 
As public concern around COVID persists, the combination of our huge Panther installed base at facilities close to the patient and our gold standard assay performance have us uniquely positioned to pursue many use cases that will be around for the long term. These include testing before hospital admissions, asymptomatic screening for various purposes and even confirmatory testing of other less accurate modalities. Studies have shown that these other tests can miss 2/3 of asymptomatic cases, and these false negative results can contribute to super spreader events. Even as the market matures and our production capacity increases, we believe our combination of robust chemistry, innovative engineering on Panther and differentiated labeling from FDA will help us gain market share. 
Moving on, the second reason Hologic will be stronger in the future is the significant non-COVID business we are gaining on our rapidly growing installed base of Panther instruments. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that in the United States, Europe and Asia, every single Panther that our commercial teams have placed has been with an eye toward the future. They are doing a fantastic job of extending and broadening commercial contracts, winning key strategic accounts and fueling our Razor/Razorblade business model. 
As an indicator of this, last quarter, we discussed tests of record, or TORs, which represent contracted year 1 revenue from new assay customers. We said that we had achieved a new record in TORs in fiscal 2020 with non-COVID business totaling $35 million in the United States, about 50% more than we had ever done before. This positive trend is actually accelerated in early 2021, with more than $20 million of additional TORs in the first quarter alone. 
That's one reason that momentum in our Molecular business, which was already good before COVID, is improving further today, especially in Europe. For example, when we removed COVID assay sales from our Molecular number as well as instruments and ancillaries, core assay sales grew roughly 10% globally in the first quarter, more than double the rate 1 quarter ago. 
The third reason we believe we will be stronger post COVID is that thanks to the tremendous success of our Diagnostics business, we have been able to use the last several quarters to further bolster our Breast and Surgical franchises for the future. In Breast, we have continued to expand on our strategy to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. Rather than just placing capital equipment, we are now selling a full portfolio of hardware and software upgrades, interventional tools and service. While the world has been understandably focused on COVID, we have increased our direct presence with breast health customers and developed and launched products such as Brevera, which is off to a very good start in its relaunch. And most recently, we acquired for $64 million, the German company, SOMATEX, a long-time partner of ours, to strengthen our portfolio of breast cancer markers, enhance our commercial presence in Europe and improve our profitability. 
In Surgical, both our R&D and business development pipelines have been productive, broadening the portfolio of products that we sell through a high-performing, highly engaged sales force. New products such as our fluent fluid management system and new hysteroscopes are complementing our market-leading MyoSure and NovaSure devices. And helped that division return to growth in the first quarter, well ahead of schedule. 
On the business development front. In August, we spent approximately $80 million plus future contingent earnouts to buy Acessa Health. Acessa's Proview is a laparoscopic RF product that is used to treat fibroids that MyoSure can't reach so it's very complementary to our Surgical business and a nice fit for our sales force. And so far, early feedback from our customers has been good. 
The acquisition of Acessa and SOMATEX demonstrate the final reason we will be stronger after the pandemic. The ability to use the healthy cash flow that COVID tests are generating to step up our business development activities. The pending $230 million acquisition of Biotheranostics, which we announced earlier this month, is another good example of this strategy. Biotheranostics, a leader in molecular tests for breast and metastatic cancers, enables us to expand into the adjacent growth market of oncology. More specifically, Biotheranostics has done a great job of developing a strong clinical and reimbursement foundation for their flagship breast cancer index test, which plays an important role in a large but underpenetrated breast cancer market that we know a lot about. In addition, Biotheranostics provides us clinical lab capabilities that we can use to develop markets for novel content down the road. From a financial perspective, Biotheranostics brings more than $30 million of annual revenue, growth rates in excess of 20% and strong gross margins. 
We're excited that since we announced the deal, Biotheranostics has received some very good news that will benefit women with early-stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, included the breast cancer index test in its guidelines to predict the benefit of extended treatment with various endocrine therapies. This should help establish the test as the standard of care for this important clinical question and contribute to increased patient access. 
Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that we are off to an excellent start in fiscal 2021. Our purpose-driven culture is driving excellent execution and performance, both in terms of our COVID tests and the recovery of our other businesses. And we are working hard to ensure that the financial success we are experiencing now will translate into a stronger company down the road. We are confident it will. Now we'll turn the call over to Karleen."
108544,700611246,2182833,"Hologic, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for t",1491,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the second quarter fiscal '21. 
As Steve said, we are very pleased with our first quarter results as revenue and EPS significantly exceeded our guidance. Reported revenue of $1.61 billion increased 87%. Organically, revenue grew 104%, driven by strong COVID sales and the continued improvement of our base business across all major geographies. Given the incredible demand for our COVID test and the strong results in our base business, we were able to significantly improve profit, margins and cash flow. As a result, EPS of $2.86 in the first quarter increased 369%, well ahead of our expectations. Further, operating cash flow has continued to be extremely strong, which I'll discuss in a minute. 
Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, our largest division, global revenue of $1.128 billion grew 256% in the first quarter, driven by Molecular, where sales increased 449%. In response to the unprecedented demand for COVID testing, we shipped about 30 million COVID test to customers, generating revenue of $745 million globally. And excluding COVID, our base molecular business accelerated sequentially as customers continue to see the benefit of our assay menu and the strength of Panther's high throughput automation. 
Rounding out Diagnostics, the cytology and perinatal businesses grew by 1% in the quarter, driven in part by a catch-up in cytology procedures at calendar year-end. 
In Breast Health, global revenue of $332.7 million was down slightly overall. However, performance improved compared to the fourth quarter and the business returned to slight growth in all geographies except for Latin America. The division's performance was driven by the interventional businesses, which grew 15% in the quarter and was helped by the relaunch of our Brevera biopsy system. 
Although we are encouraged by sequential improvement in the capital environment and by healthy equipment sales at calendar year-end, overall spending remains challenged because of COVID. However, our intentional diversification to service and consumables as well as several recent acquisitions have helped mitigate pressure on capital. As an example, Breast Health service revenue, which is larger than capital sales, grew by mid-single digits in the quarter. 
In Surgical, sales of $124 million grew 3.3%, a great result given headwinds on elective procedures from recently increasing COVID cases in some parts of the country. This result shows the strength and commitment of our surgical sales force as well as the benefit of several new products. 
Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $1.14 billion increased 80% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 91%. Outside the United States, sales of $472 million increased 106% in constant currency. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 145%, a stellar result that reflects our growing international strength. 
Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the first quarter. Gross margins of 77.2% increased 1,560 basis points, driven by sales of high-margin COVID tests and the divestiture of the low-margin Cynosure business. Total operating expenses of $274.5 million decreased 5.1% in the first quarter. However, expenses actually increased when normalized for the Cynosure sale and about $6.5 million of credits from BARDA associated with the development of our COVID assays. These increases were driven by investments in R&D and marketing for future growth. In addition, expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan increased as a result of equity market gains. As a reminder, while this liability is mark-to-market, most of the expense is offset by a benefit we realized in other income in the quarter. 
In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.75%, slightly lower than previously forecasted driven by a favorable geographic mix of income, primarily from sales of COVID-19 assays outside the United States. Putting all this together, operating margins increased 3,270 basis points to 60.2%, and net margins increased 2,730 basis points to 46.6%. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $749.6 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.86, well ahead of expectations. 
Before we cover our 2021 second quarter guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests, cash flow from operations was $650 million in the first quarter. A very strong result. In fact, this was about the same as our total cash flow from operations for all of fiscal 2019. Looked at another way, in just the last 2 quarters, we have generated about $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, which gives us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, we repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares of stock for $101 million in the first quarter. And our Board recently approved a new $1 billion authorization, highlighting our commitment to capital deployment. And we were also able to strengthen our balance sheet by repaying our outstanding revolver balance of $250 million. As a reminder, we had borrowed against the revolver as a precautionary measure very early in the pandemic. 
Overall, we had $869 million of cash at the end of the first quarter. And with more than $1 billion of EBITDA for the quarter, our leverage ratio fell to 0.8x. While we remain comfortable with leverage ratio between 2 and 3 over the longer term, we also have no problem with a lower ratio in the short term. As you know, we are actively pursuing a number of division-led tuck-in acquisitions and hope to use our cash to complete more deals this year in addition to buying back our stock. Finally, ROIC was 26.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 1,440 basis points. 
Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal '21. We anticipate that fiscal '21 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall. But our business environment remains fluid due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic. Therefore, we are only providing a single quarter of guidance today. Let me also point out that our guidance does not include the impact of the pending Biotheranostics acquisition, which has not yet closed. 
In the second quarter of fiscal '21, we expect excellent financial results again, with total revenue in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.56 billion. This represents an approximate doubling of organic revenue growth to roughly 96% to 104%. Underlying this, we expect similar sales of our COVID test to drive exceptional diagnostics growth. As a reminder, most of our new molecular production capacity is expected to come online in the second half of our fiscal year. 
Blood Screening revenue, which we backed out of our organic calculations, expected to be about $10 million in the quarter. 
In our other businesses, let me remind you that our March quarter sales are typically down sequentially compared to the December period for our Breast, Surgical and base Diagnostics businesses as capital sales in semi-elective procedures tend to be seasonally stronger at the end of the calendar year. In addition, our guidance incorporates headwinds related to customer spending constraints and restrictions on procedure volumes given rising COVID cases. While our customers are much better prepared than they were last spring to manage through local increases in COVID prevalence, we have seen a recent slowdown in some elective surgeries. 
On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $2.56 to $2.68 in the second quarter, with extraordinary growth rate that significantly outpaced revenue even as we increase investments for future growth. To put this in perspective, we expect to earn more in the second quarter alone than we did in the full year of 2019. The second quarter guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.75% and diluted shares outstanding of $262 million to $263 million for the quarter. I'd also like to point out that we expect other expenses net to increase to close to $25 million in the second quarter as we don't forecast gains or losses related to certain hedging activities like we saw in the first quarter. 
As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty has increased in recent weeks due to the pandemic. While our visibility has improved compared to several months ago, we would still encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides. 
Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic's financial performance in the first quarter was terrific. We continue to make a huge impact fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and on women's health globally. Further, I am confident that we have positioned ourselves to deliver exceptional long-term performance. With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions.

I think we've probably put it in a couple of different perspectives. First and foremost, I would say, is as -- while we're obviously generating a ton of cash right now, we also have the luxury of being in an enormous position of strength in that our base businesses are performing. And I think the best way that you can be very disciplined on deals is when it's easy to walk away from anything because you don't need anything. And you feel good about your underlying business. So then if we look at the market specifically, it's been fascinating to watch over the last 8 months, right? First, everybody hunkered down back March, April, May, including ourselves. We had pushed things like the Acessa deal. We'd even pushed out a few months, and we'd had a relationship with Biotheranostics and kind of just wanted to see where our own cash flow was at that point in time. So now, obviously, there's a lot of companies that are fairly flushed with cash. They're it's -- there's also a fairly healthy IPO market right now. So there's a bit of froth out there, I think, and we want to be disciplined. So I would tell you as excited as the deals we've done, I'm probably more proud of some deals we've gone pretty deep on over the last 3, 4 months that we walked away from, really over valuation or other issues in diligence. And that's, I think, the maturing of our team here and the fundamental strength. So I think we're in a position where if we can get the right assets at the right price with good ROICs, hey, that's great. And if we need to wait some things out or even miss some things, we're not going to get caught into bidding wars and overpay. So I do think it's it's a pretty vibrant market right now. We've had every banker beating our door down trying to sell these things as you can imagine, but staying very disciplined."

And I think, again, what's been happening in the short term, because there wasn't enough molecular tests in the beginning and the long turnaround times. There's a big emphasis on a lot of the rapid tests, particularly some of the antigen stuff, and they're going to have a place. But at the end of the day, they're not indicated, most of them, for asymptomatic screening. And we keep learning more and more by the day, how much of this is asymptomatically being passed along. And when you look at a lot of these super spreader events, they are, quite frankly, being caused by using the wrong tests off-label to try to determine whether people have something. And I think over time, what we always say to our team is the cream rises to the top. So you have Panther, and it's where it's located. You have an assay that's got incredible sensitivity, specificity and one of the best labels. We also have the pooling indication. And once you get back into screening, call it next fall, right, think about simple things. We want to get everybody back-to-school in the fall. The vaccines still aren't indicated for people under 16. So as we keep talking about vaccinating the country, children are going to be excluded from that. We're going to want to be doing asymptomatic screening. And a lot of the antigen test that people may say are great right now, they're not going to be as effective at picking up particularly asymptomatic indications. So we have that. And then you just have the pure workflow advantage that should never be forgotten, and that is the workflow of Panther, the random access, automation, ability to just make this as easy. The lab techs around the world have been running a marathon at sprint speed. They're exhausted. You can't walk into any lab and not hear from the lab director that their techs are just tired. And they would much rather be able to be using Panther. And one of the fundamental realities is we've been shipping so much but not all of it has been with our full pen caps, and that's part of the capacity we've been building up. And as we're able to provide more and more of our pen caps, it creates the full automation benefit that not everybody has even been fully getting yet. So we have no idea truly exactly how this is going to play out. But all the discussions we've been having with the Biden transition team has been continued about, hey, are you still building up more capacity? And we certainly are. We'll see how it all plays out. But I think like every market we compete in, we think we're going to be there standing."

The fact that Surgical and Breast Health both ended up growing, which we wouldn't have expected. Whether they grow or stay flattish, we're probably talking little pieces here. We're seeing little pockets, right, in certain geographies. Suddenly, we have a couple of slower days in the Surgical business or in the Breast Health consumable business. So it's -- I'd call it, it's little temporary outages. But fundamentally, it's going to be tiny for us given that we've got the COVID offset. And I think we just continue to focus on share, and it'll take care of itself here over time. But maybe slightly more muted this quarter on a couple of those businesses, but still overall good."

Let me let me take a crack at that. I think on your first point, we -- what we said a few quarters ago is in the early days, we placed a significant portion of our Panthers into some of our largest customers where they were going to replace Tigrises over time and provide access to a broader menu. There's 4 tests approved on Tigris, I think now 18 on Panther, if you include the 2 COVID test. We haven't given an update on that since then. So I don't have an update for -- a specific number for you today. I would tell you that, by and large, we are focusing on our existing customers, obviously, and broadening out relationships with those customers. If you think about where our Panthers sit overall, most of them sit in hospital labs. And I think this gets back to one of the comments that Steve was making earlier about how getting testing closer to the patient is going to help us from a share perspective going forward for pre-op procedures, things like that. And then the second part of your question, Chris? On TORs was what percentage of new Panthers. Is that? Yes. I don't know that number either. But I think as Steve said in his prepared remarks, that's what the sales force is focused on, right? And we've talked a bit in the past about how we're extra incentivizing our sales force to bring in new non-COVID business, and they've done a great job of that. So I think, as Steve said in the prepared remarks, I mean, basically, every Panther that we place is being placed with an eye toward the future. And that run rate of TORs, I mean we did 35 million last year. We talked about this. That was 50% more than we've ever done before. Pretty excited about that. And now in the first quarter, we do another 20 million. So I don't know that, that will continue with that pace, but certainly, had a good run rate here out of the shoe."

We've got follow-ups from the SSI acquisition on ultrasound. Brevera is really in the process of rolling out. So we've got a lot of additional software and smaller things there.

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and CEO; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we'll have a question-and-answer session today.
Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through February 26.
Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.
Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, and we define organic revenue as constant currency revenue, excluding the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses as well as the acquired Acessa business. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO."

We are off to a very strong start to the year across all our businesses and major geographies. Once again, our Diagnostics",2047,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone.
We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We are off to a very strong start to the year across all our businesses and major geographies. Once again, our Diagnostics division delivered incredible performance by making a massive impact against COVID-19. And our Breast Health and Surgical businesses continue to strengthen, with each returning to growth in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. So our performance was strong and broad-based across both divisions and geographies. As a result, our financial results were exceptional in the first quarter. Let's provide a quick overview.
Total revenue was $1.61 billion, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.86. Organic revenue more than doubled, up 104%, while EPS increased more than fourfold as higher production volumes in Diagnostics enabled us to leverage our fixed cost base. Both revenue and EPS came in well ahead of our expectations at the beginning of the quarter.
With that introduction, I'd like to cover 3 main topics in my remarks today, which will echo some of the themes from our presentation at the JPMorgan conference earlier this month. First, how our purpose-driven culture is contributing to, and we believe driving, our excellent financial results. Second, how we're making a huge difference in the fight against COVID-19. And third, why we'll be a stronger company on the other side of the pandemic.
To begin, many of you will recall that Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, wrote in early 2018 that companies, both public and private, should serve a social purpose. Three years later, we would argue that Hologic is the epitome of such a company. We are an incredibly purpose-driven, highly engaged team that is waking up every day wanting to make a positive difference in the world. And we believe this culture is contributing to differentiated financial performance, both in terms of our COVID response and the faster than expected return to growth in our Breast Health and Surgical divisions. Our employees understand that the bigger our collective impact on the world, the more they and our shareholders benefit.
What makes us tick is our strong purpose of enabling healthier lives everywhere, every day. Within this, we have a special passion, to champion women's health. But we don't just help women. If, for example, you're one of the tens of millions of people who have had a Hologic COVID test in the last year, you can rest assured that you're getting a high-quality, highly accurate result. That's the promise we make to our customers, which we call The Science of Sure.
Our purpose, passion and promise have shown up in countless ways since the pandemic began. Some are visible externally, like extraordinarily rapid EUAs or massive increases in production capacity. But many are behind the scenes, from how we rewarded our frontline employees for their heroic efforts during the pandemic, to how our Board and management team found safe ways to meet in person, to how we always try to under-promise and over-deliver on the COVID test commitments we made to customers and governments around the world.
We talk about many of these topics in our second annual sustainability report, titled the Power of Purpose, which we just published on our website last week. I'd encourage all our investors, but especially those interested in ESG issues, to take a look.
Now let us give you an update on our COVID testing efforts. As you can probably tell from our financial results, we continue to make good progress on our plans to expand manufacturing capacity for our 2 COVID assays out of our plants in San Diego and Manchester, U.K. Total output increased sequentially compared to the September quarter, which enabled us to provide about 30 million COVID assays to customers, generating revenue of about $745 million. As we have said, we are now selling more COVID tests each quarter than we had ever produced of all of our molecular tests before the pandemic. And we are on track to meet our goal to produce at least 75 million total molecular diagnostic tests a quarter globally by January of 2022. This would represent more than 3.5x our total capacity pre-COVID, a tremendous accomplishment thanks to our employees, our suppliers and the U.S. government, which is providing financial support.
In the first quarter, about 1/3 of our COVID test revenue came outside the United States, mainly from Europe. COVID testing continues to strengthen our international business, our relationships with customers, our future prospects in Diagnostics and even market access for our other franchises. These COVID sales contributed to total international revenue of $472 million in the quarter, which represented tremendous growth of 145% on an organic basis.
At the same time, we are also encouraged that demand for new Panther instruments remains very strong. You might recall that last fiscal year, we placed more than 500 new Panther systems worldwide, more than double our usual run rate. And we are off to an excellent start in fiscal '21 with another 150 shipments in the first quarter alone. We still have a long waiting list for instruments, which we believe reflects the longevity of COVID testing that our customers anticipate. Overall, our global installed base now stands at roughly 2,400 instruments, giving us a robust platform for future growth as more customers come to appreciate our system's best-in-class capabilities.
Now let us shift gears to our third major topic, why we believe our business will be much stronger on the other side of the pandemic. First, it's never been more clear to us that demand for highly accurate molecular COVID testing will remain robust for a while. We may have become a little numb to infection rates that remain staggeringly high in the United States and globally. But as a reminder, the almost 2 million molecular tests that are being performed daily in the United States today would annualize to a market that's about 17x bigger than the single largest molecular market before COVID.
So while demand will inevitably decline as vaccines roll out, nucleic acid testing is likely to have a long, meaningful tail that extends into fiscal '22 and beyond, with COVID likely remaining our biggest molecular product for years to come. As we have seen, it will take time to manufacture and administer vaccines broadly, and many people will choose not to be vaccinated. The societal need for and focus on COVID testing far exceeds anything we have ever seen before. And the pandemic's emotional toll will last much longer, driving future demand.
As public concern around COVID persists, the combination of our huge Panther installed base at facilities close to the patient and our gold standard assay performance have us uniquely positioned to pursue many use cases that will be around for the long term. These include testing before hospital admissions, asymptomatic screening for various purposes and even confirmatory testing of other less accurate modalities. Studies have shown that these other tests can miss 2/3 of asymptomatic cases, and these false negative results can contribute to super-spreader events. Even as the market matures and our production capacity increases, we believe our combination of robust chemistry, innovative engineering on Panther and differentiated labeling from FDA will help us gain market share.
Moving on, the second reason Hologic will be stronger in the future is the significant non-COVID business we are gaining on our rapidly growing installed base of Panther instruments. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that in the United States, Europe and Asia, every single Panther that our commercial teams have placed has been with an eye toward the future. They are doing a fantastic job of extending and broadening commercial contracts, winning key strategic accounts and fueling our razor/razor blade business model.
As an indicator of this, last quarter, we discussed tests of record, or TORs, which represent contracted year 1 revenue from new assay customers. We said that we had achieved a new record in TORs in fiscal 2020 with non-COVID business totaling $35 million in the United States, about 50% more than we had ever done before. This positive trend has actually accelerated in early 2021, with more than $20 million of additional TORs in the first quarter alone.
That's one reason that momentum in our molecular business, which was already good before COVID, is improving further today, especially in Europe. For example, when we remove COVID assay sales from our molecular number as well as instruments and ancillaries, core assay sales grew roughly 10% globally in the first quarter, more than double the rate a quarter ago.
The third reason we believe we will be stronger post-COVID is that thanks to the tremendous success of our Diagnostics business, we have been able to use the last several quarters to further bolster our Breast and Surgical franchises for the future. In Breast, we have continued to expand on our strategy to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. Rather than just placing capital equipment, we are now selling a full portfolio of hardware and software upgrades, interventional tools and service. While the world has been understandably focused on COVID, we have increased our direct presence with Breast Health customers and developed and launched products such as Brevera, which is off to a very good start in its relaunch. And most recently, we acquired for $64 million the German company Somatex, a long-time partner of ours, to strengthen our portfolio of breast cancer markers, enhance our commercial presence in Europe and improve our profitability.
In Surgical, both our R&D and business development pipelines have been productive, broadening the portfolio of products that we sell through a high performing, highly engaged sales force. New products such as our Fluent fluid management system and new hysteroscopes are complementing our market-leading MyoSure and NovaSure devices, and helped that division return to growth in the first quarter, well ahead of schedule.
On the business development front, in August, we spent approximately $80 million, plus future contingent earnouts, to buy Acessa Health. Acessa's ProVu is a laparoscopic RF product that is used to treat fibroids that MyoSure can't reach, so it's very complementary to our Surgical business and a nice fit for our sales force. And so far, early feedback from our customers has been good.
The acquisitions of Acessa and Somatex demonstrate the final reason we will be stronger after the pandemic, the ability to use the healthy cash flow that COVID tests are generating to step up our business development activities. The pending $230 million acquisition of Biotheranostics, which we announced earlier this month, is another good example of this strategy. Biotheranostics, a leader in molecular tests for breast and metastatic cancers, enables us to expand into the adjacent growth market of oncology. More specifically, Biotheranostics has done a great job of developing a strong clinical and reimbursement foundation for their flagship Breast Cancer Index test, which plays an important role in a large but underpenetrated breast cancer market that we know a lot about. In addition, Biotheranostics provides us clinical lab capabilities that we can use to develop markets for novel content down the road. From a financial perspective, Biotheranostics brings more than $30 million of annual revenue, growth rates in excess of 20% and strong gross margins.
We're excited that since we announced the deal, Biotheranostics has received some very good news that will benefit women with early-stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, included the Breast Cancer Index test in its guidelines to predict the benefit of extended treatment with various endocrine therapies. This should help establish the test as the standard of care for this important clinical question and contribute to increased patient access.
Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that we are off to an excellent start in fiscal 2021. Our purpose-driven culture is driving excellent execution and performance, both in terms of our COVID tests and the recovery of our other businesses. And we are working hard to ensure that the financial success we are experiencing now will translate into a stronger company down the road. We are confident it will.
Now we'll turn the call over to Karleen."

In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for t",1494,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the second quarter fiscal '21.
As Steve said, we are very pleased with our first quarter results as revenue and EPS significantly exceeded our guidance. Reported revenue of $1.61 billion increased 87%. Organically, revenue grew 104%, driven by strong COVID sales and the continued improvement of our base business across all major geographies. Given the incredible demand for our COVID test and the strong results in our base business, we were able to significantly improve profit, margins and cash flow. As a result, EPS of $2.86 in the first quarter increased 369%, well ahead of our expectations. Further, operating cash flow has continued to be extremely strong, which I'll discuss in a minute.
Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, our largest division, global revenue of $1.128 billion grew 256% in the first quarter, driven by molecular, where sales increased 449%. In response to the unprecedented demand for COVID testing, we shipped about 30 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of $745 million globally. And excluding COVID, our base molecular business accelerated sequentially as customers continue to see the benefit of our assay menu and the strength of Panther's high throughput automation. Rounding out Diagnostics, the cytology and perinatal businesses grew by 1% in the quarter, driven in part by a catch-up in cytology procedures at calendar year-end.
In Breast Health, global revenue of $332.7 million was down slightly overall. However, performance improved compared to the fourth quarter and the business returned to slight growth in all geographies except for Latin America. The division's performance was driven by the interventional businesses, which grew 15% in the quarter and was helped by the relaunch of our Brevera biopsy system.
Although we are encouraged by sequential improvement in the capital environment and by healthy equipment sales at calendar year-end, overall spending remains challenged because of COVID. However, our intentional diversification to service and consumables as well as several recent acquisitions have helped mitigate pressure on capital. As an example, Breast Health service revenue, which is larger than capital sales, grew by mid-single digits in the quarter.
In Surgical, sales of $124 million grew 3.3%, a great result given headwinds on elective procedures from recently increasing COVID cases in some parts of the country. This result shows the strength and commitment of our surgical sales force as well as the benefit of several new products.
Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $1.14 billion increased 80% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 91%. Outside the United States, sales of $472 million increased 106% in constant currency. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 145%, a stellar result that reflects our growing international strength.
Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the first quarter. Gross margins of 77.2% increased 1,560 basis points, driven by sales of high-margin COVID tests and the divestiture of the low-margin Cynosure business.
Total operating expenses of $274.5 million decreased 5.1% in the first quarter. However, expenses actually increased when normalized for the Cynosure sale and about $6.5 million of credits from BARDA associated with the development of our COVID assays. These increases were driven by investments in R&D and marketing for future growth. In addition, expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan increased as a result of equity market gains. As a reminder, while this liability is marked to market, most of the expense is offset by a benefit we realized in other income in the quarter.
In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.75%, slightly lower than previously forecasted driven by a favorable geographic mix of income, primarily from sales of COVID-19 assays outside the United States. Putting all this together, operating margins increased 3,270 basis points to 60.2%, and net margins increased 2,730 basis points to 46.6%. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $749.6 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.86, well ahead of expectations.
Before we cover our 2021 second quarter guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests, cash flow from operations was $650 million in the first quarter, a very strong result. In fact, this was about the same as our total cash flow from operations for all of fiscal 2019. Looked at another way, in just the last 2 quarters, we have generated about $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, which gives us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, we repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares of stock for $101 million in the first quarter. And our Board recently approved a new $1 billion authorization, highlighting our commitment to capital deployment. And we were also able to strengthen our balance sheet by repaying our outstanding revolver balance of $250 million. As a reminder, we had borrowed against the revolver as a precautionary measure very early in the pandemic.
Overall, we had $869 million of cash at the end of the first quarter. And with more than $1 billion of EBITDA for the quarter, our leverage ratio fell to 0.8x. While we remain comfortable with leverage ratio between 2 and 3 over the longer term, we also have no problem with a lower ratio in the short term. As you know, we are actively pursuing a number of division-led tuck-in acquisitions and hope to use our cash to complete more deals this year, in addition to buying back our stock. Finally, ROIC was 26.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 1,440 basis points.
Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal '21. We anticipate that fiscal '21 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall. But our business environment remains fluid due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic. Therefore, we are only providing a single quarter of guidance today. Let me also point out that our guidance does not include the impact of the pending Biotheranostics acquisition, which has not yet closed.
In the second quarter of fiscal '21, we expect excellent financial results again, with total revenue in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.56 billion. This represents an approximate doubling of organic revenue growth to roughly 96% to 104%. Underlying this, we expect similar sales of our COVID tests to drive exceptional Diagnostics growth. As a reminder, most of our new molecular production capacity is expected to come online in the second half of our fiscal year. Blood Screening revenue, which we back out of our organic calculations, is expected to be about $10 million in the quarter.
In our other businesses, let me remind you that our March quarter sales are typically down sequentially compared to the December period for our Breast, Surgical and base Diagnostics businesses as capital sales and semi-elective procedures tend to be seasonally stronger at the end of the calendar year. In addition, our guidance incorporates headwinds related to customer spending constraints and restrictions on procedure volumes given rising COVID cases. While our customers are much better prepared than they were last spring to manage through local increases in COVID prevalence, we have seen a recent slowdown in some elective surgeries.
On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $2.56 to $2.68 in the second quarter, with extraordinary growth rates that significantly outpace revenue even as we increase investments for future growth. To put this in perspective, we expect to earn more in the second quarter alone than we did in the full year of 2019. The second quarter guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.75% and diluted shares outstanding of 262 million to 263 million for the quarter. I'd also like to point out that we expect other expenses, net, to increase to close to $25 million in the second quarter as we don't forecast gains or losses related to certain hedging activities like we saw in the first quarter.
As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty has increased in recent weeks due to the pandemic. While our visibility has improved compared to several months ago, we would still encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides.
Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic's financial performance in the first quarter was terrific. We continue to make a huge impact fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and on women's health globally. Further, I am confident that we have positioned ourselves to deliver exceptional long-term performance.
With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for the first question."

As COVID has hit, it's given us incredible access to a lot of the major governments. We've got contracts with just about every major government in Europe.

I think we'd probably put it in a couple of different perspectives. First and foremost, I would say is, while we're obviously generating a ton of cash right now, we also have the luxury of being in an enormous position of strength in that our base businesses are performing. And I think the best way that you can be very disciplined on deals is when it's easy to walk away from anything because you don't need anything and you feel good about your underlying business. So then if we look at the market specifically, it's been fascinating to watch over the last 8 months, right?
First, everybody hunkered down back in March, April and May, including ourselves. We had pushed things like the Acessa deal, we had even pushed out a few months. And we'd had a relationship with Biotheranostics and kind of just wanted to see where our own cash flow was at that point in time. So now, obviously, there's a lot of companies that are fairly flush with cash. There's also a fairly healthy IPO market right now. So there's a bit of froth out there, I think, and we want to be disciplined.
So I would tell you, as excited as the deals we've done, I'm probably more proud of some deals we've gone pretty deep on over the last 3, 4 months that we walked away from, really over valuation or other issues in diligence. And that's, I think, the maturing of our team here and the fundamental strength. So I think we're in a position where if we can get the right assets at the right price with good ROICs, hey, that's great. And if we need to wait some things out or even miss some things, we're not going to get caught into bidding wars and overpay. So I do think it's a pretty vibrant market right now. We've had every banker beating our door down trying to sell us things, as you can imagine, but staying very disciplined."

So I guess, where do you see Hologic kind of landing in terms of when that pie starts shrinking? Do you get a bigger piece? How does that play out?

I believe very strongly that we will continue to improve our market share, right? In the beginning, this was kind of the wild, wild west. The FDA granted a gazillion EUAs. Everybody raced out to the market. At the end of the day, we have some very powerful and enduring assets that we believe will put us in a really good place over the long run.
It starts, frankly, with Panther and the installed base. We know there's a ton of hospitals that at a bare minimum are going to want to continue to test everybody that comes in their doors for procedures. They have them on-site. They'll be doing that. As we seek to get more people back to work and back to school, there is going to be a need for high-level testing that's asymptomatic. And I think, again, what's been happening in the short term, because there wasn't enough molecular tests in the beginning and the long turnaround times, there's a big emphasis on a lot of the rapid tests, particularly some of the antigen stuff, and they're going to have a place. But at the end of the day, they're not indicated, most of them, for asymptomatic screening. And we keep learning more and more by the day how much of this is asymptomatically being passed along.
And when you look at a lot of these super-spreader events, they are, quite frankly, being caused by using the wrong tests off-label to try to determine whether people have something. And I think over time, what we always say to our team is, the cream rises to the top. So you have Panther, and it's where it's located. You have an assay that's got incredible sensitivity, specificity and one of the best labels. We also have the pooling indication. And once you get back into screening, call it, next fall, right, think about simple things. We want to get everybody back to school in the fall. The vaccines still aren't indicated for people under 16. So as we keep talking about vaccinating the country, children are going to be excluded from that. We're going to want to be doing asymptomatic screening. And a lot of the antigen tests that people may say are great right now, they're not going to be as effective at picking up particularly asymptomatic indications. So we have that.
And then you just have the pure workflow advantage that should never be forgotten. And that is the workflow of Panther, the random access, automation, ability to just make this as easy. The lab techs around the world have been running a marathon at sprint speed. They're exhausted. You can't walk into any lab and not hear from the lab director that their techs are just tired. And they would much rather be able to be using Panther. And one of the fundamental realities is, we've been shipping so much but not all of it has been with our full pen caps, and that's part of the capacity we've been building up. And as we're able to provide more and more of our pen caps, it creates the full automation benefit that not everybody has even been fully getting yet.
So we have no idea truly exactly how this is going to play out. But all the discussions we've been having with the Biden transition team has been continued about, hey, are you still building up more capacity? And we certainly are. We'll see how it all plays out. But I think like every market we compete in, we think we're going to be there standing."

The fact that Surgical and Breast Health both ended up growing, which we wouldn't have expected. Whether they grow or stay flattish, we're probably talking little pieces here. We're seeing little pockets, right, in certain geographies. Suddenly, we'll have a couple of slower days in the Surgical business or in the Breast Health consumable business. So I'd call it, it's little temporary outages. But fundamentally, it's going to be tiny for us given that we've got the COVID offset. And I think we just continue to focus on share, and it'll take care of itself here over time. But maybe slightly more muted this quarter on a couple of those businesses but still overall good."

Let me take a crack at that. I think on your first point, what we said a few quarters ago is in the early days we placed a significant portion of our Panthers into some of our largest customers where they were going to replace Tigrises over time and provide access to a broader menu. There's 4 tests approved on Tigris, I think now 18 on Panther if you include the 2 COVID tests. We haven't given an update on that since then. So I don't have an update or a specific number for you today. I would tell you that, by and large, we are focusing on our existing customers, obviously, and broadening out relationships with those customers.
If you think about where our Panthers sit overall, most of them sit in hospital labs. And I think this gets back to one of the comments that Steve was making earlier about how getting testing closer to the patient is going to help us from a share perspective going forward for pre-op procedures, things like that.

It's hard for people to fully understand how much R&D and manufacturing and quality assurance resources went into getting all of both the assays out for COVID as well as the additional label indications, things like pooling, and they involve a lot of software. So we're continuing even just on pathways to continue to strengthen there.
In Breast Health, we've got a number of things coming out using AI. We've got follow-ups from the SSI acquisition on ultrasound. Brevera is really in the process of rolling out. So we've got a lot of additional software and smaller things there. Then we've got, obviously, Acessa, the ProVu product rolling in within the Surgical business. So I think we feel very good about the cadence of those things rolling out.
And then on the M&A front, I probably go back to the comment I made in probably answering the first question or so, which is, to me, the best way to be disciplined in M&A is to have a great core business. And all of our businesses right now are good. We've also got just really good teams, able to do some great due diligence. We've really walked away from a number of things, actually, even over the last few months, and we continue to work others. So I think we're able to look a little bit bigger, certainly, given the cash, but we don't necessarily have big eyes or big needs. And I think, if anything, we're probably likely to be building a little bit more of a cash position here in the nearer term. As Karleen mentioned, we've generated $1.1 billion of cash just in the last 2 quarters. We certainly aren't spending at that rate. And that's okay for right now. We'll be patient and disciplined."

Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we'll have a question-and-answer session today.
Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through February 26.
Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.
Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, and we define organic revenue as constant currency revenue, excluding the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses as well as the acquired Acessa business. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO."

We are off to a very strong start to the year across all our businesses and major geographies. Once again, our Diagnostics",2047,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone.
We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We are off to a very strong start to the year across all our businesses and major geographies. Once again, our Diagnostics division delivered incredible performance by making a massive impact against COVID-19. And our Breast Health and Surgical businesses continue to strengthen, with each returning to growth in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. So our performance was strong and broad-based across both divisions and geographies. As a result, our financial results were exceptional in the first quarter. Let's provide a quick overview.
Total revenue was $1.61 billion, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.86. Organic revenue more than doubled, up 104%, while EPS increased more than fourfold as higher production volumes in Diagnostics enabled us to leverage our fixed cost base. Both revenue and EPS came in well ahead of our expectations at the beginning of the quarter.
With that introduction, I'd like to cover 3 main topics in my remarks today, which will echo some of the themes from our presentation at the JPMorgan conference earlier this month. First, how our purpose-driven culture is contributing to, and we believe driving, our excellent financial results. Second, how we're making a huge difference in the fight against COVID-19. And third, why we'll be a stronger company on the other side of the pandemic.
To begin, many of you will recall that Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, wrote in early 2018 that companies, both public and private, should serve a social purpose. Three years later, we would argue that Hologic is the epitome of such a company. We are an incredibly purpose-driven, highly engaged team that is waking up every day wanting to make a positive difference in the world. And we believe this culture is contributing to differentiated financial performance, both in terms of our COVID response and the faster than expected return to growth in our Breast Health and Surgical divisions. Our employees understand that the bigger our collective impact on the world, the more they and our shareholders benefit.
What makes us tick is our strong purpose of enabling healthier lives everywhere, every day. Within this, we have a special passion, to champion women's health. But we don't just help women. If, for example, you're one of the tens of millions of people who have had a Hologic COVID test in the last year, you can rest assured that you're getting a high-quality, highly accurate result. That's the promise we make to our customers, which we call The Science of Sure.
Our purpose, passion and promise have shown up in countless ways since the pandemic began. Some are visible externally, like extraordinarily rapid EUAs or massive increases in production capacity. But many are behind the scenes, from how we rewarded our frontline employees for their heroic efforts during the pandemic, to how our Board and management team found safe ways to meet in person, to how we always try to under-promise and over-deliver on the COVID test commitments we made to customers and governments around the world.
We talk about many of these topics in our second annual sustainability report, titled the Power of Purpose, which we just published on our website last week. I'd encourage all our investors, but especially those interested in ESG issues, to take a look.
Now let us give you an update on our COVID testing efforts. As you can probably tell from our financial results, we continue to make good progress on our plans to expand manufacturing capacity for our 2 COVID assays out of our plants in San Diego and Manchester, U.K. Total output increased sequentially compared to the September quarter, which enabled us to provide about 30 million COVID assays to customers, generating revenue of about $745 million. As we have said, we are now selling more COVID tests each quarter than we had ever produced of all of our molecular tests before the pandemic. And we are on track to meet our goal to produce at least 75 million total molecular diagnostic tests a quarter globally by January of 2022. This would represent more than 3.5x our total capacity pre-COVID, a tremendous accomplishment thanks to our employees, our suppliers and the U.S. government, which is providing financial support.
In the first quarter, about 1/3 of our COVID test revenue came outside the United States, mainly from Europe. COVID testing continues to strengthen our international business, our relationships with customers, our future prospects in Diagnostics and even market access for our other franchises. These COVID sales contributed to total international revenue of $472 million in the quarter, which represented tremendous growth of 145% on an organic basis.
At the same time, we are also encouraged that demand for new Panther instruments remains very strong. You might recall that last fiscal year, we placed more than 500 new Panther systems worldwide, more than double our usual run rate. And we are off to an excellent start in fiscal '21 with another 150 shipments in the first quarter alone. We still have a long waiting list for instruments, which we believe reflects the longevity of COVID testing that our customers anticipate. Overall, our global installed base now stands at roughly 2,400 instruments, giving us a robust platform for future growth as more customers come to appreciate our system's best-in-class capabilities.
Now let us shift gears to our third major topic, why we believe our business will be much stronger on the other side of the pandemic. First, it's never been more clear to us that demand for highly accurate molecular COVID testing will remain robust for a while. We may have become a little numb to infection rates that remain staggeringly high in the United States and globally. But as a reminder, the almost 2 million molecular tests that are being performed daily in the United States today would annualize to a market that's about 17x bigger than the single largest molecular market before COVID.
So while demand will inevitably decline as vaccines roll out, nucleic acid testing is likely to have a long, meaningful tail that extends into fiscal '22 and beyond, with COVID likely remaining our biggest molecular product for years to come. As we have seen, it will take time to manufacture and administer vaccines broadly, and many people will choose not to be vaccinated. The societal need for and focus on COVID testing far exceeds anything we have ever seen before. And the pandemic's emotional toll will last much longer, driving future demand.
As public concern around COVID persists, the combination of our huge Panther installed base at facilities close to the patient and our gold standard assay performance have us uniquely positioned to pursue many use cases that will be around for the long term. These include testing before hospital admissions, asymptomatic screening for various purposes and even confirmatory testing of other less accurate modalities. Studies have shown that these other tests can miss 2/3 of asymptomatic cases, and these false negative results can contribute to super-spreader events. Even as the market matures and our production capacity increases, we believe our combination of robust chemistry, innovative engineering on Panther and differentiated labeling from FDA will help us gain market share.
Moving on, the second reason Hologic will be stronger in the future is the significant non-COVID business we are gaining on our rapidly growing installed base of Panther instruments. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that in the United States, Europe and Asia, every single Panther that our commercial teams have placed has been with an eye toward the future. They are doing a fantastic job of extending and broadening commercial contracts, winning key strategic accounts and fueling our razor/razor blade business model.
As an indicator of this, last quarter, we discussed tests of record, or TORs, which represent contracted year 1 revenue from new assay customers. We said that we had achieved a new record in TORs in fiscal 2020 with non-COVID business totaling $35 million in the United States, about 50% more than we had ever done before. This positive trend has actually accelerated in early 2021, with more than $20 million of additional TORs in the first quarter alone.
That's one reason that momentum in our molecular business, which was already good before COVID, is improving further today, especially in Europe. For example, when we remove COVID assay sales from our molecular number as well as instruments and ancillaries, core assay sales grew roughly 10% globally in the first quarter, more than double the rate a quarter ago.
The third reason we believe we will be stronger post-COVID is that thanks to the tremendous success of our Diagnostics business, we have been able to use the last several quarters to further bolster our Breast and Surgical franchises for the future. In Breast, we have continued to expand on our strategy to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. Rather than just placing capital equipment, we are now selling a full portfolio of hardware and software upgrades, interventional tools and service. While the world has been understandably focused on COVID, we have increased our direct presence with Breast Health customers and developed and launched products such as Brevera, which is off to a very good start in its relaunch. And most recently, we acquired for $64 million the German company Somatex, a long-time partner of ours, to strengthen our portfolio of breast cancer markers, enhance our commercial presence in Europe and improve our profitability.
In Surgical, both our R&D and business development pipelines have been productive, broadening the portfolio of products that we sell through a high performing, highly engaged sales force. New products such as our Fluent fluid management system and new hysteroscopes are complementing our market-leading MyoSure and NovaSure devices, and helped that division return to growth in the first quarter, well ahead of schedule.
On the business development front, in August, we spent approximately $80 million, plus future contingent earnouts, to buy Acessa Health. Acessa's ProVu is a laparoscopic RF product that is used to treat fibroids that MyoSure can't reach, so it's very complementary to our Surgical business and a nice fit for our sales force. And so far, early feedback from our customers has been good.
The acquisitions of Acessa and Somatex demonstrate the final reason we will be stronger after the pandemic, the ability to use the healthy cash flow that COVID tests are generating to step up our business development activities. The pending $230 million acquisition of Biotheranostics, which we announced earlier this month, is another good example of this strategy. Biotheranostics, a leader in molecular tests for breast and metastatic cancers, enables us to expand into the adjacent growth market of oncology. More specifically, Biotheranostics has done a great job of developing a strong clinical and reimbursement foundation for their flagship Breast Cancer Index test, which plays an important role in a large but underpenetrated breast cancer market that we know a lot about. In addition, Biotheranostics provides us clinical lab capabilities that we can use to develop markets for novel content down the road. From a financial perspective, Biotheranostics brings more than $30 million of annual revenue, growth rates in excess of 20% and strong gross margins.
We're excited that since we announced the deal, Biotheranostics has received some very good news that will benefit women with early-stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, included the Breast Cancer Index test in its guidelines to predict the benefit of extended treatment with various endocrine therapies. This should help establish the test as the standard of care for this important clinical question and contribute to increased patient access.
Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that we are off to an excellent start in fiscal 2021. Our purpose-driven culture is driving excellent execution and performance, both in terms of our COVID tests and the recovery of our other businesses. And we are working hard to ensure that the financial success we are experiencing now will translate into a stronger company down the road. We are confident it will.
Now we'll turn the call over to Karleen."

In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for t",1494,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the second quarter fiscal '21.
As Steve said, we are very pleased with our first quarter results as revenue and EPS significantly exceeded our guidance. Reported revenue of $1.61 billion increased 87%. Organically, revenue grew 104%, driven by strong COVID sales and the continued improvement of our base business across all major geographies. Given the incredible demand for our COVID test and the strong results in our base business, we were able to significantly improve profit, margins and cash flow. As a result, EPS of $2.86 in the first quarter increased 369%, well ahead of our expectations. Further, operating cash flow has continued to be extremely strong, which I'll discuss in a minute.
Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, our largest division, global revenue of $1.128 billion grew 256% in the first quarter, driven by molecular, where sales increased 449%. In response to the unprecedented demand for COVID testing, we shipped about 30 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of $745 million globally. And excluding COVID, our base molecular business accelerated sequentially as customers continue to see the benefit of our assay menu and the strength of Panther's high throughput automation. Rounding out Diagnostics, the cytology and perinatal businesses grew by 1% in the quarter, driven in part by a catch-up in cytology procedures at calendar year-end.
In Breast Health, global revenue of $332.7 million was down slightly overall. However, performance improved compared to the fourth quarter and the business returned to slight growth in all geographies except for Latin America. The division's performance was driven by the interventional businesses, which grew 15% in the quarter and was helped by the relaunch of our Brevera biopsy system.
Although we are encouraged by sequential improvement in the capital environment and by healthy equipment sales at calendar year-end, overall spending remains challenged because of COVID. However, our intentional diversification to service and consumables as well as several recent acquisitions have helped mitigate pressure on capital. As an example, Breast Health service revenue, which is larger than capital sales, grew by mid-single digits in the quarter.
In Surgical, sales of $124 million grew 3.3%, a great result given headwinds on elective procedures from recently increasing COVID cases in some parts of the country. This result shows the strength and commitment of our surgical sales force as well as the benefit of several new products.
Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $1.14 billion increased 80% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 91%. Outside the United States, sales of $472 million increased 106% in constant currency. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 145%, a stellar result that reflects our growing international strength.
Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the first quarter. Gross margins of 77.2% increased 1,560 basis points, driven by sales of high-margin COVID tests and the divestiture of the low-margin Cynosure business.
Total operating expenses of $274.5 million decreased 5.1% in the first quarter. However, expenses actually increased when normalized for the Cynosure sale and about $6.5 million of credits from BARDA associated with the development of our COVID assays. These increases were driven by investments in R&D and marketing for future growth. In addition, expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan increased as a result of equity market gains. As a reminder, while this liability is marked to market, most of the expense is offset by a benefit we realized in other income in the quarter.
In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.75%, slightly lower than previously forecasted driven by a favorable geographic mix of income, primarily from sales of COVID-19 assays outside the United States. Putting all this together, operating margins increased 3,270 basis points to 60.2%, and net margins increased 2,730 basis points to 46.6%. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $749.6 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.86, well ahead of expectations.
Before we cover our 2021 second quarter guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests, cash flow from operations was $650 million in the first quarter, a very strong result. In fact, this was about the same as our total cash flow from operations for all of fiscal 2019. Looked at another way, in just the last 2 quarters, we have generated about $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, which gives us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, we repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares of stock for $101 million in the first quarter. And our Board recently approved a new $1 billion authorization, highlighting our commitment to capital deployment. And we were also able to strengthen our balance sheet by repaying our outstanding revolver balance of $250 million. As a reminder, we had borrowed against the revolver as a precautionary measure very early in the pandemic.
Overall, we had $869 million of cash at the end of the first quarter. And with more than $1 billion of EBITDA for the quarter, our leverage ratio fell to 0.8x. While we remain comfortable with leverage ratio between 2 and 3 over the longer term, we also have no problem with a lower ratio in the short term. As you know, we are actively pursuing a number of division-led tuck-in acquisitions and hope to use our cash to complete more deals this year, in addition to buying back our stock. Finally, ROIC was 26.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 1,440 basis points.
Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal '21. We anticipate that fiscal '21 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall. But our business environment remains fluid due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic. Therefore, we are only providing a single quarter of guidance today. Let me also point out that our guidance does not include the impact of the pending Biotheranostics acquisition, which has not yet closed.
In the second quarter of fiscal '21, we expect excellent financial results again, with total revenue in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.56 billion. This represents an approximate doubling of organic revenue growth to roughly 96% to 104%. Underlying this, we expect similar sales of our COVID tests to drive exceptional Diagnostics growth. As a reminder, most of our new molecular production capacity is expected to come online in the second half of our fiscal year. Blood Screening revenue, which we back out of our organic calculations, is expected to be about $10 million in the quarter.
In our other businesses, let me remind you that our March quarter sales are typically down sequentially compared to the December period for our Breast, Surgical and base Diagnostics businesses as capital sales and semi-elective procedures tend to be seasonally stronger at the end of the calendar year. In addition, our guidance incorporates headwinds related to customer spending constraints and restrictions on procedure volumes given rising COVID cases. While our customers are much better prepared than they were last spring to manage through local increases in COVID prevalence, we have seen a recent slowdown in some elective surgeries.
On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $2.56 to $2.68 in the second quarter, with extraordinary growth rates that significantly outpace revenue even as we increase investments for future growth. To put this in perspective, we expect to earn more in the second quarter alone than we did in the full year of 2019. The second quarter guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.75% and diluted shares outstanding of 262 million to 263 million for the quarter. I'd also like to point out that we expect other expenses, net, to increase to close to $25 million in the second quarter as we don't forecast gains or losses related to certain hedging activities like we saw in the first quarter.
As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty has increased in recent weeks due to the pandemic. While our visibility has improved compared to several months ago, we would still encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides.
Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic's financial performance in the first quarter was terrific. We continue to make a huge impact fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and on women's health globally. Further, I am confident that we have positioned ourselves to deliver exceptional long-term performance.
With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for the first question."

And it's really helped us strengthen our whole team in Europe. So we've been building relationships at a higher level.
As COVID has hit, it's given us incredible access to a lot of the major governments. We've got contracts with just about every major government in Europe. And in so doing, we're now on their radar screen that they really, a lot of them didn't know about the Diagnostics business and how much of a leader we are in the sexually transmitted infections and other stuff. So we've been able, as we've been selling in COVID and giving them Panthers, to really be booking new business that will come online as the Panthers go down and really just being able to talk more about our cytology business, our HPV business and really just a different level of relationship that we think is going to strengthen us significantly down the road."

I think we'd probably put it in a couple of different perspectives. First and foremost, I would say is, while we're obviously generating a ton of cash right now, we also have the luxury of being in an enormous position of strength in that our base businesses are performing. And I think the best way that you can be very disciplined on deals is when it's easy to walk away from anything because you don't need anything and you feel good about your underlying business. So then if we look at the market specifically, it's been fascinating to watch over the last 8 months, right?
First, everybody hunkered down back in March, April and May, including ourselves. We had pushed things like the Acessa deal, we had even pushed out a few months. And we'd had a relationship with Biotheranostics and kind of just wanted to see where our own cash flow was at that point in time. So now, obviously, there's a lot of companies that are fairly flush with cash. There's also a fairly healthy IPO market right now. So there's a bit of froth out there, I think, and we want to be disciplined.
So I would tell you, as excited as the deals we've done, I'm probably more proud of some deals we've gone pretty deep on over the last 3, 4 months that we walked away from, really over valuation or other issues in diligence. And that's, I think, the maturing of our team here and the fundamental strength. So I think we're in a position where if we can get the right assets at the right price with good ROICs, hey, that's great. And if we need to wait some things out or even miss some things, we're not going to get caught into bidding wars and overpay. So I do think it's a pretty vibrant market right now. We've had every banker beating our door down trying to sell us things, as you can imagine, but staying very disciplined."

As you think about the back half and the pie possibly beginning to naturally shrink there, all tests aren't created equal. So I guess, where do you see Hologic kind of landing in terms of when that pie starts shrinking? Do you get a bigger piece? How does that play out? And again, certainly, your capacity is expanding, what's the view of that split between COVID and non-COVID as we get through this year?"
108544,700611246,2251573,"Hologic, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Sure, Patrick. You're hitting on clearly one of the biggest questions. I believe very strongly that we will continue to improve our market share, right? In the beginning, this was kind of the wild, wild west.

I believe very strongly that we will continue to improve our market share, right? In the beginning, this was kind of the wild, wild west. The FDA granted a gazillion EUAs. Everybody raced out to the market. At the end of the day, we have some very powerful and enduring assets that we believe will put us in a really good place over the long run.
It starts, frankly, with Panther and the installed base. We know there's a ton of hospitals that at a bare minimum are going to want to continue to test everybody that comes in their doors for procedures. They have them on-site. They'll be doing that. As we seek to get more people back to work and back to school, there is going to be a need for high-level testing that's asymptomatic. And I think, again, what's been happening in the short term, because there wasn't enough molecular tests in the beginning and the long turnaround times, there's a big emphasis on a lot of the rapid tests, particularly some of the antigen stuff, and they're going to have a place. But at the end of the day, they're not indicated, most of them, for asymptomatic screening. And we keep learning more and more by the day how much of this is asymptomatically being passed along.
And when you look at a lot of these super-spreader events, they are, quite frankly, being caused by using the wrong tests off-label to try to determine whether people have something. And I think over time, what we always say to our team is, the cream rises to the top. So you have Panther, and it's where it's located. You have an assay that's got incredible sensitivity, specificity and one of the best labels. We also have the pooling indication. And once you get back into screening, call it, next fall, right, think about simple things. We want to get everybody back to school in the fall. The vaccines still aren't indicated for people under 16. So as we keep talking about vaccinating the country, children are going to be excluded from that. We're going to want to be doing asymptomatic screening. And a lot of the antigen tests that people may say are great right now, they're not going to be as effective at picking up particularly asymptomatic indications. So we have that.
And then you just have the pure workflow advantage that should never be forgotten. And that is the workflow of Panther, the random access, automation, ability to just make this as easy. The lab techs around the world have been running a marathon at sprint speed. They're exhausted. You can't walk into any lab and not hear from the lab director that their techs are just tired. And they would much rather be able to be using Panther. And one of the fundamental realities is, we've been shipping so much but not all of it has been with our full pen caps, and that's part of the capacity we've been building up. And as we're able to provide more and more of our pen caps, it creates the full automation benefit that not everybody has even been fully getting yet.
So we have no idea truly exactly how this is going to play out. But all the discussions we've been having with the Biden transition team has been continued about, hey, are you still building up more capacity? And we certainly are. We'll see how it all plays out. But I think like every market we compete in, we think we're going to be there standing."

The fact that Surgical and Breast Health both ended up growing, which we wouldn't have expected. Whether they grow or stay flattish, we're probably talking little pieces here. We're seeing little pockets, right, in certain geographies. Suddenly, we'll have a couple of slower days in the Surgical business or in the Breast Health consumable business. So I'd call it, it's little temporary outages. But fundamentally, it's going to be tiny for us given that we've got the COVID offset. And I think we just continue to focus on share, and it'll take care of itself here over time. But maybe slightly more muted this quarter on a couple of those businesses but still overall good."

Let me take a crack at that. I think on your first point, what we said a few quarters ago is in the early days we placed a significant portion of our Panthers into some of our largest customers where they were going to replace Tigrises over time and provide access to a broader menu. There's 4 tests approved on Tigris, I think now 18 on Panther if you include the 2 COVID tests. We haven't given an update on that since then. So I don't have an update or a specific number for you today. I would tell you that, by and large, we are focusing on our existing customers, obviously, and broadening out relationships with those customers.
If you think about where our Panthers sit overall, most of them sit in hospital labs. And I think this gets back to one of the comments that Steve was making earlier about how getting testing closer to the patient is going to help us from a share perspective going forward for pre-op procedures, things like that.

Frankly, we've hit a grand slam in Diagnostics and put all of our energy. It's hard for people to fully understand how much R&D and manufacturing and quality assurance resources went into getting all of both the assays out for COVID as well as the additional label indications, things like pooling, and they involve a lot of software. So we're continuing even just on pathways to continue to strengthen there.
In Breast Health, we've got a number of things coming out using AI. We've got follow-ups from the SSI acquisition on ultrasound. Brevera is really in the process of rolling out. So we've got a lot of additional software and smaller things there. Then we've got, obviously, Acessa, the ProVu product rolling in within the Surgical business. So I think we feel very good about the cadence of those things rolling out.
And then on the M&A front, I probably go back to the comment I made in probably answering the first question or so, which is, to me, the best way to be disciplined in M&A is to have a great core business. And all of our businesses right now are good. We've also got just really good teams, able to do some great due diligence. We've really walked away from a number of things, actually, even over the last few months, and we continue to work others. So I think we're able to look a little bit bigger, certainly, given the cash, but we don't necessarily have big eyes or big needs. And I think, if anything, we're probably likely to be building a little bit more of a cash position here in the nearer term. As Karleen mentioned, we've generated $1.1 billion of cash just in the last 2 quarters. We certainly aren't spending at that rate. And that's okay for right now. We'll be patient and disciplined."

Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.
Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, and we define organic revenue as constant currency revenue, excluding the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses as well as the acquired Acessa business. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO."

We are off to a very strong start to the year across all our businesses and major geographies. Once again, our Diagnostics",2047,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone.
We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We are off to a very strong start to the year across all our businesses and major geographies. Once again, our Diagnostics division delivered incredible performance by making a massive impact against COVID-19. And our Breast Health and Surgical businesses continue to strengthen, with each returning to growth in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. So our performance was strong and broad-based across both divisions and geographies. As a result, our financial results were exceptional in the first quarter. Let's provide a quick overview.
Total revenue was $1.61 billion, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.86. Organic revenue more than doubled, up 104%, while EPS increased more than fourfold as higher production volumes in Diagnostics enabled us to leverage our fixed cost base. Both revenue and EPS came in well ahead of our expectations at the beginning of the quarter.
With that introduction, I'd like to cover 3 main topics in my remarks today, which will echo some of the themes from our presentation at the JPMorgan conference earlier this month. First, how our purpose-driven culture is contributing to, and we believe driving, our excellent financial results. Second, how we're making a huge difference in the fight against COVID-19. And third, why we'll be a stronger company on the other side of the pandemic.
To begin, many of you will recall that Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, wrote in early 2018 that companies, both public and private, should serve a social purpose. Three years later, we would argue that Hologic is the epitome of such a company. We are an incredibly purpose-driven, highly engaged team that is waking up every day wanting to make a positive difference in the world. And we believe this culture is contributing to differentiated financial performance, both in terms of our COVID response and the faster than expected return to growth in our Breast Health and Surgical divisions. Our employees understand that the bigger our collective impact on the world, the more they and our shareholders benefit.
What makes us tick is our strong purpose of enabling healthier lives everywhere, every day. Within this, we have a special passion, to champion women's health. But we don't just help women. If, for example, you're one of the tens of millions of people who have had a Hologic COVID test in the last year, you can rest assured that you're getting a high-quality, highly accurate result. That's the promise we make to our customers, which we call The Science of Sure.
Our purpose, passion and promise have shown up in countless ways since the pandemic began. Some are visible externally, like extraordinarily rapid EUAs or massive increases in production capacity. But many are behind the scenes, from how we rewarded our frontline employees for their heroic efforts during the pandemic, to how our Board and management team found safe ways to meet in person, to how we always try to under-promise and over-deliver on the COVID test commitments we made to customers and governments around the world.
We talk about many of these topics in our second annual sustainability report, titled the Power of Purpose, which we just published on our website last week. I'd encourage all our investors, but especially those interested in ESG issues, to take a look.
Now let us give you an update on our COVID testing efforts. As you can probably tell from our financial results, we continue to make good progress on our plans to expand manufacturing capacity for our 2 COVID assays out of our plants in San Diego and Manchester, U.K. Total output increased sequentially compared to the September quarter, which enabled us to provide about 30 million COVID assays to customers, generating revenue of about $745 million. As we have said, we are now selling more COVID tests each quarter than we had ever produced of all of our molecular tests before the pandemic. And we are on track to meet our goal to produce at least 75 million total molecular diagnostic tests a quarter globally by January of 2022. This would represent more than 3.5x our total capacity pre-COVID, a tremendous accomplishment thanks to our employees, our suppliers and the U.S. government, which is providing financial support.
In the first quarter, about 1/3 of our COVID test revenue came outside the United States, mainly from Europe. COVID testing continues to strengthen our international business, our relationships with customers, our future prospects in Diagnostics and even market access for our other franchises. These COVID sales contributed to total international revenue of $472 million in the quarter, which represented tremendous growth of 145% on an organic basis.
At the same time, we are also encouraged that demand for new Panther instruments remains very strong. You might recall that last fiscal year, we placed more than 500 new Panther systems worldwide, more than double our usual run rate. And we are off to an excellent start in fiscal '21 with another 150 shipments in the first quarter alone. We still have a long waiting list for instruments, which we believe reflects the longevity of COVID testing that our customers anticipate. Overall, our global installed base now stands at roughly 2,400 instruments, giving us a robust platform for future growth as more customers come to appreciate our system's best-in-class capabilities.
Now let us shift gears to our third major topic, why we believe our business will be much stronger on the other side of the pandemic. First, it's never been more clear to us that demand for highly accurate molecular COVID testing will remain robust for a while. We may have become a little numb to infection rates that remain staggeringly high in the United States and globally. But as a reminder, the almost 2 million molecular tests that are being performed daily in the United States today would annualize to a market that's about 17x bigger than the single largest molecular market before COVID.
So while demand will inevitably decline as vaccines roll out, nucleic acid testing is likely to have a long, meaningful tail that extends into fiscal '22 and beyond, with COVID likely remaining our biggest molecular product for years to come. As we have seen, it will take time to manufacture and administer vaccines broadly, and many people will choose not to be vaccinated. The societal need for and focus on COVID testing far exceeds anything we have ever seen before. And the pandemic's emotional toll will last much longer, driving future demand.
As public concern around COVID persists, the combination of our huge Panther installed base at facilities close to the patient and our gold standard assay performance have us uniquely positioned to pursue many use cases that will be around for the long term. These include testing before hospital admissions, asymptomatic screening for various purposes and even confirmatory testing of other less accurate modalities. Studies have shown that these other tests can miss 2/3 of asymptomatic cases, and these false negative results can contribute to super-spreader events. Even as the market matures and our production capacity increases, we believe our combination of robust chemistry, innovative engineering on Panther and differentiated labeling from FDA will help us gain market share.
Moving on, the second reason Hologic will be stronger in the future is the significant non-COVID business we are gaining on our rapidly growing installed base of Panther instruments. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that in the United States, Europe and Asia, every single Panther that our commercial teams have placed has been with an eye toward the future. They are doing a fantastic job of extending and broadening commercial contracts, winning key strategic accounts and fueling our razor/razor blade business model.
As an indicator of this, last quarter, we discussed tests of record, or TORs, which represent contracted year 1 revenue from new assay customers. We said that we had achieved a new record in TORs in fiscal 2020 with non-COVID business totaling $35 million in the United States, about 50% more than we had ever done before. This positive trend has actually accelerated in early 2021, with more than $20 million of additional TORs in the first quarter alone.
That's one reason that momentum in our molecular business, which was already good before COVID, is improving further today, especially in Europe. For example, when we remove COVID assay sales from our molecular number as well as instruments and ancillaries, core assay sales grew roughly 10% globally in the first quarter, more than double the rate a quarter ago.
The third reason we believe we will be stronger post-COVID is that thanks to the tremendous success of our Diagnostics business, we have been able to use the last several quarters to further bolster our Breast and Surgical franchises for the future. In Breast, we have continued to expand on our strategy to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. Rather than just placing capital equipment, we are now selling a full portfolio of hardware and software upgrades, interventional tools and service. While the world has been understandably focused on COVID, we have increased our direct presence with Breast Health customers and developed and launched products such as Brevera, which is off to a very good start in its relaunch. And most recently, we acquired for $64 million the German company Somatex, a long-time partner of ours, to strengthen our portfolio of breast cancer markers, enhance our commercial presence in Europe and improve our profitability.
In Surgical, both our R&D and business development pipelines have been productive, broadening the portfolio of products that we sell through a high performing, highly engaged sales force. New products such as our Fluent fluid management system and new hysteroscopes are complementing our market-leading MyoSure and NovaSure devices, and helped that division return to growth in the first quarter, well ahead of schedule.
On the business development front, in August, we spent approximately $80 million, plus future contingent earnouts, to buy Acessa Health. Acessa's ProVu is a laparoscopic RF product that is used to treat fibroids that MyoSure can't reach, so it's very complementary to our Surgical business and a nice fit for our sales force. And so far, early feedback from our customers has been good.
The acquisitions of Acessa and Somatex demonstrate the final reason we will be stronger after the pandemic, the ability to use the healthy cash flow that COVID tests are generating to step up our business development activities. The pending $230 million acquisition of Biotheranostics, which we announced earlier this month, is another good example of this strategy. Biotheranostics, a leader in molecular tests for breast and metastatic cancers, enables us to expand into the adjacent growth market of oncology. More specifically, Biotheranostics has done a great job of developing a strong clinical and reimbursement foundation for their flagship Breast Cancer Index test, which plays an important role in a large but underpenetrated breast cancer market that we know a lot about. In addition, Biotheranostics provides us clinical lab capabilities that we can use to develop markets for novel content down the road. From a financial perspective, Biotheranostics brings more than $30 million of annual revenue, growth rates in excess of 20% and strong gross margins.
We're excited that since we announced the deal, Biotheranostics has received some very good news that will benefit women with early-stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, included the Breast Cancer Index test in its guidelines to predict the benefit of extended treatment with various endocrine therapies. This should help establish the test as the standard of care for this important clinical question and contribute to increased patient access.
Before turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that we are off to an excellent start in fiscal 2021. Our purpose-driven culture is driving excellent execution and performance, both in terms of our COVID tests and the recovery of our other businesses. And we are working hard to ensure that the financial success we are experiencing now will translate into a stronger company down the road. We are confident it will.
Now we'll turn the call over to Karleen."

In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for t",1494,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, briefly touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the second quarter fiscal '21.
As Steve said, we are very pleased with our first quarter results as revenue and EPS significantly exceeded our guidance. Reported revenue of $1.61 billion increased 87%. Organically, revenue grew 104%, driven by strong COVID sales and the continued improvement of our base business across all major geographies. Given the incredible demand for our COVID test and the strong results in our base business, we were able to significantly improve profit, margins and cash flow. As a result, EPS of $2.86 in the first quarter increased 369%, well ahead of our expectations. Further, operating cash flow has continued to be extremely strong, which I'll discuss in a minute.
Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, our largest division, global revenue of $1.128 billion grew 256% in the first quarter, driven by molecular, where sales increased 449%. In response to the unprecedented demand for COVID testing, we shipped about 30 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of $745 million globally. And excluding COVID, our base molecular business accelerated sequentially as customers continue to see the benefit of our assay menu and the strength of Panther's high throughput automation. Rounding out Diagnostics, the cytology and perinatal businesses grew by 1% in the quarter, driven in part by a catch-up in cytology procedures at calendar year-end.
In Breast Health, global revenue of $332.7 million was down slightly overall. However, performance improved compared to the fourth quarter and the business returned to slight growth in all geographies except for Latin America. The division's performance was driven by the interventional businesses, which grew 15% in the quarter and was helped by the relaunch of our Brevera biopsy system.
Although we are encouraged by sequential improvement in the capital environment and by healthy equipment sales at calendar year-end, overall spending remains challenged because of COVID. However, our intentional diversification to service and consumables as well as several recent acquisitions have helped mitigate pressure on capital. As an example, Breast Health service revenue, which is larger than capital sales, grew by mid-single digits in the quarter.
In Surgical, sales of $124 million grew 3.3%, a great result given headwinds on elective procedures from recently increasing COVID cases in some parts of the country. This result shows the strength and commitment of our surgical sales force as well as the benefit of several new products.
Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $1.14 billion increased 80% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 91%. Outside the United States, sales of $472 million increased 106% in constant currency. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 145%, a stellar result that reflects our growing international strength.
Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the first quarter. Gross margins of 77.2% increased 1,560 basis points, driven by sales of high-margin COVID tests and the divestiture of the low-margin Cynosure business.
Total operating expenses of $274.5 million decreased 5.1% in the first quarter. However, expenses actually increased when normalized for the Cynosure sale and about $6.5 million of credits from BARDA associated with the development of our COVID assays. These increases were driven by investments in R&D and marketing for future growth. In addition, expenses associated with our deferred compensation plan increased as a result of equity market gains. As a reminder, while this liability is marked to market, most of the expense is offset by a benefit we realized in other income in the quarter.
In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.75%, slightly lower than previously forecasted driven by a favorable geographic mix of income, primarily from sales of COVID-19 assays outside the United States. Putting all this together, operating margins increased 3,270 basis points to 60.2%, and net margins increased 2,730 basis points to 46.6%. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $749.6 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.86, well ahead of expectations.
Before we cover our 2021 second quarter guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests, cash flow from operations was $650 million in the first quarter, a very strong result. In fact, this was about the same as our total cash flow from operations for all of fiscal 2019. Looked at another way, in just the last 2 quarters, we have generated about $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, which gives us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, we repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares of stock for $101 million in the first quarter. And our Board recently approved a new $1 billion authorization, highlighting our commitment to capital deployment. And we were also able to strengthen our balance sheet by repaying our outstanding revolver balance of $250 million. As a reminder, we had borrowed against the revolver as a precautionary measure very early in the pandemic.
Overall, we had $869 million of cash at the end of the first quarter. And with more than $1 billion of EBITDA for the quarter, our leverage ratio fell to 0.8x. While we remain comfortable with leverage ratio between 2 and 3 over the longer term, we also have no problem with a lower ratio in the short term. As you know, we are actively pursuing a number of division-led tuck-in acquisitions and hope to use our cash to complete more deals this year, in addition to buying back our stock. Finally, ROIC was 26.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 1,440 basis points.
Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal '21. We anticipate that fiscal '21 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall. But our business environment remains fluid due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic. Therefore, we are only providing a single quarter of guidance today. Let me also point out that our guidance does not include the impact of the pending Biotheranostics acquisition, which has not yet closed.
In the second quarter of fiscal '21, we expect excellent financial results again, with total revenue in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.56 billion. This represents an approximate doubling of organic revenue growth to roughly 96% to 104%. Underlying this, we expect similar sales of our COVID tests to drive exceptional Diagnostics growth. As a reminder, most of our new molecular production capacity is expected to come online in the second half of our fiscal year. Blood Screening revenue, which we back out of our organic calculations, is expected to be about $10 million in the quarter.
In our other businesses, let me remind you that our March quarter sales are typically down sequentially compared to the December period for our Breast, Surgical and base Diagnostics businesses as capital sales and semi-elective procedures tend to be seasonally stronger at the end of the calendar year. In addition, our guidance incorporates headwinds related to customer spending constraints and restrictions on procedure volumes given rising COVID cases. While our customers are much better prepared than they were last spring to manage through local increases in COVID prevalence, we have seen a recent slowdown in some elective surgeries.
On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $2.56 to $2.68 in the second quarter, with extraordinary growth rates that significantly outpace revenue even as we increase investments for future growth. To put this in perspective, we expect to earn more in the second quarter alone than we did in the full year of 2019. The second quarter guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.75% and diluted shares outstanding of 262 million to 263 million for the quarter. I'd also like to point out that we expect other expenses, net, to increase to close to $25 million in the second quarter as we don't forecast gains or losses related to certain hedging activities like we saw in the first quarter.
As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty has increased in recent weeks due to the pandemic. While our visibility has improved compared to several months ago, we would still encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides.
Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic's financial performance in the first quarter was terrific. We continue to make a huge impact fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and on women's health globally. Further, I am confident that we have positioned ourselves to deliver exceptional long-term performance.
With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for the first question."

And it's really helped us strengthen our whole team in Europe. So we've been building relationships at a higher level.
As COVID has hit, it's given us incredible access to a lot of the major governments. We've got contracts with just about every major government in Europe. And in so doing, we're now on their radar screen that they really, a lot of them didn't know about the Diagnostics business and how much of a leader we are in the sexually transmitted infections and other stuff. So we've been able, as we've been selling in COVID and giving them Panthers, to really be booking new business that will come online as the Panthers go down and really just being able to talk more about our cytology business, our HPV business and really just a different level of relationship that we think is going to strengthen us significantly down the road."

I think we'd probably put it in a couple of different perspectives. First and foremost, I would say is, while we're obviously generating a ton of cash right now, we also have the luxury of being in an enormous position of strength in that our base businesses are performing. And I think the best way that you can be very disciplined on deals is when it's easy to walk away from anything because you don't need anything and you feel good about your underlying business. So then if we look at the market specifically, it's been fascinating to watch over the last 8 months, right?
First, everybody hunkered down back in March, April and May, including ourselves. We had pushed things like the Acessa deal, we had even pushed out a few months. And we'd had a relationship with Biotheranostics and kind of just wanted to see where our own cash flow was at that point in time. So now, obviously, there's a lot of companies that are fairly flush with cash. There's also a fairly healthy IPO market right now. So there's a bit of froth out there, I think, and we want to be disciplined.
So I would tell you, as excited as the deals we've done, I'm probably more proud of some deals we've gone pretty deep on over the last 3, 4 months that we walked away from, really over valuation or other issues in diligence. And that's, I think, the maturing of our team here and the fundamental strength. So I think we're in a position where if we can get the right assets at the right price with good ROICs, hey, that's great. And if we need to wait some things out or even miss some things, we're not going to get caught into bidding wars and overpay. So I do think it's a pretty vibrant market right now. We've had every banker beating our door down trying to sell us things, as you can imagine, but staying very disciplined."

So I guess, where do you see Hologic kind of landing in terms of when that pie starts shrinking? Do you get a bigger piece? How does that play out? And again, certainly, your capacity is expanding, what's the view of that split between COVID and non-COVID as we get through this year?"
108544,700611246,2251574,"Hologic, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Sure, Patrick. You're hitting on clearly one of the biggest questions. I believe very strongly that we will continue to improve our market share, right? In the beginning, this was kind of the wild, wild west.

I believe very strongly that we will continue to improve our market share, right? In the beginning, this was kind of the wild, wild west. The FDA granted a gazillion EUAs. Everybody raced out to the market. At the end of the day, we have some very powerful and enduring assets that we believe will put us in a really good place over the long run.
It starts, frankly, with Panther and the installed base. We know there's a ton of hospitals that at a bare minimum are going to want to continue to test everybody that comes in their doors for procedures. They have them on-site. They'll be doing that. As we seek to get more people back to work and back to school, there is going to be a need for high-level testing that's asymptomatic. And I think, again, what's been happening in the short term, because there wasn't enough molecular tests in the beginning and the long turnaround times, there's a big emphasis on a lot of the rapid tests, particularly some of the antigen stuff, and they're going to have a place. But at the end of the day, they're not indicated, most of them, for asymptomatic screening. And we keep learning more and more by the day how much of this is asymptomatically being passed along.
And when you look at a lot of these super-spreader events, they are, quite frankly, being caused by using the wrong tests off-label to try to determine whether people have something. And I think over time, what we always say to our team is, the cream rises to the top. So you have Panther, and it's where it's located. You have an assay that's got incredible sensitivity, specificity and one of the best labels. We also have the pooling indication. And once you get back into screening, call it, next fall, right, think about simple things. We want to get everybody back to school in the fall. The vaccines still aren't indicated for people under 16. So as we keep talking about vaccinating the country, children are going to be excluded from that. We're going to want to be doing asymptomatic screening. And a lot of the antigen tests that people may say are great right now, they're not going to be as effective at picking up particularly asymptomatic indications. So we have that.
And then you just have the pure workflow advantage that should never be forgotten. And that is the workflow of Panther, the random access, automation, ability to just make this as easy. The lab techs around the world have been running a marathon at sprint speed. They're exhausted. You can't walk into any lab and not hear from the lab director that their techs are just tired. And they would much rather be able to be using Panther. And one of the fundamental realities is, we've been shipping so much but not all of it has been with our full pen caps, and that's part of the capacity we've been building up. And as we're able to provide more and more of our pen caps, it creates the full automation benefit that not everybody has even been fully getting yet.
So we have no idea truly exactly how this is going to play out.

The fact that Surgical and Breast Health both ended up growing, which we wouldn't have expected. Whether they grow or stay flattish, we're probably talking little pieces here. We're seeing little pockets, right, in certain geographies. Suddenly, we'll have a couple of slower days in the Surgical business or in the Breast Health consumable business. So I'd call it, it's little temporary outages. But fundamentally, it's going to be tiny for us given that we've got the COVID offset. And I think we just continue to focus on share, and it'll take care of itself here over time. But maybe slightly more muted this quarter on a couple of those businesses but still overall good."

Let me take a crack at that. I think on your first point, what we said a few quarters ago is in the early days we placed a significant portion of our Panthers into some of our largest customers where they were going to replace Tigrises over time and provide access to a broader menu. There's 4 tests approved on Tigris, I think now 18 on Panther if you include the 2 COVID tests. We haven't given an update on that since then. So I don't have an update or a specific number for you today. I would tell you that, by and large, we are focusing on our existing customers, obviously, and broadening out relationships with those customers.
If you think about where our Panthers sit overall, most of them sit in hospital labs. And I think this gets back to one of the comments that Steve was making earlier about how getting testing closer to the patient is going to help us from a share perspective going forward for pre-op procedures, things like that.

Frankly, we've hit a grand slam in Diagnostics and put all of our energy. It's hard for people to fully understand how much R&D and manufacturing and quality assurance resources went into getting all of both the assays out for COVID as well as the additional label indications, things like pooling, and they involve a lot of software. So we're continuing even just on pathways to continue to strengthen there.
In Breast Health, we've got a number of things coming out using AI. We've got follow-ups from the SSI acquisition on ultrasound. Brevera is really in the process of rolling out. So we've got a lot of additional software and smaller things there. Then we've got, obviously, Acessa, the ProVu product rolling in within the Surgical business. So I think we feel very good about the cadence of those things rolling out.
And then on the M&A front, I probably go back to the comment I made in probably answering the first question or so, which is, to me, the best way to be disciplined in M&A is to have a great core business. And all of our businesses right now are good. We've also got just really good teams, able to do some great due diligence. We've really walked away from a number of things, actually, even over the last few months, and we continue to work others. So I think we're able to look a little bit bigger, certainly, given the cash, but we don't necessarily have big eyes or big needs. And I think, if anything, we're probably likely to be building a little bit more of a cash position here in the nearer term. As Karleen mentioned, we've generated $1.1 billion of cash just in the last 2 quarters. We certainly aren't spending at that rate. And that's okay for right now. We'll be patient and disciplined."

Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those or implied. Such factors include those that are referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. 
Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue. We define organic revenue as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business as well as the acquired Acessa, Biotheranostics and Diagenode businesses. 
Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO."
108544,710561117,2261419,"Hologic, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We posted excellent financial results overall, highlighted by best-in-class growth rates. Total revenue was $1.54 billion",2014,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We posted excellent financial results overall, highlighted by best-in-class growth rates. Total revenue was $1.54 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.59, both in line with our guidance. 
Organic revenue doubled, driven by strong recovery and momentum in our base businesses as well as our continued contributions to the COVID-19 fight. On the bottom line, EPS more than quadrupled. 
Our diversified business model again demonstrated its value in the second quarter as strong growth rates in our core businesses enabled us to meet our overall guidance even though COVID assay sales were less than expected. Our base Diagnostics business and our Surgical franchise, both finished slightly better than forecast, even while overcoming a tough January for U.S. health care utilization that was driven by increasing COVID cases. And our Breast Health division clearly outperformed as our diversification strategy has led to a faster-than-expected recovery. 
Karleen will cover the revenue and expense details. But before she does, I'd like to discuss 2 primary topics. When the COVID pandemic began more than a year ago, we set out to accomplish 2 things in simple terms: first, we committed to make as big an impact as possible against the pandemic; and second, we wanted to ensure that every action we took helped us emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company. We are clearly accomplishing both goals which makes us more excited than ever about our future. 
In terms of our first goal, helping fight the pandemic on a global scale. Let's summarize our contributions by focusing on 4 key numbers. Our first number is 100 million. Soon, we will ship our 100 millionth COVID test to customers, which included 27 million in the second quarter. At the same time, we have maintained our commitment to provide women's health test by dramatically increasing total molecular diagnostics production capacity. We are on track with our expansion plans in San Diego and Manchester, U.K. to have the capacity to make at least 75 million tests a quarter across our portfolio by January of 2022. 
Our second number is 40. This is the number of countries in which we've sold COVID tests as we help battle what has been and continues to be a global crisis. COVID testing continues to strengthen our international business, our relationships with customers, our future prospects in diagnostics and even market access for our other franchises. These COVID sales contributed to total international revenue of $474 million in the second quarter, which represented tremendous growth of 142%. 
Our third number is 717. This is the number of Panther instruments we have shipped to global customers over the last year, including about 190 in the second quarter. As a reminder, in the 5 years before COVID, we shipped an average of 225 Panthers a year. So we've more than tripled that pace over the last 12 months. In addition, we are encouraged that demand for Panthers remains very high. And for all of fiscal 2021, we expect to exceed last year's record placements. Overall, our global installed base now stands at roughly 2,600 instruments, approximately 40% higher than when the pandemic began, giving us a robust platform for future growth as more customers come to appreciate our system's best-in-class capabilities. And as we have discussed, we are seeing this play out with record levels of new non-COVID business on these Panthers. 
All these numbers lead to our fourth number, which is $2.35 billion. This is the total COVID assay revenue we have generated on a global basis since the pandemic began, including $680 million in the second quarter. And this has contributed very significantly to operating cash flow of nearly $1.9 billion over the last year. This has enabled us to acquire 4 companies and sign a deal for a fifth, even while further strengthening our balance sheet. We'll discuss our business development activity more in a minute. 
Before we do that, we wanted to provide our current perspective on the changes in the COVID testing market that you have all seen, with the understanding that the pandemic and its impact on Hologic remain highly unpredictable. 
Based on publicly available data for the U.S., molecular COVID testing volumes remain very high, much higher than for any other molecular test. But have declined significantly since January based on a better-than-expected vaccine rollout. In this context, our U.S. sales of COVID tests also declined significantly in March and further in April. We believe that molecular COVID testing demand will likely decline further as vaccines roll out, but remain important into fiscal '22 and beyond. This reflects the ongoing need for accurate clinical diagnosis, the value of testing for infection control purposes and the so-called back to life testing that is helping to reopen economies. 
In this environment, the combination of our huge Panther installed base at facilities close to the patient, and our gold-standard assay performance have us uniquely positioned to gain market share. Customers continue to tell us that Panther and Aptima remain their products of choice and that they intend to consolidate on our platforms. But we believe many of them are using up less automated assays before they expire. Customers had accumulated these tests in the winter when they needed multiple manufacturers to accommodate than higher levels of demand. This dynamic is further supported by the public AdvaMed data that many of you see, which show that industry-wide, tests performed are now running ahead of tests shipped, indicating that inventory is being worked down. 
In response to these market changes, we pivoted in 2 ways in the second quarter. First, by selling more COVID tests to our base hospital customers who want to bring highly accurate testing closer to their patients, improving turnaround times and clinical relevance. Panther is well positioned for this with first test results being delivered in about 3 hours. Notably, COVID tests are now being run on Panthers in more than 600 clinical labs in the United States. This means that COVID is the second most decentralized test that we sell, following only Aptima Combo 2, which has been on the U.S. market for roughly 20 years. 
Second, we pivoted by selling more tests internationally. As everyone has seen in the news, the vaccine rollout is proceeding at different paces around the world. Europe, in particular, has struggled with inoculations, increasing the importance of testing. For example, in the second quarter, almost 40% of our COVID assay revenue came from outside the United States, mainly from Europe. 
Now let's shift gears to our second major topic, an update on how the tremendous impact we've made against COVID has strengthened our business for the other side of the pandemic. As many of you will recall, before the pandemic hit, our organic growth rate had been steadily improving to around 5% based on new products international expansion and our early acquisitions. 
Now as we begin our annual strategic planning process, we are confident that organic growth for the next several years, excluding COVID assay sales, will be higher than it was before the pandemic hit. 
In Diagnostics, we've used COVID cash flows to broaden our portfolio by buying assets that are growing faster than our base business. Since the Gen-Probe acquisition in 2012, we had acquired exactly 0 companies in Diagnostics. But since late February, we have completed 2 deals and announced a third, dramatically accelerating our long-standing goal to become a more complete diversified diagnostics leader. 
In February, we closed our $232 million acquisition of Biotheranostics, a leader in molecular tests for breast and metastatic cancers, enabling us to expand into the adjacent growth market of oncology. This business is off to a very strong start, based mainly on the inclusion of the Breast Cancer Index test in NCCN guidelines to predict the benefit of extended treatment with endocrine therapies. 
A few days after that, we closed Biotheranostics. We -- I'm sorry, a few days after we closed Biotheranostics, we acquired Diagenode, a Belgian developer and manufacturer of molecular diagnostic assays and epigenetics products for approximately $153 million. Diagenode, which generated more than $30 million of revenue in the last year, will enable us to offer a broader, more differentiated menu of molecular diagnostic tests on our fully automated high-throughput Panther Fusion instrument. We know Diagenode's capabilities in assay development well, since we have partnered with them since 2016 to develop and manufacture PCR-based assays for Fusion. 
As you might recall, the ability to leverage external PCR expertise was one of the reasons we developed the Fusion system years ago. Now that Diagenode is part of Hologic, we can accelerate those assay development efforts and make many of their CE Mark PCR tests available on our unique platform, further enhancing European growth. 
Finally, earlier this month, we announced our agreement to acquire Mobidiag, a Finnish developer of innovative molecular diagnostics tests and instrumentation for approximately $795 million. In contrast to Diagenode, which helps us leverage our Fusion installed base around the world, Mobidiag brings new capabilities that we have been interested in for more than a decade. Specifically, Mobidiag is an innovator in near-patient acute care diagnostics, a large, rapidly growing area that we don't compete in today. This market encompasses test for respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions, health care-associated infections and antibiotic resistance among others. Having monitored this space closely over the years, we believe Mobidiag's Novodiag platform is a truly differentiated asset with a unique combination of ease of use, rapid turnaround, multiplexing and low cost. 
Mobidiag generated more than $40 million of revenue in calendar 2020 with a limited commercial presence and no sales in the United States. So we believe we can accelerate their growth globally, but especially in the United States once we get some of their assays approved here. 
Before I turn the call over to Karleen, I wanted to touch briefly on how we have also strengthened our Breast and Surgical businesses during the pandemic. 
In Breast, we have continued to expand on our strategy to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. We now sell a full portfolio of capital equipment, hardware and software upgrades, interventional tools and service. While the world has been understandably focused on COVID, we have increased our direct presence with Breast Health customers. We have launched new software products based on our investments in artificial intelligence. And we have strengthened our interventional franchise by relaunching Brevera which is doing very well, and buying SOMATEX, a longtime partner and leading developer of breast cancer markers. Together, all these strategies helped Breast Health outperform in the second quarter with total sales exceeding 2019 levels and global growth of 7.3%. While the mammography market is not quite back to pre-COVID levels, we are very pleased with our competitive position and growth outlook for the future. 
In Surgical, both our R&D and business development pipelines have been productive. broadening the portfolio of products that we sell through a high-performing, highly-engaged sales force. 
New products such as our Fluent Fluid Management System, new hysteroscopes and Acessa's laparoscopic RF product, ProVu are complementing our market-leading MyoSure and NovaSure devices. As a result, Surgical sales surpassed 2019 levels in the second quarter and grew 6.6% on a global basis, even while overcoming a slow January that resulted from reduced procedures in U.S. regions that were hit hard by COVID. 
So in conclusion, I want to emphatically state that I have never been more excited or confident in our future. We have responded to the world's need for COVID testing in a remarkable fashion and will continue to be there for testing needs around the world. 
Even more importantly, we have literally strengthened every one of our businesses in every geography and added multiple new growth platforms to our company during the last 12 months. I am truly amazed at what our team has done, and we really look forward to the quarters and years ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Karleen."
108544,710561117,2261419,"Hologic, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the third",1584,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. 
As Steve said, our second quarter results were excellent as revenue and EPS grew significantly compared to the prior year. Reported revenue of $1.54 billion increased 99%. Organically, revenue grew an even 100%, driven by strong growth in our base businesses and a healthy contribution from global COVID testing revenue. 
We met our top and bottom line guidance even as the COVID testing market changed rapidly late in the quarter. Based on our strong top line, we significantly improved profitability compared to the prior year. As a result, EPS of $2.59 more than quadrupled in the second quarter, increasing 354%. 
Further, operating cash flow has continued to be exceptionally strong, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, our largest division, global revenue of $1.065 billion grew 225% in the second quarter. This was driven by molecular where sales increased 378%. 
Although COVID testing declined sequentially from peak levels in the first quarter, demand was still very high. We shipped about 27 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of $680 million globally. Excluding COVID, our base molecular business continue to grow as customers capitalize on the breadth of our assay menu and the strength of Panther's best-in-class automation. Rounding out Diagnostics, the Cytology & Perinatal businesses grew 1% in the quarter, in line with trends before the pandemic. In Breast Health, global revenue of $336.3 million grew 7%, which we are very pleased with. 
Revenue also increased sequentially compared to Q1 and exceeded the second quarter of 2019 on a reported basis. The division's strong performance was well rounded as breast imaging grew 6%, driven by upgrade packages, and the interventional business increased 14%, driven by Brevera. Furthermore, Breast Health achieved growth in disposables, service and even capital versus the prior year period. Although the capital environment probably isn't fully back to normal, we have been encouraged by the continued improvement in this area as customers have learned to effectively manage through the pandemic and become more comfortable making future investments. 
In Surgical, second quarter revenue also exceeded 2019 levels, continuing the division's rapid recovery. Compared to the prior year, sales of $114.2 million grew 7% as elective procedure volumes strengthened throughout the quarter following a challenging January. The improving macro environment, coupled with multiple new products and a motivated sales force gives us confidence in the future trajectory of the Surgical franchise. 
Lastly, in Skeletal, revenue of $22.6 million declined 7% compared to the prior year. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $1.06 billion increased 85% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 87%. Outside the United States, sales of $474 million increased 142%. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 141%, a fantastic result that reflects our growing international strength. 
Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the second quarter. Gross margins of 75% increased 1,400 basis points driven by the sales of our high-margin COVID tests. Total operating expenses of $277.7 million increased 25% in the second quarter. This included about $1.3 million of credits from BARDA associated with the development of our COVID assays. This is about $5 million less than in Q1. 
The increase in our operating expenses was driven by investments in R&D and marketing for future growth as well as incremental expense from the acquisitions that Steve discussed. Also remember, that in the second quarter of 2020, we had begun to pull back on spending, given the initial uncertainty of the pandemic. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter is 21.2%, slightly lower than forecast, driven by a favorable geographic mix of income, primarily from sales of COVID-19 assays outside the United States. Putting these all together, operating margin increased 2,540 basis points to 56.9%, and net margin increased 2,380 basis points to 43.8%. 
As a result, non-GAAP income finished at $674.1 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.59, in line with our guidance in more than 4x the prior year period. 
Before we cover our guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests and the strong performance of our base business, cash flow from operations was $552 million in the second quarter. These strong cash flows have given us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the second quarter alone, our operating cash flow essentially paid for $568 million of productive capital redeployment. Specifically, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of stock for $120 million, closed the SOMATEX deals for $63 million, acquired Biotheranostics for $232 million and bought Diagenode for $153 million. 
As Steve said, we believe these acquisitions will make Hologic a stronger company as the pandemic subsides and sets us up for faster growth. 
Overall, we had $816 million of cash at the end of the second quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.7x. We intend to continue to put our cash to work on a combination of division-led, tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom line growth rates. 
Finally, ROIC was 33.4% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 2,090 basis points. 
Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. While we anticipate that fiscal 2021 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall, COVID testing revenue remains highly unpredictable, so we are continuing our recent practice of providing a single quarter of guidance today. 
In our third quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of $1 billion to $1.07 billion, representing constant currency growth of 18% to 26% versus the prior year period. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2019, we generated about $850 million of revenue, which also included the divested Cynosure business, so we expect to grow above those prepandemic levels. 
In our base businesses, we expect continued momentum and recovery to generate very strong revenue growth rates compared to the prior year given the negative impact of the pandemic a year ago. In terms of COVID assay sales, the market remains unpredictable as discussed. While trends seem to be stabilizing today, the environment certainly could change again in May or June, depending on a number of factors, so we're going to be very cautious with our third quarter guidance and get back to our usual practice of providing conservative estimates that we have high visibility on. 
If demand exceeds our current expectations, we are poised to deliver for our customers. There's a lot we don't know, but what we do know is that our assays and systems are best-in-class, and that we have Panthers in all the right hospitals and labs. So we are confident that we will get more than our fair share of the ongoing demand. 
With this background, we expect sales of our COVID test to range from $200 million to $250 million in the third quarter. In addition, COVID-related items in Diagnostics such as collection kits, instruments and ancillaries, are expected to be down $40 million to $45 million sequentially. Our third quarter guidance includes about more than $20 million of revenue from SOMATEX, Biotheranostics and Diagenode. Backing this out, as well as $9 million of expected Blood Screening revenue, we expect organic revenue growth of 15% to 24% in the quarter. This is excellent growth against a difficult comp as we generated 324 million of COVID assay sales in the prior year period. 
Beyond revenue, here are a few other points on guidance. Our guidance does not include the impact of the pending Mobidiag acquisition, which is expected to close early in our fourth fiscal quarter. It does, however, include a full quarter of expenses from Biotheranostics and Diagenode, which will contribute to a sequential increase in total operating expenses. Below operating income, I would point out that we expect other expenses net to increase to about $25 million in the third quarter. Our guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of $261 million for the quarter. All these nets out to expected EPS of $1 to $1.15 in the third quarter. This would translate into very strong growth rates of 33% to 53% that significantly outpaced revenue, even as we increase investments for future growth. 
As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. 
Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic showed tremendous growth in the second quarter and posted results that met our guidance. We continue to make a huge impact on the pandemic and on women's health globally. Further, with organic investments in multiple acquisitions, I am confident that we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger, larger, faster-growing company. 
With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to 1 plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue.

I was wondering, as you look at the guidance for the upcoming quarter, how much of the sequential step down would you say is related to kind of burn down of inventory that's in the channel? 
And if you'll humor me, how are you thinking about longer-term demand for COVID testing given all the additional capacity that you're building?"

If we dimensionalize, we clearly see the inventory bleeding down, both in the tail -- really throughout last quarter, and we're assuming continuing to bleed down this quarter. The hard part for us, we kind of internally",518,"Yes, Jeff, it's a great question. If we dimensionalize, we clearly see the inventory bleeding down, both in the tail -- really throughout last quarter, and we're assuming continuing to bleed down this quarter. 
The hard part for us, we kind of internally use the toilet paper analogy, and I think people can understand this really easy. When households first went into COVID, they're ordering toilet paper from everywhere, right, and multiple brands and from multiple vendors. 
And what clearly happened here, and I don't think it's been as fully grasped in the outside world has been all of the vendors stockpiled as much supply as they could get from multiple vendors because we, of course, had people on allocation. So when you can't get enough when do you order and now they're bleeding through that. 
I think we look forward to the day where that's probably bled down and we're back to tests matching -- test chip matching test perform. I think as that comes, that would clearly probably be a little bit of upside. We're being a little cautious in how we're continuing to think about that bleed down. 
Looking forward to the second part of your question, you've been all over it. Look at everything. I think we still see this as a meaningful business for us in the future. And to put in perspective, the $200 million to $250 million that we've guided to for this quarter, while it looks like a big step down from where we've been, I would remind everybody on this call that is larger than our entire Molecular Diagnostics business ever was pre-COVID. So we're still looking at a big business, and that's why we're continuing to expand our production. 
And personally, I think we're going to see a pretty strong -- we're assuming right now after in the U.S., call it, June, July, August could be pretty solid. I think as things come down, people get up. But dollars to dots, next fall, you know what? People didn't get the flu this year. They didn't get sick as people start to get out again, there's going to be a lot of people getting sniffles, getting all kinds of stuff. And whether it's COVID or not, the fear of COVID is going to create an enduring demand. And by that point, all the peripheral vendors candidly will be gone. And it's going to be the big folks with the installed bases and the most automated basis that will prevail. 
And so I think we feel really good as we listen to all of our customers, they want the automated platforms. They're using up their nonautomated stuff just because they bought it, and they can't wait to really start just running Panthers in our tests. So I don't want to give you an exact number at this point because I think anybody that does is wildly speculating. So -- but I do think this is going to be a big sizable business for us, certainly well into our next fiscal year. But we're planning a little more cautiously near term."

I think as we start to shift out here, that will start to grow. 
Now it's also dependent on women going back for their health visits. And the one thing we have certainly seen, and I think this bodes well for the future quarters for us is while women's visits are still way down, there are still a lot of basically pent-up demand that should come back here over time, but it doesn't snap back immediately to 100%. A lot of the intercity clinics have been diverted to doing COVID testing as they start to get back up to speed. So in a weird way, I think it gives us more runway going forth, but probably slightly less than exciting in the near term on necessarily that base. We also have the ancillaries and some of the other stuff that are in those numbers."

But I still think there's going to be a strong need -- there will certainly be the multiplex opportunities out there. But we think there's going to also be a very strong need as we had continued to say through this year to confirm whether something is truly coven or not as all the broad test. So we believe, with our customer base, hospitals, especially key labs, everything else, that there is going to be a meaningful need to confirm whether people have COVID and using a true good molecular platform. 
Whereas, frankly, traditional flu, you haven't needed the levels of sensitivity and specificity. When it comes to COVID, people are still going to want that."

I think, clearly, the way we think about Diagenode is all about content on Panther. And particularly, a lot of the -- if you look at the European landscape, particularly too, there's a much broader base of menu needed over there. And we've been a little bit of a competitive disadvantage is why we started to work with Diagenode in the first place. So it's really filling out that menu with largely still a focus on our European business. 
And I think a totally underappreciated aspect of what's happened to this company in the last 12 months, I would argue, is the strength of our European and frankly, broader international business. We are a completely different player in Europe today when looked at by leading customers, leading governments, everything than where we were 12 months ago. We were barely known, and now we are front and center on so many discussions. So Diagenode is going to play there beautifully. 
And then for Mobidiag, we really see it, over time, especially getting into the acute care settings as a big, big opportunity. First, obviously, in Europe, where they've already got a little bit of a presence, but ultimately getting everything ported over and cleared here in the United States. That's probably going to be more of a 2024, 2025 massive growth drivers then. We're being a little conservative in terms of when we get all of that proof tier. But it's going to give us another chance to place a box, that's a different kind of box with different capabilities closer to the patient setting. So I think a really great technology.

First off, lab folks have been going on adrenaline for the last year trying to get -- there's been so much automated stuff they were dealing with. They all want to consolidate on an automated platform. We're even hearing out of Europe is from a number of customers just recently They just can't wait to get our Panthers fully up and running because they know they can run them after hours. They don't need to be handheld. They don't need people there. 
And so I think, as you really look at it, everybody is going to go to the best-performing most automated machines with the best menu. And I hate to say it, but we say it all the time, the cream rises to the top. It's hard to beat our Panther system and with our menu. And I still -- the number of governors that called us last year early on asking why they wanted more samples was because ""They kept touring their -- the labs in their states and the people kept saying, look, we need Panthers. We want Panthers, That's the one we want."" So I think as this all shakes out here in the coming months, that we will do what we've always done really well and continue to grow our menu and Panther and that volume, which, as you had seen, average revenues per Panther, we've had a tremendous track record over 7, 8, 9 years now. That number is just going to continue to go north."

So then we clearly saw it start to -- it kind of turned a little bit in Feb. I think March and April have really been a lot of inventory catch up. And I would argue that, that will shake itself out here probably pretty quickly, and then we'll be a good place. 
The longer-term contracts on the last part, it is why we feel really good about a lot of the approaches we've taken with our governments, particularly around the world, where we often sign folks up for 6-, 9-, 12-month contracts, where we guaranteed them supply. And as of right now, we've not -- you want to knock on wood, but every customer that we've sold into has continued to come back and wants to continue to work with us.

We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We posted excellent financial results overall, highlighted by best-in-class growth rates. Total revenue was $1.54 billion",2014,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We posted excellent financial results overall, highlighted by best-in-class growth rates. Total revenue was $1.54 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.59, both in line with our guidance. 
Organic revenue doubled, driven by strong recovery and momentum in our base businesses as well as our continued contributions to the COVID-19 fight. On the bottom line, EPS more than quadrupled. 
Our diversified business model again demonstrated its value in the second quarter as strong growth rates in our core businesses enabled us to meet our overall guidance even though COVID assay sales were less than expected. Our base Diagnostics business and our Surgical franchise, both finished slightly better than forecast, even while overcoming a tough January for U.S. health care utilization that was driven by increasing COVID cases. And our Breast Health division clearly outperformed as our diversification strategy has led to a faster-than-expected recovery. 
Karleen will cover the revenue and expense details. But before she does, I'd like to discuss 2 primary topics. When the COVID pandemic began more than a year ago, we set out to accomplish 2 things in simple terms: first, we committed to make as big an impact as possible against the pandemic; and second, we wanted to ensure that every action we took helped us emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company. We are clearly accomplishing both goals which makes us more excited than ever about our future. 
In terms of our first goal, helping fight the pandemic on a global scale. Let's summarize our contributions by focusing on 4 key numbers. Our first number is 100 million. Soon, we will ship our 100 millionth COVID test to customers, which included 27 million in the second quarter. At the same time, we have maintained our commitment to provide women's health test by dramatically increasing total molecular diagnostics production capacity. We are on track with our expansion plans in San Diego and Manchester, U.K. to have the capacity to make at least 75 million tests a quarter across our portfolio by January of 2022. 
Our second number is 40. This is the number of countries in which we've sold COVID tests as we help battle what has been and continues to be a global crisis. COVID testing continues to strengthen our international business, our relationships with customers, our future prospects in diagnostics and even market access for our other franchises. These COVID sales contributed to total international revenue of $474 million in the second quarter, which represented tremendous growth of 142%. 
Our third number is 717. This is the number of Panther instruments we have shipped to global customers over the last year, including about 190 in the second quarter. As a reminder, in the 5 years before COVID, we shipped an average of 225 Panthers a year. So we've more than tripled that pace over the last 12 months. In addition, we are encouraged that demand for Panthers remains very high. And for all of fiscal 2021, we expect to exceed last year's record placements. Overall, our global installed base now stands at roughly 2,600 instruments, approximately 40% higher than when the pandemic began, giving us a robust platform for future growth as more customers come to appreciate our system's best-in-class capabilities. And as we have discussed, we are seeing this play out with record levels of new non-COVID business on these Panthers. 
All these numbers lead to our fourth number, which is $2.35 billion. This is the total COVID assay revenue we have generated on a global basis since the pandemic began, including $680 million in the second quarter. And this has contributed very significantly to operating cash flow of nearly $1.9 billion over the last year. This has enabled us to acquire 4 companies and sign a deal for a fifth, even while further strengthening our balance sheet. We'll discuss our business development activity more in a minute. 
Before we do that, we wanted to provide our current perspective on the changes in the COVID testing market that you have all seen, with the understanding that the pandemic and its impact on Hologic remain highly unpredictable. 
Based on publicly available data for the U.S., molecular COVID testing volumes remain very high, much higher than for any other molecular test. But have declined significantly since January based on a better-than-expected vaccine rollout. In this context, our U.S. sales of COVID tests also declined significantly in March and further in April. We believe that molecular COVID testing demand will likely decline further as vaccines roll out, but remain important into fiscal '22 and beyond. This reflects the ongoing need for accurate clinical diagnosis, the value of testing for infection control purposes and the so-called back to life testing that is helping to reopen economies. 
In this environment, the combination of our huge Panther installed base at facilities close to the patient, and our gold-standard assay performance have us uniquely positioned to gain market share. Customers continue to tell us that Panther and Aptima remain their products of choice and that they intend to consolidate on our platforms. But we believe many of them are using up less automated assays before they expire. Customers had accumulated these tests in the winter when they needed multiple manufacturers to accommodate than higher levels of demand. This dynamic is further supported by the public AdvaMed data that many of you see, which show that industry-wide, tests performed are now running ahead of tests shipped, indicating that inventory is being worked down. 
In response to these market changes, we pivoted in 2 ways in the second quarter. First, by selling more COVID tests to our base hospital customers who want to bring highly accurate testing closer to their patients, improving turnaround times and clinical relevance. Panther is well positioned for this with first test results being delivered in about 3 hours. Notably, COVID tests are now being run on Panthers in more than 600 clinical labs in the United States. This means that COVID is the second most decentralized test that we sell, following only Aptima Combo 2, which has been on the U.S. market for roughly 20 years. 
Second, we pivoted by selling more tests internationally. As everyone has seen in the news, the vaccine rollout is proceeding at different paces around the world. Europe, in particular, has struggled with inoculations, increasing the importance of testing. For example, in the second quarter, almost 40% of our COVID assay revenue came from outside the United States, mainly from Europe. 
Now let's shift gears to our second major topic, an update on how the tremendous impact we've made against COVID has strengthened our business for the other side of the pandemic. As many of you will recall, before the pandemic hit, our organic growth rate had been steadily improving to around 5% based on new products international expansion and our early acquisitions. 
Now as we begin our annual strategic planning process, we are confident that organic growth for the next several years, excluding COVID assay sales, will be higher than it was before the pandemic hit. 
In Diagnostics, we've used COVID cash flows to broaden our portfolio by buying assets that are growing faster than our base business. Since the Gen-Probe acquisition in 2012, we had acquired exactly 0 companies in Diagnostics. But since late February, we have completed 2 deals and announced a third, dramatically accelerating our long-standing goal to become a more complete diversified diagnostics leader. 
In February, we closed our $232 million acquisition of Biotheranostics, a leader in molecular tests for breast and metastatic cancers, enabling us to expand into the adjacent growth market of oncology. This business is off to a very strong start, based mainly on the inclusion of the Breast Cancer Index test in NCCN guidelines to predict the benefit of extended treatment with endocrine therapies. 
A few days after that, we closed Biotheranostics. We -- I'm sorry, a few days after we closed Biotheranostics, we acquired Diagenode, a Belgian developer and manufacturer of molecular diagnostic assays and epigenetics products for approximately $153 million. Diagenode, which generated more than $30 million of revenue in the last year, will enable us to offer a broader, more differentiated menu of molecular diagnostic tests on our fully automated high-throughput Panther Fusion instrument. We know Diagenode's capabilities in assay development well, since we have partnered with them since 2016 to develop and manufacture PCR-based assays for Fusion. 
As you might recall, the ability to leverage external PCR expertise was one of the reasons we developed the Fusion system years ago. Now that Diagenode is part of Hologic, we can accelerate those assay development efforts and make many of their CE Mark PCR tests available on our unique platform, further enhancing European growth. 
Finally, earlier this month, we announced our agreement to acquire Mobidiag, a Finnish developer of innovative molecular diagnostics tests and instrumentation for approximately $795 million. In contrast to Diagenode, which helps us leverage our Fusion installed base around the world, Mobidiag brings new capabilities that we have been interested in for more than a decade. Specifically, Mobidiag is an innovator in near-patient acute care diagnostics, a large, rapidly growing area that we don't compete in today. This market encompasses test for respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions, health care-associated infections and antibiotic resistance among others. Having monitored this space closely over the years, we believe Mobidiag's Novodiag platform is a truly differentiated asset with a unique combination of ease of use, rapid turnaround, multiplexing and low cost. 
Mobidiag generated more than $40 million of revenue in calendar 2020 with a limited commercial presence and no sales in the United States. So we believe we can accelerate their growth globally, but especially in the United States once we get some of their assays approved here. 
Before I turn the call over to Karleen, I wanted to touch briefly on how we have also strengthened our Breast and Surgical businesses during the pandemic. 
In Breast, we have continued to expand on our strategy to diversify the business across the patient continuum of care. We now sell a full portfolio of capital equipment, hardware and software upgrades, interventional tools and service. While the world has been understandably focused on COVID, we have increased our direct presence with Breast Health customers. We have launched new software products based on our investments in artificial intelligence. And we have strengthened our interventional franchise by relaunching Brevera which is doing very well, and buying SOMATEX, a longtime partner and leading developer of breast cancer markers. Together, all these strategies helped Breast Health outperform in the second quarter with total sales exceeding 2019 levels and global growth of 7.3%. While the mammography market is not quite back to pre-COVID levels, we are very pleased with our competitive position and growth outlook for the future. 
In Surgical, both our R&D and business development pipelines have been productive. broadening the portfolio of products that we sell through a high-performing, highly-engaged sales force. 
New products such as our Fluent Fluid Management System, new hysteroscopes and Acessa's laparoscopic RF product, ProVu are complementing our market-leading MyoSure and NovaSure devices. As a result, Surgical sales surpassed 2019 levels in the second quarter and grew 6.6% on a global basis, even while overcoming a slow January that resulted from reduced procedures in U.S. regions that were hit hard by COVID. 
So in conclusion, I want to emphatically state that I have never been more excited or confident in our future. We have responded to the world's need for COVID testing in a remarkable fashion and will continue to be there for testing needs around the world. 
Even more importantly, we have literally strengthened every one of our businesses in every geography and added multiple new growth platforms to our company during the last 12 months. I am truly amazed at what our team has done, and we really look forward to the quarters and years ahead. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Karleen."
108544,710561117,2261605,"Hologic, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the third",1584,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to provide an overview of our divisional sales results, walk through our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. 
As Steve said, our second quarter results were excellent as revenue and EPS grew significantly compared to the prior year. Reported revenue of $1.54 billion increased 99%. Organically, revenue grew an even 100%, driven by strong growth in our base businesses and a healthy contribution from global COVID testing revenue. 
We met our top and bottom line guidance even as the COVID testing market changed rapidly late in the quarter. Based on our strong top line, we significantly improved profitability compared to the prior year. As a result, EPS of $2.59 more than quadrupled in the second quarter, increasing 354%. 
Further, operating cash flow has continued to be exceptionally strong, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, our largest division, global revenue of $1.065 billion grew 225% in the second quarter. This was driven by molecular where sales increased 378%. 
Although COVID testing declined sequentially from peak levels in the first quarter, demand was still very high. We shipped about 27 million COVID tests to customers, generating revenue of $680 million globally. Excluding COVID, our base molecular business continued to grow as customers capitalize on the breadth of our assay menu and the strength of Panther's best-in-class automation. Rounding out Diagnostics, the Cytology & Perinatal businesses grew 1% in the quarter, in line with trends before the pandemic. In Breast Health, global revenue of $336.3 million grew 7%, which we are very pleased with. 
Revenue also increased sequentially compared to Q1 and exceeded the second quarter of 2019 on a reported basis. The division's strong performance was well rounded as breast imaging grew 6%, driven by upgrade packages, and the interventional business increased 14%, driven by Brevera. Furthermore, Breast Health achieved growth in disposables, service and even capital versus the prior year period. Although the capital environment probably isn't fully back to normal, we have been encouraged by the continued improvement in this area as customers have learned to effectively manage through the pandemic and become more comfortable making future investments. 
In Surgical, second quarter revenue also exceeded 2019 levels, continuing the division's rapid recovery. Compared to the prior year, sales of $114.2 million grew 7% as elective procedure volumes strengthened throughout the quarter following a challenging January. The improving macro environment, coupled with multiple new products and a motivated sales force gives us confidence in the future trajectory of the Surgical franchise. 
Lastly, in Skeletal, revenue of $22.6 million declined 7% compared to the prior year. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $1.06 billion increased 85% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 87%. Outside the United States, sales of $474 million increased 142%. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 141%, a fantastic result that reflects our growing international strength. 
Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the second quarter. Gross margins of 75% increased 1,400 basis points driven by the sales of our high-margin COVID tests. Total operating expenses of $277.7 million increased 25% in the second quarter. This included about $1.3 million of credits from BARDA associated with the development of our COVID assays. This is about $5 million less than in Q1. 
The increase in our operating expenses was driven by investments in R&D and marketing for future growth as well as incremental expense from the acquisitions that Steve discussed. Also remember, that in the second quarter of 2020, we had begun to pull back on spending, given the initial uncertainty of the pandemic. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter is 21.2%, slightly lower than forecast, driven by a favorable geographic mix of income, primarily from sales of COVID-19 assays outside the United States. Putting these all together, operating margin increased 2,540 basis points to 56.9%, and net margin increased 2,380 basis points to 43.8%. 
As a result, non-GAAP income finished at $674.1 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.59, in line with our guidance and more than 4x the prior year period. 
Before we cover our guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by demand for our COVID tests and the strong performance of our base business, cash flow from operations was $552 million in the second quarter. These strong cash flows have given us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the second quarter alone, our operating cash flow essentially paid for $568 million of productive capital redeployment. Specifically, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of stock for $120 million, closed the SOMATEX deals for $63 million, acquired Biotheranostics for $232 million and bought Diagenode for $153 million. 
As Steve said, we believe these acquisitions will make Hologic a stronger company as the pandemic subsides and sets us up for faster growth. 
Overall, we had $816 million of cash at the end of the second quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.7x. We intend to continue to put our cash to work on a combination of division-led, tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom line growth rates. 
Finally, ROIC was 33.4% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 2,090 basis points. 
Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. While we anticipate that fiscal 2021 will be an excellent year for Hologic overall, COVID testing revenue remains highly unpredictable, so we are continuing our recent practice of providing a single quarter of guidance today. 
In our third quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of $1 billion to $1.07 billion, representing constant currency growth of 18% to 26% versus the prior year period. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2019, we generated about $850 million of revenue, which also included the divested Cynosure business, so we expect to grow above those prepandemic levels. 
In our base businesses, we expect continued momentum and recovery to generate very strong revenue growth rates compared to the prior year given the negative impact of the pandemic a year ago. In terms of COVID assay sales, the market remains unpredictable as discussed. While trends seem to be stabilizing today, the environment certainly could change again in May or June, depending on a number of factors, so we're going to be very cautious with our third quarter guidance and get back to our usual practice of providing conservative estimates that we have high visibility on. 
If demand exceeds our current expectations, we are poised to deliver for our customers. There's a lot we don't know, but what we do know is that our assays and systems are best-in-class, and that we have Panthers in all the right hospitals and labs. So we are confident that we will get more than our fair share of the ongoing demand. 
With this background, we expect sales of our COVID test to range from $200 million to $250 million in the third quarter. In addition, COVID-related items in Diagnostics such as collection kits, instruments and ancillaries, are expected to be down $40 million to $45 million sequentially. Our third quarter guidance includes about more than $20 million of revenue from SOMATEX, Biotheranostics and Diagenode. Backing this out, as well as $9 million of expected Blood Screening revenue, we expect organic revenue growth of 15% to 24% in the quarter. This is excellent growth against a difficult comp as we generated 324 million of COVID assay sales in the prior year period. 
Beyond revenue, here are a few other points on guidance. Our guidance does not include the impact of the pending Mobidiag acquisition, which is expected to close early in our fourth fiscal quarter. It does, however, include a full quarter of expenses from Biotheranostics and Diagenode, which will contribute to a sequential increase in total operating expenses. Below operating income, I would point out that we expect other expenses net to increase to about $25 million in the third quarter. Our guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of 261 million for the quarter. All this nets out to expected EPS of $1 to $1.15 in the third quarter. This would translate into very strong growth rates of 33% to 53% that significantly outpaced revenue, even as we increase investments for future growth. 
As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. 
Before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic showed tremendous growth in the second quarter and posted results that met our guidance. We continue to make a huge impact on the pandemic and on women's health globally. Further, with organic investments and multiple acquisitions, I am confident that we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger, larger, faster-growing company. 
With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to 1 plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue.

If we dimensionalize, we clearly see the inventory bleeding down, both in the tail -- really throughout last quarter, and we're assuming continuing to bleed down this quarter. The hard part for us, we kind of internally",518,"Yes, Jeff, it's a great question. If we dimensionalize, we clearly see the inventory bleeding down, both in the tail -- really throughout last quarter, and we're assuming continuing to bleed down this quarter. 
The hard part for us, we kind of internally use the toilet paper analogy, and I think people can understand this really easy. When households first went into COVID, they're ordering toilet paper from everywhere, right, and multiple brands and from multiple vendors. 
And what clearly happened here, and I don't think it's been as fully grasped in the outside world has been all of the vendors stockpiled as much supply as they could get from multiple vendors because we, of course, had people on allocation. So when you can't get enough what do you? You order and now they're bleeding through that. 
I think we look forward to the day where that's probably bled down and we're back to tests matching -- test chip matching test perform. I think as that comes, that would clearly probably be a little bit of upside. We're being a little cautious in how we're continuing to think about that bleed down. 
Looking forward to the second part of your question, you've been all over it. Look at everything. I think we still see this as a meaningful business for us in the future. And to put in perspective, the $200 million to $250 million that we've guided to for this quarter, while it looks like a big step down from where we've been, I would remind everybody on this call that is larger than our entire Molecular Diagnostics business ever was pre-COVID. So we're still looking at a big business, and that's why we're continuing to expand our production. 
And personally, I think we're going to see a pretty strong -- we're assuming right now in the U.S., call it, June, July, August could be pretty solid. I think as things come down, people get up. But dollars to dots, next fall, you know what? People didn't get the flu this year. They didn't get sick as people start to get out again, there's going to be a lot of people getting sniffles, getting all kinds of stuff. And whether it's COVID or not, the fear of COVID is going to create an enduring demand. And by that point, all the peripheral vendors candidly will be gone. And it's going to be the big folks with the installed bases and the most automated basis that will prevail. 
And so I think we feel really good as we listen to all of our customers, they want the automated platforms. They're using up their nonautomated stuff just because they bought it, and they can't wait to really start just running Panthers in our tests. So I don't want to give you an exact number at this point because I think anybody that does is wildly speculating. So -- but I do think this is going to be a big sizable business for us, certainly well into our next fiscal year. But we're planning a little more cautiously near term."

Last year, if you recall, in Europe, our Diagnostic -- our Molecular Diagnostics business grew, I think, well over 30% in the quarter. We had actually a monster quarter last year when we reported at this time, so we had a big number. The other piece, candidly, is we're watching the toggle and the shift. So still a huge part of the volume is being used for COVID. I think as we start to shift out here, that will start to grow. 
Now it's also dependent on women going back for their health visits. And the one thing we have certainly seen, and I think this bodes well for the future quarters for us is well women's visits are still way down, there are still a lot of basically pent-up demand that should come back here over time, but it doesn't snap back immediately to 100%. A lot of the intercity clinics have been diverted to doing COVID testing as they start to get back up to speed. So in a weird way, I think it gives us more runway going forth, but probably slightly less than exciting in the near term on necessarily that base. We also have the ancillaries and some of the other stuff that are in those numbers."

Whereas, frankly, traditional flu, you haven't needed the levels of sensitivity and specificity. When it comes to COVID, people are still going to want that."

So it's really filling out that menu with largely still a focus on our European business. 
And I think a totally underappreciated aspect of what's happened to this company in the last 12 months, I would argue, is the strength of our European and frankly, broader international business. We are a completely different player in Europe today when looked at by leading customers, leading governments, everything than where we were 12 months ago. We were barely known, and now we are front and center on so many discussions. So Diagenode is going to play there beautifully. 
And then for Mobidiag, we really see it, over time, especially getting into the acute care settings as a big, big opportunity. First, obviously, in Europe, where they've already got a little bit of a presence, but ultimately getting everything ported over and cleared here in the United States. That's probably going to be more of a 2024, 2025 massive growth drivers then. We're being a little conservative in terms of when we get all of that proof tier. But it's going to give us another chance to place a box, that's a different kind of box with different capabilities closer to the patient setting. So I think a really great technology.

They all want to consolidate on an automated platform. We're even hearing out of Europe is from a number of customers just recently they just can't wait to get our Panthers fully up and running because they know they can run them after hours. They don't need to be handheld. They don't need people there. 
And so I think, as you really look at it, everybody is going to go to the best-performing most automated machines with the best menu. And I hate to say it, but we say it all the time, the cream rises to the top. It's hard to beat our Panther system and with our menu. And I still -- the number of governors that called us last year early on asking why they wanted more samples was because ""They kept touring their labs in their states and the people kept saying, look, we need Panthers. We want Panthers, That's the one we want."" So I think as this all shakes out here in the coming months, that we will do what we've always done really well and continue to grow our menu and Panther and that volume, which, as you had seen, average revenues per Panther, we've had a tremendous track record over 7, 8, 9 years now.

So at the time we were sitting here giving our guidance, think about it, only 90 days ago, vaccines were just barely beginning. We were just transitioning from 1 President to another, vaccines were in the very early days and the post-holiday testing was spiking. 
So then we clearly saw it start to -- it kind of turned a little bit in Feb. I think March and April have really been a lot of inventory catch up. And I would argue that, that will shake itself out here probably pretty quickly, and then we'll be to a good place. 
The longer-term contracts on the last part, it is why we feel really good about a lot of the approaches we've taken with our governments, particularly around the world, where we often sign folks up for 6-, 9-, 12-month contracts, where we guaranteed them supply. And as of right now, we've not -- you want to knock on wood, but every customer that we've sold into has continued to come back and wants to continue to work with us.

But clearly, as you know, for years, we were kind of in that 3- to 4-ish range. We were moving it up into that 5 range. And I think as we look at what we've been able to do both organically, but really strengthened -- the acquisitions we've been able to do put us a lot better off than if COVID hadn't hit, right? We probably wouldn't have bought Mobidiag, Biotheranostics, all of these things, all of which should be accretive to that growth rate. So do we see us moving a little north of that 5%? Yes. Are we ready to commit to an exact range? We have our June Board meeting where we will be looking at our strat plan with our Board. 
But I can just tell you the early roll-ups, I think we look at every business being able to be at least mid-single, if not moving into the higher single digit and particularly with our international business. 
Now on a completely different footing than it ever was, we think we'll be able to really drive all of our franchises stronger outside the U.S. So I think it puts us clearly north of 5, which I think is a very meaningful step-up for this company. It's not something we've had from a sustained growth, and I think that should not be lost. And I'm glad you asked about it."

But I think as more and more people have had bad experiences candidly with rapid tests. And I think all of us know a number of people who have had false results. I think the dynamic is going to play out where there's going to be less testing -- less people racing out to need the immediate test and to try to get something super quick. 
And as you move into a vaccinated world and more of an ongoing monitoring where a few hours isn't going to make a difference, I think it's going to revolve much more towards most diagnostic testing, which is you want to use the most sensitive and most specific tests. We just think that's going to ultimately prevail and that a lot of the euphoria and urgency and design -- even some of these people calling for -- everybody would be taking a test every day, dah, dah, dah, you know what, it's just we don't see it that way. 
Ultimately, the market will decide and you can come back and slap us upside our heads if we're wrong. But I think we see it playing out as a more traditional market over time where it goes to our advantage."

We're pleased to discuss our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We posted excellent results overall driven by a strong rebound in our base businesses and continued contributions to fight the ongoing COVID pandemic.
Total revenue was $1.17 billion, up 38%, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.33, up 77%. We significantly exceeded our guidance on both the top and bottom lines. Our revenue outperformance was broad-based in the quarter. Our breast and Surgical divisions both grew substantially versus the prior year period when results were negatively affected by the pandemic. And importantly, both businesses also grew compared to the same period of 2019. Our Diagnostics division grew about 20% compared to last year despite lower sales of COVID tests and increased compared to 2019 as well.
Karleen will review our full financial results today. But before she does, I want to take a step back and provide some perspective on where Hologic is headed over the longer term, as many of you have requested. As mentioned in our last call, we have been working through our annual strategic planning process. And based on this, I've never been more excited about our future and the global impact we are making by pursuing our purpose, passion and promise. We know this is important to all our investors and especially those focused on ESG priorities.
Hologic is clearly emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic as a stronger faster-growing company. We have a much higher profile on the global stage, which has helped create a stronger and more durable foundation to accelerate our international growth. And we have placed hundreds of new Panther instruments, which is boosting our razor-razorblade business model.
From a financial perspective, we have generated more than $2.5 billion of operating cash in just the last 5 quarters. During this time, we have used about $1.35 billion to buy 6 companies and about $510 million to buy back our own stock. In Diagnostics alone, we have added 2 new growth platforms in Biotheranostics and Mobidiag and substantially increased our assay development capabilities with Diagenode.
Based on all this progress, we are now targeting organic revenue growth rates of between 5% and 7% in our base businesses between now and 2025. This excludes sales of COVID assays and related ancillaries, which we expect to decline over our strat plan horizon.
Now we'd like to discuss how we expect this to play out in our 3 divisions. This is more detailed than we'd typically provide in the quarterly call, but it's important to underpin the enthusiasm we have for our future.
First, in Diagnostics. We are diversifying our customer base, installing more Panther instruments, continuously adding new assay menu and driving testing demand. Our foundation in diagnostics remains rock-solid with leading U.S. market positions for our ThinPrep pap test and our key women's health assays on the Panther instrument, namely chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV and Trichomonas.
As leaders in these categories, we have built strong partnerships with many of our largest lab customers that enable us to educate physicians about testing guidelines issued by groups like the CDC. Just last week, in fact, the CDC posted new recommendations that are very positive for public health and for our business. So while our market shares are already very high, we are driving growth by expanding addressable markets.
In addition, we have developed related women's health tests that are often performed from the same patient sample, such as our vaginosis panel and our test for mycoplasma genitalium. Finally, we see significant opportunities to increase sales of other products where our market shares are much lower today.
Our response to the COVID pandemic has unquestionably enabled us to accelerate these growth strategies. We have grown from a successful niche player in STI testing into a much more diversified industry leader with a broader customer base. We have done this by dramatically increasing placements of Panther instruments. Since the start of the pandemic, we have increased our global installed base by more than 50% or in real numbers, by almost 1,000 Panthers. We now have about 1,500 Panthers in the United States and more than 1,200 in other countries. And we are well diversified across customer sizes and types.
And as COVID testing wanes, customers are beginning to use these instruments to run more non-COVID assays. This is a significant opportunity because today, about half our customers from the largest reference labs to smaller hospitals run 3 tests or fewer on their Panther instruments, even though we now have 19 total assays available. We are capitalizing on this opportunity by signing up record levels of new business, as reflected in the test of record, or TORs, metric that we have discussed.
Pre-COVID, our best year for TORs was a little more than $20 million. Last fiscal year, we set a new record with about $35 million of new business, and we are on track to comfortably exceed that number in 2021. Outside the United States where Hologic Diagnostics has been less well known historically, COVID has materially elevated our profile. Since the pandemic began, about 1/3 of our COVID assay sales have been generated internationally. And the relationships we have established will help us win business and drive future growth.
Finally, the strong cash flow we've generated from COVID sales has enabled us to complete 3 recent acquisitions in Diagnostics that together are expected to contribute more than $100 million of annual revenue as well as providing new growth platforms that increase our top line growth rate.
First, Biotheranostics enables us to enter the lab-based oncology space, a long-time area of interest that has been growing rapidly. Biotheranostics is off to an excellent start with about $13 million of revenue in the third quarter, more than 30% higher than their best quarter prior to the pandemic.
Second, Diagenode will help us add PCR-based menu to our Panther Fusion instrument both in Europe and in the United States.
And third, the acquisition of Mobidiag enables us to enter the rapidly growing market for acute care near-patient testing, which we have been monitoring for years. We believe the Novodiag instrument provides the right combination of ease of use, rapid turnaround and low manufacturing cost to expand into smaller hospitals and create a multi-hundred million-dollar product line over time.
Now let's shift gears and discuss our breast and Skeletal Health division, where revenue growth is becoming more diversified, more recurring, more global and more consistent than ever before. Similar to Diagnostics, our strategic plan is built on a foundation of strength. We are the leaders in breast health based on a long history of innovation, partnership with customers and focus across the continuum of breast care. Our strategy is built around the innovative market-leading Genius 3D mammography platform.
Like all our key products, our Genius exams make a real difference in women's lives. They detect more dangerous cancers while reducing unnecessary callbacks. A few years ago, many investor questions focused on whether we could overcome the 3D cliff that was thought to be inevitable once the market converted to 3D. We don't get that question much anymore because we have leveraged our leadership in 3D to create a much more diversified business with more consistent, steady revenue growth. In fact, in the third quarter, U.S. gantry sales represented less than 20% of global breast health revenue.
We have accomplished this in 4 ways. First, we have expanded our service business. If we think of breast health service as a single product, it would be the company's second largest with more than $500 million of global revenue over the last 4 quarters. While we don't expect this to grow dramatically over our strategic planning horizon, service will continue to underpin our financial results and be the cornerstone of the tight relationships we have with our customers.
Second, we have beefed up our R&D capabilities beyond our traditional focus on X-ray imaging. We have developed new software packages like Clarity HD, which provides the industry's fastest, highest-resolution images. We have introduced new tools like Genius AI detection, a deep learning-based software that helps radiologists detect subtle potential cancers. And we pioneered Brevera to fully integrate the biopsy procedure with specimen radiography for the first time. Brevera alone is now generating about $40 million of annual revenue, and we expect all these new products to drive growth over our strat plan horizon.
Third, we have acquired 4 companies since 2018 to broaden our product portfolio, expand across the continuum of breast health care and become the partner of choice for all a customers' breast health needs. These acquisitions include Faxitron, which bolstered our offerings in specimen radiography; and Focal, which moved us further into breast-conserving surgery; and SuperSonic Imagine, which strengthened our position in ultrasound; and Somatex, which increased innovation in breast biopsy markers. In aggregate, these deals are now adding about $90 million annually to breast health revenue and are important contributors to growth in our strategic plan.
And fourth, we are expanding internationally in breast health. Our focus is to continue gaining market share with our existing 3D and upgradable 2D mammography products, the same products that have established leadership positions in the United States. We are also bringing the new products I've discussed both internally developed and acquired 2 additional countries. And we've purchased distributors in Germany, Spain and other markets to get closer to customers and secure more service revenue.
Now let's turn to our guidance Surgical division. Surgical was our fastest-growing division before the pandemic, and our strategic plan assumes that Surgical will continue its momentum through 2025. We have a unique opportunity to leverage our strength in the OB/GYN channel to provide differentiated solutions throughout women's lives.
While today, our products mainly help middle-aged women, in the future, we plan to have a stronger presence among mothers-to-be and older women as we expand our offerings within the hysteroscopic, laparoscopic and pelvic health markets.
Within Surgical, MyoSure remains the world's leading hysteroscopic product to remove smaller, less complicated fibroids. Since July is Fibroid Awareness Month, you've probably seen many articles describing the huge number of women who are affected by fibroids and the way they often suffer in silence or undergo invasive procedures, such as hysterectomies. It's clear that this market remains large and underpenetrated and that after many years of exceptional growth, MyoSure still has plenty of room to run.
We are also very excited about Acessa, which we acquired in 2020, and its laparoscopic fibroid treatment system. Acessa is a perfect complement to MyoSure as the system is used to treat larger, more complicated fibroids that MyoSure can't reach. Importantly, the same OB/GYNs who rely on MyoSure have the potential to use Acessa, so it's a great fit for our sales force.
We recently received 2 pieces of good news on Acessa: that it's now included in ACOG's updated fibroid management guidance and Cigna's list of medically necessary procedures. These are important milestones on our road to creating another $100 million-plus surgical brand alongside MyoSure and NovaSure.
Another reason we feel confident in Surgical's future is the revitalization of our R&D pipeline. A few years ago, the division was basically a 2-product show. Today, however, we sell multiple versions of these products as well as new fluid management system, hysteroscopes and other GYN surgical tools. and we have a robust pipeline of new products in development.
Finally, based on the strengthening of our global commercial capabilities, we now have many opportunities to deliver our less invasive surgical solutions to women around the world since less than 20% of the division's revenue is generated outside the United States today.
Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me wrap up by saying that, to me, Hologic looks like a fundamentally different company today than just 18 months ago before the pandemic. We have 3 franchises growing faster than they ever have. We are growing in all major regions of the world. We have added multiple new growth drivers in all our divisions. And with our COVID test, we have a significant new product line to provide upside to a strong base. Taken together, we are excited for the future and confident that we will grow our base non-COVID business between 5% and 7% over the next several years.
Now let me hand the call over to Karleen."

As Steve said, our third quarter results exceeded expectations as revenue and EPS grew significantly compared to the prior year. Revenue of $1.17 billion increased 38%. Organically, revenue grew 34% driven by continued sequential improvement in our base businesses and a meaningful contribution from global COVID testing revenue. We exceeded our top and bottom line guidance with upside in both our base and COVID.
We also significantly improved profitability compared to the prior year period. As a result, EPS of $1.33 in the third quarter increased 77%. Further, operating cash flow remained robust, allowing us to execute on our capital allocation strategy, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. Providing a more complete picture of our performance, I will often compare our results to the third quarters of both 2020 and 2019.
In Diagnostics, global revenue of $665.5 million grew an impressive 20% compared to the prior year period based on higher-than-expected COVID sales and the strength of our core molecular franchise. Within Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics increased 11.9% globally as massive growth internationally more than offset the decline in U.S. COVID sales.
Although COVID testing revenue declined, it still exceeded our most recent guidance. Specifically, we shipped about 14 million COVID tests to customers, generating assay revenue of $291 million globally. About 2/3 of COVID assay revenues generated outside the United States in the quarter, reflecting the broader global footprint that Steve discussed.
To better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID businesses, let me remind you that the pandemic has also increased sales of collection kits, instruments and ancillaries that are used with our COVID test. Backing this revenue out of the current and prior year period provides a better picture of true underlying trends. If we do this, we see that base molecular revenue in total Diagnostics sales grew about 76% organically in the third quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2019, molecular grew in the mid-teens and total Diagnostics grew mid-single digits.
Rounding out Diagnostics, our Cytology & Perinatal businesses grew 75% compared to the prior year. But compared to 2019, these businesses were still slightly behind their pre-pandemic levels.
In breast health, global revenue of $349 million grew 53% and exceptional results as the franchise continues to gain momentum. As evidence of this, revenue has now increased sequentially and compared to 2019 for the last 3 quarters. The division's strong performance remains well rounded, reflecting our commitment to diversifying revenue streams, as Steve discussed.
Both breast imaging and the interventional businesses increased compared to the prior year period, with imaging growing 43% and interventional increasing 120%. Although we remain encouraged by continued improvement in the capital environment, capital is still not quite back to the 2019 levels. However, breast screening rates continue to improve. And with a healthy backlog, we are encouraged about continued recovery over the next few quarters.
In Surgical, third quarter revenue of $127.9 million grew 143% while also exceeding 2019 levels by low double digits. Surgical's strong performance has been driven by normalizing procedure volumes, MyoSure and new products in the hands of our exceptional sales force.
Lastly, in Skeletal, revenue of $25.9 million increased 66% compared to the prior year period and was also up low single digits compared to 2019. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $749.9 million increased almost 14%. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 10%. Outside the United States, sales of $418.4 million increased 130% -- 137%. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 131%, a tremendous result.
Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 66.1% increased 140 basis points driven by volume recovery in our base businesses and a nice contribution from sales of our COVID test.
Continuing down the P&L. Total operating expenses of $310.1 million increased 19% in the third quarter. Excluding expenses from our recent acquisitions, operating expenses would have increased about 11% as we reinvested for future growth with incremental spending in R&D and marketing. In addition, remember that given uncertainties associated with the pandemic, we cut back on spending in our third quarter of 2020.
Our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.5% driven by a favorable geographic income mix, mainly sales of COVID tests outside the United States. Putting this all together, operating margin increased 650 basis points to 39.5%, and net margin increased 580 basis points to 29.5%. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $344.8 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.33, exceeding the top end of our guidance.
Before we cover our fourth quarter guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by our strong performance of our base businesses as well as the contribution from COVID testing, cash flow from operations was $663 million in the third quarter. This was nearly double our non-GAAP net income, highlighting excellent cash conversion. These strong cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility.
For example, in the third quarter, we closed the acquisition of Mobidiag for an enterprise value of $808 million and also repurchased 3 million shares of our stock for $188 million.
Overall, we had $828 million of cash at the end of the third quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.7x. We intend to continue using our cash on divisional-led tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom line growth rates. Finally, ROIC was 34.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 2,190 basis points.
Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and provide a few comments on longer-term targets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of $1 billion to $1.04 billion, representing constant currency decline of 27% to 24% versus the prior year period, which benefited from huge COVID assay sales. For perspective, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we generated less than $800 million of revenue, excluding the divested Cynosure business. So we expect to grow significantly above pre-pandemic levels.
In our base businesses, we expect continued momentum and recovery to generate very strong growth rates compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 given the negative impact of the pandemic a year ago. And we expect this franchise to grow nicely compared to 2019 as well.
In terms of COVID assay sales, the U.S. testing market continues to decline. As we forecasted last quarter, we expect this trend to continue as more people are vaccinated. In addition, summer vacations may further reduce demand domestically and in Europe. With these factors in mind, we expect COVID assay sales to range from $150 million to $170 million in the fourth quarter. In addition, COVID-related items in diagnostics are expected to be approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter, down roughly $20 million sequentially. If new variants drive demand that exceeds our current expectations, we are well prepared to deliver for our customers and generate upside to our estimates.
Our fourth quarter guidance includes approximately $35 million of acquired revenue from Mobidiag, Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Acessa. Backing this out as well as $9 million of expected blood screening revenue, we expect organic revenue to decline 30% to 27%. But excluding COVID assay sales and related revenue, we forecast organic revenue to grow low to mid-teens in the fourth quarter.
Below operating income, I would point out that we expect other expenses net to increase to about $25 million in the fourth quarter. Our guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of 260 million for the quarter. All of this nets out to expected EPS of $0.92 to $1 in the fourth quarter. Given the outsized impact of COVID assay sales in the prior year period, this translates to a decline of 56% to 52%.
As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides.
Before we open up the call for questions, let me touch on a few longer-term items. As Steve discussed, based on our recent strategic planning process, we are confident that organic revenue can grow 5% to 7% through our fiscal 2025, excluding sales of COVID assays as well as the related ancillaries and instruments.
Many of you have also asked for our perspective on COVID assay sales next year. And the shortest, most accurate answer is we don't know, no one does, given the uncertainty -- significant uncertainties that still exist and that seemingly change on a weekly basis. Having said that, we do understand your desire for some kind of framework.
Toward that end, we believe that given the scope of the ongoing pandemic and our broad global installed base of Panther instruments, it's unlikely that COVID assays revenue will be much less than $200 million next year, which would make COVID one of our biggest molecular assays. It's certainly possible that sales could be more than that, maybe as much as double. But we are going to be conservative at this stage and consider anything above $200 million potential upside. We would encourage you to do the same and focus instead on the strong underlying growth rates in our base businesses that Steve discussed.
Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic showed tremendous growth in the third quarter with results that exceeded guidance. We continue to make a huge impact on helped globally and are meeting COVID tested needs as the pandemic evolves. Further, with organic investments in multiple acquisitions, we are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger company with top line growth rates of 5% to 7% excluding COVID impacts.
With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for the first question."

The other piece is -- and you're right, there's a lot of systems out there now. The simple -- my super simple way is the common sense talk to the customer approach. And I think you've been out there with enough of the labs as well to hear what is going to be important on an ongoing basis is the most highly automated instruments that provide the best level of tests. And it's what has led us to really the unbelievable market shares that we have in virtually all of our businesses.
But when you look at Panther, the automated platform, the incredible automation and particularly, as labs start to look to the future, where labor is going to be tougher and tougher to come by. And so what we continue to hear is Panther is where they want to consolidate. And in the early days of COVID, everybody went everywhere and got every machine and every test that they could get, and some are still bleeding off inventories from some of those. We just keep hearing over and over, the lab techs, especially, that are still running out inventory of other people's stuff, they want to consolidate on Panther. And I think we've got a multiyear long-term track record of delivering on that. This is not a pie in the sky, hey, we just placed a bunch of Panthers in the last 15 months and think this is going to happen. It's what we've been doing for 6 or 7 years pre-Panther, which is we place more Panthers every year. As our customers get used to them, they want to put more and more stuff on them.
So I think it's going to really help us emerge. All automated platforms are not the same. All boxes are not the same. Panther has established itself in the high-volume space, high throughput space for a good reason."

So I think we see some opportunity to immediately inject even additional life into that.
And I think beyond that, I think as we said in the script, we do see this becoming a multi-hundred million-dollar business over time. That's probably closer to the end of that -- the end of the strat plan horizon to -- particularly, we've really got to get into the U.S. to really get that -- those numbers."

So I think what's been need is, particularly each of those 3 companies, the employees of each of those companies, I think, have genuinely been excited to be a part of a company that's got our purpose, passion, promise. And it's not just a big old American company focused only on profit, but we've actually got a much bigger purpose.

And back to your first piece on the CDC, we feel really good about these new guidelines. And specifically, while it leaves it up to regional, we've got a couple of things going for us. First off, our own Diagnostics sales team that calls on physicians and helps to educate them. But really, more importantly, you're going from effectively an opt-in to an opt-out system. So there have been so many women who should be having these tests done on a routine visits that have really had to be opted in, and now the default should go the other way.
So is that going to affect this coming quarter? Probably not. Will it significantly expand the market here in the coming years? We think so. And we think it's a great move for human health because a lot of the young women when they're -- if they're at the doctor's office and they're with their mom and the doctors asking questions about are they sexually active to decide, do I give this test or not? And therefore, okay, wait. The kid has to answer yes to get the test written.

With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through August 27. 
Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. 
Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested Blood Screening business as well as year 1 revenue from acquired businesses: currently, Acessa, Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Mobidiag. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss today will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.

We're pleased to discuss our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We posted excellent results overall driven by a strong rebound in our base businesses and continued contributions to fight the ongoing COVID pandemic. Total revenue was $1.17 billion, up 38%. And non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.33, up 77%. We significantly exceeded our guidance on both the top and bottom lines. 
Our revenue outperformance was broad-based in the quarter. Our breast and Surgical divisions both grew substantially versus the prior year period when results were negatively affected by the pandemic. And importantly, both businesses also grew compared to the same period of 2019. Our Diagnostics division grew about 20% compared to last year despite lower sales of COVID tests and increased compared to 2019 as well. 
Karleen will review our full financial results today, but before she does, I want to take a step back and provide some perspective on where Hologic is headed over the longer term, as many of you have requested. As mentioned in our last call, we have been working through our annual strategic planning process. And based on this, I've never been more excited about our future and the global impact we are making by pursuing our purpose, passion and promise. We know this is important to all our investors and especially those focused on ESG priorities. 
Hologic is clearly emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic as a stronger faster-growing company. We have a much higher profile on the global stage, which has helped create a stronger and more durable foundation to accelerate our international growth. And we have placed hundreds of new Panther instruments, which is boosting our razor-razorblade business model. 
From a financial perspective, we have generated more than $2.5 billion of operating cash in just the last 5 quarters. During this time, we have used about $1.35 billion to buy 6 companies and about $510 million to buy back our own stock. In Diagnostics alone, we have added 2 new growth platforms in Biotheranostics and Mobidiag and substantially increased our assay development capabilities with Diagenode. 
Based on all this progress, we are now targeting organic revenue growth rates of between 5% and 7% in our base businesses between now and 2025. This excludes sales of COVID assays and related ancillaries, which we expect to decline over our strat plan horizon. 
Now we'd like to discuss how we expect this to play out in our 3 divisions. This is more detailed than we'd typically provide in the quarterly call, but it's important to underpin the enthusiasm we have for our future. 
First, in Diagnostics. We are diversifying our customer base, installing more Panther instruments, continuously adding new assay menu and driving testing demand. Our foundation in diagnostics remains rock-solid with leading U.S. market positions for our ThinPrep pap test and our key women's health assays on the Panther instrument, namely chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV and Trichomonas. As leaders in these categories, we have built strong partnerships with many of our largest lab customers that enable us to educate physicians about testing guidelines issued by groups like the CDC. 
Just last week, in fact, the CDC posted new recommendations that are very positive for public health and for our business. So while our market shares are already very high, we are driving growth by expanding addressable markets. 
In addition, we have developed related women's health tests that are often performed from the same patient sample, such as our vaginosis panel and our test for Mycoplasma genitalium. Finally, we see significant opportunities to increase sales of other products where our market shares are much lower today.
Our response to the COVID pandemic has unquestionably enabled us to accelerate these growth strategies. We have grown from a successful niche player in STI testing into a much more diversified industry leader with a broader customer base. We have done this by dramatically increasing placements of Panther instruments. Since the start of the pandemic, we have increased our global installed base by more than 50% or in real numbers, by almost 1,000 Panthers. We now have about 1,500 Panthers in the United States and more than 1,200 in other countries. And we are well diversified across customer sizes and types.
And as COVID testing wanes, customers are beginning to use these instruments to run more non-COVID assays. This is a significant opportunity because today, about half our customers from the largest reference labs to smaller hospitals run 3 tests or fewer on their Panther instruments, even though we now have 19 total assays available. We are capitalizing on this opportunity by signing up record levels of new business, as reflected in the test of record, or TORs, metric that we have discussed.
Pre-COVID, our best year for TORs was a little more than $20 million. Last fiscal year, we set a new record with about $35 million of new business, and we are on track to comfortably exceed that number in 2021. Outside the United States where Hologic Diagnostics has been less well known historically, COVID has materially elevated our profile. Since the pandemic began, about 1/3 of our COVID assay sales have been generated internationally. And the relationships we have established will help us win business and drive future growth.
Finally, the strong cash flow we've generated from COVID sales has enabled us to complete 3 recent acquisitions in Diagnostics that together are expected to contribute more than $100 million of annual revenue as well as providing new growth platforms that increase our top line growth rate.
First, Biotheranostics enables us to enter the lab-based oncology space, a long-time area of interest that has been growing rapidly. Biotheranostics is off to an excellent start with about $13 million of revenue in the third quarter, more than 30% higher than their best quarter prior to the pandemic.
Second, Diagenode will help us add PCR-based menu to our Panther Fusion instrument both in Europe and in the United States.
And third, the acquisition of Mobidiag enables us to enter the rapidly growing market for acute care near-patient testing, which we have been monitoring for years. We believe the Novodiag instrument provides the right combination of ease of use, rapid turnaround and low manufacturing cost to expand into smaller hospitals and create a multi-hundred million-dollar product line over time.
Now let's shift gears and discuss our Breast & Skeletal Health division, where revenue growth is becoming more diversified, more recurring, more global and more consistent than ever before. Similar to Diagnostics, our strategic plan is built on a foundation of strength. We are the leaders in breast health based on a long history of innovation, partnership with customers and focus across the continuum of breast care. Our strategy is built around the innovative market-leading Genius 3D Mammography platform.
Like all our key products, our Genius exams make a real difference in women's lives. They detect more dangerous cancers while reducing unnecessary callbacks. A few years ago, many investor questions focused on whether we could overcome the 3D cliff that was thought to be inevitable once the market converted to 3D. We don't get that question much anymore because we have leveraged our leadership in 3D to create a much more diversified business with more consistent, steady revenue growth. In fact, in the third quarter, U.S. gantry sales represented less than 20% of global breast health revenue.
We have accomplished this in 4 ways. First, we have expanded our service business. If we think of breast health service as a single product, it would be the company's second largest with more than $500 million of global revenue over the last 4 quarters. While we don't expect this to grow dramatically over our strategic planning horizon, service will continue to underpin our financial results and be the cornerstone of the tight relationships we have with our customers.
Second, we have beefed up our R&D capabilities beyond our traditional focus on X-ray imaging. We have developed new software packages like Clarity HD, which provides the industry's fastest, highest-resolution images. We have introduced new tools like Genius AI detection, a deep learning-based software that helps radiologists detect subtle potential cancers. And we pioneered Brevera to fully integrate the biopsy procedure with specimen radiography for the first time. Brevera alone is now generating about $40 million of annual revenue, and we expect all these new products to drive growth over our strat plan horizon.
Third, we have acquired 4 companies since 2018 to broaden our product portfolio, expand across the continuum of breast health care and become the partner of choice for all a customers' breast health needs. These acquisitions include Faxitron, which bolstered our offerings in specimen radiography; and Focal, which moved us further into breast-conserving surgery; and SuperSonic Imagine, which strengthened our position in ultrasound; and SOMATEX, which increased innovation in breast biopsy markers. In aggregate, these deals are now adding about $90 million annually to breast health revenue and are important contributors to growth in our strategic plan.
And fourth, we are expanding internationally in breast health. Our focus is to continue gaining market share with our existing 3D and upgradable 2D mammography products, the same products that have established leadership positions in the United States. We are also bringing the new products I've discussed both internally developed and acquired 2 additional countries. And we've purchased distributors in Germany, Spain and other markets to get closer to customers and secure more service revenue.
Now let's turn to our GYN Surgical division. Surgical was our fastest-growing division before the pandemic, and our strategic plan assumes that Surgical will continue its momentum through 2025. We have a unique opportunity to leverage our strength in the OB/GYN channel to provide differentiated solutions throughout women's lives.
While today, our products mainly help middle-aged women, in the future, we plan to have a stronger presence among mothers-to-be and older women as we expand our offerings within the hysteroscopic, laparoscopic and pelvic health markets.
Within Surgical, MyoSure remains the world's leading hysteroscopic product to remove smaller, less complicated fibroids. Since July is Fibroid Awareness Month, you've probably seen many articles describing the huge number of women who are affected by fibroids and the way they often suffer in silence or undergo invasive procedures, such as hysterectomies. It's clear that this market remains large and underpenetrated and that after many years of exceptional growth, MyoSure still has plenty of room to run.
We are also very excited about Acessa, which we acquired in 2020, and its laparoscopic fibroid treatment system. Acessa is a perfect complement to MyoSure as the system is used to treat larger, more complicated fibroids that MyoSure can't reach. Importantly, the same OB/GYNs who rely on MyoSure have the potential to use Acessa, so it's a great fit for our sales force.
We recently received 2 pieces of good news on Acessa, that it's now included in ACOG's updated fibroid management guidance and Cigna's list of medically necessary procedures. These are important milestones on our road to creating another $100 million-plus surgical brand alongside MyoSure and NovaSure.
Another reason we feel confident in Surgical's future is the revitalization of our R&D pipeline. A few years ago, the division was basically a 2-product show. Today, however, we sell multiple versions of these products as well as new fluid management system, hysteroscopes and other GYN surgical tools. and we have a robust pipeline of new products in development.
Finally, based on the strengthening of our global commercial capabilities, we now have many opportunities to deliver our less invasive surgical solutions to women around the world since less than 20% of the division's revenue is generated outside the United States today.
Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me wrap up by saying that, to me, Hologic looks like a fundamentally different company today than just 18 months ago before the pandemic. We have 3 franchises growing faster than they ever have. We are growing in all major regions of the world. We have added multiple new growth drivers in all our divisions. And with our COVID test, we have a significant new product line to provide upside to a strong base. Taken together, we are excited for the future and confident that we will grow our base, non-COVID business between 5% and 7% over the next several years.
Now let me hand the call over to Karleen."

As Steve said, our third quarter results exceeded expectations as revenue and EPS grew significantly compared to the prior year. Revenue of $1.17 billion increased 38%. Organically, revenue grew 34% driven by continued sequential improvement in our base businesses and a meaningful contribution from global COVID testing revenue. We exceeded our top and bottom line guidance with upside in both our base and COVID.
We also significantly improved profitability compared to the prior year period. As a result, EPS of $1.33 in the third quarter increased 77%. Further, operating cash flow remained robust, allowing us to execute on our capital allocation strategy, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. Providing a more complete picture of our performance, I will often compare our results to the third quarters of both 2020 and 2019.
In Diagnostics, global revenue of $665.5 million grew an impressive 20% compared to the prior year period, based on higher-than-expected COVID sales and the strength of our core molecular franchise. Within Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics increased 11.9% globally as massive growth internationally more than offset the decline in U.S. COVID sales.
Although COVID testing revenue declined, it still exceeded our most recent guidance. Specifically, we shipped about 14 million COVID tests to customers, generating assay revenue of $291 million globally. About 2/3 of COVID assay revenues generated outside the United States in the quarter, reflecting the broader global footprint that Steve discussed.
To better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID businesses, let me remind you that the pandemic has also increased sales of collection kits, instruments and ancillaries that are used with our COVID test. Backing this revenue out of the current and prior year period provides a better picture of true underlying trends. If we do this, we see that base molecular revenue in total Diagnostics sales grew about 76% organically in the third quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2019, molecular grew in the mid-teens and total Diagnostics grew mid-single digits.
Rounding out Diagnostics, our Cytology & Perinatal businesses grew 75% compared to the prior year. But compared to 2019, these businesses were still slightly behind their pre-pandemic levels.
In breast health, global revenue of $349 million grew 53% and exceptional results as the franchise continues to gain momentum. As evidence of this, revenue has now increased sequentially and compared to 2019 for the last 3 quarters. The division's strong performance remains well rounded, reflecting our commitment to diversifying revenue streams, as Steve discussed.
Both breast imaging and the interventional businesses increased compared to the prior year period, with imaging growing 43% and interventional increasing 120%. Although we remain encouraged by continued improvement in the capital environment, capital is still not quite back to the 2019 levels. However, breast screening rates continue to improve. And with a healthy backlog, we are encouraged about continued recovery over the next few quarters.
In Surgical, third quarter revenue of $127.9 million grew 143% while also exceeding 2019 levels by low double digits. Surgical's strong performance has been driven by normalizing procedure volumes, MyoSure and new products in the hands of our exceptional sales force.
Lastly, in skeletal, revenue of $25.9 million increased 66% compared to the prior year period and was also up low single digits compared to 2019. Overall, in terms of geography, domestic sales of $749.9 million increased almost 14%. On an organic basis, U.S. revenue was up 10%. Outside the United States, sales of $418.4 million increased 130% -- 137%. Organically, sales outside the U.S. grew 131%, a tremendous result.
Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 66.1% increased 140 basis points, driven by volume recovery in our base businesses and a nice contribution from sales of our COVID test.
Continuing down the P&L. Total operating expenses of $310.1 million increased 19% in the third quarter. Excluding expenses from our recent acquisitions, operating expenses would have increased about 11% as we reinvested for future growth with incremental spending in R&D and marketing. In addition, remember that given uncertainties associated with the pandemic, we cut back on spending in our third quarter of 2020.
Our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.5% driven by a favorable geographic income mix, mainly sales of COVID tests outside the United States. Putting this all together, operating margin increased 650 basis points to 39.5%, and net margin increased 580 basis points to 29.5%. As a result, non-GAAP net income finished at $344.8 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.33, exceeding the top end of our guidance.
Before we cover our fourth quarter guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Driven by our strong performance of our base businesses as well as the contribution from COVID testing, cash flow from operations was $663 million in the third quarter. This was nearly double our non-GAAP net income, highlighting excellent cash conversion. These strong cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility.
For example, in the third quarter, we closed the acquisition of Mobidiag for an enterprise value of $808 million and also repurchased 3 million shares of our stock for $188 million.
Overall, we had $828 million of cash at the end of the third quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.7x. We intend to continue using our cash on divisional-led tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom line growth rates. Finally, ROIC was 34.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 2,190 basis points.
Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and provide a few comments on longer-term targets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of $1 billion to $1.04 billion, representing constant currency decline of 27% to 24% versus the prior year period, which benefited from huge COVID assay sales. For perspective, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we generated less than $800 million of revenue, excluding the divested Cynosure business. So we expect to grow significantly above pre-pandemic levels.
In our base businesses, we expect continued momentum and recovery to generate very strong growth rates compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 given the negative impact of the pandemic a year ago. And we expect this franchise to grow nicely compared to 2019 as well.
In terms of COVID assay sales, the U.S. testing market continues to decline. As we forecasted last quarter, we expect this trend to continue as more people are vaccinated. In addition, summer vacations may further reduce demand domestically and in Europe. With these factors in mind, we expect COVID assay sales to range from $150 million to $170 million in the fourth quarter. In addition, COVID-related items in diagnostics are expected to be approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter, down roughly $20 million sequentially. If new variants drive demand that exceeds our current expectations, we are well prepared to deliver for our customers and generate upside to our estimates.
Our fourth quarter guidance includes approximately $35 million of acquired revenue from Mobidiag, Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Acessa. Backing this out as well as $9 million of expected Blood Screening revenue, we expect organic revenue to decline 30% to 27%. But excluding COVID assay sales and related revenue, we forecast organic revenue to grow low to mid-teens in the fourth quarter.
Below operating income, I would point out that we expect other expenses net to increase to about $25 million in the fourth quarter. Our guidance is based on a tax rate of 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of 260 million for the quarter. All of this nets out to expected EPS of $0.92 to $1 in the fourth quarter. Given the outsized impact of COVID assay sales in the prior year period, this translates to a decline of 56% to 52%.
As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides.
Before we open up the call for questions, let me touch on a few longer-term items. As Steve discussed, based on our recent strategic planning process, we are confident that organic revenue can grow 5% to 7% through our fiscal 2025, excluding sales of COVID assays as well as the related ancillaries and instruments.
Many of you have also asked for our perspective on COVID assay sales next year. And the shortest, most accurate answer is we don't know, no one does, given the uncertainty -- significant uncertainties that still exist and that seemingly change on a weekly basis. Having said that, we do understand your desire for some kind of framework.
Toward that end, we believe that given the scope of the ongoing pandemic and our broad global installed base of Panther instruments, it's unlikely that COVID assays revenue will be much less than $200 million next year, which would make COVID one of our biggest molecular assays. It's certainly possible that sales could be more than that, maybe as much as double. But we are going to be conservative at this stage and consider anything above $200 million potential upside. We would encourage you to do the same and focus instead on the strong underlying growth rates in our base businesses that Steve discussed.
Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic showed tremendous growth in the third quarter with results that exceeded guidance. We continue to make a huge impact on women's health globally and are meeting COVID testing needs as the pandemic evolves. Further, with organic investments in multiple acquisitions, we are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger company with top line growth rates of 5% to 7%, excluding COVID impacts.

So we want to continue to be able to get people to focus on our base businesses that we feel good about.

One of the biggest questions we get is just how to get comfortable with the big increase in Panther placements for that utilization beyond COVID. I mean we've seen so many various systems, see their installed base move higher as well. I guess when you guys work through the guidance, how do you think about this piece? I mean, obviously, there's things like test of record that you look at, that feel good about the attach rate in the near term and driving healthy utilization. But maybe just talk about that dynamic. Again, there's a ton of systems out there. What did you kind of include in the guidance in terms of Panther winning out in terms of some of that share beyond COVID?"

Some is actually the contractual obligations as we place these Panthers, particularly to provide both COVID revenue but on an ongoing basis. 
The other piece is -- and you're right, there's a lot of systems out there now. The simple -- my super simple way is the ""common sense talk to the customer"" approach. And I think you've been out there with enough of the labs as well to hear what is going to be important on an ongoing basis is the most highly automated instruments that provide the best level of tests. And it's what has led us to really the unbelievable market shares that we have in virtually all of our businesses. 
But when you look at Panther, the automated platform, the incredible automation. And particularly, as labs start to look to the future, where labor is going to be tougher and tougher to come by. And so what we continue to hear is Panther is where they want to consolidate. And in the early days of COVID, everybody went everywhere and got every machine and every test that they could get, and some are still bleeding off inventories from some of those. We just keep hearing over and over, the lab techs, especially, that are still running out inventory of other people's stuff, they want to consolidate on Panther. And I think we've got a multiyear long-term track record of delivering on that. 
This is not a pie in the sky, hey, we just placed a bunch of Panthers in the last 15 months and think this is going to happen. It's what we've been doing for 6 or 7 years pre-Panther, which is we place more Panthers every year. As our customers get used to them, they want to put more and more stuff on them. 
So I think it's going to really help us emerge. All automated platforms are not the same. All boxes are not the same. Panther has established itself in the high-volume space, high throughput space for a good reason."

So for the most part, I would say Delta accelerating with the upside as well as the flu season will likely be upside to those numbers that we've provided."

One way to think about it, we've accelerated multiple years of acquisitions in Diagnostics in a real short period of time.

We've built some very strong relationships. And the -- frankly, the health ministers around the world have known they can count on us and they can count on Panthers to deliver. So we feel pretty good about the -- being involved in those. 
And back to your first piece on the CDC, we feel really good about these new guidelines. And specifically, while it leaves it up to regional, we've got a couple of things going for us. First off, our own Diagnostics sales team that calls on physicians and helps to educate them, but really, more importantly, you're going from effectively an opt-in to an opt-out system. So there have been so many women who should be having these tests done on a routine visits that have really had to be opted in, and now the default should go the other way. So is that going to affect this coming quarter? Probably not. Will it significantly expand the market here in the coming years? We think so. 
And we think it's a great move for human health because a lot of the young women when they're -- if they're at the doctor's office and they're with their mom and the doctors asking questions about are they sexually active to decide, do I give this test or not? And therefore, okay, wait. The kid has to answer yes to get the test written. As soon as the default becomes, hey, you might not be, but we're just going to order this test anyway, that is a much -- I think a much better way for society, ultimately, to probably have a better handle on what's really going on."

We are pleased to discuss our strong financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue was $1.32 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.61. Both figures significantly exceeded our guid",1921,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our strong financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue was $1.32 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.61. Both figures significantly exceeded our guidance. 
Since this quarter marked the end of our fiscal year, we want to highlight some annual numbers and themes today. First, the numbers. For the year, total revenue was $5.63 billion, up 47% versus 2020. Non-GAAP EPS was $8.41, more than double the prior year. Some really big numbers and a truly impressive performance that was driven by our COVID test sales as well as the recovery of our core women's health businesses. 
Along these lines, if you back out COVID test sales as well as revenue from COVID-related products, such as instruments and collection kits, we grew about 12% in the quarter, a very nice start versus the long-term guidance of 5% to 7% that we introduced in our last call. 
We believe we are well positioned for success regardless of the future direction of the pandemic. If it drags on, we have shown that we can respond aggressively and generate financial upside. For example, since the beginning of the pandemic, we have provided more than 130 million highly accurate COVID tests to our customers in more than 50 countries. And when the pandemic subsides, we can rely on a base business that has never been stronger or more diversified than it is today. 
Now let's turn to those annual themes. We want to focus on the strengthening of our major businesses over the last 12 months as well as 2 very important social initiatives that help improve health access and equality. We're so proud of everything that Hologic has done to help fight the COVID pandemic. And the resulting financial success has made us a significantly stronger company for the future. 
Our core businesses are more diverse with more growth drivers than ever before. Our R&D pipelines are producing innovative new products and our commercial organizations are fully engaged. And our international business has emerged as a consistent growth driver with passionate teams on the ground who are building relationships and market presence all around the world. 
On top of all this, we have used the strong cash flow we are generating from COVID test sales to acquire companies that we expect to generate more than $150 million in revenue in 2022. Although these acquisitions are slightly dilutive to near-term EPS, we expect them to accelerate our top line growth rate. 
Now let's get into the specifics by division. First, in Diagnostics. Our Panther footprint continues to grow as we respond to the pandemic. In our fourth quarter, we placed 167 Panther instruments worldwide and about 650 for the year, well ahead of what we originally forecast. 
Our Panther installed base currently stands at more than 1,500 in the United States and almost 2,900 worldwide. Remarkably, this represents a 2/3 increase in our total installed base since the end of fiscal 2019, when we had about 1,700 instruments in the field. And looking forward to 2022, we continue to see strong demand for additional placements globally. 
Utilization of this growing footprint and leveraging our robust portfolio of 19 assays will be key to driving the business forward in a post-COVID world. Toward this end, in 2021, we signed up more new assay business in the U.S. than ever before. While our legacy women's health assays are leading the way, we also expect newer assays to make material contributions. 
For example, sales of our vaginosis panel almost doubled to nearly $30 million in 2021. We expect significant growth in 2022 as well, which would make this product our most successful diagnostics launch ever, aside from COVID. 
In addition, we completed the back to back to back acquisitions of Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Mobidiag in 2021, our first diagnostic acquisitions in nearly a decade. These deals are broadening our product offering and customer base and strengthening our R&D capabilities around the world. 
While still in the early innings, Biotheranostics continues to exceed expectations with sales of more than $16 million in our fourth quarter. In addition, the broad European launch of the Novodiag system represents a meaningful early achievement in our integration process, and we have already secured some encouraging customer wins. We are excited about opportunities to invest in these businesses in the near term and expect them to accelerate our top line growth in the years to come. 
Second, in Breast and Skeletal Health, we are well positioned for fiscal year 2022 and beyond. Our Genius 3D mammography systems remain the core of our business, and our market share remains very high. Despite COVID pressures, we placed almost 950 3D units in the United States in 2021. We now have a domestic installed base of almost 8,700, which we can build on with new software and hardware upgrades. 
At the same time, our business is now more balanced than ever as we operate across the entire continuum of breast health care from screening and diagnosis through surgery and treatment. As a result, we are now less susceptible to the boom and bust cycle of years past and better able to capitalize on opportunities as demand continues to recover from the headwinds created by the pandemic. 
Third, in our Surgical division, we are executing on our plan to broaden the division from a 2-product hysteroscopy business to a more diverse provider focused on the OV guy. In fiscal 2021, we broadened our portfolio by having Acessa, a laparoscopic fibroid removal system used to treat larger, more complicated fibroids that MyoSure cannot reach. We are pleased that insurance coverage for the Acessa procedure has steadily expanded. And with this tailwind, we expect to grow Acessa into a third important surgical brand alongside MyoSure and NovaSure. 
Taking another step forward, we are also very excited about the recent signing of an agreement to purchase Boulder Surgical, which offers additional laparoscopic devices. We expect this deal to close later this calendar year. Boulder offers a portfolio of advanced energy vessel sealing surgical devices currently marketed primarily in the pediatric space. Once the deal is closed, we expect to again leverage our strong customer relationships to grow Boulder sales in the OB/GYN market, which we estimate to be 5x the size of the pediatric market. 
Boulder and Acessa represents solid examples of executing against our tuck-in acquisition strategy, using our strong cash flow to add products that leverage our existing channel strength and accelerate our growth. 
Fourth, let's discuss our international business, which was growing nicely before COVID but has become even stronger, thanks to our pandemic contributions. Even excluding COVID, our international revenue has nearly doubled in just 5 years. And the business is positioned to continue its impressive strength of double-digit core growth. 
I recently had the pleasure of being with [ Jan Verstreken's ] leadership team in Dubai, as they made plans to kick off fiscal 2022. It was inspiring to see the deep talent that Jan has assembled and the passion for women's health that helps them build and strengthen commercial relationships. I saw business benefiting from tremendous leadership and for years of dedication, transitioning from a distribution model to direct on-the-ground commercial expertise. 
Further, the acquisitions of Diagenode, based in Belgium; Mobidiag based in Finland; and Somatex, based in Germany provide tailwinds to our international business going forward. Since the close of each deal, dozens of team members, including technical experts and leadership, have made numerous trips across Europe and across the Atlantic to ensure successful integration of these companies, all while dealing with strict COVID protocols, truly a global collaborative effort that we expect to accelerate growth for years to come. 
Now let's shift gears and discuss 2 groundbreaking social initiatives that we launched this year and that were made possible by our financial success. These efforts represent unique ways that we can extend our purpose, passion and promise even further for the benefit of women's health. 
First, in May of this year, we launched Project Healthy Equality, a $20 million initiative to address the structural and cultural barriers that prevent black and Hispanic women in the United States from receiving the same quality health care as white women. By teaming up with leading nonprofit groups focused on minority health, our goals are to drive culturally competent care, improve public health policy, increase access and ultimately decrease disparities that lead to disproportionate mortality rates for Black and Hispanic women. 
Second, in September, we released the findings of our inaugural Hologic Global Women's Health Index. As leaders in diagnostics, we understand the importance of data and know that what we can measure, we can improve. We also know that women's health has been overlooked for centuries. That's why we created the index, the first to statistically represent the health of 2.5 billion women and girls worldwide. Developed in partnership with [ Gal, ] the Hologic Global Women's Health Index is an unprecedented in-depth examination of critical markers for women's health by country and territory and over time. 
Notably, 60% of those surveyed, equating to about 1.5 billion women and girls, had not been tested in the last year for 4 common diseases that affect women's health: cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure and sexually transmitted infections. As we share this kind of data with international leaders and health organizations, our goal is to provide an actionable, science-backed data road map for improving life expectancy and quality of life for women around the world. 
While we have made a tremendous impact around the world with our innovative products, the Hologic Global Women's Health Index may ultimately prove to be our most important accomplishment for women's health. We hope that sharing a little about these initiatives is helpful to all our investors but especially those who are focused on ESG issues. 
We also are pleased to share that we recently received some recognition for our efforts as Investors Business Daily just named us 1 of their top 100 ESG stocks. 
Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me wrap up by saying that based on the stabilization, growth and diversification of our core businesses. We expect to grow revenue at least in line with our 5% to 7% long-term guidance in 2022. And on top of this, we have the potential for significant financial upside based on our sales of COVID tests. 
To state the obvious, our success in 2021 and our optimism for 2022 would not be possible without our 6,000-plus employees. I am incredibly proud of them for their continued dedication and resilience. In a year marked by day to day, hour by hour management of highly variable pandemic demands, Hologic continues to make an enormous impact on humanity. 
As I visit Hologic sites and talk to employees, the sense of pride, morale and engagement is palpable. The belief in our mission to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day is real. I personally have never been more proud or excited for our organization. 
As a reflection of our global leadership team's gratitude, in the fourth quarter, we provided all our employees a special onetime cash bonus regardless of function and level. In an environment where finding and developing talent is increasingly challenging, we've strengthened our talent across all levels of the organization with individuals who embody our purpose, passion and promise. To all of you around the world, thank you. 
Now let me hand our call over to Karleen."
108544,1684670019,2420593,"Hologic, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2021",2021-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our fourth quarter results that significantly exceeded our guidance. In our last earnings call, we said that while we were forecasting conservatively we were well prepared to gen",2055,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our fourth quarter results that significantly exceeded our guidance. In our last earnings call, we said that while we were forecasting conservatively we were well prepared to generate upside if COVID testing demand increased due to the Delta variant. And that's exactly what happened. 
Increased COVID test sales in the fourth quarter more than compensated for macro headwinds that have affected many med tech companies recently. Our fourth quarter performance demonstrates that we are in a strong position regardless of how COVID evolves. We benefit from our invaluable testing contributions as the pandemic drags on or from a strong base business when it wanes. 
In the fourth quarter, revenue and EPS were down compared to the prior year, when COVID-19 testing volumes will be near their peak. Total revenue of $1.32 billion declined almost 3% and 6% organically. 
But these figures mask the solid recovery of our base businesses. As Steve said, if you back out COVID assay revenue as well as collection kits, instruments and ancillaries that are shared by our COVID and other tests, revenue grew by 12% organically. This growth, which compares favorably to the 5% to 7% long-term guidance we provided last quarter, was driven by resilience across all of our divisions despite utilization pressures from the Delta variant and customer staffing shortages. 
EPS of $1.61 in the fourth quarter was down 22% compared to the prior year as expected, but earnings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by about 68%. Underlying this, our cash flow conversion remains tremendous, allowing us to continue pursuing tuck-in M&A and share repurchase, which I'll touch on in a moment. 
Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. To provide a more complete picture of our performance, I will at times compare our results to both 2020 and 2019 as well as exclude the impact of COVID-19 where applicable. 
In Diagnostics, global revenue of $836.8 million declined 11.5% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID assay sales and related items, worldwide Diagnostics revenue increased 5%. Although COVID testing revenue declined compared to the prior year, it still far exceeded our expectations as the Delta variant started throughout the quarter. In Q4 2021, we shipped about 21 million COVID tests to customers, generating assay revenue of $443 million globally. 
Demand in the United States was robust and represented about 2/3 of total COVID assay revenue. This dynamic highlights the breadth of our Panther installed base, our commitment to respond to customer needs and our flexibility to capture testing demand wherever and whenever it occurs. 
To better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID molecular business, I will again exclude COVID assay sales and related ancillary items. If we do this, we see that the base molecular revenue grew about 6.5% organically in the fourth quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2019, molecular grew about 10%. 
Rounding out Diagnostics, cytology and perinatal grew 3% compared to the prior year. But compared to 2019, these businesses were down low single digits as well-women visits have not yet fully recovered from the pandemic. 
In Breast Health, global revenue of $334.2 million grew 15% as the business rebounded from a weak prior year period and showcased its increasing diversity in face of the latest Delta surge. Both breast imaging and interventional businesses increased with imaging growing 12% and the interventional up 27%. 
Furthermore, our strategy to increase recurring revenue continues to pay off as global service revenue was approximately 40% of the division's total in the quarter, nearly twice as large as global gantry sales. 
In Surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $122 million grew 21%. This strong performance was driven by MyoSure, which had another impressive quarter, growing in the mid-teens. While surgical procedures were depressed in August and September, the impact was far less than what we experienced at the beginning of the pandemic. In fact, compared to 2019 levels, Surgical was up mid-single digits. 
Further, we continue to add products to the bag of our best-in-class sales force. The acquisition of Acessa and agreement to acquire Boulder set us up nicely for fiscal 2022 and beyond. 
Lastly, in our Small Skeletal business, revenue of $23.6 million increased 26% compared to the prior year period and mid-single digits compared to 2019. 
Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 69.4% exceeded our forecast, driven by higher-than-expected COVID-19 test volumes in the period. Compared to the prior year, gross margins declined 480 basis points. Total operating expenses of $353.2 million increased 28% in the fourth quarter. The recent acquisitions contributed about 1/3 of this increase. 
In addition, we deliberately reinvested for future growth with incremental spending in R&D and marketing, spent $9 million on the onetime employee bonus that Steve mentioned and made a $10 million donation to our charitable fund in the quarter. 
Finally, our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.5%, consistent with prior periods. Putting all this together, operating margin declined 1,120 basis points versus the prior year period but came in above our forecast at a very healthy 42.5%. 
Net margin also declined 880 basis points but was very strong, 31.6%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $415.7 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.61, far above the top end of our forecast. 
Before we cover our 2022 guidance, I'll touch on a few other financial metrics. Cash flow from operations was $465 million in the fourth quarter. This completed our best ever cash flow year as we generated more than $2.3 billion of operating cash in 2021. The strong cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. 
For example, in the fourth quarter, we agreed to acquire Boulder Surgical for $160 million. And although we did not repurchase any shares in our fourth quarter, we have bought back more than 1 million shares so far in the first quarter of 2022. 
Finally, I should mention that we recently refinanced our credit agreement. This further strengthened our balance sheet and financial flexibility by extending the maturity date to 2026, increasing our revolver borrowing capacity to $2 billion and lowering our borrowing costs. 
Based on our strong operational performance, we had $1.17 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.6x. We intend to continue using our cash on division-led tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom line growth rates. 
Finally, ROIC was 32.6% and on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 1,410 basis points. 
Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our financial expectations for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2022. Although the pandemic remains highly unpredictable and we are not immune from the supply chain challenges you've been hearing about, we believe we have good visibility into the recovery of our base businesses as well as a valuable hedge to COVID-19 outbreaks with our testing revenue. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion. For all of fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of $3.75 billion to $4 billion, significantly exceeding our pre-pandemic sales. 
To help with your constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $2 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $25 million for the full year. 
In terms of our divisions, we expect Breast and Skeletal Health, Surgical and Core diagnostics, excluding COVID effects, to grow in line with the 5% to 7% guidance we provided last quarter. In Diagnostics, molecular should continue to lead the way based on our larger Panther installed base, uptake of new assays like our vaginosis panel, international expansion opportunities as well as the recent change in chlamydia, gonorrhea screening guidelines that supports opt-out testing. 
In Breast Health, we have quietly been adding multiple growth drivers through acquisitions and breast conserving surgery, ultrasound and specimen radiography as well as internal development of software and hardware upgrades. Further, we have significant opportunities to expand our 3D installed base and service business internationally. 
Finally, in Surgical, we expect MyoSure to continue to drive growth but to get help from a broadening portfolio of products such as Fluent and Acessa's ProVu. Boulder is not included in our guidance because the deal has not yet closed. 
In terms of COVID assay sales, let me remind you that in the last 12 months, we have seen testing demand increase rapidly then decline rapidly, then increase rapidly again. Said another way, demand remains unpredictable and a lot can change between now and the end of our fiscal '22. So we continue to forecast conservatively and view COVID upside to our strong base business. But we will act aggressively to meet testing demands when and where it arises. 
With this perspective, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $200 million in the first quarter of 2022 and at least $300 million for the full year. COVID-related items in Diagnostics are expected to be approximately $45 million in the first quarter and at least $120 million for the full year. 
Finally, COVID has given us the opportunity to discontinue certain older products in our Diagnostics franchise. We expect a headwind of about $11 million from rationalizing these products in 2022. 
Let me remind you that our organic guidance backs out acquired revenue until the first full quarter after the deals annualize as well as revenue from our divested blood screening business. We expect blood screening revenue of $5 million to $6 million in Q1 and $20 million to $25 million for the full year. 
In total, we are backing out roughly $100 million of inorganic revenue for the year. which means that we expect organic revenue to decline 34% to 30% in fiscal '22 based on lower sales of COVID tests. However, to appreciate the underlying growth of our base women's health franchise, it's important to back out of organic revenue COVID assay sales related ancillary items and the small amount of SKU rationalization that I mentioned. On this measure, we expect revenue in 2022 to be at least in line with the 5% to 7% long-term guidance that we provided last quarter. 
Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our gross margin percentage to be between 63% and 65% and our operating margin percentage to be in the low to mid-30s. We expect both percentages to decline sequentially throughout the year since the vast majority of COVID testing revenue will likely be recorded in the first half of 2022. In addition, we have incorporated some inflationary pressure in our supply chain into our guidance. 
Despite this, for the full year, both growth and operating margins should be better than before the pandemic. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be flat to down slightly versus elevated levels in 2021, even as we absorb cost increases and continue to invest proactively in our acquisitions and our base business to drive future growth. 
Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be a little less than $25 million a quarter. Our guidance is based on the tax rate of 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of around 260 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected EPS of $1.15 to $1.25 in the first quarter and $3.55 to $3.85 for the year. 
As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. 
Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted a strong end to our fiscal 2021 with the results in our fourth quarter that far exceeded expectations and guidance. With organic investments in multiple acquisitions, we are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger company with core top line growth rates of 5% to 7% and potential upside from COVID. 
With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for the first question."

So just to think about 2022 for a second, then I also want to ask a bigger macro question. But on 2022 -- just want to kind of understand the core operating margin. I wasn't sure if you mentioned it right there at the end. I might have missed it. But if we were to sort of back out COVID-19 from both, let's say, '21 and '22, how is that core operating margin expanding? And what does that look like relative to pre-pandemic? Because it looked like on our method, operating margin may actually be coming down on the core a little bit. And I wasn't sure if that was acquisitions or other things that were there.

And if anything, we'll probably do a little bit better than the number you just mentioned and therefore, probably a little bit better than even we've been doing the previous years going into it as global demand continues to be great. 
The average dollars per Panther it's all over the place right now because, obviously, we have COVID running through a bunch of them. I think the logical expectation is we'd probably be a little bit lower than that 240 number given the incredible number we've placed. Also, a huge amount of them are outside -- if you basically look at it on a base business basis. 
I think what -- with COVID, those numbers are going to continue to be good, but it's hard to predict for the full year, obviously, given where COVID will go. But I think what we love is they're out there, they're placed. We probably take a slight short-term dip on revenue per Panther in the short term, while that continues to go up as they port our base assays onto those Panthers. 
So I do think as you're getting to the overall number of Panthers we have placed has got to bode very well. And the other reality is we're all seeing about labor constraints. Do not underestimate -- again, I know you know it, Tycho. But the fact that Panther is such an automated system -- and I know there's ongoing questions of, okay, what's going to happen with all these Panthers once COVID runs down? Most of our customers are dying to get our base business on to these and for those labor savings opportunities."

So we feel great about that as basically on deck and ready to go as soon as they have the ability. It's one reason why the Panther placements internationally have continued to be very strong because they've gotten the exposure and they want to build up with our tests. 
So I think feeling great that there has been -- we've even had a number of customers in the United States as well that we're just starting in kind of July to start to ramp down the COVID, ramp up our women's health stuff.

But I think overall, we feel very, very good about that core and about where we're headed as we come into 2022 on both of those businesses. And as Karleen and I both mentioned, those businesses are more diversified than ever, both product-wise as well as geography-wise.

A couple of questions. One on actually the acquisitions, the $34 million of total deal contribution. How much of that was actually Mobidiag? And when we think about a quarterly run rate, I think the timing of Mobidiag was not a full quarter. So should we be expecting a number perhaps in the $40 million to $45 million range for total quarterly contribution from recently closed deals?

So I think that's what makes us so excited about the future of Diagnostics. 
We had good growth rates going in. Particularly internationally, you've been seeing -- we'd had double-digit almost 20% growth in our molecular diagnostics business for the last few years and numbers of quarters as we come out of the pandemic or even as things slow down to a more manageable level, which looks to be hopefully on the horizon here.

Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them today. And a replay of this call will be archived through December 3. 
Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. 
Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year. 
Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency, unless otherwise noted.

We are pleased to discuss our strong financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue was $1.32 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.61. Both figures significantly exceeded our guid",1916,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our strong financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue was $1.32 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.61. Both figures significantly exceeded our guidance. 
Since this quarter marked the end of our fiscal year, we want to highlight some annual numbers and themes today. First, the numbers. For the year, total revenue was $5.63 billion, up 47% versus 2020. Non-GAAP EPS was $8.41, more than double the prior year. Some really big numbers and a truly impressive performance that was driven by our COVID test sales as well as the recovery of our core women's health businesses. 
Along these lines, if you back out COVID test sales as well as revenue from COVID-related products, such as instruments and collection kits, we grew about 12% in the quarter, a very nice start versus the long-term guidance of 5% to 7% that we introduced in our last call. 
We believe we are well positioned for success regardless of the future direction of the pandemic. If it drags on, we have shown that we can respond aggressively and generate financial upside. For example, since the beginning of the pandemic, we have provided more than 130 million highly accurate COVID tests to our customers in more than 50 countries. And when the pandemic subsides, we can rely on a base business that has never been stronger or more diversified than it is today. 
Now let's turn to those annual themes. We want to focus on the strengthening of our major businesses over the last 12 months as well as 2 very important social initiatives that help improve health access and equality. We're so proud of everything that Hologic has done to help fight the COVID pandemic. And the resulting financial success has made us a significantly stronger company for the future. 
Our core businesses are more diverse with more growth drivers than ever before. Our R&D pipelines are producing innovative new products. And our commercial organizations are fully engaged. And our international business has emerged as a consistent growth driver with passionate teams on the ground who are building relationships and market presence all around the world. 
On top of all this, we have used the strong cash flow we are generating from COVID test sales to acquire companies that we expect to generate more than $150 million in revenue in 2022. Although these acquisitions are slightly dilutive to near-term EPS, we expect them to accelerate our top line growth rate. 
Now let's get into the specifics by division. First, in Diagnostics. Our Panther footprint continues to grow as we respond to the pandemic. In our fourth quarter, we placed 167 Panther instruments worldwide and about 650 for the year, well ahead of what we originally forecast. 
Our Panther installed base currently stands at more than 1,500 in the United States and almost 2,900 worldwide. Remarkably, this represents a 2/3 increase in our total installed base since the end of fiscal 2019 when we had about 1,700 instruments in the field. And looking forward to 2022, we continue to see strong demand for additional placements globally. 
Utilization of this growing footprint and leveraging our robust portfolio of 19 assays will be key to driving the business forward in a post-COVID world. Toward this end, in 2021, we signed up more new assay business in the U.S. than ever before. While our legacy women's health assays are leading the way, we also expect newer assays to make material contributions. 
For example, sales of our vaginosis panel almost doubled to nearly $30 million in 2021. We expect significant growth in 2022 as well, which would make this product our most successful diagnostics launch ever, aside from COVID. 
In addition, we completed the back to back to back acquisitions of Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Mobidiag in 2021, our first diagnostic acquisitions in nearly a decade. These deals are broadening our product offering and customer base and strengthening our R&D capabilities around the world. 
While still in the early innings, Biotheranostics continues to exceed expectations with sales of more than $16 million in our fourth quarter. In addition, the broad European launch of the Novodiag system represents a meaningful early achievement in our integration process, and we have already secured some encouraging customer wins. We are excited about opportunities to invest in these businesses in the near term and expect them to accelerate our top line growth in the years to come. 
Second, in Breast and Skeletal Health, we are well positioned for fiscal year 2022 and beyond. Our Genius 3D Mammography systems remain the core of our business, and our market share remains very high. Despite COVID pressures, we placed almost 950 3D units in the United States in 2021. We now have a domestic installed base of almost 8,700, which we can build on with new software and hardware upgrades. 
At the same time, our business is now more balanced than ever as we operate across the entire continuum of breast health care from screening and diagnosis through surgery and treatment. As a result, we are now less susceptible to the boom and bust cycle of years past and better able to capitalize on opportunities as demand continues to recover from the headwinds created by the pandemic. 
Third, in our Surgical division, we are executing on our plan to broaden the division from a 2-product hysteroscopy business to a more diverse provider focused on the OB/GYN. In fiscal 2021, we broadened our portfolio by having Acessa, a laparoscopic fibroid removal system used to treat larger, more complicated fibroids that MyoSure cannot reach. We are pleased that insurance coverage for the Acessa procedure has steadily expanded. And with this tailwind, we expect to grow Acessa into a third important surgical brand alongside MyoSure and NovaSure. 
Taking another step forward, we are also very excited about the recent signing of an agreement to purchase Bolder Surgical, which offers additional laparoscopic devices. We expect this deal to close later this calendar year. Bolder offers a portfolio of advanced energy vessel sealing surgical devices currently marketed primarily in the pediatric space. Once the deal is closed, we expect to again leverage our strong customer relationships to grow Bolder sales in the OB/GYN market, which we estimate to be 5x the size of the pediatric market. 
Bolder and Acessa represents solid examples of executing against our tuck-in acquisition strategy using our strong cash flow to add products that leverage our existing channel strength and accelerate our growth. 
Fourth, let's discuss our international business, which was growing nicely before COVID but has become even stronger, thanks to our pandemic contributions. Even excluding COVID, our international revenue has nearly doubled in just 5 years. And the business is positioned to continue its impressive strength of double-digit core growth. 
I recently had the pleasure of being with Jan Verstreken's leadership team in Dubai, as they made plans to kick off fiscal 2022. It was inspiring to see the deep talent that Jan has assembled and the passion for women's health that helps them build and strengthen commercial relationships. I saw business benefiting from tremendous leadership and from years of dedication, transitioning from a distribution model to direct on-the-ground commercial expertise. 
Further, the acquisitions of Diagenode, based in Belgium; Mobidiag, based in Finland; and SOMATEX, based in Germany, provide tailwinds to our international business going forward. Since the close of each deal, dozens of team members, including technical experts and leadership, have made numerous trips across Europe and across the Atlantic to ensure successful integration of these companies, all while dealing with strict COVID protocols, truly a global collaborative effort that we expect to accelerate growth for years to come. 
Now let's shift gears and discuss 2 groundbreaking social initiatives that we launched this year and that were made possible by our financial success. These efforts represent unique ways that we can extend our purpose, passion and promise even further for the benefit of women's health. 
First, in May of this year, we launched Project Healthy Equality, a $20 million initiative to address the structural and cultural barriers that prevent black and Hispanic women in the United States from receiving the same quality health care as white women. By teaming up with leading nonprofit groups focused on minority health, our goals are to drive culturally competent care, improve public health policy, increase access and ultimately decrease disparities that lead to disproportionate mortality rates for black and Hispanic women. 
Second, in September, we released the findings of our inaugural Hologic Global Women's Health Index. As leaders in diagnostics, we understand the importance of data and know that what we can measure, we can improve. We also know that women's health has been overlooked for centuries. That's why we created the index, the first to statistically represent the health of 2.5 billion women and girls worldwide. Developed in partnership with Gallup, the Hologic Global Women's Health Index is an unprecedented in-depth examination of critical markers for women's health by country and territory and over time. 
Notably, 60% of those surveyed, equating to about 1.5 billion women and girls, had not been tested in the last year for 4 common diseases that affect women's health: cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure and sexually transmitted infections. As we share this kind of data with international leaders and health organizations, our goal is to provide an actionable, science-backed data road map for improving life expectancy and quality of life for women around the world. 
While we have made a tremendous impact around the world with our innovative products, the Hologic Global Women's Health Index may ultimately prove to be our most important accomplishment for women's health. We hope that sharing a little about these initiatives is helpful to all our investors but especially those who are focused on ESG issues. 
We also are pleased to share that we recently received some recognition for our efforts as Investor's Business Daily just named us one of their top 100 ESG stocks. 
Before I turn the call over to Karleen, let me wrap up by saying that based on the stabilization, growth and diversification of our core businesses, we expect to grow revenue at least in line with our 5% to 7% long-term guidance in 2022. And on top of this, we have the potential for significant financial upside based on our sales of COVID tests. 
To state the obvious, our success in 2021 and our optimism for 2022 would not be possible without our 6,000-plus employees. I am incredibly proud of them for their continued dedication and resilience. In a year marked by day to day, hour by hour management of highly variable pandemic demands, Hologic continues to make an enormous impact on humanity. 
As I visit Hologic sites and talk to employees, the sense of pride, morale and engagement is palpable. The belief in our mission to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day is real. I personally have never been more proud or excited for our organization. 
As a reflection of our global leadership team's gratitude, in the fourth quarter, we provided all our employees a special onetime cash bonus regardless of function and level. In an environment where finding and developing talent is increasingly challenging, we've strengthened our talent across all levels of the organization with individuals who embody our purpose, passion and promise. To all of you around the world, thank you. 
Now let me hand our call over to Karleen."
108544,1684670019,2420656,"Hologic, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2021",2021-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our fourth quarter results that significantly exceeded our guidance. In our last earnings call, we said that while we were forecasting conservatively, we were well prepared to ge",2053,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our fourth quarter results that significantly exceeded our guidance. In our last earnings call, we said that while we were forecasting conservatively, we were well prepared to generate upside if COVID testing demand increased due to the Delta variant. And that's exactly what happened. 
Increased COVID test sales in the fourth quarter more than compensated for macro headwinds that have affected many med tech companies recently. Our fourth quarter performance demonstrates that we are in a strong position regardless of how COVID evolves. We benefit from our invaluable testing contributions as the pandemic drags on or from a strong base business when it wanes. 
In the fourth quarter, revenue and EPS were down compared to the prior year when COVID-19 testing volumes will be near their peak. Total revenue of $1.32 billion declined almost 3% and 6% organically. 
But these figures mask the solid recovery of our base businesses. As Steve said, if you back out COVID assay revenue as well as collection kits, instruments and ancillaries that are shared by our COVID and other tests, revenue grew by 12% organically. This growth, which compares favorably to the 5% to 7% long-term guidance we provided last quarter, was driven by resilience across all of our divisions despite utilization pressures from the Delta variant and customer staffing shortages. 
EPS of $1.61 in the fourth quarter was down 22% compared to the prior year as expected, but earnings exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by about 68%. Underlying this, our cash flow conversion remains tremendous, allowing us to continue pursuing tuck-in M&A and share repurchase, which I'll touch on in a moment. 
Before I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results. To provide a more complete picture of our performance, I will at times compare our results to both 2020 and 2019 as well as exclude the impact of COVID-19 where applicable. 
In Diagnostics, global revenue of $836.8 million declined 11.5% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID assay sales and related items, worldwide Diagnostics revenue increased 5%. 
Although COVID testing revenue declined compared to the prior year, it still far exceeded our expectations as the Delta variant surged throughout the quarter. In Q4 2021, we shipped about 21 million COVID tests to customers, generating assay revenue of $443 million globally. 
Demand in the United States was robust and represented about 2/3 of total COVID assay revenue. This dynamic highlights the breadth of our Panther installed base, our commitment to respond to customer needs and our flexibility to capture testing demand wherever and whenever it occurs. 
To better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID molecular business, I will again exclude COVID assay sales and related ancillary items. If we do this, we see that the base molecular revenue grew about 6.5% organically in the fourth quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2019, molecular grew about 10%. 
Rounding out Diagnostics, cytology and perinatal grew 3% compared to the prior year. But compared to 2019, these businesses were down low single digits as well-women visits have not yet fully recovered from the pandemic. 
In Breast Health, global revenue of $334.2 million grew 15% as the business rebounded from weak prior year period and showcased its increasing diversity in face of the latest Delta surge. Both breast imaging and interventional businesses increased with imaging growing 12% and the interventional up 27%. 
Furthermore, our strategy to increase recurring revenue continues to pay off as global service revenue was approximately 40% of the division's total in the quarter, nearly twice as large as global gantry sales.  
In Surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $122 million grew 21%. This strong performance was driven by MyoSure, which had another impressive quarter, growing in the mid-teens. While surgical procedures were depressed in August and September, the impact was far less than what we experienced at the beginning of the pandemic. In fact, compared to 2019 levels, Surgical was up mid-single digits. 
Further, we continue to add products to the bag of our best-in-class sales force. The acquisition of Acessa and agreement to acquire Bolder set us up nicely for fiscal 2022 and beyond.  
Lastly, in our Small Skeletal business, revenue of $23.6 million increased 26% compared to the prior year period and mid-single digits compared to 2019.  
Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 69.4% exceeded our forecast, driven by higher-than-expected COVID-19 test volumes in the period. Compared to the prior year, gross margins declined 480 basis points. Total operating expenses of $353.2 million increased 28% in the fourth quarter. The recent acquisitions contributed about 1/3 of this increase.  
In addition, we deliberately reinvested for future growth with incremental spending in R&D and marketing, spent $9 million on the onetime employee bonus that Steve mentioned and made a $10 million donation to our charitable fund in the quarter.  
Finally, our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.5%, consistent with prior periods. Putting all this together, operating margin declined 1,120 basis points versus the prior year period but came in above our forecast at a very healthy 42.5%.  
Net margin also declined 880 basis points but was very strong 31.6%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $415.7 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.61, far above the top end of our forecast.  
Before we cover our 2022 guidance, I'll touch on a few other financial metrics. Cash flow from operations was $465 million in the fourth quarter. This completed our best-ever cash flow year as we generated more than $2.3 billion of operating cash in 2021. 
The strong cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the fourth quarter, we agreed to acquire Bolder Surgical for $160 million. And although we did not repurchase any shares in our fourth quarter, we have bought back more than 1 million shares so far in the first quarter of 2022.  
Finally, I should mention that we recently refinanced our credit agreement. This further strengthened our balance sheet and financial flexibility by extending the maturity date to 2026, increasing our revolver's borrowing capacity to $2 billion and lowering our borrowing costs.  
Based on our strong operational performance, we had $1.17 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.6x. We intend to continue using our cash on division-led tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases that improve our top and bottom line growth rates. Finally, ROIC was 32.6% on a trailing 12-month basis, a significant increase of 1,410 basis points. 
Before we open the call for questions, let me discuss our financial expectations for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2022. Although the pandemic remains highly unpredictable and we are not immune from the supply chain challenges you've been hearing about, we believe we have good visibility into the recovery of our base businesses as well as a valuable hedge to COVID-19 outbreaks with our testing revenue. 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect strong financial results again, with total revenue in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion. For all of fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of $3.75 billion to $4 billion, significantly exceeding our prepandemic sales. 
To help with your constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $2 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $25 million for the full year. 
In terms of our divisions, we expect Breast & Skeletal Health, Surgical and Core Diagnostics, excluding COVID effects, to grow in line with the 5% to 7% guidance we provided last quarter. 
In Diagnostics, molecular should continue to lead the way based on our larger Panther installed base, uptake of new assays like our vaginosis panel, international expansion opportunities as well as the recent change in chlamydia, gonorrhea screening guidelines that supports opt-out testing. 
In Breast Health, we have quietly been adding multiple growth drivers through acquisitions and breast conserving surgery, ultrasound and specimen radiography as well as internal development of software and hardware upgrades. Further, we have significant opportunities to expand our 3D installed base and service business internationally. 
Finally, in Surgical, we expect MyoSure to continue to drive growth but to get help from a broadening portfolio of products such as Fluent and Acessa's ProVu. Bolder is not included in our guidance because the deal has not yet closed. 
In terms of COVID assay sales, let me remind you that in the last 12 months, we have seen testing demand increase rapidly, then decline rapidly, then increase rapidly again. Said another way, demand remains unpredictable and a lot can change between now and the end of our fiscal '22. So we continue to forecast conservatively and view COVID as upside to our strong base business. But we will act aggressively to meet testing demands when and where it arises. 
With this perspective, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $200 million in the first quarter of 2022 and at least $300 million for the full year. COVID-related items in Diagnostics are expected to be approximately $45 million in the first quarter and at least $120 million for the full year. 
Finally, COVID has given us the opportunity to discontinue certain older products in our Diagnostics franchise. We expect a headwind of about $11 million from rationalizing these products in 2022. 
Let me remind you that our organic guidance backs out acquired revenue until the first full quarter after the deals annualize as well as revenue from our divested blood screening business. We expect blood screening revenue of $5 million to $6 million in Q1 and $20 million to $25 million for the full year. In total, we are backing out roughly $100 million of inorganic revenue for the year, which means that we expect organic revenue to decline 34% to 30% in fiscal '22 based on lower sales of COVID tests. 
However, to appreciate the underlying growth of our base women's health franchise, it's important to back out of organic revenue COVID assay sales, related ancillary items and the small amount of SKU rationalization that I mentioned. On this measure, we expect revenue in 2022 to be at least in line with the 5% to 7% long-term guidance that we provided last quarter. 
Moving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our gross margin percentage to be between 63% and 65% and our operating margin percentage to be in the low to mid-30s. We expect both percentages to decline sequentially throughout the year since the vast majority of COVID testing revenue will likely be recorded in the first half of 2022. In addition, we have incorporated some inflationary pressure in our supply chain into our guidance. Despite this, for the full year, both growth and operating margins should be better than before the pandemic. 
In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be flat to down slightly versus elevated levels in 2021, even as we absorb cost increases and continue to invest proactively in our acquisitions and our base business to drive future growth. 
Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be a little less than $25 million a quarter. Our guidance is based on the tax rate of 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of around 260 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected EPS of $1.15 to $1.25 in the first quarter and $3.55 to $3.85 for the year. 
As you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides. 
Let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted a strong end to our fiscal 2021 with the results in our fourth quarter that far exceeded expectations and guidance. With organic investments in multiple acquisitions, we are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger company with core top line growth rates of 5% to 7% and potential upside from COVID.

And if anything, we'll probably do a little bit better than the number you just mentioned and therefore, probably a little bit better than even we've been doing the previous years going into it as global demand continues to be great. 
The average dollars per Panther, it's all over the place right now because, obviously, we have COVID running through a bunch of them. I think the logical expectation is we'd probably be a little bit lower than that 240,000 number given the incredible number we've placed. Also, a huge amount of them are outside if you basically look at it on a base business basis. 
I think what -- with COVID, those numbers are going to continue to be good, but it's hard to predict for the full year, obviously, given where COVID will go. But I think what we love is they're out there, they're placed. We probably take a slight short-term dip on revenue per Panther in the short term, while that continues to go up as they port our base assays onto those Panthers. 
So I do think as you're getting to the overall number of Panthers we have placed has got to bode very well. And the other reality is we're all seeing about labor constraints. Do not underestimate -- again, I know you know it, Tycho. But the fact that Panther is such an automated system, and I know there's ongoing questions of, okay, what's going to happen with all these Panthers once COVID runs down, most of our customers are dying to get our base business onto these and for those labor savings opportunities."

And so I would tell you, there's probably some Panthers being a little bit underutilized right now internationally because they don't want to start to ramp them up with our tests and then have to stop. So we feel great about that as basically on deck and ready to go as soon as they have the ability. It's one reason why the Panther placements internationally have continued to be very strong, because they've gotten the exposure and they want to build up with our tests. 
So I think feeling great that there has been -- we've even had a number of customers in the United States as well that we're just starting in kind of July to start to ramp down the COVID, ramp up our women's health stuff.

We're still basically hearing from most of our customers, they want the straight COVID test. As the months evolve here, do we start to get a bigger spike in that -- the flu season? Clearly, I do think that we believe as you go forward this year, and let's face it, probably even next year, most people that are going to get tested for flu are probably going to end up getting tested for COVID as well. So we will see how it plays out. We're assuming relatively small volumes as it relates to our multiplex test at this point in time until it starts to materialize."

And frankly, it's something that we hope the Hologic Global Women's Health Index will actually be able to start to highlight a little bit more, which is many countries outside the U.S. are still only reserving 3D more for diagnostic mammograms as opposed to screening. And frankly, many still don't have great screening programs in general. 
So we're able, ultimately through the Global Women's Health Index, I think to start to have more discussions about better screening programs, about the need for 3D. And the fact that 3D, in many cases, is economically advantageous over the longer term, particularly in single-payer systems, where the ability to detect earlier, treat earlier, avoiding all the false positives, the false callback -- the unneeded callbacks and all of that. So I think we remain very bullish over the longer term. It continues to be something that's going to play out over years, not quarters."
