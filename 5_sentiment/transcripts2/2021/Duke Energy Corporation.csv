He has recently -- responsibility as Vice President of Investor Relations after a very strong 15-year career with Duke, where he's had financial experience, capital markets experience, M&A experience and brings that wealth of background to this role as well as a deep understanding of our company and our industry. We put him to work over the last couple of weeks of all of our announcements. So many of you have already had a chance to meet and talk with Jack, but you can look forward to more interaction with him as we go forward.
So good morning to all of you. It's great to be with you for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. We begin the year with significant momentum on strategic, regulatory and stakeholder fronts, and I'm very optimistic about our future heading into 2021.
Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $5.12 for the year, putting us solidly within our updated guidance range for 2020. These results reflect the strength of our regulated utilities, our commitment to generating sustainable shareholder value and our financial agility, especially in response to the unique difficulties of this past year. We also affirmed our 2021 guidance range of $5 to $5.30, with a midpoint of $5.15, and our recently increased a long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025 based off the midpoint of our 2021 guidance range.
Like most companies, 2020 presented us with new challenges, and I'm extremely proud of how we responded. We faced those challenges head on, swiftly responding to the COVID-19 pandemic to support our customers and our workforce, adjusting our plans after removing Atlantic Coast pipeline, producing $450 million in mitigation actions and responding to significant storms throughout the year. All of this was made possible by our employees who showed incredible resolve as they adjusted to new working conditions, identified cost savings and operational improvements and maintained reliable service for our customers. In short, we did more than just get through 2020. We adapted and delivered learning new ways of working that will benefit us in the years ahead.
The momentum from 2020 has continued into 2021. And turning to Slide 5. Duke Energy has made significant progress, resolving uncertainties around our company and laying a solid foundation for growth into the future. Slide 5 captures the myriad accomplishment that the Duke Energy team delivered, all providing benefits to our customers and our investors and allowing us to turn our full attention to advancing our goal to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050. In North Carolina, we reached a milestone settlement with the State Attorney General Public Staff and Sierra Club to close the debate around coal ash cost recovery. We're pleased with this balanced compromise, resolved several outstanding issues, including the remand of the 2017 rate cases and the pending 2019 rate cases. It also provides greater clarity and recovery of coal ash costs incurred through early 2030 and preserves our ability to earn an equity return on deferred coal ash costs. This settlement complements the previous settlement reached in the summer of 2020 on ROE and capital structure and again demonstrates our commitment to working collaboratively with stakeholders in our jurisdictions. We look forward to the commission's order, addressing these settlements and the remaining issues in the case.
We also developed innovative IRP in the Carolinas, outlining comprehensive proposals and offering 6 portfolios to meet key carbon reduction milestones over the next 15 years. And for the past year, we've been working with stakeholder groups to help Shape North Carolina's clean energy plan with a common goal of reaching net-zero carbon in a way that best serves our customers. This complements the efforts underway on regulatory reform and introducing more efficient cost recovery mechanisms.
Shifting to Florida, we worked with business and consumer groups, including the Office of Public Counsel, to propose a new 3-year settlement, giving our investors and customers clear visibility through 2024. This settlement includes multiyear base rate increases to recover significant investments in the grid, solar generation and electric vehicle infrastructure. It also allows for the accelerated depreciation of coal plants and supports innovative technology pilot programs that are important to achieving our carving goals in clean energy future. We expect an order from the Florida Commission by the end of the second quarter with rates effective in January of 2022.
Beyond the multiyear rate plan, we also received approval of the first 3 years of our storm protection plans, representing a $6 billion investment in grid hardening projects over the next 10 years.
In Indiana, we recently announced the GIC, a global investment firm with significant experience investing in U.S. infrastructure companies, will become a minority investor in Duke Energy, Indiana. For $2.05 billion, GIC will acquire a 19.9% ownership stake with governance rights commensurate with their equity ownership. GIC highlighted that our proven track record of high performance and clear commitment to a clean energy transition makes this an attractive partnership for them.
The transaction values our DEI utility at an attractive multiple to our current stock valuation, providing an efficient source of financing for our business and allowing us to eliminate all common equity from our 5-year plan. The structure of the investment also allows us to better match financing with capital needs, bringing $1 billion into our company in 2021 and the second tranche no later than January of 2023. This investment is a strong endorsement of our company and in Duke Energy, Indiana, our operations, employees and opportunities for growth. It is also a strong endorsement of our overall strategy to be a leader in clean energy transformation.
We also significantly expanded our renewable footprint in our regulated and commercial businesses, announcing more than 700 megawatts of solar and wind energy projects, and we built momentum around electric vehicle pilot program, which was further amplified by our own pledge to electrify the Duke Energy fleet.
In turning to Tennessee, we reached a constructive settlement in our Piedmont Natural Gas rate case with the Attorney General Consumer Advocate Division. This is our first general rate case in Tennessee in almost 9 years, allowing us to recover needed infrastructure investments to serve our growing customer base in and around Nashville. This is an impressive list of accomplishments, and we will keep going with a clear clean energy vision and growth in the 5% to 7% range, underpinned by a robust capital plan, constructive jurisdictions, operational excellence and a diverse committed workforce.
Shifting to Slide 6. We begin 2021 with a clear vision for the future to lead the clean energy transition in our communities. Our goal is captured clearly in our climate strategy, at least 50% carbon reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050. We crossed a major milestone in 2020, surpassing 40% carbon reduction from 2005 levels, and we're poised to hit more milestones in the years to come. Our road map to success involves close collaboration with key stakeholders, an accelerated move from coal and into cleaner forms of generation, including renewables and battery storage. The modernization of our grid to enable more clean energy and an unwavering commitment to reliability and affordability.
2021 is an important year on this journey. In North Carolina stakeholder discussions initiated by the Governor's clean energy plan are beginning to wrap up. These conversations have been very helpful in creating a common understanding among the interested parties on clean energy principles and the regulatory changes needed to effectuate a generation transition. As the 2021 legislative session begins, we believe both stakeholders and policymakers will benefit from this work as well as the information found in the comprehensive IRPs we filed last summer. Those resource plans present several pathways that illustrate the trade-offs between the pace of transition and cost implications. We look forward to working with legislators and stakeholders over the next several weeks and months to evaluate the various options. And we are optimistic about the policies that can be created from shared objectives around North Carolina's clean energy transition as well as the regulatory reforms that provide for timely recovery of these investments.
In Indiana, we will continue our critical grid improvement projects and further our clean energy Transition as we file our 2021 IRP this November. In Florida, our recent settlement outlines a clear path for further renewable and EV investment in the state through 2024 and the accelerated retirement of coal plants.
And at the federal level, we will work closely with policymakers as the Biden administration reenters the Paris Agreement and sets a national policy that advances our country's transition to clean energy. We look forward to adding our voice to this important discussion, ensuring that the policies strategically integrate emissions reductions, cost considerations and the promotion of a broad range of technology development. Our objectives are clear and will create value for all of our stakeholders. Our climate strategy is our growth strategy, and our relentless commitment to our bold climate targets means we are leading the transition to clean energy. Our aggressive $59 billion capital plan is among the largest in the industry, placing us at the forefront of clean energy at scale. We're confident this capital will generate value for our growing constructive jurisdictions and provide clean affordable energy for the more than 25 million customers we serve every day. This capital plan positions Duke to achieve earnings growth of 5% to 7% based off the 2021 midpoint of $5.15. I'm very proud of our results and excited about Duke Energy's path forward.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve."

We delivered results within our guidance range, overcame headwinds and leveraged our size and scale to position the company for significant growth in the years ahead.
As shown on Slide 7, our full year reported and adjusted earnings per share were $1.72 and $5.12 as compared to $5.06 of reported and adjusted earnings per share in 2019. We took swift and decisive action to mitigate the challenges we faced this year. We did not allow COVID-19, mild weather, storms and the loss of ACP earnings to define our path forward. And this commitment and dexterity enabled us to deliver solidly within our narrow 2020 earnings guidance range. Our 2020 results were driven by strong execution across each of our operating segments, growth from our rate case execution in Indiana and Kentucky, interim rates in North Carolina and continued growth from our Florida operations through their multiyear rate plan and SoBRA mechanisms, produced positive results in electric utilities and infrastructure. We also saw growth in our Carolinas wholesale business due to the new formula rate contract that was effective this year. These factors were offset by regulatory lag and our growing asset base, milder weather and dilution from equity issuances.
Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, we saw higher results in our LDC businesses, primarily due to Piedmont's rate case in North Carolina and contributions from rider mechanisms. The gas LDCs continue to provide strong earnings growth, adding $0.11, driven by customer additions and investments in integrity management, but offset by the cancellation of ACP in July.
Results in commercial renewables were higher than 2019, driven by new projects placed in service, including Palmer, Holstein and Rambler, which together totaled 460 megawatts. Going forward, we continue to plan for this segment to deliver between $200 million and $250 million of net income per year over the 5-year plan with the potential for upside that projects meet our return expectations.
Having accomplished a lot in 2020, we turn to 2021 well positioned to achieve our adjusted EPS guidance range of $5 to $5.30 with a $5.15 midpoint.
Turning to Slide 8. Our financial outlook for 2021 and beyond is strong and rooted in our increased capital investment plan. Our core utilities continue to generate solid growth, driving our earnings results upward for the foreseeable future. For Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, growth in 2021 will come from our customer additions and infrastructure investments across our franchises. In the Carolinas, we will experience growth from revised rates in our current pending rate cases. In Florida, we expect strong earnings contributions as we move into the final year of our multiyear rate plan, coupled with growth in solar via the SoBRA mechanism. In 2021, we'll continue to benefit from the steady growth of our T&D infrastructure investments in the Midwest, along with new effective rates in Indiana and Kentucky. As the economy continues to rebound from the pandemic, we forecast our 2021 low growth in the 1% to 2% range across our entire footprint, driven by some of the strongest customer growth we have seen in recent years.
Our Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment provides consistent and steady growth, largely driven by our organic customer additions and integrity management investments. These investments will translate to revenues through riders and base rate adjustment mechanisms in our LDCs, such as the recent rate settlement filed in Tennessee. In commercial renewables, in 2021, we will deliver annual earnings solidly in the $200 million to $250 million range and throughout the 5-year plan. We expect the other segment to be lower year-over-year. This is primarily due to favorable tax optimization in 2020 not producing the same level of contributions in 2021 and the expectation of lower market returns in our captive insurance program and grant or trust. Finally, we have adjusted our plans to reflect the cancellation of ACP and the full year impact of the $2.5 billion equity forward transaction that closed in December of 2020. Including this, we expect growth in our core businesses of 6% in 2021.
Turning to Slide 9. Let me touch on electric volumes and economic trends. We operate in constructive and growing jurisdictions. That said, like most utilities, we saw a decline in retail load for 2020 given the impact of the pandemic. While residential volumes were up 3% for the year, that did not offset the lower volumes from commercial and industrial customers. As we look at customer growth, we experienced very positive trends closing out 2020 with 1.8% growth for the year. This was favorable to the projections we originally shared in May of last year and affirms we operate in high-growth states. In fact, our franchises serve 4 of the top 8 states in terms of positive population migration. We project an overall increase in electricity consumption in 2021 of 1% to 2% over 2020, given many of our commercial and industrial customers continue to return to normal operations. We expect the metrics for residential may decline a bit as people begin to return to the workplace following the mass distribution of the COVID vaccine. Over the 5-year plan, we project load growth of 0.5% to 1% as the economy returns to pre-COVID status.
On Slide 10, you will see the transformative work underway to lower our cost structure and bolster our growth potential. Duke Energy is a leader in the industry when it comes to cost mitigation, driven by digital capabilities, data analytics, and retraining and reskilling employees, which serves -- which drives a more versatile workforce. Taken together, these factors result in meaningful and sustainable savings.
When 2020 began with weaker weather and storms, we initiated tactical business matters to significantly reduce our O&M costs. And in response to the pandemic in the first quarter, we accelerated these mitigations to offset projected impacts. By the end of the year, we delivered $450 million of mitigation. This included $320 million of O&M savings, equivalent to more than 6% of our 2020 nonrecoverable O&M. And this was done with a keen focus on minimizing the impacts to employee jobs. While certain cost savings in 2020 were onetime opportunities, we have identified many others that are sustainable, which will ultimately benefit our customers and shareholders over the long term. These sustainable savings of approximately $200 million are underpinned by our versatile workforce who continue to adopt advanced technologies to perform work with increased efficiencies, allowing us to take advantage of attrition, reduce employee expenses and minimize facilities costs. For the past 5 years, our net regulated electric and gas O&M has a decline, approximately 1% per year. Even with the acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas events, and we expect this downward trend to continue.
Moving to Slide 11. As Lynn discussed, we have a robust capital plan of $59 billion over the 5-year planning period. About 70% of this capital investment will be geared towards investments in clean energy and the green infrastructure that supports it. We expect the clean energy transformation to ramp up over the 5-year period and grow even further to $65 billion to $75 billion when we enter the back half of the decade. This will be largely driven by more coal plant retirements and the acceleration of renewables. We expect to gain more clarity around this projection as our states make important carbon policy decisions. These investments across our electric and LDC franchises position us for a 5-year rate base CAGR of approximately 6.5% for the next 5-year period ending in 2029. We see that growth accelerating to 7% based on our growing capital needs during this transition and transformation.
Turning to Slide 12. Our growing capital plan vibrant franchise service area growth and proven capability to control cost and work constructively to stakeholders to move through regulatory processes give us confidence in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted earnings per share of 5% to 7% throughout the 5-year period. Bear in mind this capital plan assumes the lower-end carbon reduction scenarios in the Carolinas.
Moving to Slide 13. Our ability to execute on our robust capital program is underpinned by a healthy balance sheet and solid credit ratings. We announced a $2.05 billion minority investment in our Indiana utility, where we will remain the majority owner and sole operator of this private equity investment by a reputable infrastructure investor demonstrates the premium valuation of our regulated utilities addresses all equity needs for the next 5 years and supports a strong balance sheet that allows access to low-cost capital. The equity from the Indiana transaction, along with our overall financing plan, allows us to maintain a healthy credit profile, targeting a consolidated FFO to debt ratio of 14%.
Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 14. We are positioned to deliver results for our shareholders and are confident in the 2021 base year EPS guidance and robust capital plan we have laid out for you. Our focus on the future, sound investment strategy and demonstrated dexterity position us to consistently deliver within our increased 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rate through 2025. Our commitment to the dividend remains unchanged. We understand how important it is to our shareholders, and that's why 2021 will mark the 95th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend. We intend to keep growing the Duke Energy dividend, balancing our desire to offer investors a strong payout with our need to fund our capital plans.
As we said in our opening remarks, 2020, the early part of 2021 have been transformative for Duke Energy. And we lean into the next decade with anticipation and resolve to achieve our goals for our customers and our shareholders.
With that, we'll open the line for your questions."

I would say, as we look at this 5-year period, we feel like we've got a pretty strong capital plan. There may be some upside in the back part of the plan, Shar, but I'd look at the Clean Energy Transition that's underway, we have some work to do in 2021 and 2022 to lay further groundwork. And so that escalation will be towards the end of the 5-year, continuing over the rest of the decade. We will always look for attractive ways to finance growth, and I think we've demonstrated that with this transaction, but don't have anything in the near term that I would point to, just reinforce that finding attractive low-cost capital to underpin growth is always an objective, and we're really pleased with what we were able to accomplish with this transaction."

Shar, the first thing I'd like to do is express the confidence we have in achieving 5% to 7%. It has been grounded in not only strong franchise growth, the regulatory certainty we've been able to achieve, including the recent settlement with EAG. The investment opportunities we talked about on decarbonizing and then our ability to control costs, coupled with the transaction with GIC eliminating equity, gives us a really solid foundation for 5% to 7%.
And so I'd look at what we've put in front of you is a capital plan and a strategy with a high degree of confidence to achieve 5% to 7%. I think the ability to reach that top end to keep going would include faster acceleration of generation transition, perhaps faster economic recovery. I'd put in that list also. Shar, we're seeing such incredible customer growth in the areas that we serve because of population migration. That could be another item that would be a surprise to the upside in a good way. Sustainable cost savings. As we continue the digital transformation, continue grid modernization, continue retirement of the coal fleet, all of those things will give us an opportunity to continue to drive O&M out.
And I do think regulatory lag, if we can find a way to lessen it, the growth is going to be strengthened. And so I come to this discussion with a lot of confidence. We have a plan that will achieve the 5% to 7%, and we'll continue to work on the legislation and regulatory reform in a way that will complement the growth and perhaps enhance it, if it moves more quickly."

Where in the Carolinas, in particular, the load centers are further west than the coast, so finding an appropriate transmission path would be important.
I think there's been more conversation in the Carolinas. The governor has joined with other mid-Atlantic governors signing an MOU to say, ""Let's spend more time figuring this out."" There's a study underway to look at the impact to economic development. And so I would say we're monitoring all of this closely. I would think about it as maybe a late 2020, 2030 opportunity in the Carolinas. But nonetheless, we are supportive of finding ways to bring wind into the state as a complement to the solar and nuclear resources that we have that are carbon-free. So I think more to come on that, Stephen, as some of these exploratory processes bear fruit."

The carbon policy report, which is the one that's been led by the Nicholas Institute shouldn't be coming any time. And I would think about it, Steve, as a data point that will be considered in the legislative session along with our IRPs, frankly, that has garnered a lot of stakeholder discussion. We don't expect that carbon policy report to include specific recommendations, but we believe it will be a discussion of retirement of coal, carbon pricing, clean energy standard, et cetera. And the stakeholders that have been involved in all of these processes, integrated resource plan, clean energy, policy discussions that the governor sponsored, the regulatory reform, all of those stakeholders have been working together quite well over the course of the year. And when I talked about common objectives, what I was really speaking to is a common objective that has come out of all of that. Common objectives around retirement of coal. Common objectives around increasing renewable, regulatory reform, et cetera. So it's that bringing together of those common objectives that is being worked on to try to advance where we go from here, and I'm optimistic that we have a number of very informed stakeholder groups that have common views of positioning North Carolina for the future. And I think progress will come from that. There's also a keen focus in that group on reliability and affordability, which we also strongly endorse and come to the conversation with very low prices against national averages, and we'll be working actively to make sure we make progress within that construct as well."

And we would expect an order from the North Carolina Commission yet this year, probably in the fall. And the North Carolina Commission doesn't approve, but rather provide comments, perspectives on what they've seen. And so it becomes a data point, right, not only for the legislative process, but also for the commission on how we're thinking about the future. And stakeholder parties will have an opportunity to weigh in and discuss.
In South Carolina, the IRP will be approved or reviewed, and an order will be issued by the commission. This is consistent with Act 62, which you may remember, being a requirement in South Carolina. We believe our IRP conforms with those requirements, extensive stakeholder engagement and analysis of coal retirements and analysis of rate impact. So we should expect to hear from the South Carolina Commission in June.
The legislative session, the bills would be introduced in this legislative session in April. Crossover dates are in May. So the legislative session is also running, Julien, in the first half of the year. And so I could think about all these things as complementary.

When you have a base rate case, you'll build up investments up to that point and then the new rates will work on the return. So you'll see some movements around a rate case like that.
But over a broad period, as you've seen in the across our footprint, we've been very capable of earning our allowed returns on a growing rate base.

So many of you have already had a chance to meet and talk with Jack, but you can look forward to more interaction with him as we go forward.
So good morning to all of you. It's great to be with you for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. We begin the year with significant momentum on strategic, regulatory and stakeholder fronts, and I'm very optimistic about our future heading into 2021.
Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $5.12 for the year, putting us solidly within our updated guidance range for 2020. These results reflect the strength of our regulated utilities, our commitment to generating sustainable shareholder value and our financial agility, especially in response to the unique difficulties of this past year. We also affirmed our 2021 guidance range of $5 to $5.30, with a midpoint of $5.15 and our recently increased a long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025 based off the midpoint of our 2021 guidance range.
Like most companies, 2020 presented us with new challenges, and I'm extremely proud of how we responded. We faced those challenges head on, swiftly responding to the COVID-19 pandemic to support our customers and our workforce, adjusting our plans after removing Atlantic Coast pipeline, producing $450 million in mitigation actions and responding to significant storms throughout the year. All of this was made possible by our employees who showed incredible results as they adjusted to new working conditions, identified cost savings and operational improvements and maintained reliable service for our customers. In short, we did more than just get through 2020. We adapted and delivered learning new ways of working that will benefit us in the years ahead.
The momentum from 2020 has continued into 2021. And turning to Slide 5. Duke Energy has made significant progress, resolving uncertainties around our company and laying a solid foundation for growth into the future. Slide 5 captures the myriad accomplishment that the Duke Energy team delivered, all providing benefits to our customers and our investors and allowing us to turn our full attention to advancing our goal to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050.
In North Carolina, we reached a milestone settlement with the State Attorney General Public Staff and Sierra Club to close the debate around coal ash cost recovery. We're pleased with this balanced compromise, resolved several outstanding issues, including the remand of the 2017 rate cases and the pending 2019 rate cases. It also provides greater clarity and recovery of coal ash costs incurred through early 2030 and preserves our ability to earn an equity return on deferred coal ash costs. This settlement complements the previous settlement reached in the summer of 2020 on ROE and capital structure and again demonstrates our commitment to working collaboratively with stakeholders in our jurisdictions. We look forward to the commission's order, addressing these settlements and the remaining issues in the case.
We also developed innovative IRPs in the Carolina as outlined in comprehensive proposals and offering 6 portfolios to meet key carbon reduction milestones over the next 15 years. And for the past year, we've been working with stakeholder groups to help shape North Carolina's Clean Energy Plan with a common goal of reaching net-zero carbon in a way that best serves our customers. This complements the efforts underway on regulatory reform and introducing more efficient cost recovery mechanisms.
Shifting to Florida. We worked with business and consumer groups, including the Office of Public Counsel, to propose a new 3-year settlement, giving our investors and customers clear visibility through 2024. This settlement includes multiyear base rate increases to recover significant investments in the grid, solar generation and electric vehicle infrastructure. It also allows for the accelerated depreciation of coal plants and supports innovative technology pilot programs that are important to achieving our carving goals in Clean Energy future. We expect an order from the Florida Commission by the end of the second quarter with rates effective in January of 2022.
Beyond the multiyear rate plan, we also received approval of the first 3 years of our storm protection plans, representing a $6 billion investment in grid hardening projects over the next 10 years.
In Indiana, we recently announced the GIC, a global investment firm with significant experience investing in U.S. infrastructure companies, will become a minority investor in Duke Energy, Indiana. For $2.05 billion, GIC will acquire a 19.9% ownership stake with governance rights commensurate with their equity ownership. GIC highlighted that our proven track record of high performance and clear commitment to a Clean Energy transition makes this an attractive partnership for them.
The transaction values our DEI utility at an attractive multiple to our current stock valuation, providing an efficient source of financing for our business and allowing us to eliminate all common equity from our 5-year plan. The structure of the investment also allows us to better match financing with capital needs, bringing $1 billion into our company in 2021 and the second tranche no later than January of 2023. This investment is a strong endorsement of our company and in Duke Energy, Indiana, our operations, employees and opportunities for growth. It is also a strong endorsement of our overall strategy to be a leader in Clean Energy transformation.
We also significantly expanded our renewable footprint in our regulated and commercial businesses, announcing more than 700 megawatts of solar and wind energy projects, and we built momentum around electric vehicle pilot program, which was further amplified by our own pledge to electrify the Duke Energy fleet.
In turning to Tennessee, we reached a constructive settlement in our Piedmont Natural Gas rate case with the Attorney General's Consumer Advocate Division. This is our first general rate case in Tennessee in almost 9 years, allowing us to recover needed infrastructure investments to serve our growing customer base in and around Nashville. This is an impressive list of accomplishments, and we will keep going with a clear Clean Energy vision and growth in the 5% to 7% range, underpinned by a robust capital plan, constructive jurisdictions, operational excellence and a diverse committed workforce.
Shifting to Slide 6. We began 2021 with a clear vision for the future to lead the Clean Energy transition in our communities. Our goal is captured clearly in our climate strategy, at least 50% carbon reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050. We crossed a major milestone in 2020, surpassing 40% carbon reduction from 2005 levels and we're poised to hit more milestones in the years to come. Our road map to success involves close collaboration with key stakeholders, an accelerated move from coal and into cleaner forms of generation, including renewables and battery storage, the modernization of our grid to enable more clean energy and an unwavering commitment to reliability and affordability.
2021 is an important year on this journey. In North Carolina stakeholder discussions initiated by the Governor's Clean Energy Plan are beginning to wrap up. These conversations have been very helpful in creating a common understanding among the interested parties on Clean Energy principles and the regulatory changes needed to effectuate a generation transition. As the 2021 legislative session begins, we believe both stakeholders and policymakers will benefit from this work as well as the information found in the comprehensive IRPs we filed last summer.
Those resource plans present several pathways that illustrate the trade-offs between the pace of transition and cost implications. We look forward to working with legislators and stakeholders over the next several weeks and months to evaluate the various options. And we are optimistic about the policies that can be created from shared objectives around North Carolina's Clean Energy transition as well as the regulatory reforms that provide for timely recovery of these investments.
In Indiana, we will continue our critical grid improvement projects and further our Clean Energy transition as we file our 2021 IRP this November. In Florida, our recent settlement outlines a clear path for further renewable and EV investment in the state through 2024 and the accelerated retirement of coal plants.
And at the federal level, we will work closely with policymakers as the Biden administration reenters the Paris Agreement and sets a national policy that advances our country's transition to clean energy. We look forward to adding our voice to this important discussion, ensuring that the policies strategically integrate emissions reductions, cost considerations and the promotion of a broad range of technology development. Our objectives are clear and will create value for all of our stakeholders. Our climate strategy is our growth strategy, and our relentless commitment to our bold climate targets means we are leading the transition to clean energy.
Our aggressive $59 billion capital plan is among the largest in the industry, placing us at the forefront of clean energy at scale. We're confident this capital will generate value for our growing constructive jurisdictions and provide clean affordable energy for the more than 25 million customers we serve every day. This capital plan positions Duke to achieve earnings growth of 5% to 7% based off the 2021 midpoint of $5.15. I'm very proud of our results and excited about Duke Energy's path forward.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve."

We delivered results within our guidance range, overcame headwinds and leveraged our size and scale to position the company for significant growth in the years ahead.
As shown on Slide 7, our full year reported and adjusted earnings per share were $1.72 and $5.12 as compared to $5.06 of reported and adjusted earnings per share in 2019. We took swift and decisive action to mitigate the challenges we faced this year. We did not allow COVID-19, mild weather, storms and the loss of ACP earnings to define our path forward. And this commitment and dexterity enabled us to deliver solidly within our narrow 2020 earnings guidance range.
Our 2020 results were driven by strong execution across each of our operating segments, growth from our rate case execution in Indiana and Kentucky, interim rates in North Carolina and continued growth from our Florida operations through their multiyear rate plan and SoBRA mechanisms, produced positive results in electric utilities and infrastructure. We also saw growth in our Carolina's wholesale business due to the new formula rate contract that was effective this year. These factors were offset by regulatory lag and our growing asset base, milder weather and dilution from equity issuances.
Shifting to Gas Utilities & Infrastructure, we saw higher results in our LDC businesses, primarily due to Piedmont's rate case in North Carolina and contributions from rider mechanisms. The gas LDCs continue to provide strong earnings growth, adding $0.11, driven by customer additions and investments in integrity management, but offset by the cancellation of ACP in July.
Results in commercial renewables were higher than 2019, driven by new projects placed in service, including Palmer, Holstein and Rambler, which together totaled 460 megawatts. Going forward, we continue to plan for this segment to deliver between $200 million and $250 million of net income per year over the 5-year plan with the potential for upside that projects meet our return expectations.
Having accomplished a lot in 2020, we turned to 2021 well positioned to achieve our adjusted EPS guidance range of $5 to $5.30 with a $5.15 midpoint.
Turning to Slide 8. Our financial outlook for 2021 and beyond is strong and rooted in our increased capital investment plan. Our core utilities continue to generate solid growth, driving our earnings results upward for the foreseeable future. For Electric Utilities & Infrastructure, growth in 2021 will come from our customer additions and infrastructure investments across our franchises. In the Carolinas, we will experience growth from revised rates in our current pending rate cases.
In Florida, we expect strong earnings contributions as we move into the final year of our multiyear rate plan, coupled with growth in solar via the SoBRA mechanism. In 2021, we'll continue to benefit from the steady growth of our T&D infrastructure investments in the Midwest, along with new effective rates in Indiana and Kentucky. As the economy continues to rebound from the pandemic, we forecast our 2021 low growth in the 1% to 2% range across our entire footprint, driven by some of the strongest customer growth we have seen in recent years.
Our Gas Utilities & Infrastructure segment provides consistent and steady growth, largely driven by our organic customer additions and integrity management investments. These investments will translate to revenues through riders and base rate adjustment mechanisms in our LDCs, such as the recent rate settlement filed in Tennessee.
In commercial renewables, in 2021, we will deliver annual earnings solidly in the $200 million to $250 million range and throughout the 5-year plan. We expect the other segment to be lower year-over-year. This is primarily due to favorable tax optimization in 2020 not producing the same level of contributions in 2021 and the expectation of lower market returns in our captive insurance program and grant or trust. Finally, we have adjusted our plans to reflect the cancellation of ACP and the full year impact of the $2.5 billion equity forward transaction that closed in December of 2020. Including this, we expect growth in our core businesses of 6% in 2021.
Turning to Slide 9. Let me touch on electric volumes and economic trends. We operate in constructive and growing jurisdictions. That said, like most utilities, we saw a decline in retail load for 2020 given the impact of the pandemic. While residential volumes were up 3% for the year, that did not offset the lower volumes from commercial and industrial customers. As we look at customer growth, we experienced very positive trends closing out 2020 with 1.8% growth for the year. This was favorable to the projections we originally shared in May of last year and affirms we operate in high-growth states. In fact, our franchises serve 4 of the top 8 states in terms of positive population migration.
We project an overall increase in electricity consumption in 2021 of 1% to 2% over 2020, given many of our commercial and industrial customers continue to return to normal operations. We expect the metrics for residential may decline a bit as people begin to return to the workplace following the mass distribution of the COVID vaccine. Over the 5-year plan, we project load growth of 0.5% to 1% as the economy returns to pre-COVID status.
On Slide 10, you will see the transformative work underway to lower our cost structure and bolster our growth potential. Duke Energy is a leader in the industry when it comes to cost mitigation, driven by digital capabilities, data analytics and retraining and reskilling employees, which serves -- which drives a more versatile workforce. Taken together, these factors result in meaningful and sustainable savings.
When 2020 began with weaker weather and storms, we initiated tactical business matters to significantly reduce our O&M costs. And in response to the pandemic in the first quarter, we accelerated these mitigations to offset projected impacts. By the end of the year, we delivered $450 million of mitigation. This included $320 million of O&M savings, equivalent to more than 6% of our 2020 nonrider recoverable O&M. And this was done with a keen focus on minimizing the impacts to employee jobs.
While certain cost savings in 2020 were onetime opportunities, we have identified many others that are sustainable, which will ultimately benefit our customers and shareholders over the long term. These sustainable savings of approximately $200 million are underpinned by our versatile workforce who continue to adopt advanced technologies to perform work with increased efficiencies, allowing us to take advantage of attrition, reduce employee expenses and minimize facilities costs. For the past 5 years, our net regulated electric and gas O&M has a decline approximately 1% per year, even with the acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas and we expect this downward trend to continue.
Moving to Slide 11. As Lynn discussed, we have a robust capital plan of $59 billion over the 5-year planning period. About 70% of this capital investment will be geared towards investments in clean energy and the grid infrastructure that supports it. We expect the Clean Energy transformation to ramp up over the 5-year period and grow even further to $65 billion to $75 billion when we enter the back half of the decade. This will be largely driven by more coal plant retirements and the acceleration of renewables. We expect to gain more clarity around this projection as our states make important carbon policy decisions. These investments across our electric and LDC franchises position us for a 5-year rate base CAGR of approximately 6.5%. For the next 5-year period ending in 2029, we see that growth accelerating to 7% based on our growing capital needs during this transition and transformation.
Turning to Slide 12. Our growing capital plan, vibrant franchise service area growth and proven capability to control cost and work constructively to stakeholders to move through regulatory processes give us confidence in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted earnings per share of 5% to 7% throughout the 5-year period. Bear in mind, this capital plan assumes the lower-end carbon reduction scenarios in the Carolinas.
Moving to Slide 13. Our ability to execute on our robust capital program is underpinned by a healthy balance sheet and solid credit ratings. We announced a $2.05 billion minority investment in our Indiana utility, where we will remain majority owner and sole operator. This private equity investment by a reputable infrastructure investor demonstrates the premium valuation of our regulated utilities addresses all equity needs for the next 5 years and supports a strong balance sheet that allows access to low-cost capital. The equity from the Indiana transaction, along with our overall financing plan, allows us to maintain a healthy credit profile, targeting a consolidated FFO to debt ratio of 14%.
Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 14. We are positioned to deliver results for our shareholders and are confident in the 2021 base year EPS guidance and robust capital plan we have laid out for you. Our focus on the future, sound investment strategy and demonstrated dexterity position us to consistently deliver within our increased 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rate through 2025. Our commitment to the dividend remains unchanged. We understand how important it is to our shareholders and that's why 2021 will mark the 95th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend. We intend to keep growing the Duke Energy dividend, balancing our desire to offer investors a strong payout with our need to fund our capital plans.
As Lynn said in our opening remarks, 2020, the early part of 2021 have been transformative for Duke Energy and we lean into the next decade with anticipation and resolve to achieve our goals for our customers and our shareholders.
With that, we'll open the line for your questions."

When -- obviously, you highlight some factors that would provide upside to the base plan, like through acceleration of clean energy, federal legislation.
So to the extent that these items require incremental CapEx, would you kind of consider monetizing additional stakes that you opcos like Indiana similar to the GIC deal versus maybe tapping traditional financing like equity? Obviously, the demand is there for these strategies and the transaction multiple was certainly healthy versus where your stock trades."

It gave us an opportunity to eliminate common stock, as you said, at a valuation that was attractive to our investors and, frankly, recognize the value where we operate in Indiana.
I would say, as we look at this 5-year period, we feel like we've got a pretty strong capital plan. There may be some upside in the back part of the plan, Shar, but I'd look at the Clean Energy transition that's underway, we have some work to do in 2021 and 2022 to lay further groundwork. And so that escalation will be towards the end of the 5-year, continuing over the rest of the decade. We will always look for attractive ways to finance growth. And I think we've demonstrated that with this transaction, but don't have anything in the near term that I would point to. Just reinforce that finding attractive low-cost capital to underpin growth is always an objective, and we're really pleased with what we were able to accomplish with this transaction."

Shar, the first thing I'd like to do is express the confidence we have in achieving 5% to 7%. It has been grounded in not only strong franchise growth, the regulatory certainty we've been able to achieve, including the recent settlement with EAG. The investment opportunities we talked about on decarbonizing and then our ability to control costs, coupled with the transaction with GIC eliminating equity, gives us a really solid foundation for 5% to 7%.
So I'd look at what we've put in front of you is a capital plan and a strategy with a high degree of confidence to achieve 5% to 7%. I think the ability to reach that top end to keep going would include faster acceleration of generation transition, perhaps faster economic recovery. I'd put in that list also. Shar, we're seeing such incredible customer growth in the areas that we serve because of population migration. That could be another item that would be a surprise to the upside in a good way.
Sustainable cost savings. As we continue the digital transformation, continue grid modernization, continue retirement of the coal fleet, all of those things will give us an opportunity to continue to drive O&M out.
And I do think regulatory lag, if we can find a way to lessen it, the growth is going to be strengthened. And so I come to this discussion with a lot of confidence, and we have a plan that we'll achieve the 5% to 7% and we'll continue to work on the legislation and regulatory reform in a way that will complement the growth and perhaps enhance it, if it moves more quickly."

Where in the Carolinas, in particular, the load centers are further west than the coast, so finding an appropriate transmission path would be important.
I think there's been more conversation in the Carolinas. The governor has joined with other mid-Atlantic governors signing an MoU to say, ""Let's spend more time figuring this out."" There's a study underway to look at the impact to economic development. And so I would say we're monitoring all of this closely. I would think about it as maybe a late 2020, 2030 opportunity in the Carolinas.

North Carolina will review the IRP comments due at the end of April. And we would expect an order from the North Carolina Commission yet this year, probably in the fall.

In South Carolina, the IRP will be approved or reviewed and an order will be issued by the commission. This is consistent with Act 62, which you may remember, being a requirement in South Carolina. We believe our IRP conforms with those requirements, extensive stakeholder engagement and analysis of coal retirements and analysis of rate impact. So we should expect to hear from the South Carolina Commission in June.

We'll be able to optimize around that and earn very well there.
Ohio is a similar situation. When you have a base rate case, you'll build up investments up to that point and then the new rates will work on the return. So you'll see some movements around a rate case like that. But over a broad period, as you've seen in the work across our footprint, we've been very capable of earning our allowed returns on a growing rate base.

We're pleased to be with you to share our results and the excellent progress we're making on our strategic initiatives. 
Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 for the quarter, delivering strong results to start the year, driven by growth at our electric utilities. Our first quarter results demonstrate the power of our clean energy strategy and our ability to execute that strategy. We also continue to tightly manage costs that engage stakeholders throughout our business as we develop and implement smart policy solutions. 
With the first quarter behind us and a clear path forward, we are reaffirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5 to $5.30, with a midpoint of $5.15, and our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025 based off the $5.15 midpoint. 
Turning to Slide 5. Just over a year ago, we launched our comprehensive response to COVID-19. And although the pandemic is not behind us, I'm very proud of our response, demonstrating our commitment to health, safety and customer service in the face of very difficult circumstances. 
But as I reflect on the past year, we accomplished so much more. We made the difficult but appropriate decision to step away from the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We hosted a successful ESG Day, clearly articulating our clean energy vision and how we are pursuing the largest fleet transition in the U.S. We actively participated in stakeholder meetings in the Carolinas focused on our clean energy transition and regulatory reforms necessary to recover those investments, laying the groundwork for comprehensive energy legislation. We announced a market-leading transaction with GIC, delivering $2 billion of accretive investment into our company and eliminating the need for equity over the 5-year period. We maintained a sharp focus on our cost structure, operational excellence and customer service, delivering industry-leading safety results and surpassing our internal customer satisfaction target by nearly 15%. We outlined an updated 5-year $59 billion capital plan and raised our growth rate to 5% to 7%. Further, we achieved numerous regulatory outcomes, including the successful completion of our first rate case in Indiana in 16 years resulting in multiyear rate increases, accelerated depreciation of coal plants and recovery of coal ash costs. We reached comprehensive settlements in our North Carolina rate cases with a broad range of stakeholders, which have been approved by the NCUC. We reached a comprehensive settlement on chole ash recovery, providing customers with near-term benefits while establishing recovery with a return in the years to come, which was also approved. And finally, in Florida, we received approval of a new multiyear rate plan as well as the clean energy connection program and the first 3 years of our Storm Protection Plan. 
In light of these accomplishments, which included eliminating uncertainties and creating a clear vision for growth, the stock has performed well, and we're poised to deliver even more in 2021. 
Turning to Slide 6. We're leading the way to cleaner energy and continue to make progress toward our 2030 goals and our target of net fee emissions by 2050. Across our jurisdictions, we're engaging with policymakers and stakeholders to accelerate the transition while keeping a sharp focus on reliability and affordability. 
I wanted to provide an update on the legislative session in North Carolina. As we discussed in February, ongoing work continues to build alignment on the shared objectives that came out of the Clean Energy Plan process. These shared objectives include North Carolina's clean energy transition, as well as the regulatory reforms that provide for timely recovery of these investments. We are now entering the middle phase of the legislative long session and the legislative process, including opportunities to introduce new legislation, is expected to continue into the summer months. We continue to see momentum from a broad range of stakeholders to make progress on these objectives in 2021 and we remain optimistic for comprehensive energy legislation this year, aligned with our shared goals of generation transition and regulatory reforms needed to enable that change. 
Moving to Florida. Our DEF utility continue to enjoy robust growth, deliver strong returns and support important energy infrastructure for the benefit of customers. Our constructive relationship with customer and consumer groups has resulted in the advancement of critical infrastructure investments that accelerate our shared clean energy vision. This was clearly demonstrated with the Public Service Commission's approval of our multiyear base rate settlement on May 4. As the commission noted in the ruling, the settlement was the culmination of extensive engagement with many interested parties, including the Office of Public Counsel. We appreciate the commissioner's complementary remarks on our robust process to reach settlement, keeping the interest of all stakeholders in mind and arriving at a fair and equitable rate design. 
The settlement approval provides clarity through 2024 and includes recovery of significant investments in the grid, solar generation and electric vehicle infrastructure. This settlement builds on our clean energy connection solar program and storm protection plan grid program as we continue to advance our transition to net 0 emissions. 
Our Florida operation, positioned well for the economic rebound, continues to build momentum with investments aligned to our clean energy transition. 
Shifting to Indiana. We're making progress as we move through the state's integrated resource plan process. We've hosted multiple stakeholder sessions, receiving input from various interested parties as we collaborate on the path forward, all while ensuring our system remains reliable as we transition to new energy sources. 
Stakeholders have always been a part of the IRP process in Indiana and their feedback is valuable as we evaluate a number of possible scenarios for future generation. Our filing will be submitted in November of this year, continuing our progress toward the energy transition in the state. 
At the federal level, we are actively engaged with policymakers on climate, infrastructure and tax policy. We support policies that pave the way to net 0 emissions, while ensuring customer affordability and reliability. We also support investments in research and development for new clean technologies, which will be critical to achieving net 0. To that end, we see permitting reform as a solution to help streamline the process to build infrastructure without compromising community involvement and environmental protection. Electrification has also entered the climate discussions and represents an exciting opportunity to address transportation sector emissions. 
In the months ahead, we expect more clarity in the form and content of these policies, potentially an infrastructure bill, tax incentive extensions and regulatory proposals, among others. We will continue to advocate for policies that support and accelerate our clean energy transition, emphasizing the importance and maintaining affordability and reliability for our customers. We will keep you informed along the way. It's important at this early stage, however, to recognize that we see great alignment between our vision of a net 0 clean energy future and the policies that are being discussed. 
Shifting to Slide 7. It's clear our industry is transforming, and the pace of change is increasing. Duke Energy is not only keeping pace with this change, but we are at the forefront. Our transition to net 0 is enabled by our growing capital plan, which in the back half of the decade ranges from $65 billion to $75 billion. This range of investment is consistent with our integrated resource plan filings and includes up to 15 to 20 gigawatts of additional renewable investment, tripling the amount of renewables on our system by 2030. We are also planning for retirements of 7 gigawatts of coal-only capacity, an amount that could increase as policies and regulations continue to unfold in this decade. 
The ultimate pace of our clean energy transition will be shaped by a variety of factors, including state and federal clean energy regulations and policies. We are actively engaged with policymakers and regulators on this important topic and are prepared to move as quickly as state and federal regulation and policy allow. We remain confident in achieving our carbon reduction and earnings growth goals as we continue the execution of our clean energy vision, creating value for our customers and growth for our investors. 
Shifting to Slide 8. We carried our momentum forward in our environmental, social and governance commitments following our ESG Day and fourth quarter call in February. In April, we released our 15th consecutive sustainability report outlining our tremendous progress during 2020, and we've reached additional milestones in just the last few months. 
In March, we retired a 270-megawatt coal unit in DEC ahead of schedule, marking the 52nd coal unit closed across the enterprise. We also announced the accelerated closure of our Gallagher Station in Indiana, bringing the retirement forward 1.5 years to June of 2021. These decisions place us another step closer to our goal of removing all coal-only units from our portfolio in the Carolinas by 2030 and advances the targets for our Midwest utilities as well. 
As we retire coal, we are also adding renewables and other clean energy infrastructure across our system. In our Commercial Renewables business, we placed the 350-megawatt Frontier 2 wind farm in service in Oklahoma during the quarter. And in the regulated business, we placed 220 megawatts of solar in service in the Carolinas and Florida. 
Our electric vehicle strategy remains front and center as we continue to position Duke Energy as a key enabler of mass electric vehicle adoption. With commission approvals in the Carolinas and Florida, we're investing $100 million to implement pilot programs to support decarbonization of the electric sector across the southeast. And we had joined the Electric Highway Coalition to help expand chartering infrastructure across the nation's highways, aligned with many of our [ peer ] utilities. 
I'm also pleased to share that we're one of the first in the industry to release EEO diversity data as part of our sustainability report, demonstrating not only our commitment to transparency, but also to moving the needle on our diversity and inclusion metrics across the enterprise. Beyond that, we are one of the first in the industry to issue a report detailing our trade association memberships and their positions on climate change. It's these types of disclosures and transparent reporting that have earned us top rankings for investor transparency. 
And finally, last week, we announced 3 new directors to join our Board, maintaining a strong focus on diversity as well as bringing a wide range of backgrounds and skills to the table. 
Each of these steps highlights our keen focus on ESG priorities, and we look forward to sharing additional updates throughout the year as we make progress on our strategy. 
With the first quarter behind us and a clearly defined strategy ahead of us, I'm confident in Duke Energy's strong growth trajectory and believe our investment plan will deliver sustainable value and 5% to 7% growth over the next 5 years. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Steve."

I'll start with a brief discussion on our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances in the prior year.

I'll start with a brief discussion on our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances in the prior year. For a more detailed information on the various drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. 
As shown on Slide 9, our first quarter reported earnings per share were $1.25 and our adjusted earnings per share were $1.26. This is compared to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.24 and $1.14 last year. Please see our non-GAAP reconciliation, including in the earnings release, for more details. 
Within the segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was up $0.15 compared to the prior year. Results were favorable due to benefits from base rate increases in North Carolina, Florida, Indiana and Kentucky, weather year-over-year and timing of O&M expenses. Partially offsetting these items were lower retail and wholesale volumes and higher depreciation costs on our growing investment base. 
Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, results were flat year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by continued margin growth at the LDCs and new retail rates in Tennessee, offset by the cancellation of ACP last year. 
In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were down $0.04 for the quarter, largely driven by the impact of the Texas weather event. 
Other was favorable $0.06 for the quarter, principally due to higher market returns and certain benefit plans as well as lower holding company financing costs. 
Finally, segment results are impacted by the allocation of dilution related to the $2.5 billion equity forward that settled in December 2020, which totaled $0.05 for the quarter. 
Overall, we were pleased with the strong results compared to last year, further illustrating how we continue to execute on our business and regulatory strategies. It's these excellent results and our strong start to the year that ensure we are well positioned to meet the 2021 guidance we shared in February. We remain confident in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted earnings per share at 5% to 7% throughout the 5-year period off of the 2021 base year. 
Turning to Slide 10. Let me provide an overview of electric volumes and economic trends. Our results for the first quarter were down approximately 1% year-over-year. Keep in mind that we are comparing sales data to a quarter last year that had little impact from COVID-19. 
Residential volumes were up 2.6% over last year, driven by continued strong customer growth in our service territories and ongoing remote learning and work-from-home policies. 
The winter surge in COVID-19 cases impacted our commercial class, which was down 5% for the quarter. As vaccination rates continue to climb and the restrictions ease, we expect a strong improvement in the commercial class through the rest of the year. 
While industrial volumes were down 2% for the quarter, nearly all of our large commercial and industrial customers have resumed or operations and the sector is showing signs of optimism. 
The ISM Manufacturing Index, a key indicator of economic activity, was 64.7 in March, its highest reading since 1983. 
As we look back, we continue to expect 1% to 2% load growth in 2021. This is supported by our early look at April volumes, which showed strong sales across all customer classes. 
Our service territories are well positioned for sustained growth over the long term. We operate in 4 of the top 8 states for population migration, a testament to the attractive business environments of our service territories, and electricity rates well below the national average. In fact, Apple recently announced a $1 billion investment in North Carolina that will bring 3,000 jobs to the research triangle area, highlighting the governor's commitment to economic development in the state. 
Turning to Slide 11. We remain active in the regulatory arena, engaging stakeholders as we see constructive outcomes and smart solutions for our customers. 
In North Carolina, we received orders in our DEC and DEP rate cases which approved key settlements we reached with interveners. These settlements incorporate significant infrastructure investment, providing benefits to our customers. The orders include approval of a 9.6% ROE and 52% equity capital structure deferral treatment for approximately $1.2 billion in grid improvement plan projects and resolution of coal ash recovery through early 2030. We have also mitigated customer rate increases with EDIT flowback from the 2018 tax rate change and strong cost securitization. Overall, we are very pleased with the outcomes in these rate cases. 
As Lynn noted, our settlement in Florida was approved last week. The settlement includes investments in renewables and the grid, the approval of an ROE band of 8.85% to 10.85% and a 53% equity capital structure. Importantly, the ROE band also includes a trigger mechanism that protects against rising interest rates. Additionally, it approves accelerated depreciation for coal plants and the Vision Florida Program, which funds $100 million in emerging technologies. 
Turning to our LDC business. Our Tennessee gas rate case settlement was approved. 
Looking forward, we expect to complete 2 rate filings this year. [indiscernible] filed a North Carolina rate case in March which includes investments in our Robeson LNG facility, pipeline integrity management and system infrastructure growth to support our rapidly growing customer base. We expect an evidentiary hearing in September and new rates to be effective later this year. 
And in Kentucky, we submitted our prefiling notice on April 30, indicating our intention to file a natural gas rate case in June. 
Our ability to execute on our robust capital plan and grow our investment base is underpinned by a healthy balance sheet and solid credit ratings. So far this year, we have raised approximately $1.4 billion in long-term debt for DEC and Piedmont, with both transactions pricing at very attractive rates. 
We expect to close the first tranche of the minority sale of Duke Energy Indiana to GIC by the middle of this year and are on track to complete the North Carolina storm securitization in 2021.
The proceeds from the GIC transaction, along with our overall financing plan, allow us to maintain a strong credit profile without the need for common equity issuances throughout the 5-year plan. 
Looking ahead to second quarter and beyond, I want to provide some perspective on timing considerations for the balance of the year. Our expectations are that volumes will recover over the balance of the year with a 1% to 2% increase over 2020. Having said that, our second quarter will reflect the cancellation of ACP. And as we discussed in the year-end call, we expect O&M to be unfavorable in the second and third quarters due to the significant COVID mitigation actions we took in the spring and summer of 2020. 
Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 13. We remain confident in our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.30 with a midpoint of $5.15. Our first quarter results position us well to achieve full year results within this range as we continue to invest in important energy infrastructure that our communities value. Our attractive dividend yield, coupled with our long-term earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. 
As Lynn discussed in her opening remarks, we continue to advance our clean energy strategy with a keen focus on affordability and reliability, keeping customers at the center of all we do. Duke Energy is well positioned to lead as the pace of change in our industry accelerates, delivering sustainable value to our customers and investors. 
With that, we'll open the line for your questions."

So the administration, the environmental communities, solar developers, industrial customers, Duke Energy, others have been at the table, and there is broad support to move forward in 2021. 
I think the other thing that's important to note, which I tried to emphasize in the remarks, is we're in the middle of the session. But that legislative process, which includes the opportunity to introduce bills, will continue and is expected to continue well into the summer. 
So one thing I would just point out is if we think back to 2017 when House Bill 589 was moving, it was actually introduced in June, which was well passed crossover dates, and then became law at the end of July.

Some wind availability in terms of resource capability in Indiana, more so than in the Carolinas. Solar is available but would have a slightly different capacity profile than in the southeast, as you can imagine. 
And so we have been in active conversations in Indiana on the appropriate transition for some time. You may recall that in the rate case that was approved in July, we actually accelerated depreciation, shortening the lives of the -- of the assets. And the legislature in Indiana has also undertaken a review and a clean energy task force of how the state can keep making progress. And so we see this IRP filing is a way for us to continue discussions with all the parties, how can we accelerate, how can Indiana maintain control of their destiny, how can we bring in renewables in a cost-effective way, is there a role for natural gas as we move away from coal. And good conversations are underway and expect to have more to say as we get closer to that filing, Stephen, but I would share with you that we're building on conversations that have been underway in the state for some time."

And good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be with you to share our results and the excellent progress we're making on our strategic initiatives.
Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 for the quarter, delivering strong results to start the year, driven by growth at our electric utilities. Our first quarter results demonstrate the power of our clean energy strategy and our ability to execute that strategy. We also continue to tightly manage costs that engage stakeholders throughout our business as we develop and implement smart policy solutions.
With the first quarter behind us and a clear path forward, we are reaffirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5 to $5.30, with a midpoint of $5.15, and our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025 based off the $5.15 midpoint.
Turning to Slide 5. Just over a year ago, we launched our comprehensive response to COVID-19. And although the pandemic is not behind us, I'm very proud of our response, demonstrating our commitment to health, safety and customer service in the face of very difficult circumstances.
But as I reflect on the past year, we accomplished so much more. We made the difficult but appropriate decision to step away from the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We hosted a successful ESG Day, clearly articulating our clean energy vision and how we are pursuing the largest fleet transition in the U.S. We actively participated in stakeholder meetings in the Carolinas focused on our clean energy transition and regulatory reforms necessary to recover those investments, laying the groundwork for comprehensive energy legislation. We announced a market-leading transaction with GIC, delivering $2 billion of accretive investment into our company and eliminating the need for equity over the 5-year period. We maintained a sharp focus on our cost structure, operational excellence and customer service, delivering industry-leading safety results and surpassing our internal customer satisfaction target by nearly 15%. We outlined an updated 5-year $59 billion capital plan and raised our growth rate to 5% to 7%.
Further, we achieved numerous regulatory outcomes, including the successful completion of our first rate case in Indiana in 16 years resulting in multiyear rate increases, accelerated depreciation of coal plants and recovery of coal ash costs. We reached comprehensive settlements in our North Carolina rate cases with a broad range of stakeholders, which have been approved by the NCUC. We reached a comprehensive settlement on coal ash recovery, providing customers with near-term benefits while establishing recovery with a return in the years to come, which was also approved. And finally, in Florida, we received approval of a new multiyear rate plan as well as the Clean Energy Connection Program and the first 3 years of our Storm Protection Plan.
In light of these accomplishments, which included eliminating uncertainties and creating a clear vision for growth, the stock has performed well, and we're poised to deliver even more in 2021.
Turning to Slide 6. We're leading the way to cleaner energy and continue to make progress toward our 2030 goals and our target of net zero emissions by 2050. Across our jurisdictions, we're engaging with policymakers and stakeholders to accelerate the transition while keeping a sharp focus on reliability and affordability.
I wanted to provide an update on the legislative session in North Carolina. As we discussed in February, ongoing work continues to build alignment on the shared objectives that came out of the Clean Energy Plan process. These shared objectives include North Carolina's clean energy transition, as well as the regulatory reforms that provide for timely recovery of these investments.
We are now entering the middle phase of the legislative long session and the legislative process, including opportunities to introduce new legislation, is expected to continue into the summer months. We continue to see momentum from a broad range of stakeholders to make progress on these objectives in 2021 and we remain optimistic for comprehensive energy legislation this year, aligned with our shared goals of generation transition and regulatory reforms needed to enable that change.
Moving to Florida. Our DEF utility continue to enjoy robust growth, deliver strong returns and support important energy infrastructure for the benefit of customers. Our constructive relationship with customer and consumer groups has resulted in the advancement of critical infrastructure investments that accelerate our shared clean energy vision. This was clearly demonstrated with the Public Service Commission's approval of our multiyear base rate settlement on May 4.
As the commission noted in the ruling, the settlement was the culmination of extensive engagement with many interested parties, including the Office of Public Counsel. We appreciate the commissioner's complementary remarks on our robust process to reach settlement, keeping the interest of all stakeholders in mind and arriving at a fair and equitable rate design.
The settlement approval provides clarity through 2024 and includes recovery of significant investments in the grid, solar generation and electric vehicle infrastructure. This settlement builds on our Clean Energy Connection solar program and Storm Protection Plan grid program as we continue to advance our transition to net zero emissions.
Our Florida operation, positioned well for the economic rebound, continues to build momentum with investments aligned to our clean energy transition.
Shifting to Indiana. We're making progress as we move through the state's integrated resource plan process. We've hosted multiple stakeholder sessions, receiving input from various interested parties as we collaborate on the path forward, all while ensuring our system remains reliable as we transition to new energy sources. Stakeholders have always been a part of the IRP process in Indiana, and their feedback is valuable as we evaluate a number of possible scenarios for future generation. Our filing will be submitted in November of this year, continuing our progress toward the energy transition in the state.
At the federal level, we are actively engaged with policymakers on climate, infrastructure and tax policy. We support policies that pave the way to net zero emissions, while ensuring customer affordability and reliability. We also support investments in research and development for new clean technologies, which will be critical to achieving net zero. To that end, we see permitting reform as a solution to help streamline the process to build infrastructure without compromising community involvement and environmental protections. Electrification has also entered the climate discussions and represents an exciting opportunity to address transportation sector emissions.
In the months ahead, we expect more clarity in the form and content of these policies, potentially an infrastructure bill, tax incentive extensions and regulatory proposals, among others. We will continue to advocate for policies that support and accelerate our clean energy transition, emphasizing the importance and maintaining affordability and reliability for our customers. We will keep you informed along the way. It's important at this early stage, however, to recognize that we see great alignment between our vision of a net zero clean energy future and the policies that are being discussed.
Shifting to Slide 7. It's clear our industry is transforming, and the pace of change is increasing. Duke Energy is not only keeping pace with this change, but we are at the forefront. Our transition to net zero is enabled by our growing capital plan, which in the back half of the decade ranges from $65 billion to $75 billion. This range of investment is consistent with our integrated resource plan filings and includes up to 15 to 20 gigawatts of additional renewable investment, tripling the amount of renewables on our system by 2030. We are also planning for retirements of 7 gigawatts of coal-only capacity, an amount that could increase as policies and regulations continue to unfold in this decade.
The ultimate pace of our clean energy transition will be shaped by a variety of factors, including state and federal clean energy regulations and policies. We are actively engaged with policymakers and regulators on this important topic and are prepared to move as quickly as state and federal regulation and policy allow. We remain confident in achieving our carbon reduction and earnings growth goals as we continue the execution of our clean energy vision, creating value for our customers and growth for our investors.
Shifting to Slide 8. We carried our momentum forward in our environmental, social and governance commitments following our ESG Day and fourth quarter call in February. In April, we released our 15th consecutive sustainability report outlining our tremendous progress during 2020, and we've reached additional milestones in just the last few months.
In March, we retired a 270-megawatt coal unit in DEC ahead of schedule, marking the 52nd coal unit closed across the enterprise. We also announced the accelerated closure of our Gallagher Station in Indiana, bringing the retirement forward 1.5 years to June of 2021. These decisions place us another step closer to our goal of removing all coal-only units from our portfolio in the Carolinas by 2030 and advances the targets for our Midwest utilities as well.
As we retire coal, we are also adding renewables and other clean energy infrastructure across our system. In our Commercial Renewables business, we placed the 350-megawatt Frontier II wind farm in service in Oklahoma during the quarter. And in the regulated business, we placed 220 megawatts of solar in service in the Carolinas and Florida.
Our electric vehicle strategy remains front and center as we continue to position Duke Energy as a key enabler of mass electric vehicle adoption. With commission approvals in the Carolinas and Florida, we're investing $100 million to implement pilot programs to support decarbonization of the electric sector across the southeast. And we had joined the Electric Highway Coalition to help expand chartering infrastructure across the nation's highways, aligned with many of our peer utilities.
I'm also pleased to share that we're one of the first in the industry to release EEO diversity data as part of our sustainability report, demonstrating not only our commitment to transparency, but also to moving the needle on our diversity and inclusion metrics across the enterprise. Beyond that, we are one of the first in the industry to issue a report detailing our trade association memberships and their positions on climate change. It's these types of disclosures and transparent reporting that have earned us top rankings for investor transparency.
And finally, last week, we announced 3 new directors to join our Board, maintaining a strong focus on diversity as well as bringing a wide range of backgrounds and skills to the table. Each of these steps highlights our keen focus on ESG priorities, and we look forward to sharing additional updates throughout the year as we make progress on our strategy.
With the first quarter behind us and a clearly defined strategy ahead of us, I'm confident in Duke Energy's strong growth trajectory and believe our investment plan will deliver sustainable value and 5% to 7% growth over the next 5 years.
And with that, let me turn it over to Steve."

I'll start with a brief discussion on our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances in the prior year. For a more detailed information on the various drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation.
As shown on Slide 9, our first quarter reported earnings per share were $1.25 and our adjusted earnings per share were $1.26. This is compared to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.24 and $1.14 last year. Please see our non-GAAP reconciliation including in the earnings release for more details.
Within the segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was up $0.15 compared to the prior year. Results were favorable due to benefits from base rate increases in North Carolina, Florida, Indiana and Kentucky, weather year-over-year and timing of O&M expenses. Partially offsetting these items were lower retail and wholesale volumes and higher depreciation costs on our growing investment base.
Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, results were flat year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by continued margin growth at the LDCs and new retail rates in Tennessee, offset by the cancellation of ACP last year.
In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were down $0.04 for the quarter, largely driven by the impact of the Texas weather event. Other was favorable $0.06 for the quarter, principally due to higher market returns and certain benefit plans as well as lower holding company financing costs. Finally, segment results are impacted by the allocation of dilution related to the $2.5 billion equity forward that settled in December 2020, which totaled $0.05 for the quarter.
Overall, we were pleased with the strong results compared to last year, further illustrating how we continue to execute on our business and regulatory strategies. It's these excellent results and our strong start to the year that ensure we are well positioned to meet the 2021 guidance we shared in February. We remain confident in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted earnings per share at 5% to 7% throughout the 5-year period off of the 2021 base year.
Turning to Slide 10. Let me provide an overview of electric volumes and economic trends. Our results for the first quarter were down approximately 1% year-over-year. Keep in mind that we are comparing sales data to a quarter last year that had little impact from COVID-19.
Residential volumes were up 2.6% over last year, driven by continued strong customer growth in our service territories and ongoing remote learning and work-from-home policies. The winter surge in COVID-19 cases impacted our commercial class, which was down 5% for the quarter. As vaccination rates continue to climb and restrictions ease, we expect a strong improvement in the commercial class through the rest of the year. While industrial volumes were down 2% for the quarter, nearly all of our large commercial and industrial customers have resumed or operations and the sector is showing signs of optimism.
The ISM Manufacturing Index, a key indicator of economic activity, was 64.7 in March, its highest reading since 1983. As we look back, we continue to expect 1% to 2% load growth in 2021. This is supported by our early look at April volumes, which showed strong sales across all customer classes.
Our service territories are well positioned for sustained growth over the long term. We operate in 4 of the top 8 states for population migration, a testament to the attractive business environments of our service territories, and electricity rates well below the national average. In fact, Apple recently announced a $1 billion investment in North Carolina that will bring 3,000 jobs to the research triangle area, highlighting the governor's commitment to economic development in the state.
Turning to Slide 11. We remain active in the regulatory arena, engaging stakeholders as we see constructive outcomes and smart solutions for our customers. In North Carolina, we received orders in our DEC and DEP rate cases which approved key settlements we reached with interveners. These settlements incorporate significant infrastructure investment, providing benefits to our customers. The orders include approval of a 9.6% ROE and 52% equity capital structure deferral treatment for approximately $1.2 billion in grid improvement plan projects and resolution of coal ash recovery through early 2030. We have also mitigated customer rate increases with EDIT flowback from the 2018 tax rate change and strong cost securitization. Overall, we are very pleased with the outcomes in these rate cases.
As Lynn noted, our settlement in Florida was approved last week. The settlement includes investments in renewables and the grid, the approval of an ROE band of 8.85% to 10.85% and a 53% equity capital structure. Importantly, the ROE band also includes a trigger mechanism that protects against rising interest rates. Additionally, it approves accelerated depreciation for coal plants and the Vision Florida program, which funds $100 million in emerging technologies.
Turning to our LDC business. Our Tennessee gas rate case settlement was approved. Looking forward, we expect to complete 2 rate filings this year. Piedmont filed a North Carolina rate case in March which includes investments in our Robeson LNG facility, pipeline integrity management and system infrastructure growth to support our rapidly growing customer base. We expect an evidentiary hearing in September and new rates to be effective later this year. And in Kentucky, we submitted our prefiling notice on April 30, indicating our intention to file a natural gas rate case in June.
Our ability to execute on our robust capital plan and grow our investment base is underpinned by a healthy balance sheet and solid credit ratings. So far this year, we have raised approximately $1.4 billion in long-term debt for DEC and Piedmont, with both transactions pricing at very attractive rates. We expect to close the first tranche of the minority sale of Duke Energy Indiana to GIC by the middle of this year and are on track to complete the North Carolina storm securitization in 2021. The proceeds from the GIC transaction, along with our overall financing plan, allow us to maintain a strong credit profile without the need for common equity issuances throughout the 5-year plan.
Looking ahead to second quarter and beyond, I want to provide some perspective on timing considerations for the balance of the year. Our expectations are that volumes will recover over the balance of the year with a 1% to 2% increase over 2020. Having said that, our second quarter will reflect the cancellation of ACP. And as we discussed in the year-end call, we expect O&M to be unfavorable in the second and third quarters due to the significant COVID mitigation actions we took in the spring and summer of 2020.
Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 13. We remain confident in our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.30 with a midpoint of $5.15. Our first quarter results position us well to achieve full year results within this range as we continue to invest in important energy infrastructure that our communities value. Our attractive dividend yield, coupled with our long-term earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders.
As Lynn discussed in her opening remarks, we continue to advance our clean energy strategy with a keen focus on affordability and reliability, keeping customers at the center of all we do. Duke Energy is well positioned to lead as the pace of change in our industry accelerates, delivering sustainable value to our customers and investors.
With that, we'll open the line for your questions."

I think the other thing that's important to note, which I tried to emphasize in the remarks, is we're in the middle of the session. But that legislative process, which includes the opportunity to introduce bills, will continue and is expected to continue well into the summer.
So one thing I would just point out is if we think back to 2017 when House Bill 589 was moving, it was actually introduced in June, which was well past crossover dates, and then became law at the end of July.

And the legislature in Indiana has also undertaken a review and a clean energy task force of how the state can keep making progress.
And so we see this IRP filing is a way for us to continue discussions with all the parties, how can we accelerate, how can Indiana maintain control of their destiny, how can we bring in renewables in a cost-effective way, is there a role for natural gas as we move away from coal. And good conversations are underway and expect to have more to say as we get closer to that filing, Stephen, but I would share with you that we're building on conversations that have been underway in the state for some time."

We have a lot of work going on with large industrial and commercial customers looking for customized solutions as they work to achieve their own sustainability goals. It could take the form of commercial renewables. It could take the form of micro grids. It could take the form of supporting electrification of industrial processes or transportation.
And so we have been working with these large customers for some time and thought this would be a helpful way just to bring a comprehensive set of solutions to those customers as we go forward. And I believe that customization is going to be an important part of the decarbonization journey for large industrial commercial customers as we move forward."

Today, we announced strong results for the quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.15. These results, driven in part by economic recovery, also demonstrate the continued strength of our clean energy strategy. We are leading the transition to cleaner energy by adding significant amounts of renewables to our portfolio, hardening the grid through investments in our transmission and distribution assets and collaborating with stakeholders and policymakers to advance supportive energy policy. 
We have positive momentum going into the second half of the year and are reaffirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5 to $5.30. 
We're also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025, based off of $5.15 midpoint for 2021.
And we remain fully committed to creating value for shareholders by recently increasing our quarterly cash dividend for the 15th consecutive year. 
Looking ahead, we have a number of strategic milestones that we're working towards the -- we're working toward in the second half of the year. We anticipate the closing of the minority sale of Duke Energy Indiana to GIC announced earlier this year at an attractive premium to our public equity valuation. This transaction satisfies our equity needs for the next 5 years. We received CFIUS approval in June. FERC approval is the only remaining closing requirement, and we anticipate receiving approval at any time during the third quarter. 
We continue engaging with stakeholders on important work in the Carolinas on our 2020 IRPs and energy legislation and in Indiana on our 2021 IRP. I will speak further about those in just a moment. 
And operationally, we have 4 remaining months of hurricane season, and our team is ready to respond on behalf of our customers. 
In July, Elsa was our first official storm of the 2021 season. While we had minimal impact in our Florida and Carolinas service territories, we were prepared and restored power quickly to our customers. I'm very proud of our accomplishments to date and we're poised for a strong finish to 2021. 
Turning to Slide 5. We continue to advance our clean energy transformation powered by our 5-year $59 billion growth capital plan. These investments are delivering value for our customers and communities and driving strong growth for our investors. I want to highlight a couple of recent accomplishments. 
Renewables are playing a major role in our path to net zero. We continue construction on approximately 250 megawatts of new solar projects in North Carolina and Florida that we expect to bring online by the end of this year. And in recent weeks, we commissioned the 144-megawatt Pflugerville solar and 182-megawatt Maryneal wind projects in Texas. With the completion of these 2 projects, we hit a significant milestone, surpassing 10,000 megawatts of solar and wind resources. This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees and strong support we receive from the communities where we operate. 
In addition to carbon reduction and the benefits of creating a diverse energy infrastructure, solar and wind investments foster economic development, tax revenue and job creation in the areas we serve. 
This milestone reflects our leadership in clean energy, and we are on track to pass 16,000 megawatts of renewables by 2025 and approximately 24,000 megawatts by 2030. By 2050, renewables will represent 40% or more of our energy mix. 
Nuclear is also a foundational component of our strategy, providing the largest source of reliable carbon-free energy we have in our system. In June, we submitted our application to renew Oconee Nuclear Station's operating licenses for an additional 20 years which was accepted by the NRC for review. This is our first subsequent license renewal application among our 6 nuclear sites in the Carolinas, and the review process will move forward over the next 18 months. 
Oconee is our largest nuclear station, with 3 generating units that produce more than 2,500 megawatts of carbon-free base flow generation, enough to power more than 1.9 million homes. Our nuclear fleet provided 83% of the company's carbon-free generation in 2020 and avoided the release of nearly 50 million tons of carbon dioxide. We'll pursue similar extensions for each of our remaining reactors as they approach the end of their respective licensing periods. 
Our ambitious climate strategy also puts us in a strong position to help other sectors, such as transportation, meet their emission reduction goals. We continue to build out electric vehicle infrastructure in our service territories and one of our subsidiaries, eTrans Energy, was recently named a preferred provider by GM to help its fleet customers transition to electric vehicles. Electrifying vehicles is a win-win approach to reducing carbon emissions from both the electric and the transportation sectors. 
Turning to Slide 6. We're actively engaging policymakers and stakeholders across our jurisdictions and at the federal level. 
In North Carolina, the House of Representatives recently passed House Bill 951. This legislation directs an orderly clean energy transition for North Carolina, including mandates to retire 12 coal units at 5 locations and replace them with cleaner forms of generation, renewed solar programs and modern ratemaking tools to better align clean energy investments with customer needs. We support House Bill 951 and will continue to monitor its progress through the legislative process. 
North Carolina has a long history of constructive energy policy that was developed by finding common ground which has helped position the state as a leader in clean energy and in economic development. Advancing this clean energy transition continues to be a priority for the state and its leaders. 
We also continue to work with the commissions in both North and South Carolina to advance our integrated resource plans. Regulators have been complementary of the extensive stakeholder feedback process and comprehensive data incorporated into the IRPs. In South Carolina, we received an order from the commission requesting additional analysis and modeling, which will be filed later this month. And in North Carolina, the commission plans to hold additional proceedings and will be providing guidance on next steps. This is the first time we've presented multiple generation scenarios in the IRP, and we welcome the opportunity to provide our regulators with more input. 
In Florida, we received the final order from the commission in June, approving the new multiyear rate plan settlement. The significant agreement includes the continued expansion of utility scale solar, energy storage, new electric vehicle charging station programs and provides rate certainty to benefit customers. Among other things, our investments include 10 new solar power plants across the state that will deliver 750 megawatts of cost-effective renewable energy to customers. This multiyear rate plan is in addition to our Storm Protection Plan, which entails $6.2 billion in grid investments through 2029 to harden and strengthen the grid, protecting it against significant weather events and improving reliability for customers. 
In Indiana, the commission approves Step 2 from our 2019 rate case, which updates rate base through year-end 2020 and trues up carrying costs back to January 1, 2021. As we prepare to submit our Indiana IRP in November, we continue to engage business customers, consumer advocates and environmental groups to solicit input on transitioning to cleaner generation sources while keeping a sharp focus on reliability and affordability for customers. We took an important step in our last rate case by reducing the depreciable lives for our coal capacity and look to the IRP to continue this progress. We'll collaborate with stakeholders and policymakers to find the best path forward for the state's clean energy transition. 
Shifting to the LDCs. We've filed rate cases in 2 jurisdictions this year. Across our gas segment, we've worked to keep O&M costs relatively flat during a period of strong customer growth and capital additions. 
Our Piedmont Natural Gas rate request continues to move through the regulatory process in North Carolina. This request includes construction costs related to our new natural gas storage facility in Robinson County. A hearing is scheduled for September. And if approved, rates would be effective by year-end. 
In Kentucky, we've made strategic investments to improve the reliability and integrity of our natural gas delivery system and filed a request with the Public Service Commission to recover those costs. We've invested nearly $190 million in a variety of capital projects across Northern Kentucky since we last sought a natural gas base rate increase in 2018. We will present our case to the commission in October. 
And finally, let me comment on the work in D.C. We're engaged with Congress and the administration on a wide range of issues, including infrastructure, tax and climate policy. The bipartisan infrastructure framework is the subject of much discussion and could serve as a powerful catalyst to modernize our nation's infrastructure. It includes funding for large-scale expansion of charging infrastructure to prepare for and further drive adoption of electric vehicles. And as charging infrastructure grows, so will the need for grid investments. 
Innovation will also be a critical part of the journey to net zero because with our existing technologies, we can make important progress, but cannot close the gap. We're pleased to see the framework includes funding to accelerate the development of next-generation clean-energy technologies such as hydrogen, carbon capture and advanced nuclear. Robust and sustained government support is vital to ensure the commercialization of these advanced technologies. It's critical for us to tackle this issue today so the technologies are scalable when we need them. 
In closing, our continued growth and strong second quarter results were driven by solid execution across all our jurisdictions as we lead the largest clean energy transition in our industry. I'm confident we will continue to build on this momentum to deliver sustainable value and grow earnings 5% to 7% over the next 5 years. 
With that, let me turn it over to Steve."

I'll start with a brief discussion on our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year. For more detailed information on variance drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. 
As shown on Slide 7, our second quarter reported earnings per share was $0.96 and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.15. This is compared to a reported loss of $1.13 and an adjusted earnings per share gain of $1.08 last year. The difference between second quarter reported and adjusted earnings per share is due to the onetime impacts of the initiative to redefine workspace usage in light of what we have learned from COVID. This effort involves consolidation of corporate office space and accommodating a hybrid work environment, resulting in a 60% reduction in square footage and annual savings of approximately $25 million to $30 million. 
The adjusted earnings per share growth in the quarter continues to be strong, led by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure which was up $0.24 compared to the prior year. Results were favorable due to benefits from base rate increases, favorable volumes, riders and weather. Partially offsetting these items were higher O&M costs due to COVID-19 mitigation efforts in 2020.
Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, results were down $0.03, primarily due to the cancellation of ACP last year. 
In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were down $0.06 for the quarter, driven by lower investments in new renewables projects compared to prior year. This is consistent with our guidance in February, and we expect full year 2021 earnings to be within our $200 million to $250 million range. 
Other was unfavorable $0.04 for the quarter, principally due to less favorable market returns on certain benefit plans and higher income tax expense, partially offset by lower financing costs. 
Finally, segment results are impacted by $0.04 of share dilution related to the $2.5 billion equity issuance that closed in December 2020. 
Overall, we had strong results compared to last year, supported by our continued execution and the rebounding economy. We remain confident in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted EPS at 5% to 7% throughout the 5-year period off the 2021 base year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Let me provide an overview of electric volumes and economic trends. Our results for the second quarter were up approximately 6.5% year-over-year. Keep in mind, we are comparing sales data to Q2 of last year, which experienced the largest impact from COVID-19. 
Residential volumes were down 6%. However, given stay-at-home orders during the same period last year, the modest decrease indicates many people continue to work from home on at least a part-time basis. In fact, this quarter's results are more than 4% above the second quarter of 2019, highlighting the continued strength of the residential class which is supported by customer growth across our service territories. 
As reported on our first quarter earnings call, nearly all large commercial and industrial customers have resumed operations in the sector and the sector is showing signs of optimism. The commercial class has rebounded considerably from prior year with an increase of 11.7%. Retail, dining and recreation were all driving the positive year-over-year comparison as most COVID restrictions have been lifted. Similarly, industrial volumes have increased 11.8% for the quarter, whereas volumes had declined 15% last year. We expect improvement in the commercial and industrial classes as employment recovers and supply chain bottlenecks are resolved. 
As we progress through the back half of the year, we are monitoring the pace of economic recovery and potential impacts of the Delta variant. At the same time, we are encouraged by the sales trends so far this year, along with strong customer growth across our service territories. 
With Q2 overall retail volumes returning to Q2 2019 levels, we remain confident in our full year expectation of 1% to 2% load growth for 2021 and are trending towards the top half of that range. 
On Slide 9, I'd like to share an update on where we are with our financing plan and dividend growth. We remain on track with the financing plan we outlined on the fourth quarter call. The proceeds from the GIC minority interest sale, along with our overall financing plan, allow us to maintain a strong credit profile without the need for common equity issuances throughout our 5-year plan. We are on track to complete the North Carolina storm securitization this fall and we recently issued $3 billion of holding company debt at low attractive rates. 
Finally, we understand the value of our dividend to our investors. This year marks the 95th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend and the 15th consecutive annual increase. 
Moving to Slide 10. I want to provide some perspective on timing considerations for the second half of the year and an update on our cost management efforts. 
We expect volumes will continue to recover over the balance of the year. But as we saw in the second quarter, we expect O&M to be unfavorable in the third quarter when compared to 2020. This is due to the actions we took to significantly reduce O&M during the pandemic, such as deferred outages at are generating stations. 
Overall, we reduced O&M $320 million in 2020, equivalent to more than 6% of our non-rider recoverable O&M. On our February call, we shared that we plan to sustain 65% or $200 million of those savings and carry them forward into 2021. We are on track to achieve those savings. This is consistent with our cost management track record since 2016. On a consolidated basis, over the past 5 years, our net regulated electric and gas O&M has declined approximately 1% per year, and we expect this trend to continue. 
Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 11. We remain confident in our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.30 with a midpoint of $5.15. Our year-to-date results position us well to achieve full year results within this range as we continue to invest in important energy infrastructure to benefit our customers and communities. Our attractive dividend yield, coupled with our long-term earnings growth profile of 5% to 7%, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. 
As Lynn discussed, we continue to advance our clean energy strategy, adding new renewable generation and taking steps to extend the lives of our carbon-free nuclear fleet. We continue to engage with state and federal leaders as they work to pave the way for a clean energy future. We're executing our capital plan to support those efforts by investing in our energy grid, all while employing financing solutions that save customers money and add value for shareholders. Duke Energy is well positioned to lead as the pace of change in our industry accelerates, delivering sustainable value to our customers and investors. 
With that, we'll open the line for your questions."

Today, we announced strong results for the quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.15. These results, driven in part by economic recovery, also demonstrate the continued strength of our clean energy strategy. We are leading the transition to cleaner energy by adding significant amounts of renewables to our portfolio, hardening the grid through investments in our transmission and distribution assets and collaborating with stakeholders and policymakers to advance supportive energy policy. 
We have positive momentum going into the second half of the year and are reaffirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5 to $5.30. 
We're also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025, based off of $5.15 midpoint for 2021.
And we remain fully committed to creating value for shareholders by recently increasing our quarterly cash dividend for the 15th consecutive year. 
Looking ahead, we have a number of strategic milestones that we're working towards the -- we're working toward in the second half of the year. We anticipate the closing of the minority sale of Duke Energy Indiana to GIC announced earlier this year at an attractive premium to our public equity valuation. This transaction satisfies our equity needs for the next 5 years. We received CFIUS approval in June. FERC approval is the only remaining closing requirement, and we anticipate receiving approval at any time during the third quarter. 
We continue engaging with stakeholders on important work in the Carolinas on our 2020 IRPs and energy legislation and in Indiana on our 2021 IRP. I will speak further about those in just a moment. 
And operationally, we have 4 remaining months of hurricane season, and our team is ready to respond on behalf of our customers. 
In July, Elsa was our first official storm of the 2021 season. While we had minimal impact in our Florida and Carolinas service territories, we were prepared and restored power quickly to our customers. I'm very proud of our accomplishments to date and we're poised for a strong finish to 2021. 
Turning to Slide 5. We continue to advance our clean energy transformation powered by our 5-year $59 billion growth capital plan. These investments are delivering value for our customers and communities and driving strong growth for our investors. I want to highlight a couple of recent accomplishments. 
Renewables are playing a major role in our path to net zero. We continue construction on approximately 250 megawatts of new solar projects in North Carolina and Florida that we expect to bring online by the end of this year. And in recent weeks, we commissioned the 144-megawatt Pflugerville solar and 182-megawatt Maryneal wind projects in Texas. With the completion of these 2 projects, we hit a significant milestone, surpassing 10,000 megawatts of solar and wind resources. This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees and strong support we receive from the communities where we operate. 
In addition to carbon reduction and the benefits of creating a diverse energy infrastructure, solar and wind investments foster economic development, tax revenue and job creation in the areas we serve. 
This milestone reflects our leadership in clean energy, and we are on track to pass 16,000 megawatts of renewables by 2025 and approximately 24,000 megawatts by 2030. By 2050, renewables will represent 40% or more of our energy mix. 
Nuclear is also a foundational component of our strategy, providing the largest source of reliable carbon-free energy we have in our system. In June, we submitted our application to renew Oconee Nuclear Station's operating licenses for an additional 20 years, which was accepted by the NRC for review. This is our first subsequent license renewal application among our 6 nuclear sites in the Carolinas, and the review process will move forward over the next 18 months. 
Oconee is our largest nuclear station, with 3 generating units that produce more than 2,500 megawatts of carbon-free base flow generation, enough to power more than 1.9 million homes. Our nuclear fleet provided 83% of the company's carbon-free generation in 2020 and avoided the release of nearly 50 million tons of carbon dioxide. We'll pursue similar extensions for each of our remaining reactors as they approach the end of their respective licensing periods. 
Our ambitious climate strategy also puts us in a strong position to help other sectors, such as transportation, meet their emission reduction goals. We continue to build out electric vehicle infrastructure in our service territories and one of our subsidiaries, eTrans Energy, was recently named a preferred provider by GM to help its fleet customers transition to electric vehicles. Electrifying vehicles is a win-win approach to reducing carbon emissions from both the electric and the transportation sectors. 
Turning to Slide 6. We're actively engaging policymakers and stakeholders across our jurisdictions and at the federal level. In North Carolina, the House of Representatives recently passed House Bill 951. This legislation directs an orderly clean energy transition for North Carolina, including mandates to retire 12 coal units at 5 locations and replace them with cleaner forms of generation, renewed solar programs and modern ratemaking tools to better align clean energy investments with customer needs. We support House Bill 951 and will continue to monitor its progress through the legislative process. 
North Carolina has a long history of constructive energy policy that was developed by finding common ground, which has helped position the state as a leader in clean energy and in economic development. Advancing this clean energy transition continues to be a priority for the state and its leaders. 
We also continue to work with the commissions in both North and South Carolina to advance our integrated resource plans. Regulators have been complementary of the extensive stakeholder feedback process and comprehensive data incorporated into the IRPs. In South Carolina, we received an order from the commission requesting additional analysis and modeling, which will be filed later this month. And in North Carolina, the commission plans to hold additional proceedings and will be providing guidance on next steps. This is the first time we've presented multiple generation scenarios in the IRPs, and we welcome the opportunity to provide our regulators with more input. 
In Florida, we received the final order from the commission in June, approving the new multiyear rate plan settlement. The significant agreement includes the continued expansion of utility scale solar, energy storage, new electric vehicle charging station programs and provides rate certainty to benefit customers. Among other things, our investments include 10 new solar power plants across the state that will deliver 750 megawatts of cost-effective renewable energy to customers. This multiyear rate plan is an addition to our Storm Protection Plan, which entails $6.2 billion in grid investments through 2029 to harden and strengthen the grid, protecting it against significant weather events and improving reliability for customers. 
In Indiana, the commission approves Step 2 from our 2019 rate case, which updates rate base through year-end 2020 and trues up carrying costs back to January 1, 2021. As we prepare to submit our Indiana IRP in November, we continue to engage business customers, consumer advocates and environmental groups to solicit input on transitioning to cleaner generation sources while keeping a sharp focus on reliability and affordability for customers. We took an important step in our last rate case by reducing the depreciable lives for our coal capacity and look to the IRP to continue this progress. We'll collaborate with stakeholders and policymakers to find the best path forward for the state's clean energy transition. 
Shifting to the LDCs. We've filed rate cases in 2 jurisdictions this year. Across our gas segment, we've worked to keep O&M costs relatively flat during a period of strong customer growth and capital additions. 
Our Piedmont Natural Gas rate request continues to move through the regulatory process in North Carolina. This request includes construction costs related to our new natural gas storage facility in Robeson County. A hearing is scheduled for September. And if approved, rates would be effective by year-end. 
In Kentucky, we've made strategic investments to improve the reliability and integrity of our natural gas delivery system and filed a request with the Public Service Commission to recover those costs. We've invested nearly $190 million in a variety of capital projects across Northern Kentucky since we last sought a natural gas base rate increase in 2018. We will present our case to the commission in October. 
And finally, let me comment on the work in D.C. We're engaged with Congress and the administration on a wide range of issues, including infrastructure, tax and climate policy. The bipartisan infrastructure framework is the subject of much discussion and could serve as a powerful catalyst to modernize our nation's infrastructure. It includes funding for large-scale expansion of charging infrastructure to prepare for and further drive adoption of electric vehicles. And as charging infrastructure grows, so will the need for grid investments. 
Innovation will also be a critical part of the journey to net zero because with our existing technologies, we can make important progress, but cannot close the gap. We're pleased to see the framework includes funding to accelerate the development of next-generation clean-energy technologies such as hydrogen, carbon capture and advanced nuclear. Robust and sustained government support is vital to ensure the commercialization of these advanced technologies. It's critical for us to tackle this issue today so the technologies are scalable when we need them. 
In closing, our continued growth and strong second quarter results were driven by solid execution across all our jurisdictions as we lead the largest clean energy transition in our industry. I'm confident we will continue to build on this momentum to deliver sustainable value and grow earnings 5% to 7% over the next 5 years. 
With that, let me turn it over to Steve."

I'll start with a brief discussion on our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year. For more detailed information on variance drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. 
As shown on Slide 7, our second quarter reported earnings per share was $0.96 and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.15. This is compared to a reported loss of $1.13 and an adjusted earnings per share gain of $1.08 last year. The difference between second quarter reported and adjusted earnings per share is due to the onetime impacts of the initiative to redefine workspace usage in light of what we have learned from COVID. This effort involves consolidation of corporate office space and accommodating a hybrid work environment, resulting in a 60% reduction in square footage and annual savings of approximately $25 million to $30 million. 
The adjusted earnings per share growth in the quarter continues to be strong, led by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, which was up $0.24 compared to the prior year. Results were favorable due to benefits from base rate increases, favorable volumes, riders and weather. Partially offsetting these items were higher O&M costs due to COVID-19 mitigation efforts in 2020.
Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, results were down $0.03, primarily due to the cancellation of ACP last year. 
In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were down $0.06 for the quarter, driven by lower investments in new renewables projects compared to prior year. This is consistent with our guidance in February, and we expect full year 2021 earnings to be within our $200 million to $250 million range. 
Other was unfavorable $0.04 for the quarter, principally due to less favorable market returns on certain benefit plans and higher income tax expense, partially offset by lower financing costs. 
Finally, segment results are impacted by $0.04 of share dilution related to the $2.5 billion equity issuance that closed in December 2020. 
Overall, we had strong results compared to last year, supported by our continued execution and the rebounding economy. We remain confident in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted EPS at 5% to 7% throughout the 5-year period off the 2021 base year. 
Turning to Slide 8. Let me provide an overview of electric volumes and economic trends. Our results for the second quarter were up approximately 6.5% year-over-year. Keep in mind, we are comparing sales data to Q2 of last year, which experienced the largest impact from COVID-19. 
Residential volumes were down 6%. However, given stay-at-home orders during the same period last year, the modest decrease indicates many people continue to work from home on at least a part-time basis. In fact, this quarter's results are more than 4% above the second quarter of 2019, highlighting the continued strength of the residential class which is supported by customer growth across our service territories. 
As reported on our first quarter earnings call, nearly all large commercial and industrial customers have resumed operations in the sector and the sector is showing signs of optimism. The commercial class has rebounded considerably from prior year with an increase of 11.7%. Retail, dining and recreation were all driving the positive year-over-year comparison as most COVID restrictions have been lifted. Similarly, industrial volumes have increased 11.8% for the quarter, whereas volumes had declined 15% last year. We expect improvement in the commercial and industrial classes as employment recovers and supply chain bottlenecks are resolved. 
As we progress through the back half of the year, we are monitoring the pace of economic recovery and potential impacts of the delta variant. At the same time, we are encouraged by the sales trends so far this year, along with strong customer growth across our service territories. 
With Q2 overall retail volumes returning to Q2 2019 levels, we remain confident in our full year expectation of 1% to 2% load growth for 2021 and are trending towards the top half of that range. 
On Slide 9, I'd like to share an update on where we are with our financing plan and dividend growth. We remain on track with the financing plan we outlined on the fourth quarter call. The proceeds from the GIC minority interest sale, along with our overall financing plan, allow us to maintain a strong credit profile without the need for common equity issuances throughout our 5-year plan. We are on track to complete the North Carolina storm securitization this fall and we recently issued $3 billion of holding company debt at low attractive rates. 
Finally, we understand the value of our dividend to our investors. This year marks the 95th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend and the 15th consecutive annual increase. 
Moving to Slide 10. I want to provide some perspective on timing considerations for the second half of the year and an update on our cost management efforts. 
We expect volumes will continue to recover over the balance of the year. But as we saw in the second quarter, we expect O&M to be unfavorable in the third quarter when compared to 2020. This is due to the actions we took to significantly reduce O&M during the pandemic, such as deferred outages at are generating stations. 
Overall, we reduced O&M $320 million in 2020, equivalent to more than 6% of our non-rider recoverable O&M. On our February call, we shared that we plan to sustain 65% or $200 million of those savings and carry them forward into 2021. We are on track to achieve those savings. This is consistent with our cost management track record since 2016. On a consolidated basis, over the past 5 years, our net regulated electric and gas O&M has declined approximately 1% per year, and we expect this trend to continue. 
Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 11. We remain confident in our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.30 with a midpoint of $5.15. Our year-to-date results position us well to achieve full year results within this range as we continue to invest in important energy infrastructure to benefit our customers and communities. Our attractive dividend yield, coupled with our long-term earnings growth profile of 5% to 7%, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. 
As Lynn discussed, we continue to advance our clean energy strategy, adding new renewable generation and taking steps to extend the lives of our carbon-free nuclear fleet. We continue to engage with state and federal leaders as they work to pave the way for a clean energy future. We're executing our capital plan to support those efforts by investing in our energy grid, all while employing financing solutions that save customers money and add value for shareholders. Duke Energy is well positioned to lead as the pace of change in our industry accelerates, delivering sustainable value to our customers and investors. 
With that, we'll open the line for your questions."

And the discussion in Washington has really centered more around the plants that are exposed to markets, commercial markets. So think about plants in PJM and otherwise. 
But we have had discussions with a number of people about the importance of nuclear in the transition, and I do believe it is being recognized by the administration and by Congress. And so that's an important area of advocacy for us, not only in existing plants, but on new technologies that would keep nuclear as part of the solution set for the clean energy transition."

It's great to be with you for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. 
Today, we announced strong results for the quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.88 driven by growth at our electric utilities. We're well positioned for a solid finish to the year and are narrowing our full year guidance range to $5.15 to $5.30, raising the midpoint into the upper half of our original range. 
We're also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025 based off our original 2021 guidance range. 
Before I hand it over to Steve for a financial update, I'd like to discuss the important progress we've made on our climate goals and highlight recent and critical accomplishments that help advance our clean energy transformation. 
Turning to Slide 5. We've been actively engaged with policymakers and stakeholders across the Carolinas for several years to chart a path toward cleaner energy. Our 2020 IRPs filed in both states reflect our goal to pursue an orderly energy transition, achieving aggressive carbon reduction while maintaining affordability and reliability. These filings and ongoing conversations in both states have been informed by robust stakeholder engagement and feedback. 
In October, North Carolina took an additional step, consistent with their long-standing history of proactively tackling complex energy issues, when state leaders came together to pass a landmark bipartisan law, House Bill 951, that accelerates the clean energy transition. 
House Bill 951 provides a framework to achieve 70% carbon reduction by '23 while continuing to prioritize affordability and reliability for customers. It also sets into law our corporate goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
The road map to achieve these goals will come in the form of a carbon reduction plan, which will be approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission by the end of 2022. We anticipate the active involvement of South Carolina in this process, as they have been over the decades in developing and retiring assets that serve both states. The plan will also be informed by stakeholders, a continuation of the conversations that have been ongoing over the last several years. 
Consistent with the vertically integrated utility model, House Bill 951 calls for utilities to own new generation or other resources selected by the commission, with the exception of solar generation, which contemplates 55% utility ownership and the remaining procured through PPAs. 
Throughout our history, we have offered great protections for low-income customers and House Bill 951 takes further steps to prioritize affordability. The legislation calls for securitization of 50% of subcritical coal plants upon their early retirement, which will lower customer rates. Additionally, we've initiated a low-income collaborative to propose new low-income programs to further help our customers. 
The legislation also adopts modern regulatory mechanisms in North Carolina, including multiyear rate plans, performance-based ratemaking and residential decoupling, all designed to better align utility investments with customer needs and improve rate certainty. 
As we look ahead, our pace of change will accelerate as we work toward our carbon reduction goals and the broader clean energy transformation across all of our jurisdictions. With this in mind, we expect our enterprise capital plan for the next 5 years, through 2026, to increase to the $60 billion and $65 billion range. And then moving into the back half of the decade, we estimate to be in the top half of our $65 billion to $75 billion range. And we will provide more details on our updated capital and financing plans on our fourth quarter call in February. 
Turning to Slide 6. It's been 1 year since we hosted our first ESG Investor Day, where we laid out several targets in our path to net-zero carbon and methane emissions. We're making meaningful progress across these goals while also advancing social responsibility and corporate governance work. 
We exceeded 40% carbon reduction across the enterprise in 2020, and we continue to accelerate coal retirements and add significant amounts of renewables to our system. Our path to net-zero is underpinned by strong governance, collaboration with stakeholders and a culture rooted in diversity, equity and inclusion. Our long-term investment strategy also provides societal benefits, as demonstrated by our commitment to environmental justice. 
Earlier this week, we launched a new sustainable financing framework to help fund investments in eligible green and social projects. This framework provides additional transparency around our investments and clearly defines projects aligned with our ESG priorities. 
And as a testament to our strong culture of governance and accountability, we were recognized by Labrador's 2021 Transparency Awards as the #1 utility for overall transparency. 
While there is more to do, we're proud of our progress and are poised for more in the years ahead. We look forward to holding another ESG Day with you in 2022 to dive deeper into our commitments and our accomplishments. 
Turning to Slide 7. We continue to work with stakeholders at federal, state and local levels to make this clean energy vision possible while maintaining reliability and affordability for customers. 
In South Carolina, we filed a modified IRP at the end of August, incorporating feedback from the Public Service Commission and demonstrating further progress toward cleaner energy. The plan includes a balanced resource mix, expanding renewable generation, storage, retiring coal and achieving significant carbon reductions. We expect an order from the Commission later this year and believe this filing is an important foundational element to the continued conversation on the pace and approach to the clean energy transition in the Carolinas. 
Strategic progress continues in Florida as well. We announced 4 new solar projects in the third quarter as part of our Clean Energy Connection program, and we continue to harden the grid through our Storm Protection Plan rider. 
As we prepare to submit our Indiana IRP later this month, we've gathered input from business customers, consumer advocates and environmental groups on transitioning to cleaner generation while keeping a sharp focus on reliability and affordability. The IRP will continue to advance efforts to shift away from coal, and we remain engaged with stakeholders and policymakers to find the best path forward for the state. 
Finally, we're engaging with Congress and the administration on a wide range of issues, including infrastructure, tax and climate policy. We support new federal policies that align with our clean energy transition by modernizing and investing in the nation's infrastructure and helping to fund the development of advanced clean energy technologies. 
From a regulatory point of view, we are pleased that FERC has accepted the application filed by Duke and the other members of the Southeast Energy Exchange Market, known as SEEM. This allows the members to proceed with the development of the trading platform. SEEM is a low-cost, low-risk way to provide immediate customer benefits through a shared market structure while advancing more renewables throughout the Southeast. 
In closing, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we're meeting our financial and strategic objectives while continuing to focus on operational excellence. We operate in constructive jurisdictions that continue to drive new customers at growth rates above national averages. Our climate goals are driving our investment strategy and long-term planning, and we continue to make progress on all fronts. We have a clear line of sight to achieving our 2030 goals. Over this decade, we will deploy one of the largest capital investment plans in the country focused on building clean energy infrastructure, investments that will benefit the environment, our customers and communities and our investors. 
With this positive momentum, we are highly confident in our 5% to 7% EPS growth range and see the potential over time to earn in the top half of this range. With that, let me turn it over to Steve."

I'll start with a brief discussion of our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year.

I'll start with a brief discussion of our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year. For more detailed information on variance drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. 
As shown on Slide 8, our third quarter reported earnings per share was $1.79 and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.88. The difference between third quarter reported and adjusted earnings per share is primarily due to a charge related to the 2018 South Carolina rate cases, partially offset by proceeds from the settlement with insurers on coal ash basin closure costs. 
The adjusted earnings per share results in the quarter continue to be strong, led by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, which was up $0.10 compared to the prior year. Results were driven by favorable volumes, benefits from base rate increases and riders. Partially offsetting these items were higher O&M costs when compared to 2020 levels due to COVID-19 mitigation efforts in the prior year. 
Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, results were flat to last year. In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were up $0.02 for the quarter driven by investments in the Maryneal wind and Pflugerville solar projects. 
Other was unfavorable $0.03 for the quarter, principally due to higher income tax expense. Recall in 2020 that we executed tax optimization levers as part of our COVID mitigation strategy. 
Finally, segment results are impacted by $0.08 per share of diluted -- dilution related to the $2.5 billion equity issuance that closed in December 2020. 
Overall, we are pleased with the results for the quarter, supported by our continued execution in the rebounding economy. We remain confident in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted earnings per share at 5% to 7% throughout the 5-year period off of the 5.15-point -- midpoint of our 2021 guidance range. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are pleased to see our electric volumes continue to bounce back as the economic recovery progresses. Results for the third quarter were up approximately 3.4% year-over-year. And for the second consecutive quarter, results are near or above pre-pandemic levels, with the third quarter up 1.3% versus 2019. 
Looking more closely at the customer classes, residential volumes were down 0.2% for the quarter as people began to return to the workplace. We continue to see strong customer growth of 1.7% year-to-date. When comparing this quarter's residential volumes to that of 2019, we see that volumes have risen almost 4%, highlighting the continued strength of the residential class. 
Robust labor market recovery in our service territories is driving the improvement in the commercial and industrial classes. Commercial volumes are up 5.3% and industrial was up 7.2% in our 4 largest states, representing nearly 90% of our overall electric volumes. Job recovery is outpacing the national average. This is a testament to the attractive jurisdictions in which we operate. 
We continue to monitor the impact that our largest customers may experience due to supply chain disruptions. And to date, we have seen only minor impacts in certain sectors, such as suppliers of the automotive industry. We serve a diverse customer base, spanning a variety of industries, mitigating sector-specific impacts. 
As we progress towards the end of the year, we are encouraged by the sales trends we have seen bolstered by strong customer growth across our service territories which support load growth over the long term. With our rolling 12-month retail load growing at 2.1%, we expect to finish at or above the top end of our original 1% to 2% load growth range for 2021. 
On Slide 10, I'd like to discuss primary growth drivers for the next year, beginning with the electric utilities segment. We see higher load in 2022 across our jurisdictions as the economic recovery progresses. 
In Florida, we will see the impact of the first base rate increase in our multiyear rate plan that was approved this year. We also expect growth from the Storm Protection Plan Rider and the final projects recovered under the solar base rate adjustment mechanism. 
In the Carolinas, we expect to see growth through our grid improvement plan, allowing us to defer certain grid projects with a return between rate cases. 
Meanwhile, 2022 will be a key year to move through rulemaking related to HB 951 and the carbon reduction plan, setting the stage for 2023 and beyond. 
In the Midwest, we'll see the impact of our Ohio distribution rate case beginning in the summer, and we'll continue to invest in transmission and distribution upgrades that are recovered under our rider programs in both Indiana and Ohio. 
We continue to make progress on our cost management efforts across our jurisdictions and expect lower year-over-year O&M in 2022. 
Shifting to the gas segment. We will have a full year benefit from the Piedmont, North Carolina and Kentucky rate cases. We will also see growth from integrity management investments and customer additions. Consistent with this historical practice, we will provide 2022 earnings guidance or detailed capital plan and our growth prospects for the future during our February financial update. 
Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 11. We are having an outstanding 2021, as evidenced by another strong quarter. And we have narrowed our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to the top half of our range. Our attractive dividend yield, coupled with our long-term earnings growth profile of 5% to 7%, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. 
As Lynn discussed, we have a long runway of capital investment opportunities as we advance our clean energy strategy over the next decade and beyond. Duke Energy is well positioned to lead as the pace of change in our industry accelerates, delivering sustainable value to our customers and investors. 
With that, we'll open the line for your questions."

And in many ways, it's a combination of the process we've discussed with you over the last several years as we've worked towards this clean energy transition. 
The next step, which is already underway, is rulemaking around the performance-based ratemaking and securitization. The commission has outlined a process that should culminate in February for PBR and in April for securitization. And then we would also expect the commission to establish procedures around the shaping of the carbon reduction plan. That is not yet out, but we would expect it to occur. As you know, the time line for that is December of 2022. 
So a lot of work will go on as this legislation transitions into the regulatory arena. We will be involved. Of course, stakeholders will be involved. And on the carbon reduction plan, South Carolina will be a very important stakeholder at the table every step of the way. 
And so we'll be anxious to provide updates along the way as we reach those milestones, but I feel like this is a very good process to put us on a path to achieve not only our carbon reduction goals but meaningful investments that will drive returns over this decade and beyond."

And then Lynn, lastly, I wanted to tease out a bit of your kind of prepared comments around the growth guide as we're thinking about sort of various drivers of the legislation and how it impacts your plan. You obviously have more regulated renewable opportunities. You should theoretically have less lag and more opportunities to increase and accelerate CapEx as the plan further cements, right? You obviously have opportunities around PBR and sharing mechanisms. So if you're solidly within your 5% to 7% growth rate without legislation, especially with an improving load backdrop as Steve clearly highlighted, how can the legislation, I guess, not be accretive to your current guide from an EPS growth standpoint?"

And I think we should broaden it really beyond the Carolinas to also note the progress that we expect to make in other jurisdictions. We have an important IRP filing coming up in November, end of this month, in Indiana which will set a pace for the transition. So taking all of those things together, we do see increased capital. And as we open up 2026 and establish a 5-year range, we believe that capital will go to 60 to 65. As we look at the back half of the decade, we had shared 65 to 75, we think it's more likely to be in that top half, 70 to 75. And so we do believe we have the potential over time to earn at the top end of our 5% to 7% range, the top half of that 5% to 7% range. 
And so we have some work to do with rulemaking and be getting the execution, but we have a long runway of capital investment. And this regulatory modernization will be helpful, not only to align investments with benefits to customers, but also to allow us to more effectively put capital to work and deliver returns."

And so I believe this will be an important discussion as the carbon reduction plan is developed, and we will go into that, engaging with our regulators, policymakers, the communities to come up with a thoughtful approach on how to incorporate these technologies.

Today, we announced strong results for the quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.88 driven by growth at our electric utilities. We're well positioned for a solid finish to the year and are narrowing our full year guidance range to $5.15 to $5.30, raising the midpoint into the upper half of our original range. We're also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025 based off our original 2021 guidance range.
Before I hand it over to Steve for a financial update, I'd like to discuss the important progress we've made on our climate goals and highlight recent and critical accomplishments that help advance our clean energy transformation.
Turning to Slide 5. We've been actively engaged with policymakers and stakeholders across the Carolinas for several years to chart a path toward cleaner energy. Our 2020 IRPs filed in both states reflect our goal to pursue an orderly energy transition, achieving aggressive carbon reduction while maintaining affordability and reliability. These filings and ongoing conversations in both states have been informed by robust stakeholder engagement and feedback.
In October, North Carolina took an additional step, consistent with their long-standing history of proactively tackling complex energy issues when state leaders came together to pass a landmark bipartisan law, House Bill 951, that accelerates the clean energy transition.
House Bill 951 provides a framework to achieve 70% carbon reduction by '23 while continuing to prioritize affordability and reliability for customers. It also sets into law our corporate goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
The road map to achieve these goals will come in the form of a carbon reduction plan, which will be approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission by the end of 2022. We anticipate the active involvement of South Carolina in this process, as they have been over the decades in developing and retiring assets that serve both states. The plan will also be informed by stakeholders, a continuation of the conversations that have been ongoing over the last several years.
Consistent with the vertically integrated utility model, House Bill 951 calls for utilities to own new generation or other resources selected by the commission, with the exception of solar generation, which contemplates 55% utility ownership and the remaining procured through PPAs.
Throughout our history, we have offered great protections for low-income customers, and House Bill 951 takes further steps to prioritize affordability. The legislation calls for securitization of 50% of subcritical coal plants upon their early retirement, which will lower customer rates. Additionally, we've initiated a low-income collaborative to propose new low-income programs to further help our customers.
The legislation also adopts modern regulatory mechanisms in North Carolina, including multiyear rate plans, performance-based ratemaking and residential decoupling, all designed to better align utility investments with customer needs and improve rate certainty.
As we look ahead, our pace of change will accelerate as we work toward our carbon reduction goals and the broader clean energy transformation across all of our jurisdictions. With this in mind, we expect our enterprise capital plan for the next 5 years, through 2026, to increase to the $60 billion and $65 billion range. And then moving into the back half of the decade, we estimate to be in the top half of our $65 billion to $75 billion range. And we will provide more details on our updated capital and financing plans on our fourth quarter call in February.
Turning to Slide 6. It's been 1 year since we hosted our first ESG Investor Day where we laid out several targets in our path to net-zero carbon and methane emissions. We're making meaningful progress across these goals while also advancing social responsibility and corporate governance work.
We exceeded 40% carbon reduction across the enterprise in 2020, and we continue to accelerate coal retirements and add significant amounts of renewables to our system. Our path to net-zero is underpinned by strong governance, collaboration with stakeholders and a culture rooted in diversity, equity and inclusion. Our long-term investment strategy also provides societal benefits, as demonstrated by our commitment to environmental justice.
Earlier this week, we launched a new sustainable financing framework to help fund investments in eligible green and social projects. This framework provides additional transparency around our investments and clearly defines projects aligned with our ESG priorities. And as a testament to our strong culture of governance and accountability, we were recognized by Labrador's 2021 Transparency Awards as the #1 utility for overall transparency.
While there is more to do, we're proud of our progress and are poised for more in the years ahead. We look forward to holding another ESG Day with you in 2022 to dive deeper into our commitments and our accomplishments.
Turning to Slide 7. We continue to work with stakeholders at federal, state and local levels to make this clean energy vision possible while maintaining reliability and affordability for customers. In South Carolina, we filed a modified IRP at the end of August, incorporating feedback from the Public Service Commission and demonstrating further progress toward cleaner energy. The plan includes a balanced resource mix, expanding renewable generation, storage, retiring coal and achieving significant carbon reductions. We expect an order from the commission later this year and believe this filing is an important foundational element to the continued conversation on the pace and approach to the clean energy transition in the Carolinas.
Strategic progress continues in Florida as well. We announced 4 new solar projects in the third quarter as part of our Clean Energy Connection program, and we continue to harden the grid through our Storm Protection Plan rider.
As we prepare to submit our Indiana IRP later this month, we've gathered input from business customers, consumer advocates and environmental groups on transitioning to cleaner generation while keeping a sharp focus on reliability and affordability. The IRP will continue to advance efforts to shift away from coal, and we remain engaged with stakeholders and policymakers to find the best path forward for the state.
Finally, we're engaging with Congress and the administration on a wide range of issues, including infrastructure, tax and climate policy. We support new federal policies that align with our clean energy transition by modernizing and investing in the nation's infrastructure and helping to fund the development of advanced clean energy technologies.
From a regulatory point of view, we are pleased that FERC has accepted the application filed by Duke and the other members of the Southeast Energy Exchange Market, known as SEEM. This allows the members to proceed with the development of the trading platform. SEEM is a low-cost, low-risk way to provide immediate customer benefits through a shared market structure while advancing more renewables throughout the Southeast.
In closing, the fundamentals of our business are strong, and we're meeting our financial and strategic objectives while continuing to focus on operational excellence. We operate in constructive jurisdictions that continue to drive new customers at growth rates above national averages. Our climate goals are driving our investment strategy and long-term planning, and we continue to make progress on all fronts. We have a clear line of sight to achieving our 2030 goals. Over this decade, we will deploy one of the largest capital investment plans in the country focused on building clean energy infrastructure, investments that will benefit the environment, our customers and communities and our investors.
With this positive momentum, we are highly confident in our 5% to 7% EPS growth range and see the potential over time to earn in the top half of this range.
With that, let me turn it over to Steve."

I'll start with a brief discussion of our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year.

I'll start with a brief discussion of our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year. For more detailed information on variance drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation.
As shown on Slide 8, our third quarter reported earnings per share was $1.79, and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.88. The difference between third quarter reported and adjusted earnings per share is primarily due to a charge related to the 2018 South Carolina rate cases, partially offset by proceeds from the settlement with insurers on coal ash basin closure costs.
The adjusted earnings per share results in the quarter continue to be strong, led by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, which was up $0.10 compared to the prior year. Results were driven by favorable volumes, benefits from base rate increases and riders. Partially offsetting these items were higher O&M costs when compared to 2020 levels due to COVID-19 mitigation efforts in the prior year.
Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, results were flat to last year.
In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were up $0.02 for the quarter driven by investments in the Maryneal wind and Pflugerville solar projects.
Other was unfavorable $0.03 for the quarter, principally due to higher income tax expense. Recall in 2020 that we executed tax optimization levers as part of our COVID mitigation strategy.
Finally, segment results are impacted by $0.08 per share of diluted -- dilution related to the $2.5 billion equity issuance that closed in December 2020.
Overall, we are pleased with the results for the quarter, supported by our continued execution in the rebounding economy. We remain confident in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted earnings per share at 5% to 7% throughout the 5-year period off of the 5.15-point -- midpoint of our 2021 guidance range.
Turning to Slide 9. We are pleased to see our electric volumes continue to bounce back as the economic recovery progresses. Results for the third quarter were up approximately 3.4% year-over-year. And for the second consecutive quarter, results are near or above pre-pandemic levels, with the third quarter up 1.3% versus 2019.
Looking more closely at the customer classes, residential volumes were down 0.2% for the quarter as people began to return to the workplace. We continue to see strong customer growth of 1.7% year-to-date. When comparing this quarter's residential volumes to that of 2019, we see that volumes have risen almost 4%, highlighting the continued strength of the residential class.
Robust labor market recovery in our service territories is driving the improvement in the commercial and industrial classes. Commercial volumes are up 5.3% and industrial was up 7.2% in our 4 largest states, representing nearly 90% of our overall electric volumes. Job recovery is outpacing the national average. This is a testament to the attractive jurisdictions in which we operate.
We continue to monitor the impact that our largest customers may experience due to supply chain disruptions. And to date, we have seen only minor impacts in certain sectors, such as suppliers of the automotive industry. We serve a diverse customer base, spanning a variety of industries, mitigating sector-specific impacts.
As we progress towards the end of the year, we are encouraged by the sales trends we have seen, bolstered by strong customer growth across our service territories, which support load growth over the long term. With our rolling 12-month retail load growing at 2.1%, we expect to finish at or above the top end of our original 1% to 2% load growth range for 2021.
On Slide 10, I'd like to discuss primary growth drivers for the next year, beginning with the electric utilities segment. We see higher load in 2022 across our jurisdictions as the economic recovery progresses. In Florida, we will see the impact of the first base rate increase in our multiyear rate plan that was approved this year. We also expect growth from the Storm Protection Plan rider and the final projects recovered under the solar base rate adjustment mechanism.
In the Carolinas, we expect to see growth through our grid improvement plan, allowing us to defer certain grid projects with a return between rate cases. Meanwhile, 2022 will be a key year to move through rulemaking related to HB 951 and the carbon reduction plan, setting the stage for 2023 and beyond.
In the Midwest, we'll see the impact of our Ohio distribution rate case beginning in the summer, and we'll continue to invest in transmission and distribution upgrades that are recovered under our rider programs in both Indiana and Ohio.
We continue to make progress on our cost management efforts across our jurisdictions and expect lower year-over-year O&M in 2022.
Shifting to the gas segment. We will have a full year benefit from the Piedmont, North Carolina and Kentucky rate cases. We will also see growth from integrity management investments and customer additions.
Consistent with this historical practice, we will provide 2022 earnings guidance, our detailed capital plan and our growth prospects for the future during our February financial update.
Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 11. We are having an outstanding 2021 as evidenced by another strong quarter. And we have narrowed our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to the top half of our range. Our attractive dividend yield, coupled with our long-term earnings growth profile of 5% to 7%, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for our shareholders.
As Lynn discussed, we have a long runway of capital investment opportunities as we advance our clean energy strategy over the next decade and beyond. Duke Energy is well positioned to lead as the pace of change in our industry accelerates, delivering sustainable value to our customers and investors.
With that, we'll open the line for your questions."

And in many ways, it's a culmination of the process we've discussed with you over the last several years as we've worked toward this clean energy transition.
The next step, which is already underway, is rulemaking around the performance-based ratemaking and securitization. The commission has outlined a process that should culminate in February for PBR and in April for securitization. And then we would also expect the commission to establish procedures around the shaping of the carbon reduction plan. That is not yet out, but we would expect it to occur. As you know, the time line for that is December of 2022.
So a lot of work will go on as this legislation transitions into the regulatory arena. We will be involved. Of course, stakeholders will be involved. And on the carbon reduction plan, South Carolina will be a very important stakeholder at the table every step of the way. And so we'll be anxious to provide updates along the way as we reach those milestones, but I feel like this is a very good process to put us on a path to achieve not only our carbon reduction goals but meaningful investments that will drive returns over this decade and beyond."

And then, Lynn, lastly, I wanted to tease out a bit of your kind of prepared comments around the growth guide as we're thinking about sort of various drivers of the legislation and how it impacts your plan. You obviously have more regulated renewable opportunities. You should theoretically have less lag and more opportunities to increase and accelerate CapEx as the plan further cements, right? You obviously have opportunities around PBRs and sharing mechanisms. So if you're solidly within your 5% to 7% growth rate without legislation, especially with an improving load backdrop, as Steve clearly highlighted, how can the legislation, I guess, not be accretive to your current guide from an EPS growth standpoint?"

And I think we should broaden it really beyond the Carolinas to also note the progress that we expect to make in other jurisdictions. We have an important IRP filing coming up in November, end of this month, in Indiana, which will set a pace for the transition. So taking all of those things together, we do see increased capital. And as we open up 2026 and establish a 5-year range, we believe that capital will go to $60 billion to $65 billion. As we look at the back half of the decade, we had shared $65 billion to $75 billion. We think it's more likely to be in that top half, $70 billion to $75 billion. And so we do believe we have the potential over time to earn at the top end of our 5% to 7% range, the top half of that 5% to 7% range.
And so we have some work to do with rulemaking and be getting the execution, but we have a long runway of capital investment. And this regulatory modernization will be helpful, not only to align investments with benefits to customers but also to allow us to more effectively put capital to work and deliver returns."

In some of our states, also a keen interest in getting a base amount of electric vehicle infrastructure in place. And so I do believe the momentum is picking up.
Of course, all states are watching what's going on at the federal level. And the tax incentives, in particular, can be additive to our progress in the states.

Jonathan, if you think back to the scenarios that we put forward in the 2020 IRP, there were a couple of scenarios that got to that 70% level. One included offshore wind. The other included advanced nuclear or a small modular reactor. We do see a need over time to put in some of these next-generation, although offshore wind, very mature in Europe, not as much here in the U.S., but these clean energy technologies.
And so I believe this will be an important discussion as the carbon reduction plan is developed. And we will go into that, engaging with our regulators, policymakers, the communities to come up with a thoughtful approach on how to incorporate these technologies. And so I think more to come on that as this carbon reduction plan begins to take shape in '22."
