Thank you for joining us today, and I hope you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. It is hard to comprehend everything that has transpired around the world over the last year. The world we",2318,"Well, thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. 
It is hard to comprehend everything that has transpired around the world over the last year. The world we knew pre-pandemic has changed forever, and the need to use innovative technologies to advance the way people live and business operate has never been greater. 
Improving the health of our communities from educating our children to digitizing our economy and enable its recovery creates an enormous opportunity. I believe we are entering a new year, the age of insight, fueled by the amount of data around us. The arrival of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is a marvel of innovation and good news for us all, bringing hope and optimism for what lies ahead. I am personally very excited about the future of innovation and impact it will have. 
I am very pleased with HPE's Q1 results. Our revenue exceeded our outlook and represents a stronger-than-normal sequential seasonality. We significantly expanded our gross and operating margins, driving strong profitability across our businesses ahead of pre-pandemic levels. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded the high end of our guidance, and free cash flow was a record Q1 performance. These results give us confidence to raise our fiscal year '21 EPS and free cash flow outlook, which we will address in more detail later on the call. 
The global pandemic has brought a renewed focus on digital transformation as businesses are rethinking everything from remote work and collaboration to business continuity and data insights. As the work recovers, our customers are looking for the agility and simplicity of the cloud-native world with the flexibility and control of a hybrid business model. This is where we have a unique and differentiated value proposition. 
HPE acted intentionally and quickly last year to become a more agile organization and enable our ability to innovate faster. Our Q1 results demonstrate our progress in enhancing our position to accelerate what comes next for our customers. I am very grateful for our dedicated, passionate and resilient team members. They have been laser-focused on delivering for our customers and executing our strategy to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. 
We are strengthening our core businesses, doubling down in key areas of growth and accelerating our as-a-service pivot to become the edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service  choice for our customers and partners. 
Our total revenue of $6.8 billion was down 3% from the prior year. When normalized for the backlog from last quarter, this is better-than-expected sequential seasonality. 
We saw solid order linearity intake across all of our businesses throughout the quarter. We are executing on multiple growth opportunities, and we are particularly pleased with strong revenue growth in our Intelligent Edge business and growth in our as-a-service orders and revenue. Going forward, we expect to see gradual improvement in customer spending as we progress through fiscal year '21, giving us the confidence in our ability to deliver on our long-term revenue growth guidance. 
Importantly, our non-GAAP gross margin of 33.7% is up 30 basis points year-over-year and 300 basis points sequentially. Our non-GAAP operating profit of 11.3% is up 130 basis points year-over-year, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 is up 4% year-over-year and significantly above the high end of our outlook. 
We generated a record Q1 free cash flow of $563 million, the highest achieved in the first fiscal quarter in the history of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. These are impressive results made possible through disciplined execution, strong expense management and critical investment prioritization. 
Based on the strong start to fiscal year  '21, we are raising our fiscal year '21 non-GAAP EPS outlook to $1.70 to $1.88 and free cash flow to $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion. 
Tarek will discuss the financial results and outlook in greater detail, but let me first give you some additional context around our business segment performance and innovation highlights for the quarter. 
To emerge and recover from the global pandemic, enterprises require secure connectivity, data insight and a cloud experience to accelerate their digital transformation, all of which further reinforces the significance of HP's differentiated edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service vision. 
In our prioritized areas of growth, our Intelligent Edge business had an outstanding quarter, with revenue of $806 million, up 11% year-over-year. We again expect to take market share in both campus switching and wireless LAN segments of the market. 
We are seeing continued traction from our investment at the edge, including rich software capabilities like our Aruba ClearPass security, our cloud-native Aruba Central and most recently, Aruba ESP, our edge services platform. 
Our Aruba SaaS revenue grew triple digits year-over-year. The first full quarter following our Silver Peak acquisition reinforces that we are on track to grow high-margin recurring revenue with technology that accelerates our ability to capture the high-growth SD-WAN market opportunity. 
Our Silver Peak SaaS offering provide customers the ability to connect all their edges and all their clouds in a fully automated and autonomous way. 
We launched new SD-WAN capabilities to centrally monitor, manage and automate connectivity from branch location to AWS, adding support for the AWS Transit Gateway Connect solution. And early today, you may have seen our announcement introducing new solutions from deeper integration between our Aruba ESP and Microsoft Azure, which will simplify IoT device connectivity and bring Aruba Central to Microsoft Azure. 
Finally, we introduced a new class of cloud-native and fully automated data center switching products specifically designed for the edge cloud data centers, which represents a $12 billion TAM expansion opportunity for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. 
These new offerings also enable us to accelerate the delivery of workload optimized solutions for our HP GreenLake Cloud services offerings. Aruba's innovations is why customers like Santander, SKECHERS USA and L3 Harris are choosing Aruba. We have multi-growth drivers in our Intelligent Edge business, and we believe we are well positioned to outgrow the market. 
High-performance compute and mission-critical solution is inherently a lumpy business due to the timing of deals and customer [indiscernible] because we can only recognize revenues once customer workloads are in production. In Q1, revenue was down 9% from the prior year. We remain very confident in this high-growth segment based on our backlog of our awarded business, which now exceeds well over $2 billion of exascale contracts and a robust pipeline of multimillion-dollar sized deals. 
We are on track to deliver the 8% to 12% annual growth rate communicated at our Security Analyst Meeting last fall. We have a market-leading and differentiated portfolio of technologies that will power the new age of insight. 
We recently introduced HP GreenLake Cloud Services for HPC to accelerate enterprise Main Street adoption or high-performance computing, targeting a $3 billion to $4 billion TAM. Enterprises are running analytics on increasingly large data sets and are adopting new techniques such as artificial intelligence, deep learning and machine learning. And then now we have access to HPC technologies that were historically out of reach. 
In Q1, we won 2 major HPC awards, one with the National Center of Atmospheric Research, a contract worth $35 million, to build a supercomputer for extreme weather research; and another that expands NASA's HP Akin Supercomputer. 
We also completed the installation of the [ Damon ] 7 supercomputer for Saudi Aramco, which immediately became 1 of the top 10 supercomputers in the world. 
Finally, on February 20, you may have seen that HPC Spaceborne Computer 2 was launched into orbit for use on the International Space Station. This system is enabling real-time data processing with advanced commercial edge computing in space for the first time as NASA prepares for future missions. 
Today, I want to share the news that Pete Ungaro has decided to leave the company in April. Pete joined HP with Cray -- with the Cray acquisition and ensured the successful integration of the 2 companies. He has made significant contribution and has grown the business despite the complications and backlog brought by the global pandemic last year. Pete will stay on with the company in a consulting capacity for 6 months. And I'm really grateful for him -- to him for his leadership. 
I am pleased to announce that Justin Hotard, a seasoned HP leader, will take over the leadership of the HPC MCS business and also Hewlett Packard Labs reporting to me. Justin has brought an extensive experience across the company that includes leading our HPE Compute business, where he transformed the x86 compute portfolio and delivered revenue growth, profitability and market share expansion. I'm excited about what Justin will bring to the business. 
In the core businesses of Compute and Storage, our strategy to grow in profitable segments and pivot to more as-a-service solutions is paying off. We drove strong profitability and cash flow in both businesses. 
In Compute, our operating margins of 11.5% increased 80 basis points year-over-year and 490 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Our revenue declined 2% from the prior year but was up low single digits sequentially when normalized for the backlog in Q4. We are encouraged by the sequential growth in new orders intake, taking into account our normal Q2 seasonality. 
Just last week, we launched our new HPE 5G open run solution stack for telecommunications companies to accelerate the commercial adoption of open run in 5G network deployments. This is a transformative technology, featuring the industry's first server optimized for 5G open run workloads with our HP ProLiant servers. This complements the HPE 5G core stack and build last year in March. 
Orange, one of the world's largest mobile network operators, is currently working with HPE to test a full 5G core stack in preparation for broader commercial deployment. 
In Storage, revenue was down 6% from the prior year, with operating margins of 19.7%, which is above the target profitability range we discussed at SAM. 
We continue to see strong revenue growth in our own IP software-defined portfolio, where we have been investing. Our HPE Primera business grew triple digits year-over-year and soon will be bigger than our 3PAR business. This is the fastest revenue ramp ever achieved in our HP storage portfolio. 
Our overall HPE All Flash Array portfolio grew 5%, driven by both HPE Primera and HP Nimble storage. 
Our hyper-converged strategy continued to gain traction. Our HP Nimble dHCI next-generation technology, powered with artificial intelligence, give customers a cloud-native experience in their own data centers, where they also have the ability to control costs while maintaining data compliance and security. 
Our focus on our own IP software-defined portfolio also improves our ability to attach rich services to our product offerings. Our storage operational services attach intensity is up double digits year-over-year. 
We're also integrating cloud-native software technology to empower our field and accelerate sales velocity. Just last week, we completed the acquisition of CloudPhysics. This deal provides us with a SaaS-based tool that analyzes it environment to provide a quick return on investment recommendations for cloud migrations, application modernization and infrastructure. I am very excited about this new addition to our set of capabilities, which we will expand across our entire HP portfolio. 
Our pivot to as-a-service continues its strong momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate of $649 million was up 27% year-over-year. And we had our highest first quarter ever with HP GreenLake Cloud services. The customer adoption continued to be very strong. In Q1, we gained more than 70 new HP GreenLake cloud services logos. 
Lineas, Europe's largest private rail freight operator selected HP GreenLake Cloud services to support its transformation from a conventional freight company into a high-performing, efficient and sustainable transport system for the European logistics industry. We remain very confident in our unique approach and differentiate the portfolio to capitalize on the rapidly growing on-premises as-a-service market. 
Our new HPE software portfolio and our HP GreenLake manage services offerings enable a true consumption-based experience. Our HP GreenLake Cloud services customer retention rates are above 95%, and the average customer usage of our cloud services currently running at 120% of original commitment, driven by customer expansion in their capacity utilization. We are excited about this long-term opportunity, and I'm very confident in our 30% to 40% CAGR target by fiscal year '22. 
HP continued to benefit from capabilities and services that enable growth in our core business segments. HP Pointnext operational services had a solid quarter. Order trends are improving and revenue has stabilized to flat year-over-year with expanded operating profit margins. 
HP Financial Services provide significant value to our customers as they rebuild and rethink their IT transformation requirements. Q1 revenue stabilized with improved collections to deliver a return on equity of 16.5%. 
Overall, I'm pleased with how we started fiscal year '21. Because of our strong start, we are raising our outlook for both EPS and free cash flow. 
I talk to customers and partners almost every day. And while there continue to be some level of uncertainty, one thing is clear. Customers are looking to accelerate their transformations and in a partner with the right technology, expertise and financial flexibility. Our distinctive and industry-leading portfolio of edge-to-cloud solutions and unique capabilities is resonating with customers. And I believe our team is one of the best in the industry. I'm impressed with our team members' commitment to make bold moves and ensuring we stay true to our service. 
For the third year in a row, HP has been named one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute. And just last week, HP received the terms of Reuters Foundation's Top Slavery Enterprise Award for our leadership in limiting the risk of slavery in our supply chain and operations. 
With this unstoppable team and our portfolio leading solutions, we are well positioned to capture the tremendous opportunity ahead in fiscal year '21 and beyond. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter results. Tarek?"
273983758,703766265,2228769,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 02, 2021",2021-03-02,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year '21. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Anton",2103,"Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year '21. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. 
Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 1. And now let me discuss our financial performance and KPIs, starting with Slide 2. I am delighted to report that our Q1 results were marked by continued momentum in revenue, substantial gross and operating margin expansion and robust cash generation. 
We delivered Q1 revenues of $6.8 billion, down 3% from the prior year period, but better than our typical historical sequential seasonality when normalizing for Q4 backlog. I am particularly proud of the fact that our non-GAAP gross margin returned to above pre-pandemic levels and was up 30 basis points from the prior year period and up 300 basis points sequentially. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, the absence of backlog-related headwinds, cost takeouts and an ongoing favorable mix shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings. 
Our operating expenses decreased year-over-year, thanks to our ongoing structural efficiency measures as well as some timing-related benefits related to hiring in key selected areas, which have been pushed out. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin was 11.3%, up 130 basis points from the prior year, which translates to an 11% year-over-year increase in operating profit. As a result of our strong execution, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, which was up 4% from the prior year and significantly above the higher end of our outlook range. 
Q1 cash flow from operations was close to $1 billion, driven by better profitability and strong operational discipline as well as working capital timing benefits. Q1 free cash flow was $563 million, which was up approximately $750 million from the prior year and a record level for any first HPE first quarter. 
Finally, we paid $155 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q2 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in April 2021. 
Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 3. In Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our momentum with rich software capabilities, delivering 11% year-over-year growth, our third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. 
Switching was up 5% year-over-year with double-digit growth in North America. And wireless LAN was up 11% year-over-year with double-digit growth in both North America and APJ. 
Additionally, the Aruba SaaS offering was up triple digits year-over-year and is now a significant contributor to HPE overall ARR. Based on our solid performance, we expect to take share again this quarter in both campus switching and wireless LAN. We are also seeing the significant operating profit potential of this business with operating margins in Q1 of 18.9%, up 680 basis points year-over-year as we drove greater productivity from past investments and operational leverage benefits kick in. 
Finally, I am pleased to say we recognized our first full quarter of revenue from the acquisition of Silver Peak, the premium growth SD-WAN leader, which contributed approximately 500 basis points to the Intelligent Edge top line growth. 
In HPC and MCS, revenue declined 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the inherent lumpiness of the business, which is linked to the timing of deals and customer acceptance milestones. 
We remain very confident in the near-term and longer-term outlook for this business and are reaffirming our full year and 3-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%, respectively, as highlighted at SAM. 
We have an extremely strong order book of over $2 billion worth of awarded exascale contracts with another $5-plus billion of market opportunity over the next 3 years. 
Finally, we announced the launch of our HPC as a Service offer, which we expect to gain traction later this year and become a further contributor to our overall growing ARR profile. 
In Compute, revenue stabilized to a 2% year-over-year decline, but was up low single digits sequentially when normalizing for Q4 backlog, which attest of a strong order momentum in the quarter. 
Gross and operating margins were up meaningfully quarter-over-quarter due to the absence of any backlog-related margin impact, improved supply chain execution and the rightsizing of the cost structure of this segment. We ended the quarter with an operating profit margin of 11.5%, up 80 basis points from prior year period and at the high end of our long-term margin guidance for this segment provided at SAM. 
Within storage, revenue declined 6% year-over-year, driven by difficult prior year compare, but with strong growth in software-defined offerings. We are extremely well positioned in Storage with Primera and Nimble dHCI. Our most software rich platforms, they are both growing triple digits year-over-year. 
They are absolute winners in the market, and Primera is on track to surpass 3PAR sales as early as next quarter. 
We also saw notable strength in overall Nimble, up 31% year-over-year, and total all-flash arrays were up 5% year-over-year. The mix shift towards our more software-rich platforms helped drive storage operating profit margins to 19.7%, well above our long-term outlook for this segment presented at SAM last October. 
With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue stabilized and was flat year-over-year, driven by the increased focus of our BU segments on selling products and services as bundles, improved services intensity and are growing as-a-service business, which I remind you, involves service attach rates of 100%. This is very important to note because all of our services -- all of our OS revenue is recurring with 3-year average contract length, and OS remains the highest operating margin contributor to our segments. 
Within HPE Financial Services, revenue stabilized and was slightly down 1% year-over-year. As expected, we are seeing sequential improvements in our bad debt loss ratios, ending this quarter at approximately 0.9%, which continues to be best-in-class within the industry. 
We have also seen strong cash collections well above pre-COVID levels. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 110 basis points on the prior year. And our return on equity is back to a pre-pandemic high teens level of 16.5%. 
Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. Similar to last quarter, we are making great strides in our as-a-service offering this quarter with over 70 new GreenLake logos added in Q1. I am very pleased to report that our Q1 21 ARR came in at $649 million, representing 27% year-over-year reported growth. Total as-a-service orders were up 26% year-over-year, driven by very strong performance in Europe and Japan. 
Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform also contributed to grow revenues strong triple digits year-over-year. Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving its ARR growth targets of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year '20 to fiscal year '23, which I am reiterating today. 
Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date, where you can clearly see the strong rebound from our Q2 trough. Revenue returned back to near pre-pandemic levels last quarter. And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have nearly doubled EPS from the trough and are now growing year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 6. We delivered a non-GAAP gross margin rate of Q1 -- in Q1 of 33.7% of revenues, which was up 300 basis points sequentially and 30 basis points from the prior year period. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, the absence of backlog-related headwinds we had in the second half of last year, operational services, margin expansion from cost takeout and automation and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and Storage. 
Moving to Slide 7. You can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margins, which is up 280 basis points sequentially and 130 basis points from the prior year period. We have done this by driving further productivity benefits while simultaneously maintaining our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our innovation engine and revenue growth targets. 
Q1 operating expenses also benefited from delayed hiring and a pushout of select investments that we will be making to drive further growth. 
Turning to Slide 8, we generated record levels of first quarter cash flows. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1 billion, and free cash flow was $563 million for the quarter, up approximately $750 million from the prior year period. This was primarily driven by the increased profitability, strong operational discipline and some working capital in year timing related benefits. 
Now moving on to Slide 9. Let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet, liquidity position, which are a competitive advantage in the current environment. As of our January 31 quarter end, we had approximately $4.2 billion of cash on hand. 
Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $9 billion of liquidity. 
Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was recently reaffirmed by the rating agencies. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensures we have ample liquidity to run our operations, continue to invest in our business to drive growth and execute on our strategy. 
Now turning to outlook on Slide 10. At our October 2020 Securities Analyst Meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year '21, which we raised by $0.03 at the midpoint to $1.60 to $1.78 in our last earnings release. Today, I'm pleased to announce that we are raising our fiscal year guidance for fiscal year  '21 once again to reflect our strong operational performance to date and confidence in our outlook. 
We now expect to grow our fiscal year  '21 non-GAAP operating profit by over 20% and expect to deliver fiscal year  '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.70 to $1.88, which is a $0.10 per share improvement on the midpoint of our prior EPS guidance of $1.60 to $1.78. 
From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the momentum we saw in Q1. And whilst we continue to see gradual improvement, we remain prudent as we and the rest of the world continue to navigate the pandemic and related macro uncertainties. More specifically for Q2 '21, we expect revenue to be slightly better than in line with our normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q1. This still represents double-digit year-over-year growth from the $6 billion trough of Q2 of fiscal year '20. 
Now with respect to supply chain, I would like to remind everyone that we exited Q4 of fiscal year '20 with higher levels of inventory to protect against the risk of a short-term supply squeeze and address improved customer demand. With these actions and other proactive steps that we've taken in Q1, we do not expect any meaningful impacts on our supply chain in the near term. We are now turning our attention to working on strengthening our inventory supply for the second half of fiscal year '21 as we see improved levels of demand, recognizing also that we have entered an inflationary environment for memory components. 
For Q2 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.02 to $0.08 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 to $0.44. Additionally, given our record levels of cash flow this quarter and raised earnings outlook, I am very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year '21 free cash flow guidance from our SAM guidance of $900 million to $1.1 billion to a revised outlook of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, a $250 million increase at the midpoint. 
So overall, Antonio and I are proud of these results. We have navigated well through unprecedented challenges in the last fiscal year and have started the new fiscal year strong out of the gate. We saw significant acceleration and customer demand in our Intelligent Edge business and the order pipeline, and our HPC MCS business remains robust. 
Our core business of Compute and Storage revenues are stabilizing with improved margins, and our as-a-service ARR continues to show strong momentum aligned to our outlook. 
As a result of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we are emerging from an unprecedented crisis as a different company, one that is much leaner, better-resourced and positioned to capitalize on the gradual economic recovery currently at play. 
We are already seeing the benefits of our actions in our improved margin profile and free cash flow outlook.

We talked about this all the time about the fact that many employees will never return to the office, and they need access to data and services in a very connected way. And so that's why we believe our Aruba business, it is a digital transformation engine for our customers. 
It is not just about access to a WiFi  port, but it's also the fact that provide that edge-to-cloud connectivity for all the apps and data, wherever they live. 
So what we see though is an acceleration for definitely the access to data, the analytics side. We see AI machine learning taking holding every segment of the market because data insights is necessary to compete in this new digital economy. We see, obviously, the need to improve IT resiliency based on the learnings we had in 2020. We see also the need to deploy cloud everywhere. And remember, our definition of the cloud is an experience, not a destination. And that's why we are very bullish about our IHP GreenLake cloud services. The pipeline, the size of the deal, the need to engage in a consultative application-driven conversation is increasing. And that's where we have aligned our advisory and professional services to that part of the business. So I think there is going to be a mix of things, Shannon. But ultimately, digital transformation is no longer a priority. It is a strategic imperative. 
And those who move fast around the data insights and digitizing everything will be the winners. No question."

Listen, I spent more than 50% of my time talking to customers and partners, and I see a renewed focus on making sure the businesses are positioned for success. Definitely, there is a need to modernize their infrastructure and deploy these new technologies across the board. 
Our order linear intake, Wamsi, it was very solid every single week of the quarter. There was no one week that was higher than others. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised about that. The way I manage the business with my team, a quarter has 13 weeks because when you go into a quarter, you already have a week of backlog and then you drive your linearity from there. And it was very consistent. It was across all businesses. 
As Tarek said, our Compute business saw sequential growth in our order intake, the same in our areas of the Storage portfolio, where we are pivoting, particularly everything that's software-defined. 
Aruba was very strong out of the gate, and we see the momentum going through 2021. GreenLake, the same thing. But ultimately, their vision of edge-to-cloud is paying off because ultimately, customers need that architecture and a set of services that they can deliver what they need in this digital transformation. 
So we feel very confident about that. And that's why we are confident in raising the outlook, which Tarek gave you the insights about the EPS upside. So maybe, Tarek, you want to talk about that?"

Now when you look at our margins for this quarter and the need to proceed with select investments, we feel that the guidance that we have on an EPS level is achievable, particularly when you look at the improvement quarter-over-quarter in Q2 and for the rest of the year, as Q3 and Q4 are usually strong quarters for our businesses such as the Intelligent Edge and also Storage. 
With respect to cash flow, our guidance has improved by $250 million at the midpoint, and it's a reflection of the improved outlook on operating profit. I am very pleased to put forward the guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in free cash flow. And we'll see as the year progresses, how this guidance will translate in actual results."

So let's pick up gross margin first, and then we'll talk about our cost optimization, resource allocation program. 
On gross margin, we feel very good that now that we've put behind us all the effects from backlog in Q3, Q4 of last year. We're now operating the business in the context where we have normal business flows between orders and supply chain delivery. And we do acknowledge, like we said before, that there is an inflationary environment on some commodities such as DRAM. But we feel that we have the right levers around pricing and also purchases to navigate the upcoming quarters. We feel very good about our supply chain position in terms of inventory levels for the short term. 
As a reminder, at the end of last year, we stocked up in anticipation of 2 things: a resurgence in customer demand, which we saw happening; and also a potential squeeze in some commodities that we were anticipating back then, which is proving true now. But we are very well positioned to drive that. 
So we will navigate the short-term supply-demand equation reasonably well, pulling on pricing levers as needed in our core. 
In addition to this, you have a mix effect from software rich revenues. These are coming from storage and of course, the Intelligent Edge. Aruba is performing extremely well. It's a very high gross margin business. We see continued growth in Aruba. We've demonstrated 3 quarters of consecutive growth. This is set to continue. The products are in very hot demand everywhere globally. And the mix effect will also play on the gross margin front. 
I think I've given you sufficient color there. So maybe it's time we turn to the cost optimization and resource allocation program. 
The bottom line on this one is we're on track. And the reason why you see our operating margins up to the levels that you've seen north of 11% overall for the company is because of that program. And so what's very, very important for us is that we keep that expense discipline to sustain this level of operating profit growth moving forward and drive productivity, meaning having higher revenue over the same cost base to continue to drive operating profit growth and, therefore, translating into free cash flow growth moving forward. 
The $800 million net run rate benefits, as a reminder, would be felt for the most part in fiscal year '21. You started seeing some of that. We're incurring restructuring costs to that effect. And the program will be over by fiscal year '22. And we're well on track, and I'm very pleased with how it's tracking as we speak."

A couple of points on the investment front. You could see from some of the slides that we put forward, our investment in R&D and FSC, this has to continue, and we'll find adequate sources to fund investments in FSCs and R&D because we have to continue to fuel growth. And this is part of our story, which is to rethink our cost structure in terms of back-office and front-of-house to drive growth and innovation by way of software. 
So I feel pretty good about that. With respect to also your modeling of EPS on a full year basis, I want to take the opportunity to highlight what's going on at the OI&E level. OI&E was a positive contributor to EPS in this quarter. This is just simply due to timing, particularly the contribution of economic interest from HPC. 
For the full year, we still see overall in OI&E $100 million expense. And this is why you may think that the guidance is flat H1 on H2. But don't forget the effect of OI&E coming in, in the second half of the year as an expense."

It is a software asset that delivers mobile-first class first experience, that provides ubiquitous secure connectivity in a platform-oriented approach. So for us, it's not a surprise to see the momentum in that business, which is not just revenue. As Tarek said, 3 consecutive quarters of growth, but also 5 quarters of growth and margin expansion in that business. 
And as we commented early on, our SaaS revenue, which is the subscription to the platform is up triple digits, right, on that part of the business. 
We expect to gain both shares in campus switching and wireless LAN, whether is -- we'll see how the market does. But some of our competitors don't disclose numbers. So it's hard to understand what was down versus up. But I think the market was not as positive as people portray, but we outperformed that market quite significantly. So whether it's 100 basis points, 200 basis points, all we see soon. But I've remained very bullish. I remain very bullish about the business. This business will continue to grow for the balance of the year. Also because now we have silver peak in our portfolio, which is a completely differentiated experience for the SD-WAN. 
And remember what I said early on, in an edge-to-cloud architecture, you have to connect all your edges and all your cloud. And the only way to do it at scale is through software. And Silver Peak brings a SaaS solution and also an on-prem solution that allows customers to connect all their edges on the cloud in a fully automated and autonomous way. And that's a big opportunity for us. And that's why I'm really bullish because ultimately, we are integrating that solution into the same platform. And then there are multiple drivers of growth as we think about the next 12, 24, 36 months, which includes edge computing and 5G. So that's why I'm very, very confident in our ability to deliver against that market."

I mean, I think the market, in general, is recovering. As I said early on, Simon, is my point about the order linearity was steady and consistent throughout the quarter, which give us the confidence that we will see gradual continued improvement in that demand. And it's not one business. I think it's across all businesses. And I think it's a combination of our execution because of our strategy and the emphasis on the innovation that we bring to the market. And obviously, as the market gets better, we should take advantage of that. But remember, we have a unique value proposition. 
We are a company that has unique portfolio from edge to cloud. Our competitors don't have all of that. Some have in one area, some have in another area. And what customers want is an integrated experience more and more. And obviously, the shift to a consumption-driven model is in our favor because once we land a customer in GreenLake, basically, they get what they want, whether it's at the edge or what is in the core or whether it's in a managed services for the hybrid model that they are all adopting. 
So I think Compute, I think there are new technologies coming online with NVMe and more options that can be attached. Storage, obviously, is all the software-defined that Tarek talked about it. Data is exploding. And HPC, I'm very bullish about HPC because ultimately, the data sets we see in customer sites continue to grow. And they all need AI machine learning at one point in time. Not just few customers. So whether it's large public sector, education also is going to be very good because we expect our children to get back to school at some point in time. Obviously, transportation with autonomous vehicles and 5G deployments. 
So I see multiple growth going forward and obviously, it's in our hand to innovate and deliver against that opportunity."

Thank you for joining us today, and I hope you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. It is hard to comprehend everything that has transpired around the world over the last year. The world we",2316,"Well, thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. 
It is hard to comprehend everything that has transpired around the world over the last year. The world we knew pre-pandemic has changed forever, and the need to use innovative technologies to advance the way people live and business operate has never been greater. 
Improving the health of our communities from educating our children to digitizing our economy and enable its recovery creates an enormous opportunity. I believe we are entering a new era, the age of insight, fueled by the amount of data around us. The arrival of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is a marvel of innovation and good news for us all, bringing hope and optimism for what lies ahead. I am personally very excited about the future of innovation and impact it will have. 
I am very pleased with HPE's Q1 results. Our revenue exceeded our outlook and represents a stronger-than-normal sequential seasonality. We significantly expanded our gross and operating margins, driving strong profitability across our businesses ahead of pre-pandemic levels. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded the high end of our guidance, and free cash flow was a record Q1 performance. These results give us confidence to raise our fiscal year '21 EPS and free cash flow outlook, which we will address in more detail later on the call. 
The global pandemic has brought a renewed focus on digital transformation as businesses are rethinking everything from remote work and collaboration to business continuity and data insights. As the work recovers, our customers are looking for the agility and simplicity of the cloud-native world with the flexibility and control of a hybrid business model. This is where we have a unique and differentiated value proposition. 
HPE acted intentionally and quickly last year to become a more agile organization and enable our ability to innovate faster. Our Q1 results demonstrate our progress in enhancing our position to accelerate what comes next for our customers. I am very grateful for our dedicated, passionate and resilient team members. They have been laser-focused on delivering for our customers and executing our strategy to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. 
We are strengthening our core businesses, doubling down in key areas of growth and accelerating our as-a-service pivot to become the edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service  choice for our customers and partners. 
Our total revenue of $6.8 billion was down 3% from the prior year. When normalized for the backlog from last quarter, this is better-than-expected sequential seasonality. 
We saw solid order linearity intake across all of our businesses throughout the quarter. We are executing on multiple growth opportunities, and we are particularly pleased with strong revenue growth in our Intelligent Edge business and growth in our as-a-service orders and revenue. Going forward, we expect to see gradual improvement in customer spending as we progress through fiscal year '21, giving us the confidence in our ability to deliver on our long-term revenue growth guidance. 
Importantly, our non-GAAP gross margin of 33.7% is up 30 basis points year-over-year and 300 basis points sequentially. Our non-GAAP operating profit of 11.3% is up 130 basis points year-over-year, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 is up 4% year-over-year and significantly above the high end of our outlook. 
We generated a record Q1 free cash flow of $563 million, the highest achieved in the first fiscal quarter in the history of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. These are impressive results made possible through disciplined execution, strong expense management and critical investment prioritization. 
Based on the strong start to fiscal year  '21, we are raising our fiscal year '21 non-GAAP EPS outlook to $1.70 to $1.88 and free cash flow to $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion. 
Tarek will discuss the financial results and outlook in greater detail, but let me first give you some additional context around our business segment performance and innovation highlights for the quarter. 
To emerge and recover from the global pandemic, enterprises require secure connectivity, data insight and a cloud experience to accelerate their digital transformation, all of which further reinforces the significance of HP's differentiated edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service vision. 
In our prioritized areas of growth, our Intelligent Edge business had an outstanding quarter, with revenue of $806 million, up 11% year-over-year. We again expect to take market share in both campus switching and wireless LAN segments of the market. 
We are seeing continued traction from our investment at the edge, including rich software capabilities like our Aruba ClearPass security, our cloud-native Aruba Central and most recently, Aruba ESP, our edge services platform. 
Our Aruba SaaS revenue grew triple digits year-over-year. The first full quarter following our Silver Peak acquisition reinforces that we are on track to grow high-margin recurring revenue with technology that accelerates our ability to capture the high-growth SD-WAN market opportunity. 
Our Silver Peak SaaS offering provide customers the ability to connect all their edges and all their clouds in a fully automated and autonomous way. 
We launched new SD-WAN capabilities to centrally monitor, manage and automate connectivity from branch location to AWS, adding support for the AWS Transit Gateway Connect solution. And early today, you may have seen our announcement introducing new solutions from deeper integration between our Aruba ESP and Microsoft Azure, which will simplify IoT device connectivity and bring Aruba Central to Microsoft Azure. 
Finally, we introduced a new class of cloud-native and fully automated data center switching products specifically designed for the edge cloud data centers, which represents a $12 billion TAM expansion opportunity for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. 
These new offerings also enable us to accelerate the delivery of workload optimized solutions for our HP GreenLake Cloud services offerings. Aruba's innovations is why customers like Santander, SKECHERS USA and L3 Harris are choosing Aruba. We have multi-growth drivers in our Intelligent Edge business, and we believe we are well positioned to outgrow the market. 
High-performance compute and mission-critical solution is inherently a lumpy business due to the timing of deals and customer uncertainties because we can only recognize revenues once customer workloads are in production. In Q1, revenue was down 9% from the prior year. We remain very confident in this high-growth segment based on our backlog of our awarded business, which now exceeds well over $2 billion of exascale contracts and a robust pipeline of multimillion-dollar sized deals. 
We are on track to deliver the 8% to 12% annual growth rate communicated at our Security Analyst Meeting last fall. We have a market-leading and differentiated portfolio of technologies that will power the new age of insight. 
We recently introduced HP GreenLake Cloud Services for HPC to accelerate enterprise Main Street adoption or high-performance computing, targeting a $3 billion to $4 billion TAM. Enterprises are running analytics on increasingly large data sets and are adopting new techniques such as artificial intelligence, deep learning and machine learning. And then now we have access to HPC technologies that were historically out of reach. 
In Q1, we won 2 major HPC awards, one with the National Center of Atmospheric Research, a contract worth $35 million, to build a supercomputer for extreme weather research; and another that expands NASA's HP Akin Supercomputer. 
We also completed the installation of the Dammam 7 supercomputer for Saudi Aramco, which immediately became 1 of the top 10 supercomputers in the world. 
Finally, on February 20, you may have seen that HPC Spaceborne Computer 2 was launched into orbit for use on the International Space Station. This system is enabling real-time data processing with advanced commercial edge computing in space for the first time as NASA prepares for future missions. 
Today, I want to share the news that Pete Ungaro has decided to leave the company in April. Pete joined HP with Cray -- with the Cray acquisition and ensured the successful integration of the 2 companies. He has made significant contribution and has grown the business despite the complications and backlog brought by the global pandemic last year. Pete will stay on with the company in a consulting capacity for 6 months. And I'm really grateful for him -- to him for his leadership. 
I am pleased to announce that Justin Hotard, a seasoned HP leader, will take over the leadership of the HPC MCS business and also Hewlett Packard Labs reporting to me. Justin has brought an extensive experience across the company that includes leading our HPE Compute business, where he transformed the x86 compute portfolio and delivered revenue growth, profitability and market share expansion. I'm excited about what Justin will bring to the business. 
In the core businesses of Compute and Storage, our strategy to grow in profitable segments and pivot to more as-a-service solutions is paying off. We drove strong profitability and cash flow in both businesses. 
In Compute, our operating margins of 11.5% increased 80 basis points year-over-year and 490 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Our revenue declined 2% from the prior year but was up low single digits sequentially when normalized for the backlog in Q4. We are encouraged by the sequential growth in new orders intake, taking into account our normal Q2 seasonality. 
Just last week, we launched our new HPE 5G open run solution stack for telecommunications companies to accelerate the commercial adoption of open run in 5G network deployments. This is a transformative technology, featuring the industry's first server optimized for 5G open run workloads with our HP ProLiant servers. This complements the HPE 5G core stack and build last year in March. 
Orange, one of the world's largest mobile network operators, is currently working with HPE to test a full 5G core stack in preparation for broader commercial deployment. 
In Storage, revenue was down 6% from the prior year, with operating margins of 19.7%, which is above the target profitability range we discussed at SAM. 
We continue to see strong revenue growth in our own IP software-defined portfolio, where we have been investing. Our HPE Primera business grew triple digits year-over-year and soon will be bigger than our 3PAR business. This is the fastest revenue ramp ever achieved in our HP storage portfolio. 
Our overall HPE All Flash Array portfolio grew 5%, driven by both HPE Primera and HP Nimble storage. Our hyper-converged strategy continued to gain traction. Our HP Nimble dHCI next-generation technology, powered with artificial intelligence, give customers a cloud-native experience in their own data centers, where they also have the ability to control costs while maintaining data compliance and security. 
Our focus on our own IP software-defined portfolio also improves our ability to attach rich services to our product offerings. Our storage operational services attach intensity is up double digits year-over-year. 
We're also integrating cloud-native software technologies to empower our field and accelerate sales velocity. Just last week, we completed the acquisition of CloudPhysics. This deal provides us with a SaaS-based tool that analyzes IT environment to provide a quick return on investment recommendations for cloud migrations, application modernization and infrastructure. I am very excited about this new addition to our set of capabilities, which we will expand across our entire HP portfolio. 
Our pivot to as-a-service continues its strong momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate of $649 million was up 27% year-over-year. And we had our highest first quarter ever with HP GreenLake Cloud services. The customer adoption continued to be very strong. In Q1, we gained more than 70 new HP GreenLake cloud services logos. 
Lineas, Europe's largest private rail freight operator, selected HP GreenLake Cloud services to support its transformation from a conventional freight company into a high-performing, efficient and sustainable transport system for the European logistics industry. We remain very confident in our unique approach and differentiate the portfolio to capitalize on the rapidly growing on-premises as-a-service market. 
Our new HPE software portfolio and our HP GreenLake manage services offerings enable a true consumption-based experience. Our HP GreenLake Cloud services customer retention rates are above 95%, and the average customer usage of our cloud services currently running at 120% of original commitment, driven by customer expansion in their capacity utilization. We are excited about this long-term opportunity, and I'm very confident in our 30% to 40% CAGR target by fiscal year '22. 
HP continued to benefit from capabilities and services that enable growth in our core business segments. HP Pointnext operational services had a solid quarter. Order trends are improving and revenue has stabilized to flat year-over-year with expanded operating profit margins. 
HP Financial Services provide significant value to our customers as they rebuild and rethink their IT transformation requirements. Q1 revenue stabilized with improved collections to deliver a return on equity of 16.5%. 
Overall, I'm pleased with how we started fiscal year '21. Because of our strong start, we are raising our outlook for both EPS and free cash flow. 
I talk to customers and partners almost every day. And while there continue to be some level of uncertainty, one thing is clear. Customers are looking to accelerate their transformations and in a partner with the right technology, expertise and financial flexibility. Our distinctive and industry-leading portfolio of edge-to-cloud solutions and unique capabilities is resonating with customers. And I believe our team is one of the best in the industry. I'm impressed with our team members' commitment to make bold moves and ensuring we stay true to our service. 
For the third year in a row, HP has been named one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute. And just last week, HP received the terms of Reuters Foundation's Top Slavery Enterprise Award for our leadership in limiting the risk of slavery in our supply chain and operations. 
With this unstoppable team and our portfolio leading solutions, we are well positioned to capture the tremendous opportunity ahead in fiscal year '21 and beyond. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter results. Tarek?"
273983758,703766265,2228889,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 02, 2021",2021-03-02,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year '21. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Anton",2103,"Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year '21. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. 
Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 1. And now let me discuss our financial performance and KPIs, starting with Slide 2. I am delighted to report that our Q1 results were marked by continued momentum in revenue, substantial gross and operating margin expansion and robust cash generation. 
We delivered Q1 revenues of $6.8 billion, down 3% from the prior year period, but better than our typical historical sequential seasonality when normalizing for Q4 backlog. I am particularly proud of the fact that our non-GAAP gross margin returned to above pre-pandemic levels and was up 30 basis points from the prior year period and up 300 basis points sequentially. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, the absence of backlog-related headwinds, cost takeouts and an ongoing favorable mix shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings. 
Our operating expenses decreased year-over-year, thanks to our ongoing structural efficiency measures as well as some timing-related benefits related to hiring in key selected areas, which have been pushed out. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin was 11.3%, up 130 basis points from the prior year, which translates to an 11% year-over-year increase in operating profit. As a result of our strong execution, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, which was up 4% from the prior year and significantly above the higher end of our outlook range. 
Q1 cash flow from operations was close to $1 billion, driven by better profitability and strong operational discipline as well as working capital timing benefits. Q1 free cash flow was $563 million, which was up approximately $750 million from the prior year and a record level for any first HPE first quarter. 
Finally, we paid $155 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q2 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in April 2021. 
Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 3. In Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our momentum with rich software capabilities, delivering 11% year-over-year growth, our third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. 
Switching was up 5% year-over-year with double-digit growth in North America. And wireless LAN was up 11% year-over-year with double-digit growth in both North America and APJ. 
Additionally, the Aruba SaaS offering was up triple digits year-over-year and is now a significant contributor to HPE overall ARR. Based on our solid performance, we expect to take share again this quarter in both campus switching and wireless LAN. We are also seeing the significant operating profit potential of this business with operating margins in Q1 of 18.9%, up 680 basis points year-over-year as we drove greater productivity from past investments and operational leverage benefits kick in. 
Finally, I am pleased to say we recognized our first full quarter of revenue from the acquisition of Silver Peak, the premium growth SD-WAN leader, which contributed approximately 500 basis points to the Intelligent Edge top line growth. 
In HPC and MCS, revenue declined 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the inherent lumpiness of the business, which is linked to the timing of deals and customer acceptance milestones. 
We remain very confident in the near-term and longer-term outlook for this business and are reaffirming our full year and 3-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%, respectively, as highlighted at SAM. 
We have an extremely strong order book of over $2 billion worth of awarded exascale contracts with another $5-plus billion of market opportunity over the next 3 years. 
Finally, we announced the launch of our HPC as a Service offer, which we expect to gain traction later this year and become a further contributor to our overall growing ARR profile. 
In Compute, revenue stabilized to a 2% year-over-year decline, but was up low single digits sequentially when normalizing for Q4 backlog, which attest of a strong order momentum in the quarter. 
Gross and operating margins were up meaningfully quarter-over-quarter due to the absence of any backlog-related margin impact, improved supply chain execution and the rightsizing of the cost structure of this segment. We ended the quarter with an operating profit margin of 11.5%, up 80 basis points from prior year period and at the high end of our long-term margin guidance for this segment provided at SAM. 
Within storage, revenue declined 6% year-over-year, driven by difficult prior year compare, but with strong growth in software-defined offerings. We are extremely well positioned in Storage with Primera and Nimble dHCI. Our most software rich platforms, they are both growing triple digits year-over-year. 
They are absolute winners in the market, and Primera is on track to surpass 3PAR sales as early as next quarter. 
We also saw notable strength in overall Nimble, up 31% year-over-year, and total all-flash arrays were up 5% year-over-year. The mix shift towards our more software-rich platforms helped drive storage operating profit margins to 19.7%, well above our long-term outlook for this segment presented at SAM last October. 
With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue stabilized and was flat year-over-year, driven by the increased focus of our BU segments on selling products and services as bundles, improved services intensity and are growing as-a-service business, which I remind you, involves service attach rates of 100%. This is very important to note because all of our services -- all of our OS revenue is recurring with 3-year average contract length, and OS remains the highest operating margin contributor to our segments. 
Within HPE Financial Services, revenue stabilized and was slightly down 1% year-over-year. As expected, we are seeing sequential improvements in our bad debt loss ratios, ending this quarter at approximately 0.9%, which continues to be best-in-class within the industry. 
We have also seen strong cash collections well above pre-COVID levels. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 110 basis points on the prior year. And our return on equity is back to a pre-pandemic high teens level of 16.5%. 
Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. Similar to last quarter, we are making great strides in our as-a-service offering this quarter with over 70 new GreenLake logos added in Q1. I am very pleased to report that our Q1 21 ARR came in at $649 million, representing 27% year-over-year reported growth. Total as-a-service orders were up 26% year-over-year, driven by very strong performance in Europe and Japan. 
Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform also contributed to grow revenues strong triple digits year-over-year. Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving its ARR growth targets of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year '20 to fiscal year '23, which I am reiterating today. 
Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date, where you can clearly see the strong rebound from our Q2 trough. Revenue returned back to near pre-pandemic levels last quarter. And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have nearly doubled EPS from the trough and are now growing year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 6. We delivered a non-GAAP gross margin rate of Q1 -- in Q1 of 33.7% of revenues, which was up 300 basis points sequentially and 30 basis points from the prior year period. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, the absence of backlog-related headwinds we had in the second half of last year, operational services, margin expansion from cost takeout and automation and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and Storage. 
Moving to Slide 7. You can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margins, which is up 280 basis points sequentially and 130 basis points from the prior year period. We have done this by driving further productivity benefits while simultaneously maintaining our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our innovation engine and revenue growth targets. 
Q1 operating expenses also benefited from delayed hiring and a pushout of select investments that we will be making to drive further growth. 
Turning to Slide 8, we generated record levels of first quarter cash flows. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1 billion, and free cash flow was $563 million for the quarter, up approximately $750 million from the prior year period. This was primarily driven by the increased profitability, strong operational discipline and some working capital in year timing related benefits. 
Now moving on to Slide 9. Let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet, liquidity position, which are a competitive advantage in the current environment. As of our January 31 quarter end, we had approximately $4.2 billion of cash on hand. 
Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $9 billion of liquidity. 
Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was recently reaffirmed by the rating agencies. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensures we have ample liquidity to run our operations, continue to invest in our business to drive growth and execute on our strategy. 
Now turning to outlook on Slide 10. At our October 2020 Securities Analyst Meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year '21, which we raised by $0.03 at the midpoint to $1.60 to $1.78 in our last earnings release. Today, I'm pleased to announce that we are raising our fiscal year guidance for fiscal year  '21 once again to reflect our strong operational performance to date and confidence in our outlook. 
We now expect to grow our fiscal year  '21 non-GAAP operating profit by over 20% and expect to deliver fiscal year  '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.70 to $1.88, which is a $0.10 per share improvement on the midpoint of our prior EPS guidance of $1.60 to $1.78. 
From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the momentum we saw in Q1. And whilst we continue to see gradual improvement, we remain prudent as we and the rest of the world continue to navigate the pandemic and related macro uncertainties. More specifically for Q2 '21, we expect revenue to be slightly better than in line with our normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q1. This still represents double-digit year-over-year growth from the $6 billion trough of Q2 of fiscal year '20. 
Now with respect to supply chain, I would like to remind everyone that we exited Q4 of fiscal year '20 with higher levels of inventory to protect against the risk of a short-term supply squeeze and address improved customer demand. With these actions and other proactive steps that we've taken in Q1, we do not expect any meaningful impacts on our supply chain in the near term. We are now turning our attention to working on strengthening our inventory supply for the second half of fiscal year '21 as we see improved levels of demand, recognizing also that we have entered an inflationary environment for memory components. 
For Q2 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.02 to $0.08 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 to $0.44. Additionally, given our record levels of cash flow this quarter and raised earnings outlook, I am very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year '21 free cash flow guidance from our SAM guidance of $900 million to $1.1 billion to a revised outlook of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, a $250 million increase at the midpoint. 
So overall, Antonio and I are proud of these results. We have navigated well through unprecedented challenges in the last fiscal year and have started the new fiscal year strong out of the gate. We saw significant acceleration and customer demand in our Intelligent Edge business and the order pipeline, and our HPC MCS business remains robust. Our core business of Compute and Storage revenues are stabilizing with improved margins, and our as-a-service ARR continues to show strong momentum aligned to our outlook. 
As a result of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we are emerging from an unprecedented crisis as a different company, one that is much leaner, better-resourced and positioned to capitalize on the gradual economic recovery currently at play. We are already seeing the benefits of our actions in our improved margin profile and free cash flow outlook. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Andy?"

Well, we definitely still see the tailwind of what we saw in 2020. Obviously, we work in a much more distributed environment. We talked about this all the time about the fact that many employees will never return to the office, and they need access to data and services in a very connected way. And so that's why we believe our Aruba business, it is a digital transformation engine for our customers. It is not just about access to a WiFi  port, but it's also the fact that provide that edge-to-cloud connectivity for all the apps and data, wherever they live. 
So what we see though is an acceleration for definitely the access to data, the analytics side. We see AI machine learning taking holding every segment of the market because data insights is necessary to compete in this new digital economy. We see, obviously, the need to improve IT resiliency based on the learnings we had in 2020. We see also the need to deploy cloud everywhere. 
And remember, our definition of the cloud is an experience, not a destination. And that's why we are very bullish about our HP GreenLake cloud services. The pipeline, the size of the deal, the need to engage in a consultative application-driven conversation is increasing. And that's where we have aligned our advisory and professional services to that part of the business. So I think there is going to be a mix of things, Shannon. But ultimately, digital transformation is no longer a priority. It is a strategic imperative. 
And those who move fast around the data insights and digitizing everything will be the winners. No question."

Listen, I spent more than 50% of my time talking to customers and partners, and I see a renewed focus on making sure the businesses are positioned for success. Definitely, there is a need to modernize their infrastructure and deploy these new technologies across the board. 
Our order linear intake, Wamsi, it was very solid every single week of the quarter. There was no one week that was higher than others. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised about that. The way I manage the business with my team, a quarter has 13 weeks because when you go into a quarter, you already have a week of backlog and then you drive your linearity from there. And it was very consistent. It was across all businesses. 
As Tarek said, our Compute business saw sequential growth in our order intake, the same in our areas of the Storage portfolio, where we are pivoting, particularly everything that's software-defined. Aruba was very strong out of the gate, and we see the momentum going through 2021. GreenLake, the same thing. But ultimately, our vision of edge-to-cloud is paying off because ultimately, customers need that architecture and a set of services that they can deliver what they need in this digital transformation. 
So we feel very confident about that. And that's why we are confident in raising the outlook, which Tarek gave you the insights about the EPS upside. So maybe, Tarek, you want to talk about that?"

We feel very good about our guidance for the second quarter and the full year '21. We did express in our scripts that we see our non-GAAP operating profit growing by over 20% year-over-year, and our guidance reflect that. 
Now when you look at our margins for this quarter and the need to proceed with select investments, we feel that the guidance that we have on an EPS level is achievable, particularly when you look at the improvement quarter-over-quarter in Q2 and for the rest of the year, as Q3 and Q4 are usually strong quarters for our businesses such as the Intelligent Edge and also Storage. 
With respect to cash flow, our guidance has improved by $250 million at the midpoint, and it's a reflection of the improved outlook on operating profit. I am very pleased to put forward the guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in free cash flow. And we'll see as the year progresses, how this guidance will translate in actual results."

So let's pick up gross margin first, and then we'll talk about our cost optimization, resource allocation program. 
On gross margin, we feel very good that now that we've put behind us all the effects from backlog in Q3, Q4 of last year, we're now operating the business in the context where we have normal business flows between orders and supply chain delivery. And we do acknowledge, like we said before, that there is an inflationary environment on some commodities such as DRAM, but we feel that we have the right levers around pricing and also purchases to navigate the upcoming quarters. We feel very good about our supply chain position in terms of inventory levels for the short term. 
As a reminder, at the end of last year, we stocked up in anticipation of 2 things: a resurgence in customer demand, which we saw happening; and also a potential squeeze in some commodities that we were anticipating back then, which is proving true now. But we are very well positioned to drive that. So we will navigate the short-term supply-demand equation reasonably well, pulling on pricing levers as needed in our core. 
In addition to this, you have a mix effect from software rich revenues. These are coming from storage and of course, the Intelligent Edge. Aruba is performing extremely well. It's a very high gross margin business. We see continued growth in Aruba. We've demonstrated 3 quarters of consecutive growth. This is set to continue. The products are in very hot demand everywhere globally. And the mix effect will also play on the gross margin front. 
I think I've given you sufficient color there. So maybe it's time we turn to the cost optimization and resource allocation program. 
The bottom line on this one is we're on track. And the reason why you see our operating margins up to the levels that you've seen north of 11% overall for the company is because of that program. And so what's very, very important for us is that we keep that expense discipline to sustain this level of operating profit growth moving forward and drive productivity, meaning having higher revenue over the same cost base to continue to drive operating profit growth and, therefore, translating into free cash flow growth moving forward. 
The $800 million net run rate benefits, as a reminder, would be felt for the most part in fiscal year '21. You started seeing some of that. We're incurring restructuring costs to that effect. And the program will be over by fiscal year '22. And we're well on track, and I'm very pleased with how it's tracking as we speak."

You could see from some of the slides that we put forward, our investment in R&D and FSC, this has to continue, and we'll find adequate sources to fund investments in FSCs and R&D because we have to continue to fuel growth. And this is part of our story, which is to rethink our cost structure in terms of back-office and front-of-house to drive growth and innovation by way of software. 
So I feel pretty good about that. With respect to also your modeling of EPS on a full year basis, I want to take the opportunity to highlight what's going on at the OI&E level. OI&E was a positive contributor to EPS in this quarter. This is just simply due to timing, particularly the contribution of economic interest from HPC. 
For the full year, we still see overall in OI&E $100 million expense. And this is why you may think that the guidance is flat H1 on H2. But don't forget the effect of OI&E coming in, in the second half of the year as an expense."

It is a software asset that delivers mobile first-class, first experience that provides ubiquitous, secure connectivity in a platform-oriented approach. So for us, it's not a surprise to see the momentum in that business, which is not just revenue. As Tarek said, 3 consecutive quarters of growth, but also 5 quarters of growth and margin expansion in that business. And as we commented early on, our SaaS revenue, which is the subscription to the platform, is up triple digits, right, on that part of the business. 
We expect to gain both shares in campus switching and wireless LAN, whether is -- we'll see how the market does. But some of our competitors don't disclose numbers, so it's hard to understand what was down versus up. But I think the market was not as positive as people portray, but we outperformed that market quite significantly. So whether it's 100 basis points, 200 basis points, all we see soon. But I remained very bullish. I remain very bullish about the business. This business will continue to grow for the balance of the year. Also because now we have Silver Peak in our portfolio, which is a completely differentiated experience for the SD-WAN. 
And remember what I said early on, in an edge-to-cloud architecture, you have to connect all your edges and all your cloud. And the only way to do it at scale is through software. And Silver Peak brings a SaaS solution and also an on-prem solution that allows customers to connect all their edges on the cloud in a fully automated and autonomous way. And that's a big opportunity for us. And that's why I'm really bullish because ultimately, we are integrating that solution into the same platform. And then there are multiple drivers of growth as we think about the next 12, 24, 36 months, which includes edge computing and 5G. So that's why I'm very, very confident in our ability to deliver against that market."

I mean, I think the market, in general, is recovering. As I said early on, Simon, is my point about the order linearity was steady and consistent throughout the quarter, which give us the confidence that we will see gradual continued improvement in that demand. And it's not one business. I think it's across all businesses. And I think it's a combination of our execution because of our strategy and the emphasis on the innovation that we bring to the market. And obviously, as the market gets better, we should take advantage of that. But remember, we have a unique value proposition. 
We are a company that has unique portfolio from edge to cloud. Our competitors don't have all of that. Some have in one area, some have in another area. And what customers want is an integrated experience more and more. And obviously, the shift to a consumption-driven model is in our favor because once we land a customer in GreenLake, basically, they get what they want, whether it's at the edge or what is in the core or whether it's in a managed services for the hybrid model that they are all adopting. 
So I think Compute, I think there are new technologies coming online with NVMe and more options that can be attached. Storage, obviously, is all the software-defined that Tarek talked about it. Data is exploding. And HPC, I'm very bullish about HPC because ultimately, the data sets we see in customer sites continue to grow. And they all need AI machine learning at one point in time. Not just few customers. So whether it's large public sector, education also is going to be very good because we expect our children to get back to school at some point in time. Obviously, transportation with autonomous vehicles and 5G deployments. 
So I see multiple growth going forward and obviously, it's in our hand to innovate and deliver against that opportunity."

We saw solid sequential improvement in total HPE orders growth that was up mid-single digits with double-digit growth in HPE GreenLake and HPC business segments. We expect to continue to see improvement in customer IT spending throughout 2021. Our disciplined execution on our strategic priorities outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting last fall is positively impacting both top and bottom line performance. We are strengthening our core businesses, doubling down in key areas of growth and accelerating our ultra service pivot while advancing our cloud-first innovation agenda to become the edge-to-cloud Platform-as-a-Service choice for our customers and partners. 
We have also executed well throughout the industry-wide tightening and cost inflationary trends with minimal impact to our first half. We have taken proactive inventory buffering measures to position us well for the second half. We will continue to take additional inventory actions as appropriate in alignment to the market demand by leveraging great engineering capabilities and our long-term agreements with our suppliers. Our continued strong performance give us the confidence to raise our fiscal year '21 EPS and free cash flow outlook for the third time since our Security Analyst Meeting. We will provide more details about this new guidance later in the call. 
First, let me review some key Q2 highlights. Revenue of $6.7 billion was up 9% year-over-year, with better-than-normal sequential seasonality. I'm particularly pleased with the double-digit revenue growth in both our HPC and Intelligent Edge businesses that together now represents  2 -- 22% of our HPE total revenue. 
Our as-a-service annual recurring revenue growth was an impressive 30% year-over-year, which underscores our momentum in enabling consumption-based IT. This is an important long-term growth driver for our company. 
We made significant improvements in both gross and operating margins. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 34.3% is at record level and up 210 basis points year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating profit of 10.2% is up 300 basis points year-over-year. And our non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 is up [ 17% ] year-over-year and above the high end of our outlook range. These results contribute to Q2 free cash flow of $368 million, which is up $770 million year-over-year. bringing our first half fiscal year '21 free cash flow to a record $931 million. 
Tarek will discuss the financial results and outlook in greater detail. Before he does that, I want to provide additional comments on our business segment performance and highlight some of the innovative solutions and experiences we introduced during the quarter. 
HPE has been a driving transformation in our businesses to deliver a modern secure cloud experience everywhere to help our customers with their digital transformations. Our Intelligent Edge business accelerated its momentum with an outstanding quarter across all metrics. Revenue of $799 million grew 17% year-over-year, and operating profit expanded 320 basis points year-over-year. This is the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and sixth consecutive quarter of operating profit expansion. Edge-as-a-service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year and now a meaningful contributor to HPE's overall ARR. 
Extended to the edge has never been more critical for enterprises. At Aruba Atmosphere, our signature event for Aruba customers and partners, we announced an expansive set of cross-portfolio edge-to-cloud security integrations for our Aruba Edge Services Platform, or ESP, including SD-WAN technology from our recent Silver Peak acquisition. 
Today, our Aruba Edge Services platform already supports well over 100,000 customers with 150 new customers added every day, connecting over 1 million active devices.  Aruba building identity network security is unique in the market and provides the ideal foundation for building a zero trust and secure access service edge. 
Our comprehensive portfolio and AI power cloud dreaming platforms like Aruba ESP and Aruba Central will continue to accelerate one and security deployment, advanced cloud and IoT adoption and fast track digital transformation. Customers like Walgreens, Boots Alliance and Mercado Libre chose Aruba in Q2 for these reasons. 
I am tremendously pleased with Aruba's impressive performance, and it is against this successful backdrop that I want to share that Aruba Founder, Keerti Melkote, has made the decision to retire from HPE. 
We acquired Aruba in 2015 when we saw the edge as the next frontier. Aruba and Keerti has been instrumental in accelerating this business to the $3 billion business it is today. I'm incredibly grateful for his leadership, and I have personally benefited from his counsel, knowledge and friendship. Keerti will remain as an adviser to me for the remainder of 2021. 
I am pleased to announce that effective today, Phil Motta will take over the leadership of our Aruba Intelligent Edge business. Phil is a result-driven leader with extensive experience, implementing growth strategies and leading transformation initiatives. He joined HPE in 2019 and most recently assumed the role as the General Manager of our Communication Technology Group, leading a team of more than 5,000 team members  who drive $500 million in CPG specific revenue and $3.5 billion in total revenue for HPE. I'm excited to welcome Phil into this new role and believe he is the perfect fit to ensure we maintain our leadership position and strong momentum in the market. 
In our high-performance compute and Mission Critical Solutions business, revenue of $685 million was up 11% year-over-year. We are the undisputed market leader with an industry-leading portfolio in AI and people learning solutions for the new age of insights. 
We continue to execute on over $2 billion in awarded contract, and we are pursuing a robust pipeline of another $5 billion in market opportunity over the next 3 years. 
In Q2, we announced several new HPC systems deals and collaborations. This includes building new supercomputer to advance scientific research for the Swiss National Supercomputer Center, the United States Department of Energy Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Supercomputing Center in Singapore. 
As we have noted on previous calls, this is an inherently lumpy business due to the lead times between ordinary revenue recognition, but we remain on track to deliver our target of 8% to 12% annual growth in this business this year. 
Our Compute and Storage businesses performed very well in the quarter. Our strategy to grow in profitable segments of the market and pivot to more as-a-service solutions is paying off. In compute revenue, $3 billion was up 10% year-over-year. We drove strong operational performance, expanding operating margins by 550 basis points. 
We expanded our portfolio with the latest AMD EPYC and Intel Zscaler processors, which include launching 3 new HPE ProLiant solutions targeting 5G deployments in telco, virtual desktop infrastructure and storage optimized solutions for database world lots in enterprise. 
In Storage, revenue of $1.1 billion was up 3% year-over-year with a strong operating profit of 16.8%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see strength in key software-defined solutions, which drive our ability to attach rich services to our product offerings. 
HPE Primera and Nimble HCI both grew triple digits. RHP's All Flash Array portfolio grew 20%. 
On May 4, we introduced a new portfolio of cloud-native data infrastructure called HPE Altra. This portfolio delivers world of optimize systems and provides customers with architectural flexibility to run any application without compromise from edge to cloud with a cloud operational experience. These innovations are propelling our storage business into our cloud-native software-defined data services business. 
Our pivot to as a Service continued its strong momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate of $678 million was up 30% year-over-year. We saw strong total as a Service order growth of 41%. Over 900 go-to-market partners are now actively selling HPE GreenLake as a part of their own marketplace. And we average a 95% renewal rate with billings from those customers at 124% usage of the regional contract commitments. 
We have an unmatched portfolio of hybrid cloud services that spans all aspects of networking, compute, storage, VMs, competes, MLabs, HPC and more. On the innovation front, we announced a transformative new data storage services platform that brings a cloud operation model to whatever data lets but unify in state operations. The platform will be available through HP GreenLake Central and includes a new data services cloud console and a suite of software subscription services that simplifies and automates global infrastructure and scale. 
Our industry-leading HPC let cloud services experience enable us to gain more than 90 new customers during the quarter. Carestream is a great recent customer, for example. In a 3 years multimillion-dollar deal, Carestream selected HPC cloud services with software and services to power a transformative new health care initiatives based on artificial intelligence as a service. We will continue to invest aggressively in HPE GreenLake cloud services to provide a true cloud experience and operating model, whether at the edge on premises across multiple clouds.  HPE businesses that provide services and capability of our customers recently transformed also performed well in Q2. 
HPE Pointnext Operational Services had another solid quarter with revenue growing year-over-year as reported. We expect to see growth for the full fiscal year, driven by our growing services intensity and other service momentum. 
HPE Financial Services continue to play an important role helping our customers as they rebuild and rethink their IT transformation requirements. Cash collections continue to improve, and HPE FS delivered a return on equity of 18.3%, well above pre-pandemic levels. This business continued to perform very well. 
Over the past year, our global communities have faced a catastrophic health crisis and significant business disruption. At HPE, we accelerated our strategy to be the edge-to-cloud Platform-as-a-Service company to support our customers' rapidly changing needs. We have defined our 60,000 team members demonstrated amazing agility and perseverance. And I'm tremendously proud of our team members' response with time and want to thank them for their commitment and passion that has made HPE stronger and better position in a world that is whatever changed. 
As businesses emerge from the pandemic and move beyond the median of COVID, digital transformation is at the forefront of their strategic initiatives. 
At our Discover event on June 22, you will hear more about how HPE or the center of this to procure digital economy. A edge-to-cloud architecture, software and solutions all delivered as a service will continue to help our customers transform their businesses, optimize their applications and data increasingly distributing world and be future ready today. I'm excited about our momentum, and I believe the HPE represents a strong investment opportunity for our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter's results."
273983758,714395818,2306843,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2021",2021-06-01,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year '21. As usual, I'm be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio",1981,"Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year '21. As usual, I'm be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 1, and now let me discuss our financial performance, starting with Slide 2. 
I am very pleased to report that our Q2 results reflect continued momentum in revenue, strong growth and operating margin expansion and robust cash flow generation. 
We delivered Q2 revenues of $6.7 billion, up 9% from the prior year period, a level better than our normal sequential seasonality. I am particularly proud of the fact that our non-GAAP gross margin is at the record level of 34.3%, up 210 basis points from the prior year period and up 60 basis points sequentially. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, cost takeouts and an ongoing favorable mix shift towards higher-margin software rich offering. Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased in the quarter, as we previously indicated due to the planned hiring increases along with R&D and go-to-market investments This offset by our continued progress delivering on the savings from our cost optimization plan, which is on track. 
Even with our investments, our non-GAAP operating margin was 10.2%. That is up 300 basis points from our prior year, which translates to a 59% year-over-year increase in operating profit. 
Within other income and expense, we benefited from onetime gains related to increased valuations in our Cohesity and Ion Q investments within our Pathfinder Venture portfolio. As a result, we now expect other income and expense for the full year in fiscal year '21 to be an expense of approximately $50 million. 
With strong execution across the business, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.46, up 70% from the prior year and meaningfully above the higher end of our outlook range for Q2. Q2 cash flow from operations was $822 million and free cash flow was $368 million, up $770 million from the prior year, driven by better profitability and strong operational discipline as well as working capital benefits. This puts us at a record level of free cash flow for the first half at $931 million. 
Finally, we paid $156 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q3 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in July. 
Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 3. In Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our momentum with rich software capabilities to meet robust customer demand, delivering 17% year-over-year revenue growth across the portfolio. Switching was up 17% year-over-year, and wireless LAN was up 16%. Additionally, the Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year and now represent a meaningful contribution to HPE's overall ARR. 
We also continue to see strong operating margins at 15.5% in Q2, up 320 basis points year-over-year, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin expansion.  
Silver Peak continues to perform well, leveraging the high-growth SD-WAN market opportunity and contributed about 5 points to the intelligent edge top line growth. 
In HPC MCS, revenue grew 11% year-over-year as we continue to achieve more customer acceptance milestones and deliver on our more than $2 billion of awarded contracts. We remain on track to deliver on our full year and 3-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%. 
In Compute, revenue grew 10% year-over-year and was down just 1% sequentially, reflecting much stronger-than-normal sequential seasonality. Operating margins were up meaningfully year-over-year due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. We ended the quarter with an operating profit margin of 11.3%, up 550 basis points from the prior year period and towards the upper range of our long-term margin guidance for these segments provided at SAM. 
Within Storage, revenue grew 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. Nimble grew 17% with ongoing strong dHCI momentum growing triple digits. All Flash Arrays grew 20% year-over-year, led by Primera, that was up triple digits and is expected to surpass 3PAR sales next quarter. 
The mix shift towards our more software-rich platforms and operational execution helped drive storage operating profit margin to 16.8%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. 
With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the second consecutive quarter year-over-year as reported with further growth expected for the full year of fiscal year '21. This has been driven by the increased focus of our BU segments on selling product and service bundles, improve service intensity and our growing as a Service business, which I'll remind you, enrolls service attach rates of 100%. This is very, very important to note because all of our OS revenue is recurring with 3-year average contract length, and OS is the highest operating margin contributor to our segments. 
Within HPE Financial Services, revenue was down 3% year-over-year as the pandemic did not materially impact this business until later in 2020. As expected, we are seeing continued sequential improvements in our bad debt loss ratios ending this quarter at just 75 basis points, which continues to be best-in-class within the industry. We have also seen improved cash collections well above pre-COVID levels. 
Our operating margin in this segment was 10.8%, up 160 basis points from the prior year and our return on equity at 18.3% is well above pre-pandemic levels and the 15%-plus target that we set at SAM. 
Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our growing as a Service business. Similar to the past couple of quarters, we are making great strides in our as a Service offering with over 90 new enterprise Green Lake customers added. That is in Q2, bringing the total to well over 1,000. 
I am pleased to report that our Q2 '21 ARR was $678 million, which was up 30% year-over-year as reported. Total as a Service orders were up 41% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in North America and Central Europe. Our Edge-as-a-Service offerings also continued to grow revenue strong triple digits year-over-year. 
Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving our ARR growth targets of 30% to 40%, a CAGR from FY '20 to FY '23. 
Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date where you can clearly see the strong rebound and momentum from our Q2 '20 trough. For the past 2 quarters, revenue has exceeded our normal sequential seasonality, reflecting the improving demand environment and with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP EPS in Q2 by 70% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 6. We delivered a record non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q2 of 34.3% of revenues which was up 60 basis points sequentially and up 210 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, operational services margin expansion from cost takeout and automation and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and next-generation storage offering. 
We have also benefited from the new segmentation we implemented beginning of fiscal year '20 that has given us much better visibility into each business unit and enabled better operational discipline. 
Moving to Slide 7. You can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margin substantially from pandemic lows of -- to 10.2%, which is up 300 basis points from the prior year period. We have done this by driving further productivity benefits and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan while simultaneously increasing our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets. Q2 operating expenses also included planned increased hiring and spending on select investment to drive further growth. 
Turning to Slide 8. We generated a record first half levels of cash flow with $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and $931 million of free cash flow, which is up $1.5 billion year-over-year. This was primarily driven by the increased profitability, strong operational discipline and some near timing-related benefits. 
I would like to underscore that this year, our free cash flow profile seasonality will be different as a result of our back-end-loaded restructuring costs and investment in inventory for our supply chain to cater for rising demand and chip shortages as the economic recovery accelerate. 
Now moving on to Slide 9, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet. As of April 30 quarter end, we have improved the operating company to a net cash neutral position with our strong free cash flow. Furthermore, we have made good progress securitizing some financial services-related debt through the ABS market and expect to have close to all of the U.S. portfolio securitized by year-end. The refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at a cheaper cost of debt capital as well as diversifying and segregating our balance sheet between our operating company and our financial services business. 
Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensures we have ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business, drive growth and execute on our strategy. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 10. I am very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in the demand environment and our strong operational performance to date. This will be our third guidance increase in SAM in October 2020. 
We now expect to grow non-GAAP operating profit by 25% to 35% and deliver fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.82 and $1.94. This is a $0.09 per share improvement at the midpoint of our prior EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.88 and a $0.22 per share improvement at the midpoint since SAM. 
With respect to supply chain, we have executed well to date with minimal impact and continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible. We do see further industry while tightening and inflation persisting in the near term, which has been factored in our outlook from both a revenue and cost perspective, but overall demand remains strong. From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the momentum we saw in the first half. And while we continue to see further demand improvement, we remain prudent as certain geographies continue to navigate the pandemic, and we continue to observe uncertainties in the supply of commodity. 
More specifically for Q3 '21, we expect revenue to be in line with our normal sequential seasonality of up low single digits from Q2. For Q3 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.04 to $0.10 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 to $0.44. Additionally, given our record levels of cash flow in the first half and raised earnings outlook, I am very pleased to announce that we are also raising FY '21 free cash flow guidance to $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. That is a $350 million increase at the midpoint from our original SAM guidance. 
So overall, Antonio and I are very proud of the progress we have made in the first half. We have navigated well through the pandemic and are exiting the first half with improved revenue momentum, strong profitability and robust cash flow. 
Our growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC-MCS have accelerated top line performance. Our core business of Compute and Storage revenues are growing with improved margins, and our as-a-Service ARR is accelerating. We also continue to execute well against our cost optimization and resource allocation program, which has made us leaner, better resourced and positioned to capitalize on the economic recovery currently at play. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

Wamsi, Tarek here. So let me try and dissect the guidance we gave for Q3 and also the full year. So putting things in perspective. First, you know we are raising our FY '21 EPS outlook by $0.09 at the midpoint to $1.82 to $1.94 based on our Q2 outp",316,"Yes. Wamsi, Tarek here. So let me try and dissect the guidance we gave for Q3 and also the full year. So putting things in perspective. 
First, you know we are raising our FY '21 EPS outlook by $0.09 at the midpoint to $1.82 to $1.94 based on our Q2 outperformance. And we feel very confident for the rest of the year. This reflects what we see as continued improvement in customer spending, but also we want to remain prudent given the remaining pandemic and supply chain uncertainty. 
Specifically for Q3, it's important to note that we do expect revenue growth in line with normal FY '18, FY '19 sequential seasonality of up low single digits. We anchored you on FY '18 -- FY '19 and not last year because of the disruption we suffered in the supply chain last year. So it's better to look at it from an FY '18, FY '19 viewpoint. 
You should expect that gross margins hold roughly flat relative to our H1 levels near just under 34%. OpEx should be up somewhat as we continue to make select investments aligned to our strategy in key growth areas, and this is partially offset by further efficiencies we find. 
But most importantly, it is important that you note that OI&E will flip to an expense overall in the full year, and therefore, in the second half. OI&E in Q1 was a positive income, and Q2 was a positive income. And now we're expecting for the full year '21 a [ $50 ] million expense, hence, the guidance that we're giving you overall for Q3. You can expect that the tax rate will be unchanged at 14%, like we said at SAM. And the net of all of this is that we expect our Q3 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.44, and we feel pretty comfortable about it."

We quoted in our remarks that we're up mid-single digits and, therefore, we translate that conversion into revenue. But obviously, part of the improvement could come from the HPC acceptances. Remember that on HPC, our order to revenue is a little bit more lumpy because of the time between orders and revenue tax longer. But overall, what we are confident is the fact that we see obviously IT demand improving. But I'm really pleased with our innovation and our ability to execute against that innovation. The innovation we have across the portfolio is perfectly timed what we see in today's environment. 
We live in a much more distributed enterprise. Obviously, digital transformation is essential to operate in this digital economy, and the first step is connectivity. And I have to tell you, the Intelligent Edge business is absolutely incredibly strong. 
You saw in actual dollars, almost 20%. And we expect to continue to be super strong for the balance of the year into 202, honestly. And that's because we have a business at scale. You have a massive business scale and to give a point of reference. We already have 100,000 customers on that platform. We have 150 customers every day. We manage more than 1.1 million devices. And honestly, we actually manage data of 1 billion plus per hour, data points that comes through our cloud. 
And so we expect that to continue to be very strong. I think the core business has definitely stabilized, and we see pockets of improvement, particularly with Storage. And then the other service will continue to stay strong. 
Again, we are cautious about the supply chain aspect of this. But we position ourselves well for the second half, and that was all factored in our guidance, absolutely well factored in our guidance, so it's why we raised the guidance."

This is a level of earnings that was actually benefiting from the fact that we have a very strong run rate entering into Q1. 
In Q2, you saw that momentum continuing with the EPS that we posted at $0.46 per share. Very comfortable with the level of investments that we are making, and this is also showing in the gross and operating margin expansion that we've demonstrated so far. 
So now when you also look at how this translates into free cash flow, obviously, we had a lot of free cash flow benefits into Q1, Q2 as a result of the earnings strength and which translated into free cash flow. But moving forward, what you have to factor into the guidance on earnings is the fact that there is some degree of uncertainty on supply chain, although, as Antonio said, the demand is very strong across the board. 
The demand is very strong in Aruba. The demand is very strong in Compute. And you can see that with units going up year-over-year. And also in HPC-MCS, we are seeing the revenue trending in the range that we guided at SAM. This is all good. 
Having said that, we have also to reckon 2 other dynamics aside from the cost optimization program and the demand. The other dynamic is OI&E, which affects EPS in Q3 and Q4. Q1, Q2, we had 2 income quarters as far as OI&E is concerned. They'll flip into an expense of $50 million for the full year gives you an order of magnitude of what would be the EPS for each one of Q3, Q4. 
And then on free cash flow, the other final element that drives it is we have to deal with supply chain, and we continue to buffer inventory to be ready for the demand in fiscal year '21 for the second half, but also fiscal year '22. We do not expect that the situation on inventory is going to be all of a sudden setting up across the world and across the industries, and we've taken steps, and we'll continue to do so. 
So overall, we're managing, I would say, the resurgent demand environment very well. We're lean from an organization standpoint. Our earnings power is shown by the margins we're posting. And also, you could see that what we're doing on free cash flow, we're doing very, very well. So hopefully, that gives you color to your questions with the rankings of the various effects at play."

I understand the normal sequential seasonality, people trying to get into it. But the fact of the matter is we are delivering record-breaking gross margin. We are raising our EPS guidance despite the supply chain uncertainty. And our business is in huge demand. 
And it's not just the IT demand, it's the fact that we have unique portfolio, edge-to-cloud, that's meeting the customer needs of today and future ready for tomorrow. And so I think the fact is that when you look at the full year, right, we have raised guidance now 3 times. And to Tarek's point, it's more than 25% from the beginning of the year. And that's a testament of the momentum we have in the business. 
Then obviously, every quarter has ups and downs because of unique things like OI&E or maybe more inventory buildout. But again, the takeaway is that we are raising again the EPS for the full year and free cash flow."

But obviously, our portfolio, which is ProLiant is on the 23 years in the making and our installed base is incredibly large. 
The average is probably between 4, 5 years, Kyle, at this point in time. Definitely, it's a pent-up demand to modernize that infrastructure. But it's not just replacing hardware for the sake of replacing hardware.  It's to really bring that cloud experience to our computer source and more and more be able to consume it elastically as a service. And that's the unique value proposition we have, which is not only just the best infrastructure with ProLiant as a franchise, but the fact that we have a provisional life cycle management, and you should stay tuned for more announcement here shortly, but also be able to pivot that installed base to more a consumption base over time, and then more and more as a well to optimize solutions. 
And remember, these platforms come also in a different structure in the sense that you have more options and more technologies built into the platform. And so for us, it's a big opportunity. And I think an accelerator of that position is our GreenLake business. It's not just replacing the old infrastructure but be able to and repatriate workloads on-prem where it makes sense, or actually whole world lots on-prem because now we can deliver a true cloud experience in our consumption-driven model."

There's also another aspect that we see the pent-up demand and really the need to modernize the infrastructure and the way the infrastructure is used. But also if the decision to actually modernize the infrastructure and moving to consumption isn't made, it's not bad for us because we benefit from extended leasing with our financial services portfolio, has been doing extremely well with our asset management business as people tend to use the infrastructure more absent a decision or an availability of supply for the equipment they want to use.

I mean, obviously, if you look about the way we operate and the growth in IoT and the need for connectivity, obviously, is continuing to grow. 
Interesting enough, 3 years ago, I said that the enterprise of the future will be edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And is play exactly that way. Unfortunately, through the COVID pandemic, we saw that acceleration. But when you think about digital transformation, right, obviously, we live in a digital economy. And the first step is to be connected. If you're not connected, you now participate in that connectivity is not just any more users and devices is things. Everything is connected to the network, everything computes, everything generates data. 
And so connectivity is at the forefront of the digital transformation. And obviously, remote working is requiring the need for WiFi connectivity to a level we haven't seen before. But that's an example of what's happening out there. But I will say our innovation with a true cloud-native platform at massive scale. And again, the fact that we already have 100,000 customers, and we're adding 150 customers every day, that tells you the value proposition resonated. 
We can provision a WAN port, a LAN port or a WiFi port or a BLE or Zile, whatever is the multi protocol from the cloud. And we're able to do that in an intelligent and autonomous way. Because ultimately, it's about the data you collect and what experiences you can provide. 
And so we believe this is absolutely durable. We are very bullish about this business. We expect this business to continue to grow double digits for the balance of the year. And as we add more functionality by cloud platform, particularly with edge computing and 5G, we are going to accelerate that momentum. And when you talk to customers and partners, they love the Aruba experience, absolutely love the simplicity, the law of the fact that you improve their experience for their own business and then powers this new way to work. 
So that's why we are pretty excited. And the other thing is that the platform, that Aruba runs the cloud is not the platform we run the rest of the company. When we deploy now one of the data services through the new announcements we made on May 4, or where we deploy compute or when we deploy a word load optimize is running on the same back end that Aruba was originally created. And that's why we have a true edge-to-cloud platform. And then we lay on top of that the other service model, whether it's subscription and software, which is growing triple digit or Aruba or whether it's the as a Service model with GreenLake, And that's the unique differentiation we have in the marketplace. And that's why we feel very good about the growth prospect of this business.  Tarek, OI&E?"

On the OI&E front, thanks for asking the question as to why we expect one to flip into an expense in the second half. Ian, you have effectively 3 effects. The first one is the H3C economic contribution and the timing of which shifts between quarters Well, we're like we said before, very happy with H3C and the economic interest that we have through them and the cash they return to us on a regular basis. So it's a timing element there for HCC. There is also interest expense that is the second force in the line. 
And then the third force is the Pathfinder portfolio, our venture portfolio, which has been doing extremely well in the first half, and we did flag this in my script. We said we had benefits from revaluations of our investment in Cohesity and IQ. We had, in the first quarter, OI&E is $16 million income in the second quarter, a $27 million income. This is on an aggregate basis across the 3 forces. So for the first half, $43 million of OI&E income, and we're guiding for the full year for an expense of $50 million. So that's a $90 million swing. And that $90 million swing, if you turn it into an EPS number, divide that to do the math yourself, it's about $0.07 to $0.08 of EPS for the full year, right? That's the thing you have to reckon when you compute your Q3 or Q4 EPS forecast, that's the swing factor there. It does not change the fact that our operating performance remains very, very solid. The swing factor at the R&D level is explaining a little bit more, hopefully, the guidance for all of you on the call."

Listen, the booking momentum is incredibly strong in this business. So you have to look at the booking side and then you have to look at the revenue side. The buckets continue to be just amazing. And I quote some of the deals we want. These are multimillion dollar deals. Seasonality in this business doesn't really play out that well because the fact of the matter is that you have these large systems that need to be built, shipped install, you have to run the workload. And then only then when the customer accepts the system with a workload, you can recognize revenue. 
And that time can vary, it can be as quick as 3 months as long as a year in some cases, especially when you deploy these massive exascale systems, which we're going to do starting end of the year and then next year in 2022. And sometimes you need to run the dollar for a lot, but we're installing the system from the factory on the floor, sometimes can take up to 60 days. It's just -- it's a size of football field. 
So I would not think about the seasonality. I think about the long-term growth of the business, we feel pretty good and confident about that CAGR. But even this year, we believe we're going to deliver the 8% to 12% growth just this year in 2021, right? So this is about keeping the orders book momentum, short term, the life cycle of the supply chain and install and acceptance as much as we can. And then this business is a lot of software, right, that gets built around the system itself. So that's why we're very bullish about this system -- this business.

And because of the lumpiness of the revenue, you also have lumpiness in profitability as a result of the revenue profile and the product mix that doesn't worry us at all.

I want to take a moment to acknowledge the suffering occurring in India and elsewhere as communities confront devastating COVID surges. We will continue to do everything we can to support our team members, customers and communities through this very challenging time.  
Hewlett Packard Enterprise had a strong second quarter. I'm very pleased with our results and that they are marked by revenue growth, strong profitability and free cash flow. The overall demand environment is improving, and we are seeing traction across our portfolio.  
We saw solid sequential improvement in total HPE orders growth that was up mid-single digits with double-digit growth in HPE GreenLake and HPC business segments. We expect to continue to see improvement in customer IT spending throughout 2021. Our disciplined execution on our strategic priorities outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting last fall is positively impacting both top and bottom line performance. We are strengthening our core businesses, doubling down in key areas of growth and accelerating our ultra service pivot while advancing our cloud-first innovation agenda to become the edge-to-cloud Platform-as-a-Service choice for our customers and partners.  
We have also executed well throughout the industry-wide tightening and cost inflationary trends with minimal impact to our first half. We have taken proactive inventory buffering measures to position us well for the second half. We will continue to take additional inventory actions as appropriate, in alignment to the market demand by leveraging great engineering capabilities and our long-term agreements with our suppliers. Our continued strong performance give us the confidence to raise our fiscal year '21 EPS and free cash flow outlook for the third time since our Security Analyst Meeting.  We will provide more details about this new guidance later in the call.  
First, let me review some key Q2 highlights. Revenue of $6.7 billion was up 9% year-over-year, with better-than-normal sequential seasonality. I'm particularly pleased with the double-digit revenue growth in both our HPC and Intelligent Edge businesses that together now represents 2 -- 22% of our HPE total revenue.  
Our as-a-Service annual recurring revenue growth was an impressive 30% year-over-year, which underscores our momentum in enabling consumption-based IT. This is an important long-term growth driver for our company.  
We made significant improvements in both gross and operating margins. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 34.3% is at record level and up 210 basis points year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating profit of 10.2% is up 300 basis points year-over-year. And our non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 is up 70% year-over-year and above the high end of our outlook range. These results contribute to Q2 free cash flow of $368 million, which is up $770 million year-over-year, bringing our first half fiscal year '21 free cash flow to a record $931 million.  
Tarek will discuss the financial results and outlook in greater detail. Before he does that, I want to provide additional comments on our business segment performance and highlight some of the innovative solutions and experiences we introduced during the quarter.  
HPE has been a driving transformation in our businesses to deliver a modern secure cloud experience everywhere to help our customers with their digital transformations. Our Intelligent Edge business accelerated its momentum with an outstanding quarter across all metrics. Revenue of $799 million grew 17% year-over-year, and operating profit expanded 320 basis points year-over-year. This is the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and sixth consecutive quarter of operating profit expansion. Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year and now a meaningful contributor to HPE's overall ARR.  
Extended to the edge has never been more critical for enterprises. At Aruba Atmosphere, our signature event for Aruba customers and partners, we announced an expansive set of cross-portfolio edge-to-cloud security integrations for our Aruba Edge Services Platform, or ESP, including SD-WAN technology from our recent Silver Peak acquisition.  
Today, our Aruba Edge Services platform already supports well over 100,000 customers with 150 new customers added every day, connecting over 1 billion active devices. Aruba building identity network security is unique in the market and provides the ideal foundation for building a zero trust and Secure Access Service Edge.  
Our comprehensive portfolio and AI-powered, cloud-driven platforms like Aruba ESP and Aruba Central will continue to accelerate WAN and security deployment, advanced cloud and IoT adoption and fast track digital transformation. Customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance and Mercado Libre chose Aruba in Q2 for these reasons.  
I am tremendously pleased with Aruba's impressive performance, and it is against this successful backdrop that I want to share that Aruba founder, Keerti Melkote, has made the decision to retire from HPE. We acquired Aruba in 2015 when we saw the edge as the next frontier. Aruba and Keerti has been instrumental in accelerating this business to the $3 billion business it is today. I'm incredibly grateful for his leadership, and I have personally benefited from his counsel, knowledge and friendship. Keerti will remain as an adviser to me for the remainder of 2021.  
I am pleased to announce that effective today, Phil Mottram will take over the leadership of our Aruba Intelligent Edge business. Phil is a result-driven leader with extensive experience implementing growth strategies and leading transformation initiatives. He joined HPE in 2019 and most recently assumed the role as the General Manager of our Communications Technology Group, leading a team of more than 5,000 team members  who drive $500 million in CPG-specific revenue and $3.5 billion in total revenue for HPE. I'm excited to welcome Phil into this new role and believe he is the perfect fit to ensure we maintain our leadership position and strong momentum in the market.  
In our High Performance Compute & Mission Critical Solutions business, revenue of $685 million was up 11% year-over-year. We are the undisputed market leader with an industry-leading portfolio in AI and people learning solutions for the new Age of Insight. We continue to execute on over $2 billion in awarded contract, and we are pursuing a robust pipeline of another $5 billion in market opportunity over the next 3 years.  
In Q2, we announced several new HPC systems deals and collaborations. This includes building new supercomputer to advance scientific research for the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, the United States Department of Energy Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Supercomputing Center in Singapore. As we have noted on previous calls, this is an inherently lumpy business due to the lead times between ordinary revenue recognition, but we remain on track to deliver our target of 8% to 12% annual growth in this business this year.  
Our Compute and Storage businesses performed very well in the quarter. Our strategy to grow in profitable segments of the market and pivot to more as-a-Service solutions is paying off. In Compute, revenue of $3 billion was up 10% year-over-year. We drove strong operational performance, expanding operating margins by 550 basis points. We expanded our portfolio with the latest AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon Scalable Processors, which include launching 3 new HPE ProLiant solutions targeting 5G deployments in telco, virtual desktop infrastructure and storage optimized solutions for database workloads in enterprise.  
In Storage, revenue of $1.1 billion was up 3% year-over-year with a strong operating profit of 16.8%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see strength in key software-defined solutions, which drive our ability to attach rich services to our product offerings. HPE Primera and Nimble dHCI both grew triple digits. Our HPE's All-Flash Array portfolio grew 20%.  
On May 4, we introduced a new portfolio of cloud-native data infrastructure called HPE Alletra. This portfolio delivers workload-optimized systems and provides customers with architectural flexibility to run any application without compromise from edge to cloud with a cloud operational experience. These innovations are propelling our storage business into our cloud-native software-defined data services business.  
Our pivot to as-a-Service continued its strong momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate of $678 million was up 30% year-over-year. We saw strong total as-a-Service order growth of 41%. Over 900 go-to-market partners are now actively selling HPE GreenLake as a part of their own marketplace. And we average a 95% renewal rate with billings from those customers at 124% usage of the regional contract commitments.  
We have an unmatched portfolio of hybrid cloud services that spans all aspects of networking, compute, storage, VMs, containers, ML Ops, HPC and more. On the innovation front, we announced a transformative new data storage services platform that brings a cloud operational model to whatever data it is by unifying data operations. The platform will be available through HPE GreenLake Central and includes a new data services cloud console and a suite of software subscription services that simplifies and automates global infrastructure and scale.  
Our industry-leading HPE GreenLake Cloud Services experience enable us to gain more than 90 new customers during the quarter. Carestream is a great recent customer, for example. In a 3 years multimillion-dollar deal, Carestream selected HPE GreenLake Cloud Services with HPE Ezmeral software HPE Pointnext services to power a transformative new health care initiative based on Artificial Intelligence-as-a-Service. 
We will continue to invest aggressively in HPE GreenLake Cloud Services to provide a true cloud experience and operating model, whether at-the-edge, on-premise or across multiple clouds. HPE's businesses that provide services and capability of our customers recently transformed also performed well in Q2.  
HPE Pointnext Operational Services had another solid quarter with revenue growing year-over-year as reported. We expect to see growth for the full fiscal year, driven by our growing services intensity and other service momentum.  
HPE Financial Services continue to play an important role helping our customers as they rebuild and rethink their IT transformation requirements. Cash collections continue to improve, and HPE FS delivered a return on equity of 18.3%, well above pre-pandemic levels. This business continued to perform very well.  
Over the past year, our global communities have faced a catastrophic health crisis and significant business disruption. At HPE, we accelerated our strategy to be the edge-to-cloud Platform-as-a-Service company to support our customers' rapidly changing needs, who have defined our 60,000 team members' demonstrated amazing agility and perseverance. And I'm tremendously proud of our team members' response during this unprecedented time. I want to thank them for their commitment and passion that has made HPE stronger and better positioned in a world that is forever changed.  
As businesses emerge from the pandemic and move beyond the realities of COVID, digital transformation is at the forefront of their strategic initiatives. At our Discover event on June 22, you will hear more about how HPE is at the center of this super-charged digital economy. Our edge-to-cloud architecture, software and solutions all delivered as-a-Service will continue to help our customers transform their businesses, optimize their applications, and data clouds are increasingly distributing work and be future-ready today. I'm excited about our momentum, and I believe the HPE represents a strong investment opportunity for our shareholders.  
With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter's results."
273983758,714395818,2306931,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2021",2021-06-01,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year '21. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antoni",1968,"Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year '21. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 1, and now let me discuss our financial performance, starting with Slide 2.  
I am very pleased to report that our Q2 results reflect continued momentum in revenue, strong growth and operating margin expansion and robust cash flow generation.  
We delivered Q2 revenues of $6.7 billion, up 9% from the prior year period, a level better than our normal sequential seasonality. I am particularly proud of the fact that our non-GAAP gross margin is at the record level of 34.3%, up 210 basis points from the prior year period and up 60 basis points sequentially. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, cost takeouts and an ongoing favorable mix shift towards higher-margin, software-rich offering. Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased in the quarter, as we've previously indicated due to the planned hiring increases along with R&D and go-to-market investments, this offset by our continued progress delivering on the savings from our cost optimization plan, which is on track.  
Even with our investments, our non-GAAP operating margin was 10.2%. That is up 300 basis points from our prior year, which translates to a 59% year-over-year increase in operating profit. Within other income and expense, we benefited from onetime gains related to increased valuations in our Cohesity and IonQ investments within our Pathfinder venture portfolio. As a result, we now expect other income and expense for the full year in fiscal year '21 to be an expense of approximately $50 million.  
With strong execution across the business, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.46, up 70% from the prior year and meaningfully above the higher end of our outlook range for Q2. Q2 cash flow from operations was $822 million and free cash flow was $368 million, up $770 million from the prior year, driven by better profitability and strong operational discipline as well as working capital benefits. This puts us at a record level of free cash flow for the first half at $931 million.  Finally, we paid $156 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q3 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in July.  
Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 3. In Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our momentum with rich software capabilities to meet robust customer demand, delivering 17% year-over-year revenue growth across the portfolio. Switching was up 17% year-over-year, and wireless LAN was up 16%. Additionally, the Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year and now represent a meaningful contribution to HPE's overall ARR.  
We also continue to see strong operating margins at 15.5% in Q2, up 320 basis points year-over-year, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin expansion. Silver Peak continues to perform well, leveraging the high-growth SD-WAN market opportunity and contributed about 5 points to the Intelligent Edge top line growth.  
In HPC-MCS, revenue grew 11% year-over-year as we continue to achieve more customer acceptance milestones and deliver on our more than $2 billion of awarded contracts. We remain on track to deliver on our full year and 3-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%.  
In Compute, revenue grew 10% year-over-year and was down just 1% sequentially, reflecting much stronger-than-normal sequential seasonality. Operating margins were up meaningfully year-over-year due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. We ended the quarter with an operating profit margin of 11.3%, up 550 basis points from the prior year period and towards the upper range of our long-term margin guidance for these segments provided at SAM.  
Within Storage, revenue grew 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. Nimble grew 17% with ongoing strong dHCI momentum growing triple digits. All-Flash Arrays grew 20% year-over-year, led by Primera, that was up triple digits and is expected to surpass 3PAR sales next quarter.  
The mix shift towards our more software-rich platforms and operational execution helped drive storage operating profit margin to 16.8%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the second consecutive quarter year-over-year as reported with further growth expected for the full year of fiscal year '21. This has been driven by the increased focus of our BU segments on selling product and service bundles, improve service intensity and our growing as-a-Service business, which I'll remind you, enrolls service attach rates of 100%. This is very, very important to note because all of our OS revenue is recurring with 3-year average contract length, and OS is the highest operating margin contributor to our segments.  
Within HPE Financial Services, revenue was down 3% year-over-year as the pandemic did not materially impact this business until later in 2020. As expected, we are seeing continued sequential improvements in our bad debt loss ratios ending this quarter at just 75 basis points, which continues to be best-in-class within the industry. We have also seen improved cash collections well above pre-COVID levels. Our operating margin in this segment was 10.8%, up 160 basis points from the prior year and our return on equity at 18.3% is well above pre-pandemic levels and the 15%-plus target that we set at SAM.  
Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-Service business. Similar to the past couple of quarters, we are making great strides in our as-a-Service offering with over 90 new enterprise GreenLake customers added. That is in Q2, bringing the total to well over 1,000.  
I am pleased to report that our Q2 '21 ARR was $678 million, which was up 30% year-over-year as reported. Total as-a-Service orders were up 41% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in North America and Central Europe. Our Edge-as-a-Service offerings also continued to grow revenue strong triple digits year-over-year.  
Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving our ARR growth targets of 30% to 40%, a CAGR from FY '20 to FY '23.  
Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date where you can clearly see the strong rebound and momentum from our Q2 '20 trough. For the past 2 quarters, revenue has exceeded our normal sequential seasonality, reflecting the improving demand environment. And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP EPS in Q2 by 70% year-over-year.  
Turning to Slide 6. We delivered a record non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q2 of 34.3% of revenues, which was up 60 basis points sequentially and up 210 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, operational services margin expansion from cost takeout and automation and a positive mix shift towards high-margin, software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and next-generation storage offering.  
We have also benefited from the new segmentation we implemented beginning of fiscal year '20 that has given us much better visibility into each business unit and enabled better operational discipline. 
Moving to Slide 7. You can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margin substantially from pandemic lows of -- to 10.2%, which is up 300 basis points from the prior year period. We have done this by driving further productivity benefits and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan while simultaneously increasing our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets. Q2 operating expenses also included planned increased hiring and spending on select investment to drive further growth. 
Turning to Slide 8. We generated a record first half levels of cash flow with $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and $931 million of free cash flow, which is up $1.5 billion year-over-year. This was primarily driven by the increased profitability, strong operational discipline and some in near timing-related benefits. I would like to underscore that this year, our free cash flow profile seasonality will be different as a result of our back-end-loaded restructuring costs and investment in inventory for our supply chain to cater for rising demand and chip shortages as the economic recovery accelerate. 
Now moving on to Slide 9, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet. As of April 30 quarter end, we have improved the operating company to a net cash neutral position with our strong free cash flow. Furthermore, we have made good progress securitizing some financial services-related debt through the ABS market and expect to have close to all of the U.S. portfolio securitized by year-end. The refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at a cheaper cost of debt capital as well as diversifying and segregating our balance sheet between our operating company and our financial services business. 
Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensures we have ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business, drive growth and execute on our strategy. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 10. I am very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in the demand environment and our strong operational performance to date. This will be our third guidance increase in SAM in October 2020. We now expect to grow non-GAAP operating profit by 25% to 35% and deliver fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.82 and $1.94. This is a $0.09 per share improvement at the midpoint of our prior EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.88 and a $0.22 per share improvement at the midpoint since SAM. 
With respect to supply chain, we have executed well to date with minimal impact and continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible. We do see further industry-wide tightening and inflation persisting in the near term, which has been factored in our outlook from both a revenue and cost perspective. But overall demand remains strong. From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the momentum we saw in the first half. And while we continue to see further demand improvement, we remain prudent as certain geographies continue to navigate the pandemic, and we continue to observe uncertainties in the supply of commodity. 
More specifically for Q3 '21, we expect revenue to be in line with our normal sequential seasonality of up low single digits from Q2. For Q3 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.04 to $0.10 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 to $0.44. Additionally, given our record levels of cash flow in the first half and raised earnings outlook, I am very pleased to announce that we are also raising FY '21 free cash flow guidance to $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. That is a $350 million increase at the midpoint from our original SAM guidance. So overall, Antonio and I are very proud of the progress we have made in the first half. We have navigated well through the pandemic and are exiting the first half with improved revenue momentum, strong profitability and robust cash flow. 
Our growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC-MCS have accelerated top line performance. Our core business of Compute and Storage revenues are growing with improved margins, and our as-a-Service ARR is accelerating. We also continue to execute well against our cost optimization and resource allocation program, which has made us leaner, better resourced and positioned to capitalize on the economic recovery currently at play. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

Wamsi, it's Tarek here. So let me try and dissect the guidance we gave for Q3 and also the full year. So putting things in perspective.  First, you know we are raising our FY '21 EPS outlook by $0.09 at the midpoint to $1.82 to $1.94 based on our Q2",315,"Yes. Wamsi, it's Tarek here. So let me try and dissect the guidance we gave for Q3 and also the full year. So putting things in perspective.  First, you know we are raising our FY '21 EPS outlook by $0.09 at the midpoint to $1.82 to $1.94 based on our Q2 outperformance. And we feel very confident for the rest of the year. This reflects what we see as continued improvement in customer spending, but also we want to remain prudent given the remaining pandemic and supply chain uncertainty. 
Specifically for Q3, it's important to note that we do expect revenue growth in line with normal FY '18, FY '19 sequential seasonality of up low single digits. We anchored you on FY '18 -- FY '19 and not last year because of the disruption we suffered in the supply chain last year. So it's better to look at it from an FY '18, FY '19 viewpoint. 
You should expect that gross margins hold roughly flat relative to our H1 levels, near just under 34%. OpEx should be up somewhat as we continue to make select investments aligned to our strategy in key growth areas, and this is partially offset by further efficiencies we find. But most importantly, it is important that you note that OI&E will flip to an expense overall in the full year, and therefore, in the second half. 
OI&E in Q1 was a positive income, and Q2 was a positive income. And now we're expecting for the full year '21 a $50 million expense, hence, the guidance that we're giving you overall for Q3. You can expect that the tax rate will be unchanged at 14%, like we said at SAM. And the net of all of this is that we expect our Q3 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.44, and we feel pretty comfortable about it."

We quoted in our remarks that we're up mid-single digits and, therefore, we translate that conversion into revenue. But obviously, part of the improvement could come from the HPC acceptances. Remember that on HPC, our order to revenue is a little bit more lumpy because of the time between orders and revenue takes longer. But overall, what we are confident is the fact that we see obviously IT demand improving. But I'm really pleased with our innovation and our ability to execute against that innovation. The innovation we have across the portfolio is perfectly timed what we see in today's environment. 
We live in a much more distributed enterprise. Obviously, digital transformation is essential to operate in this digital economy, and the first step is connectivity. And I have to tell you, the Intelligent Edge business is absolutely incredibly strong. You saw in actual dollars, almost 20%. And we expect to continue to be super strong for the balance of the year into 2022, honestly. And that's because we have a business at scale. You have a massive business at scale, and to give a point of reference, we already have 100,000 customers on that platform. 
We have 150 customers every day. We manage more than 1.1 million devices. And honestly, we actually manage data of 1 billion plus per hour, data points that comes through our cloud. And so we expect that to continue to be very strong. I think the core business has definitely stabilized, and we see pockets of improvement, particularly with Storage. And then the other service will continue to stay strong. 
Again, we are cautious about the supply chain aspect of this. But we position ourselves well for the second half, and that was all factored in our guidance, absolutely well factored in our guidance, so it's why we raised the guidance."

You typically have low to mid-50% second half EPS mix. 
I think I heard you mention supply chain constraints and being cautious around that and COVID, in general, cost inflation, investments you're making and then the OI&E dynamics. Can you just rank those -- well, first, did I forget any? And then can you just rank those factors in terms of which are having the most impact on your back half EPS guidance?"

Thank you, Katy. So let me try and add a little bit more color to what we said already. So first of all, remember our cost optimization and allocation program. We exited FY '20 very lean, and this has driven a very strong performance in Q1 at $0.52 p",467,"Yes. Thank you, Katy. So let me try and add a little bit more color to what we said already. So first of all, remember our cost optimization and allocation program. We exited FY '20 very lean, and this has driven a very strong performance in Q1 at $0.52 per share. This is a level of earnings that was actually benefiting from the fact that we have a very strong run rate entering into Q1. 
In Q2, you saw that momentum continuing with the EPS that we posted at $0.46 per share. Very comfortable with the level of investments that we are making, and this is also showing in the gross and operating margin expansion that we've demonstrated so far. 
So now when you also look at how this translates into free cash flow, obviously, we had a lot of free cash flow benefits into Q1, Q2 as a result of the earnings strength and which translated into free cash flow. But moving forward, what you have to factor into the guidance on earnings is the fact that there is some degree of uncertainty on supply chain, although, as Antonio said, the demand is very strong across the board. The demand is very strong in Aruba. The demand is very strong in Compute. And you can see that with units going up year-over-year. And also in HPC-MCS, we are seeing the revenue trending in the range that we guided at SAM. This is all good. 
Having said that, we have also to reckon 2 other dynamics aside from the cost optimization program and the demand. The other dynamic is OI&E, which affects EPS in Q3 and Q4. Q1, Q2, we had 2 income quarters as far as OI&E is concerned. They flip into an expense of $50 million for the full year; gives you an order of magnitude of what would be the EPS for each one of Q3, Q4. 
And then on free cash flow, the other final element that drives it is we have to deal with supply chain, and we continue to buffer inventory to be ready for the demand in fiscal year '21 for the second half, but also fiscal year '22. We do not expect that the situation on inventory is going to be all of a sudden setting up across the world and across the industries. And we've taken steps, and we'll continue to do so. 
So overall, we're managing, I would say, the resurgent demand environment very well. We're lean from an organization standpoint. Our earnings power is shown by the margins we're posting. And also, you could see that what we're doing on free cash flow, we're doing very, very well. So hopefully, that gives you color to your questions with the rankings of the various effects at play."

I understand the normal sequential seasonality, people trying to get into it. But the fact of the matter is we are delivering record-breaking gross margin. We are raising our EPS guidance despite the supply chain uncertainty. And our business is in huge demand. 
And it's not just the IT demand, it's the fact that we have unique portfolio, edge-to-cloud, that's meeting the customer needs of today and future-ready for tomorrow. And so I think the fact is that when you look at the full year, right, we have raised guidance now 3 times. And to Tarek's point, it's more than 25% from the beginning of the year. And that's a testament of the momentum we have in the business. 
Then obviously, every quarter has ups and downs because of unique things like OI&E or maybe more inventory build-out. But again, the takeaway is that we are raising again the EPS for the full year and free cash flow."

The average is probably between 4, 5 years, Kyle, at this point in time. Definitely, it's a pent-up demand to modernize that infrastructure. But it's not just replacing hardware for the sake of replacing hardware. It's to really bring that cloud experience to our computer source and more and more be able to consume it elastically as a service. And that's the unique value proposition we have, which is not only just the best infrastructure with ProLiant as a franchise, but the fact that we have a provisional life cycle management, and you should stay tuned for more announcement here shortly, but also be able to pivot that installed base to more a consumption base over time, and then more and more as workload-optimized solutions. 
And remember, these platforms come also in a different structure in the sense that you have more options and more technologies built into the platform. And so for us, it's a big opportunity. And I think an accelerator of that position is our GreenLake business. It's not just replacing the old infrastructure of the CapEx, but be able to bring and repatriate workloads on-prem where it makes sense, or actually whole workloads on-prem because now we can deliver a true cloud experience in our consumption-driven model."

There's also another aspect that we see the pent-up demand and really the need to modernize the infrastructure and the way the infrastructure is used. But also if the decision to actually modernize the infrastructure and move into consumption isn't made, it's not bad for us because we benefit from extended leasing with our financial services portfolio. It has been doing extremely well with our asset management business as people tend to use the infrastructure more absent a decision or an availability of supply for the equipment they want to use.

I mean, obviously, if you look about the way we operate and the growth in IoT and the need for connectivity, obviously, is continuing to grow. 
Interesting enough, 3 years ago, I said that the enterprise of the future will be edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And it's playing exactly that way. Unfortunately, through the COVID pandemic, we saw that acceleration. But when you think about digital transformation, right, obviously, we live in a digital economy. And the first step is to be connected. If you're not connected, you're not participating. That connectivity is not just any more users and devices, it's things. Everything is connected to the network. Everything computes, everything generates data. 
And so connectivity is at the forefront of the digital transformation. And obviously, remote working is requiring the need for WiFi connectivity to a level we haven't seen before. But that's an example of what's happening out there. But I will say our innovation with a true cloud-native platform at massive scale. And again, the fact that we already have 100,000 customers, and we're adding 150 customers every day, that tells you the value proposition resonated. 
We can provision a WAN port, a LAN port or a WiFi port or a BLE or ZigBee, whatever is the multi-protocol from the cloud. And we're able to do that in an intelligent and autonomous way. Because ultimately, it's about the data you collect and what experiences you can provide. And so we believe this is absolutely durable. We are very bullish about this business. We expect this business to continue to grow double digits for the balance of the year. And as we add more functionality by cloud platform, particularly with edge computing and 5G, we are going to accelerate that momentum. And when you talk to customers and partners, they love the Aruba experience, absolutely love the simplicity, the law of the fact that you improve their experience for their own business and then powers this new way to work. So that's why we are very excited. 
And the other thing is that the platform that Aruba runs the cloud is not the platform we run the rest of the company. When we deploy now one of the data services through the new announcements we made on May 4, or where we deploy compute or we deploy workload-optimized, is running on the same back end that Aruba was originally created. And that's why we have a true edge-to-cloud platform. And then we lay on top of that the other service model, whether it's subscription and software, which is growing triple digits on Aruba or whether it's the as-a-Service model with GreenLake. And that's the unique differentiation we have in the marketplace. And that's why we feel very good about the growth prospect of this business. Tarek, on the OI&E?"

On the OI&E front, thanks for asking the question as to why we expect OI&E to flip into an expense in the second half. In OI&E, you have effectively 3 effects. The first one is the H3C economic contribution, and the timing of which shifts between quarters. Well, we're, like we said before, very happy with H3C and the economic interest that we have through them and the cash they return to us on a regular basis. So there's a timing element there for H3C. There is also interest expense that is the second force in the OI&E line. 
And then the third force is the Pathfinder portfolio, our venture portfolio, which has been doing extremely well in the first half, and we did flag this in my script. We said we had benefits from revaluations of our investment in Cohesity and IonQ. We had, in the first quarter, OI&E is $16 million income; in the second quarter, a $27 million income. This is on an aggregate basis across the 3 forces. So for the first half, $43 million of OI&E income, and we're guiding for the full year for an expense of $50 million. So that's a $90 million swing. 
And that $90 million swing, if you turn it into an EPS number, you might have to do the math yourself, it's about $0.07 to $0.08 of EPS for the full year, right? That's the thing you have to reckon when you compute your Q3 or Q4 EPS forecast. That's the swing factor there. It does not change the fact that our operating performance remains very, very solid.

I had expected that business to grow sequentially, especially after a slowdown in Q1. Maybe it's just normal seasonality, but understand the businesses could be lumpy. Are there any trends that you can draw from the last 2 quarters? What are deals that are taking longer to close or being accepted by customers? And more broadly, what gives you confidence that you can hit your 8% to 12% growth target? Maybe you can talk about what's the normal seasonality for that business in fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4."
273983758,714395818,2306931,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2021",2021-06-01,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Let me start. I'm going to talk more for the market, and Tarek can talk more on the financial side. Listen, the booking momentum is incredibly strong in this business. So you have to look at the booking side and then you have to look at the revenue side.",360,"Let me start. I'm going to talk more for the market, and Tarek can talk more on the financial side. Listen, the booking momentum is incredibly strong in this business. So you have to look at the booking side and then you have to look at the revenue side. The bookings continue to be just amazing. And I quote some of the deals we won. These are multimillion dollar deals. Seasonality in this business doesn't really play out that well because the fact of the matter is that you have these large systems that need to be built, shipped, installed. You have to run the workloads. And then only then when the customer accepts the system for the workload run, you can recognize revenue. 
And that time can vary. It can be as quick as 3 months; as long as a year, in some cases. Especially when you deploy these massive exascale systems, which we're going to do starting end of the year and then next year in 2022. And sometimes you need to run the workload for a month. But reinstalling the system from the factory image on the floor, sometimes, can take up to 60 days. It's just -- it's a size of football field. 
So I would not think about the seasonality. I think about the long-term growth of the business. We feel pretty good and confident about the CAGR. But even this year, we believe we're going to deliver the 8% to 12% growth, just this year in 2021, right? So this is about keeping the orders book momentum short term, the life cycle of the supply chain and install and acceptance as much as we can. And then this business is a lot of software, right, that gets built around the system itself. So that's why we're very bullish about this system -- this business. 
And remember, it's all on the back of the day. That's why we talk about AI and deep learning technologies. Data continue to grow exponentially, and you need more compute. That's a fact at the level you haven't seen before. Tarek, maybe you want to comment on the financial line."

We simply say, look, the order momentum remains very, very strong. It was up double digits in Q2. We have a large awarded order book with over $2 billion of contracts. The pipeline that we are having in mind includes another $5 billion of exascale opportunity to be awarded over the next 3 years. .
The win rates that we observed are very high. We win 5 out of 6 contracts in the exascale space. It's an inherently lumpy business. So I think if you look at it on a quarterly basis, probably not the best picture. You have to look at it on a multiyear basis. And we feel very confident that we can achieve the 8% to 12% CAGR per year, including starting this year, fiscal year '21. 
And because of the lumpiness of the revenue, you also have lumpiness in profitability as a result of the revenue profile and the product mix. That doesn't worry us at all. It's the nature of the beast, so to speak. We feel that HPC-MCS is extremely well positioned as a business segment to continue to be a very strong crafter of growth for HPE overall."

So anyway, I know we are running out of time. Just to close, I'm very pleased with HPE's Q2 results that again, they are marked by strong revenue momentum, profitability and free cash flow. The overall demand is improving, but our execution, our innovation is perfectly timed to the customer needs that we see in the marketplace. And despite there is supply chain uncertainty around specific commodities, we factor all that in our ability to execute on the back half, and that's why we are raising, once again for the third time in the year, our EPS and free cash flow. 
And I believe the future resides to the cloud, and it's going to be consumption-based. Well, I think HPE has a unique value proposition and set of offerings. And that's why I believe this is a very exciting time for HPE. We have worked really hard despite the pandemic. Our team has been incredibly resilient.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise had a strong second quarter. I'm very pleased with our results and that they are marked by revenue growth, strong profitability and free cash flow. The overall demand environment is improving, and we are seeing traction across our portfolio.  
We saw solid sequential improvement in total HPE orders growth that was up mid-single digits with double-digit growth in HPE GreenLake and HPC business segments. We expect to continue to see improvement in customer IT spending throughout 2021. Our disciplined execution on our strategic priorities outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting last fall is positively impacting both top and bottom line performance. We are strengthening our core businesses, doubling down in key areas of growth and accelerating our as-a-Service pivot while advancing our cloud-first innovation agenda to become the edge-to-cloud Platform-as-a-Service choice for our customers and partners.  
We have also executed well throughout the industry-wide tightening and cost inflationary trends with minimal impact to our first half. We have taken proactive inventory buffering measures to position us well for the second half. We will continue to take additional inventory actions as appropriate, in alignment to the market demand by leveraging great engineering capabilities and our long-term agreements with our suppliers. Our continued strong performance give us the confidence to raise our fiscal year '21 EPS and free cash flow outlook for the third time since our Security Analyst Meeting. We will provide more details about this new guidance later in the call.  
First, let me review some key Q2 highlights. Revenue of $6.7 billion was up 9% year-over-year, with better-than-normal sequential seasonality. I'm particularly pleased with the double-digit revenue growth in both our HPC and Intelligent Edge businesses that together now represents 2 -- 22% of our HPE total revenue.  
Our as-a-Service annual recurring revenue growth was an impressive 30% year-over-year, which underscores our momentum in enabling consumption-based IT. This is an important long-term growth driver for our company.  
We made significant improvements in both gross and operating margins. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 34.3% is at record level and up 210 basis points year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating profit of 10.2% is up 300 basis points year-over-year. And our non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 is up 70% year-over-year and above the high end of our outlook range. These results contribute to Q2 free cash flow of $368 million, which is up $770 million year-over-year, bringing our first half fiscal year '21 free cash flow to a record $931 million.  
Tarek will discuss the financial results and outlook in greater detail. Before he does that, I want to provide additional comments on our business segment performance and highlight some of the innovative solutions and experiences we introduced during the quarter.  
HPE has been driving transformation in our businesses to deliver a modern secure cloud experience everywhere to help our customers with their digital transformations. Our Intelligent Edge business accelerated its momentum with an outstanding quarter across all metrics. Revenue of $799 million grew 17% year-over-year, and operating profit expanded 320 basis points year-over-year. This is the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and sixth consecutive quarter of operating profit expansion. Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year and now a meaningful contributor to HPE's overall ARR.  
Extended to the edge has never been more critical for enterprises. At Aruba Atmosphere, our signature event for Aruba customers and partners, we announced an expansive set of cross-portfolio edge-to-cloud security integrations for our Aruba Edge Services Platform, or ESP, including SD-WAN technology from our recent Silver Peak acquisition.  
Today, our Aruba Edge Services Platform already supports well over 100,000 customers with 150 new customers added every day, connecting over 1 million active devices. Aruba building identity network security is unique in the market and provides the ideal foundation for building a zero trust and Secure Access Service Edge.  
Our comprehensive portfolio and AI-powered, cloud-driven platforms like Aruba ESP and Aruba Central will continue to accelerate WAN and security deployments, advanced cloud and IoT adoption and fast track digital transformation. Customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance and Mercado Libre chose Aruba in Q2 for these reasons.  
I am tremendously pleased with Aruba's impressive performance, and it is against this successful backdrop that I want to share that Aruba founder, Keerti Melkote, has made the decision to retire from HPE. We acquired Aruba in 2015 when we saw the edge as the next frontier. Aruba and Keerti has been instrumental in accelerating this business to the $3 billion business it is today. I'm incredibly grateful for his leadership, and I have personally benefited from his counsel, knowledge and friendship. Keerti will remain as an adviser to me for the remainder of 2021.  
I am pleased to announce that effective today, Phil Mottram will take over the leadership of our Aruba Intelligent Edge business. Phil is a result-driven leader with extensive experience implementing growth strategies and leading transformation initiatives. He joined HPE in 2019 and most recently assumed the role as the General Manager of our Communications Technology Group, leading a team of more than 5,000 team members who drive $500 million in CPG-specific revenue and $3.5 billion in total revenue for HPE. I'm excited to welcome Phil into this new role and believe he is the perfect fit to ensure we maintain our leadership position and strong momentum in the market.  
In our High Performance Compute & Mission Critical Solutions business, revenue of $685 million was up 11% year-over-year. We are the undisputed market leader with an industry-leading portfolio in AI and deep learning solutions for the new Age of Insight. We continue to execute on over $2 billion in awarded contract, and we are pursuing a robust pipeline of another $5 billion in market opportunity over the next 3 years.
In Q2, we announced several new HPC systems deals and collaborations. This includes building new supercomputer to advance scientific research for the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, the United States Department of Energy, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Supercomputing Center in Singapore. As we have noted on previous calls, this is an inherently lumpy business due to the lead times between ordinary revenue recognition, but we remain on track to deliver our target of 8% to 12% annual growth in this business this year.  
Our Compute and Storage businesses performed very well in the quarter. Our strategy to grow in profitable segments of the market and pivot to more as-a-Service solutions is paying off. In Compute, revenue of $3 billion was up 10% year-over-year. We drove strong operational performance, expanding operating margins by 550 basis points. We expanded our portfolio with the latest AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon Scalable Processors, which include launching 3 new HPE ProLiant solutions targeting 5G deployments in telco, virtual desktop infrastructure and storage optimized solutions for database workloads in enterprise.  
In Storage, revenue of $1.1 billion was up 3% year-over-year with a strong operating profit of 16.8%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see strength in key software-defined solutions, which drive our ability to attach rich services to our product offerings. HPE Primera and Nimble dHCI both grew triple digits. Our HPE's All-Flash Array portfolio grew 20%.  
On May 4, we introduced a new portfolio of cloud-native data infrastructure called HPE Alletra. This portfolio delivers workload-optimized systems and provides customers with architectural flexibility to run any application without compromise from edge to cloud with a cloud operational experience. These innovations are propelling our storage business into our cloud-native software-defined data services business.  
Our pivot to as-a-Service continued its strong momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate of $678 million was up 30% year-over-year. We saw strong total as-a-Service order growth of 41%. Over 900 go-to-market partners are now actively selling HPE GreenLake as a part of their own marketplace. And we average a 95% renewal rate with billings from those customers at 124% usage of the regional contract commitments.  
We have an unmatched portfolio of hybrid cloud services that spans all aspects of networking, compute, storage, VMs, containers, ML Ops, HPC and more. On the innovation front, we announced a transformative new data storage services platform that brings a cloud operational model to whatever data it is by unifying data operations. The platform will be available through HPE GreenLake Central and includes a new data services cloud console and a suite of software subscription services that simplifies and automates global infrastructure and scale.  
Our industry-leading HPE GreenLake Cloud Services experience enable us to gain more than 90 new customers during the quarter. Carestream is a great recent customer example. In a 3 years multimillion-dollar deal, Carestream selected HPE GreenLake Cloud Services with HPE Ezmeral software and HPE Pointnext services to power a transformative new health care initiative based on Artificial Intelligence-as-a-Service. 
We will continue to invest aggressively in HPE GreenLake Cloud Services to provide a true cloud experience and operating model, whether at-the-edge, on-premise or across multiple clouds. HPE's businesses that provide services and capability of our customers recently transformed also performed well in Q2.  
HPE Pointnext Operational Services had another solid quarter with revenue growing year-over-year as reported. We expect to see growth for the full fiscal year, driven by our growing services intensity and other service momentum.  
HPE Financial Services continue to play an important role helping our customers as they rebuild and rethink their IT transformation requirements. Cash collections continue to improve, and HPE FS delivered a return on equity of 18.3%, well above pre-pandemic levels. This business continued to perform very well.  
Over the past year, our global communities have faced a catastrophic health crisis and significant business disruption. At HPE, we accelerated our strategy to be the edge-to-cloud Platform-as-a-Service company to support our customers' rapidly changing needs, who have defined our 60,000 team members' demonstrated amazing agility and perseverance. And I'm tremendously proud of our team members' response during this unprecedented time. I want to thank them for their commitment and passion that has made HPE stronger and better positioned in a world that is forever changed.  
As businesses emerge from the pandemic and move beyond the realities of COVID, digital transformation is at the forefront of their strategic initiatives. At our Discover event on June 22, you will hear more about how HPE is at the center of this super-charged digital economy. Our edge-to-cloud architecture, software and solutions all delivered as-a-Service will continue to help our customers transform their businesses, optimize their applications, and data clouds are increasingly distributing work and be future-ready today. I'm excited about our momentum, and I believe the HPE represents a strong investment opportunity for our shareholders.  
With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter's results."
273983758,714395818,2350625,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2021",2021-06-01,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year '21. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antoni",1968,"Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year '21. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 1, and now let me discuss our financial performance, starting with Slide 2.  
I am very pleased to report that our Q2 results reflect continued momentum in revenue, strong growth and operating margin expansion and robust cash flow generation.
We delivered Q2 revenues of $6.7 billion, up 9% from the prior year period, a level better than our normal sequential seasonality. I am particularly proud of the fact that our non-GAAP gross margin is at the record level of 34.3%, up 210 basis points from the prior year period and up 60 basis points sequentially. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, cost takeouts and an ongoing favorable mix shift towards higher-margin, software-rich offering. Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased in the quarter, as we've previously indicated due to the planned hiring increases along with R&D and go-to-market investments, this offset by our continued progress delivering on the savings from our cost optimization plan, which is on track.  
Even with our investments, our non-GAAP operating margin was 10.2%. That is up 300 basis points from our prior year, which translates to a 59% year-over-year increase in operating profit. Within other income and expense, we benefited from onetime gains related to increased valuations in our Cohesity and IonQ investments within our Pathfinder venture portfolio. As a result, we now expect other income and expense for the full year in fiscal year '21 to be an expense of approximately $50 million.
With strong execution across the business, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.46, up 70% from the prior year and meaningfully above the higher end of our outlook range for Q2. Q2 cash flow from operations was $822 million and free cash flow was $368 million, up $770 million from the prior year, driven by better profitability and strong operational discipline as well as working capital benefits. This puts us at a record level of free cash flow for the first half at $931 million.  Finally, we paid $156 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q3 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in July.  
Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 3. In Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our momentum with rich software capabilities to meet robust customer demand, delivering 17% year-over-year revenue growth across the portfolio. Switching was up 17% year-over-year, and wireless LAN was up 16%. Additionally, the Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year and now represent a meaningful contribution to HPE's overall ARR.  
We also continue to see strong operating margins at 15.5% in Q2, up 320 basis points year-over-year, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin expansion. Silver Peak continues to perform well, leveraging the high-growth SD-WAN market opportunity and contributed about 5 points to the Intelligent Edge top line growth.  
In HPC-MCS, revenue grew 11% year-over-year as we continue to achieve more customer acceptance milestones and deliver on our more than $2 billion of awarded contracts. We remain on track to deliver on our full year and 3-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%.  
In Compute, revenue grew 10% year-over-year and was down just 1% sequentially, reflecting much stronger-than-normal sequential seasonality. Operating margins were up meaningfully year-over-year due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. We ended the quarter with an operating profit margin of 11.3%, up 550 basis points from the prior year period and towards the upper range of our long-term margin guidance for these segments provided at SAM.  
Within Storage, revenue grew 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. Nimble grew 17% with ongoing strong dHCI momentum growing triple digits. All-Flash Arrays grew 20% year-over-year, led by Primera, that was up triple digits and is expected to surpass 3PAR sales next quarter.  
The mix shift towards our more software-rich platforms and operational execution helped drive storage operating profit margin to 16.8%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the second consecutive quarter year-over-year as reported with further growth expected for the full year of fiscal year '21. This has been driven by the increased focus of our BU segments on selling product and service bundles, improve service intensity and our growing as-a-Service business, which I'll remind you, enrolls service attach rates of 100%. This is very, very important to note because all of our OS revenue is recurring with 3-year average contract length, and OS is the highest operating margin contributor to our segments.  
Within HPE Financial Services, revenue was down 3% year-over-year as the pandemic did not materially impact this business until later in 2020. As expected, we are seeing continued sequential improvements in our bad debt loss ratios ending this quarter at just 75 basis points, which continues to be best-in-class within the industry. We have also seen improved cash collections well above pre-COVID levels. Our operating margin in this segment was 10.8%, up 160 basis points from the prior year and our return on equity at 18.3% is well above pre-pandemic levels and the 15%-plus target that we set at SAM.  
Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-Service business. Similar to the past couple of quarters, we are making great strides in our as-a-Service offering with over 90 new enterprise GreenLake customers added, that is in Q2, bringing the total to well over 1,000.  
I am pleased to report that our Q2 '21 ARR was $678 million, which was up 30% year-over-year as reported. Total as-a-Service orders were up 41% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in North America and Central Europe. Our Edge-as-a-Service offerings also continued to grow revenue strong triple digits year-over-year.  
Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving our ARR growth targets of 30% to 40%, a CAGR from FY '20 to FY '23.  
Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date where you can clearly see the strong rebound and momentum from our Q2 '20 trough. For the past 2 quarters, revenue has exceeded our normal sequential seasonality, reflecting the improving demand environment. And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP EPS in Q2 by 70% year-over-year.  
Turning to Slide 6. We delivered a record non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q2 of 34.3% of revenues, which was up 60 basis points sequentially and up 210 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, operational services margin expansion from cost takeout and automation and a positive mix shift towards high-margin, software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and next-generation storage offering.  
We have also benefited from the new segmentation we implemented beginning of fiscal year '20 that has given us much better visibility into each business unit and enabled better operational discipline. 
Moving to Slide 7. You can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margin substantially from pandemic lows of -- to 10.2%, which is up 300 basis points from the prior year period. We have done this by driving further productivity benefits and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan while simultaneously increasing our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets. Q2 operating expenses also included planned increased hiring and spending on select investment to drive further growth. 
Turning to Slide 8. We generated a record first half levels of cash flow with $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and $931 million of free cash flow, which is up $1.5 billion year-over-year. This was primarily driven by the increased profitability, strong operational discipline and some in near timing-related benefits. I would like to underscore that this year, our free cash flow profile seasonality will be different as a result of our back-end-loaded restructuring costs and investment in inventory for our supply chain to cater for rising demand and chip shortages as the economic recovery accelerate. 
Now moving on to Slide 9, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet. As of April 30 quarter end, we have improved the operating company to a net cash neutral position with our strong free cash flow. Furthermore, we have made good progress securitizing some financial services-related debt through the ABS market and expect to have close to all of the U.S. portfolio securitized by year-end. The refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at a cheaper cost of debt capital as well as diversifying and segregating our balance sheet between our operating company and our financial services business. 
Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensures we have ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business, drive growth and execute on our strategy. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 10. I am very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in the demand environment and our strong operational performance to date. This will be our third guidance increase in SAM in October 2020. We now expect to grow non-GAAP operating profit by 25% to 35% and deliver fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.82 and $1.94. This is a $0.09 per share improvement at the midpoint of our prior EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.88 and a $0.22 per share improvement at the midpoint since SAM. 
With respect to supply chain, we have executed well to date with minimal impacts and continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible. We do see further industry-wide tightening and inflation persisting in the near term, which has been factored in our outlook from both a revenue and cost perspective, but overall demand remains strong. From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the momentum we saw in the first half. And while we continue to see further demand improvement, we remain prudent as certain geographies continue to navigate the pandemic, and we continue to observe uncertainties in the supply of commodity. 
More specifically for Q3 '21, we expect revenue to be in line with our normal sequential seasonality of up low single digits from Q2. For Q3 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.04 to $0.10 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 to $0.44. Additionally, given our record levels of cash flow in the first half and raised earnings outlook, I am very pleased to announce that we are also raising FY '21 free cash flow guidance to $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. That is a $350 million increase at the midpoint from our original SAM guidance. So overall, Antonio and I are very proud of the progress we have made in the first half. We have navigated well through the pandemic and are exiting the first half with improved revenue momentum, strong profitability and robust cash flow. 
Our growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC-MCS have accelerated top line performance. Our core business of Compute and Storage revenues are growing with improved margins, and our as-a-Service ARR is accelerating. We also continue to execute well against our cost optimization and resource allocation program, which has made us leaner, better resourced and positioned to capitalize on the economic recovery currently at play. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

Wamsi, it's Tarek here. So let me try and dissect the guidance we gave for Q3 and also the full year. So putting things in perspective. First, you know we are raising our FY '21 EPS outlook by $0.09 at the midpoint to $1.82 to $1.94 based on our Q2 o",314,"Yes. Wamsi, it's Tarek here. So let me try and dissect the guidance we gave for Q3 and also the full year. So putting things in perspective. First, you know we are raising our FY '21 EPS outlook by $0.09 at the midpoint to $1.82 to $1.94 based on our Q2 outperformance. And we feel very confident for the rest of the year. This reflects what we see as continued improvement in customer spending, but also we want to remain prudent given the remaining pandemic and supply chain uncertainty. 
Specifically for Q3, it's important to note that we do expect revenue growth in line with normal FY '18, FY '19 sequential seasonality of up low single digits. We anchored you on FY '18, FY '19 and not last year because of the disruption we suffered in the supply chain last year. So it's better to look at it from an FY '18, FY '19 viewpoint. 
You should expect that gross margins hold roughly flat relative to our H1 levels, near just under 34%. OpEx should be up somewhat as we continue to make select investments aligned to our strategy in key growth areas, and this is partially offset by further efficiencies we find. But most importantly, it is important that you note that OI&E will flip to an expense overall in the full year, and therefore, in the second half. 
OI&E in Q1 was a positive income, and Q2 was a positive income. And now we're expecting for the full year '21 a $50 million expense, hence, the guidance that we're giving you overall for Q3. You can expect that the tax rate will be unchanged at 14%, like we said at SAM. And the net of all of this is that we expect our Q3 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.44, and we feel pretty comfortable about it."

I don't know if Tarek has many comments. I mean we see strong demand momentum right now. We quoted in our remarks that we're up mid-single digits and, therefore, we translate that conversion into revenue. But obviously, part of the improvement could come from the HPC acceptances. Remember that on HPC, our order to revenue is a little bit more lumpy because of the time between orders and revenue takes longer. But overall, what we are confident is the fact that we see obviously IT demand improving. But I'm really pleased with our innovation and our ability to execute against that innovation. The innovation we have across the portfolio is perfectly timed what we see in today's environment. 
We live in a much more distributed enterprise. Obviously, digital transformation is essential to operate in this digital economy, and the first step is connectivity. And I have to tell you, the Intelligent Edge business is absolutely incredibly strong. You saw in actual dollars, almost 20%. And we expect to continue to be super strong for the balance of the year into '22, honestly. And that's because we have a business at scale. You have a massive business at scale, and to give a point of reference, we already have 100,000 customers on that platform. 
We have 150 customers every day. We manage more than 1.1 million devices. And honestly, we actually manage data of 1 billion plus per hour, data points that comes through our cloud. And so we expect that to continue to be very strong. I think the core business has definitely stabilized, and we see pockets of improvement, particularly with Storage. And then the other service will continue to stay strong. 
Again, we are cautious about the supply chain aspect of this. But we position ourselves well for the second half, and that was all factored in our guidance, absolutely well factored in our guidance, so it's why we raised the guidance."

I think I heard you mention supply chain constraints and being cautious around that and COVID, in general, cost inflation, investments you're making and then the OI&E dynamics. Can you just rank those -- well, first, did I forget any? And then can you just rank those factors in terms of which are having the most impact on your back half EPS guidance?"

Thank you, Katy. So let me try and add a little bit more color to what we said already. So first of all, remember our cost optimization and allocation program.

So first of all, remember our cost optimization and allocation program. We exited FY '20 very lean, and this has driven a very strong performance in Q1 at $0.52 per share. This is a level of earnings that was actually benefiting from the fact that we have a very strong run rate entering into Q1. 
In Q2, you saw that momentum continuing with the EPS that we posted at $0.46 per share. Very comfortable with the level of investments that we are making, and this is also showing in the gross and operating margin expansion that we've demonstrated so far. 
So now when you also look at how this translates into free cash flow, obviously, we had a lot of free cash flow benefits into Q1, Q2 as a result of the earnings strength and which translated into free cash flow. But moving forward, what you have to factor into the guidance on earnings is the fact that there is some degree of uncertainty on supply chain, although, as Antonio said, the demand is very strong across the board. The demand is very strong in Aruba. The demand is very strong in Compute. And you can see that with units going up year-over-year. And also in HPC-MCS, we are seeing the revenue trending in the range that we guided at SAM. This is all good. 
Having said that, we have also to reckon 2 other dynamics aside from the cost optimization program and the demand. The other dynamic is OI&E, which affects EPS in Q3 and Q4. Q1, Q2, we had 2 income quarters as far as OI&E is concerned. They flip into an expense of $50 million for the full year; gives you an order of magnitude of what would be the EPS for each one of Q3, Q4. 
And then on free cash flow, the other final element that drives it is we have to deal with supply chain, and we continue to buffer inventory to be ready for the demand in fiscal year '21 for the second half, but also fiscal year '22. We do not expect that the situation on inventory is going to be all of a sudden setting up across the world and across the industries. And we've taken steps, and we'll continue to do so. 
So overall, we're managing, I would say, the resurgent demand environment very well. We're lean from an organization standpoint. Our earnings power is shown by the margins we're posting. And also, you could see that what we're doing on free cash flow, we're doing very, very well. So hopefully, that gives you color to your questions with the rankings of the various effects at play."

I understand the normal sequential seasonality, people trying to get into it. But the fact of the matter is we are delivering record-breaking gross margin. We are raising our EPS guidance despite the supply chain uncertainty. And our business is in huge demand. 
And it's not just the IT demand, it's the fact that we have unique portfolio, edge-to-cloud, that's meeting the customer needs of today and future-ready for tomorrow. And so I think the fact is that when you look at the full year, right, we have raised guidance now 3 times. And to Tarek's point, it's more than 25% from the beginning of the year. And that's a testament of the momentum we have in the business. 
Then obviously, every quarter has ups and downs because of unique things like OI&E or maybe more inventory build-out. But in the end, the takeaway is that we are raising again the EPS for the full year and free cash flow."

The average is probably between 4, 5 years, Kyle, at this point in time. Definitely, it's a pent-up demand to modernize that infrastructure. But it's not just replacing the hardware for the sake of replacing hardware. It's to really bring that cloud experience to our computer source and more and more be able to consume it elastically as a service. And that's the unique value proposition we have, which is not only just the best infrastructure with ProLiant as a franchise, but the fact that we have a provisional life cycle management, and you should stay tuned for more announcement here shortly, but also be able to pivot that installed base to more a consumption base over time, and then more and more as workload-optimized solutions. 
And remember, these platforms come also in a different structure in the sense that you have more options and more technologies built into the platform. And so for us, it's a big opportunity. And I think an accelerator of that position is our GreenLake business. It's not just replacing the old infrastructure of the CapEx, but be able to bring and repatriate workloads on-prem where it makes sense, or actually whole workloads on-prem because now we can deliver a true cloud experience in our consumption-driven model."

There's also another aspect that we see the pent-up demand and really the need to modernize the infrastructure and the way the infrastructure is used. But also if the decision to actually modernize the infrastructure and move into consumption isn't made, it's not bad for us because we benefit from extended leasing with our financial services portfolio. It has been doing extremely well with our asset management business as people tend to use the infrastructure more absent a decision or an availability of supply for the equipment they want to use.

And the first step is to be connected. If you're not connected, you're not participating. That connectivity is not just any more users and devices, it's things. Everything is connected to the network. Everything computes, everything generates data. 
And so connectivity is at the forefront of the digital transformation. And obviously, remote working is requiring the need for WiFi connectivity to a level we haven't seen before. But that's an example of what's happening out there. But I will say our innovation with a true cloud-native platform at massive scale. And again, the fact that we already have 100,000 customers, and we're adding 150 customers every day, that tells you the value proposition resonated. 
We can provision a WAN port, a LAN port or a WiFi port or a BLE or ZigBee, whatever is the multi-protocol from the cloud. And we're able to do that in an intelligent and autonomous way. Because ultimately, it's about the data you collect and what experiences you can provide. And so we believe this is absolutely durable. We are very bullish about this business. We expect this business to continue to grow double digits for the balance of the year. And as we add more functionality by cloud platform, particularly with edge computing and 5G, we are going to accelerate that momentum. And when you talk to customers and partners, they love the Aruba experience, absolutely love the simplicity, the law of the fact that you improve their experience for their own business and then powers this new way to work. So that's why we are very excited. 
And the other thing is that the platform that Aruba runs the cloud is not the platform we run the rest of the company. When we deploy now one of the data services through the new announcements we made on May 4, or where we deploy compute or we deploy workload-optimized, is running on the same back end that Aruba was originally created. And that's why we have a true edge-to-cloud platform. And then we lay on top of that the other service model, whether it's subscription and software, which is growing triple digits on Aruba or whether it's the as-a-Service model with GreenLake. And that's the unique differentiation we have in the marketplace. And that's why we feel very good about the growth prospect of this business. Tarek, on the OI&E?"

Thank you, Antonio. On the OI&E front, thanks for asking the question as to why we expect OI&E to flip into an expense in the second half. In OI&E, you have effectively 3 effects.

On the OI&E front, thanks for asking the question as to why we expect OI&E to flip into an expense in the second half. In OI&E, you have effectively 3 effects. The first one is the H3C economic contribution, and the timing of which shifts between quarters. Well, we're, like we said before, very happy with H3C and the economic interest that we have through them and the cash they return to us on a regular basis. So there's a timing element there for H3C. There is also interest expense that is the second force in the OI&E line. 
And then the third force is the Pathfinder portfolio, our venture portfolio, which has been doing extremely well in the first half, and we did flag this in my script. We said we had benefits from revaluations of our investment in Cohesity and IonQ. We had, in the first quarter, OI&E is $16 million income; in the second quarter, a $27 million income. This is on an aggregate basis across the 3 forces. So for the first half, $43 million of OI&E income, and we're guiding for the full year for an expense of $50 million. So that's a $90 million swing. 
And that $90 million swing, if you turn it into an EPS number, you might have to do the math yourself, it's about $0.07 to $0.08 of EPS for the full year, right? That's the thing you have to reckon when you compute your Q3 or Q4 EPS forecast. That's the swing factor there. It does not change the fact that our operating performance remains very, very solid. The swing factor at the OI&E level is explaining a little bit more, hopefully, the guidance for all of you on the call."

I had expected that business to grow sequentially, especially after a slowdown in Q1. Maybe it's just normal seasonality, but understand the businesses could be lumpy. Are there any trends that you can draw from the last 2 quarters? What are deals that are taking longer to close or being accepted by customers?

I'm going to talk more for the market, and Tarek can talk more on the financial side. Listen, the booking momentum is incredibly strong in this business. So you have to look at the booking side and then you have to look at the revenue side.",360,"Let me start. I'm going to talk more for the market, and Tarek can talk more on the financial side. Listen, the booking momentum is incredibly strong in this business. So you have to look at the booking side and then you have to look at the revenue side. The bookings continue to be just amazing. And I quote some of the deals we won. These are multimillion dollar deals. Seasonality in this business doesn't really play out that well because the fact of the matter is that you have these large systems that need to be built, shipped, installed. You have to run the workloads. And then only then when the customer accepts the system for the workload run, you can recognize revenue. 
And that time can vary. It can be as quick as 3 months; as long as a year, in some cases. Especially when you deploy these massive exascale systems, which we're going to do starting end of the year and then next year in 2022. And sometimes you need to run the workload for a month. But reinstalling the system from the factory image on the floor, sometimes, can take up to 60 days. It's just -- it's a size of football field. 
So I would not think about the seasonality. I think about the long-term growth of the business. We feel pretty good and confident about the CAGR. But even this year, we believe we're going to deliver the 8% to 12% growth, just this year in 2021, right? So this is about keeping the orders book momentum short term, the life cycle of the supply chain and install and acceptance as much as we can. And then this business is a lot of software, right, that gets built around the system itself. So that's why we're very bullish about this system -- this business. 
And remember, it's all on the back of the day. That's why we talk about AI and deep learning technologies. Data continue to grow exponentially, and you need more compute. That's a fact at the level you haven't seen before. Tarek, maybe you want to comment on the financial line."

We simply say, look, the order momentum remains very, very strong. It was up double digits in Q2. We have a large awarded order book with over $2 billion of contracts. The pipeline that we are having in mind includes another $5 billion of exascale opportunity to be awarded over the next 3 years. .
The win rates that we observed are very high. We win 5 out of 6 contracts in the exascale space. It's an inherently lumpy business. So I think if you look at it on a quarterly basis, probably not the best picture. You have to look at it on a multiyear basis. And we feel very confident that we can achieve the 8% to 12% CAGR per year, including starting this year, fiscal year '21. 
And because of the lumpiness of the revenue, you also have lumpiness in profitability as a result of the revenue profile and the product mix. That doesn't worry us at all. It's the nature of the beast, so to speak. We feel that HPC-MCS is extremely well positioned as a business segment to continue to be a very strong crafter of growth for HPE overall."

So anyway, I know we are running out of time. Just to close, I'm very pleased with HPE's Q2 results that again, they are marked by strong revenue momentum, profitability and free cash flow. The overall demand is improving, but our execution, our innovation is perfectly timed to the customer needs that we see in the marketplace. And despite there is supply chain uncertainty around specific commodities, we factor all that in our ability to execute on the back half, and that's why we are raising, once again for the third time in the year, our EPS and free cash flow. 
And I believe the future resides to the cloud, and it's going to be consumption-based. Well, I think HPE has a unique value proposition and set of offerings.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise had a strong second quarter. I'm very pleased with our results and that they are marked by revenue growth, strong profitability and free cash flow. The overall demand environment is improving, and we are seeing traction across our portfolio.  
We saw solid sequential improvement in total HPE orders growth that was up mid-single digits with double-digit growth in HPE GreenLake and HPC business segments. We expect to continue to see improvement in customer IT spending throughout 2021. Our disciplined execution on our strategic priorities outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting last fall is positively impacting both top and bottom line performance. We are strengthening our core businesses, doubling down in key areas of growth and accelerating our as-a-Service pivot while advancing our cloud-first innovation agenda to become the edge-to-cloud Platform-as-a-Service choice for our customers and partners.  
We have also executed well throughout the industry-wide tightening and cost inflationary trends with minimal impact to our first half. We have taken proactive inventory buffering measures to position us well for the second half. We will continue to take additional inventory actions as appropriate, in alignment to the market demand by leveraging great engineering capabilities and our long-term agreements with our suppliers. Our continued strong performance give us the confidence to raise our fiscal year '21 EPS and free cash flow outlook for the third time since our Security Analyst Meeting. We will provide more details about this new guidance later in the call.  
First, let me review some key Q2 highlights. Revenue of $6.7 billion was up 9% year-over-year, with better-than-normal sequential seasonality. I'm particularly pleased with the double-digit revenue growth in both our HPC and Intelligent Edge businesses that together now represents 2 -- 22% of our HPE total revenue.  
Our as-a-Service annual recurring revenue growth was an impressive 30% year-over-year, which underscores our momentum in enabling consumption-based IT. This is an important long-term growth driver for our company.  
We made significant improvements in both gross and operating margins. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 34.3% is at record level and up 210 basis points year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating profit of 10.2% is up 300 basis points year-over-year. And our non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 is up 70% year-over-year and above the high end of our outlook range. These results contribute to Q2 free cash flow of $368 million, which is up $770 million year-over-year, bringing our first half fiscal year '21 free cash flow to a record $931 million.  
Tarek will discuss the financial results and outlook in greater detail. Before he does that, I want to provide additional comments on our business segment performance and highlight some of the innovative solutions and experiences we introduced during the quarter.  
HPE has been a driving transformation in our businesses to deliver a modern secure cloud experience everywhere to help our customers with their digital transformations. Our Intelligent Edge business accelerated its momentum with an outstanding quarter across all metrics. Revenue of $799 million grew 17% year-over-year, and operating profit expanded 320 basis points year-over-year. This is the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and sixth consecutive quarter of operating profit expansion. Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year and now a meaningful contributor to HPE's overall ARR.  
Extended to the edge has never been more critical for enterprises. At Aruba Atmosphere, our signature event for Aruba customers and partners, we announced an expansive set of cross-portfolio edge-to-cloud security integrations for our Aruba Edge Services Platform, or ESP, including SD-WAN technology from our recent Silver Peak acquisition.  
Today, our Aruba Edge Services Platform already supports well over 100,000 customers with 150 new customers added every day, connecting over 1 million active devices. Aruba building identity network security is unique in the market and provides the ideal foundation for building a zero trust and Secure Access Service Edge.  
Our comprehensive portfolio and AI-powered, cloud-driven platforms like Aruba ESP and Aruba Central will continue to accelerate WAN and security deployments, advanced cloud and IoT adoption and fast track digital transformation. Customers like Walgreens Boots Alliance and Mercado Libre chose Aruba in Q2 for these reasons.  
I am tremendously pleased with Aruba's impressive performance, and it is against this successful backdrop that I want to share that Aruba founder, Keerti Melkote, has made the decision to retire from HPE. We acquired Aruba in 2015 when we saw the edge as the next frontier. Aruba and Keerti has been instrumental in accelerating this business to the $3 billion business it is today. I'm incredibly grateful for his leadership, and I have personally benefited from his counsel, knowledge and friendship. Keerti will remain as an adviser to me for the remainder of 2021.  
I am pleased to announce that effective today, Phil Mottram will take over the leadership of our Aruba Intelligent Edge business. Phil is a result-driven leader with extensive experience implementing growth strategies and leading transformation initiatives. He joined HPE in 2019 and most recently assumed the role as the General Manager of our Communications Technology Group, leading a team of more than 5,000 team members who drive $500 million in CPG-specific revenue and $3.5 billion in total revenue for HPE. I'm excited to welcome Phil into this new role and believe he is the perfect fit to ensure we maintain our leadership position and strong momentum in the market.  
In our High Performance Compute & Mission Critical Solutions business, revenue of $685 million was up 11% year-over-year. We are the undisputed market leader with an industry-leading portfolio in AI and deep learning solutions for the new Age of Insight. We continue to execute on over $2 billion in awarded contract, and we are pursuing a robust pipeline of another $5 billion in market opportunity over the next 3 years.
In Q2, we announced several new HPC systems deals and collaborations. This includes building new supercomputer to advance scientific research for the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, the United States Department of Energy, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Supercomputing Centre in Singapore. As we have noted on previous calls, this is an inherently lumpy business due to the lead times between ordinary revenue recognition, but we remain on track to deliver our target of 8% to 12% annual growth in this business this year.  
Our Compute and Storage businesses performed very well in the quarter. Our strategy to grow in profitable segments of the market and pivot to more as-a-Service solutions is paying off. In Compute, revenue of $3 billion was up 10% year-over-year. We drove strong operational performance, expanding operating margins by 550 basis points. We expanded our portfolio with the latest AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon Scalable Processors, which include launching 3 new HPE ProLiant solutions targeting 5G deployments in telco, virtual desktop infrastructure and storage optimized solutions for database workloads in enterprise.  
In Storage, revenue of $1.1 billion was up 3% year-over-year with a strong operating profit of 16.8%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see strength in key software-defined solutions, which drive our ability to attach rich services to our product offerings. HPE Primera and Nimble dHCI both grew triple digits. Our HPE's All-Flash Array portfolio grew 20%.  
On May 4, we introduced a new portfolio of cloud-native data infrastructure called HPE Alletra. This portfolio delivers workload-optimized systems and provides customers with architectural flexibility to run any application without compromise from edge to cloud with a cloud operational experience. These innovations are propelling our storage business into our cloud-native software-defined data services business.  
Our pivot to as-a-Service continued its strong momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate of $678 million was up 30% year-over-year. We saw strong total as-a-Service order growth of 41%. Over 900 go-to-market partners are now actively selling HPE GreenLake as a part of their own marketplace. And we average a 95% renewal rate with billings from those customers at 124% usage of the regional contract commitments.  
We have an unmatched portfolio of hybrid cloud services that spans all aspects of networking, compute, storage, VMs, containers, ML Ops, HPC and more. On the innovation front, we announced a transformative new data storage services platform that brings a cloud operational model to whatever data it is by unifying data operations. The platform will be available through HPE GreenLake Central and includes a new data services cloud console and a suite of software subscription services that simplifies and automates global infrastructure and scale.  
Our industry-leading HPE GreenLake Cloud Services experience enable us to gain more than 90 new customers during the quarter. Carestream is a great recent customer example. In a 3 years multimillion-dollar deal, Carestream selected HPE GreenLake Cloud Services with HPE Ezmeral software and HPE Pointnext services to power a transformative new health care initiative based on Artificial Intelligence-as-a-Service. 
We will continue to invest aggressively in HPE GreenLake Cloud Services to provide a true cloud experience and operating model, whether at-the-edge, on-premises or across multiple clouds. HPE's businesses that provide services and capability of our customers recently transformed also performed well in Q2.  
HPE Pointnext Operational Services had another solid quarter with revenue growing year-over-year as reported. We expect to see growth for the full fiscal year, driven by our growing services intensity and other service momentum.  
HPE Financial Services continue to play an important role helping our customers as they rebuild and rethink their IT transformation requirements. Cash collections continue to improve, and HPE FS delivered a return on equity of 18.3%, well above pre-pandemic levels. This business continued to perform very well.  
Over the past year, our global communities have faced a catastrophic health crisis and significant business disruption. At HPE, we accelerated our strategy to be the edge-to-cloud Platform-as-a-Service company to support our customers' rapidly changing needs, who have defined our 60,000 team members' demonstrated amazing agility and perseverance. And I'm tremendously proud of our team members' response during this unprecedented time. I want to thank them for their commitment and passion that has made HPE stronger and better positioned in a world that is forever changed.  
As businesses emerge from the pandemic and move beyond the realities of COVID, digital transformation is at the forefront of their strategic initiatives. At our Discover event on June 22, you will hear more about how HPE is at the center of this super-charged digital economy. Our edge-to-cloud architecture, software and solutions all delivered as-a-Service will continue to help our customers transform their businesses, optimize their applications, and data clouds are increasingly distributing work and be future-ready today. I'm excited about our momentum, and I believe that HPE represents a strong investment opportunity for our shareholders.  
With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter's results."
273983758,714395818,2367266,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jun 01, 2021",2021-06-01,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year '21. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antoni",1968,"Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year '21. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 1, and now let me discuss our financial performance, starting with Slide 2.  
I am very pleased to report that our Q2 results reflect continued momentum in revenue, strong growth and operating margin expansion and robust cash flow generation.
We delivered Q2 revenues of $6.7 billion, up 9% from the prior year period, a level better than our normal sequential seasonality. I am particularly proud of the fact that our non-GAAP gross margin is at the record level of 34.3%, up 210 basis points from the prior year period and up 60 basis points sequentially. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, cost takeouts and an ongoing favorable mix shift towards higher-margin, software-rich offering. Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased in the quarter, as we've previously indicated due to the planned hiring increases along with R&D and go-to-market investments, this offset by our continued progress delivering on the savings from our cost optimization plan, which is on track.  
Even with our investments, our non-GAAP operating margin was 10.2%. That is up 300 basis points from our prior year, which translates to a 59% year-over-year increase in operating profit. Within other income and expense, we benefited from one-time gains related to increased valuations in our Cohesity and IonQ investments within our Pathfinder venture portfolio. As a result, we now expect other income and expense for the full year in fiscal year '21 to be an expense of approximately $50 million.
With strong execution across the business, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.46, up 70% from the prior year and meaningfully above the higher end of our outlook range for Q2. Q2 cash flow from operations was $822 million and free cash flow was $368 million, up $770 million from the prior year, driven by better profitability and strong operational discipline as well as working capital benefits. This puts us at a record level of free cash flow for the first half at $931 million.  Finally, we paid $156 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q3 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in July.  
Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 3. In Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our momentum with rich software capabilities to meet robust customer demand, delivering 17% year-over-year revenue growth across the portfolio. Switching was up 17% year-over-year, and wireless LAN was up 16%. Additionally, the Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year and now represent a meaningful contribution to HPE's overall ARR.  
We also continue to see strong operating margins at 15.5% in Q2, up 320 basis points year-over-year, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin expansion. Silver Peak continues to perform well, leveraging the high-growth SD-WAN market opportunity and contributed about 5 points to the Intelligent Edge top line growth.  
In HPC-MCS, revenue grew 11% year-over-year as we continue to achieve more customer acceptance milestones and deliver on our more than $2 billion of awarded contracts. We remain on track to deliver on our full year and 3-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%.  
In Compute, revenue grew 10% year-over-year and was down just 1% sequentially, reflecting much stronger-than-normal sequential seasonality. Operating margins were up meaningfully year-over-year due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. We ended the quarter with an operating profit margin of 11.3%, up 550 basis points from the prior year period and towards the upper range of our long-term margin guidance for these segments provided at SAM.  
Within Storage, revenue grew 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. Nimble grew 17% with ongoing strong dHCI momentum growing triple digits. All-Flash Arrays grew 20% year-over-year, led by Primera, that was up triple digits and is expected to surpass 3PAR sales next quarter.  
The mix shift towards our more software-rich platforms and operational execution helped drive storage operating profit margin to 16.8%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the second consecutive quarter year-over-year as reported with further growth expected for the full year of fiscal year '21. This has been driven by the increased focus of our BU segments on selling product and service bundles, improve service intensity and our growing as-a-Service business, which I'll remind you, enrolls service attach rates of 100%. This is very, very important to note because all of our OS revenue is recurring with 3-year average contract length, and OS is the highest operating margin contributor to our segments.  
Within HPE Financial Services, revenue was down 3% year-over-year as the pandemic did not materially impact this business until later in 2020. As expected, we are seeing continued sequential improvements in our bad debt loss ratios ending this quarter at just 75 basis points, which continues to be best-in-class within the industry. We have also seen improved cash collections well above pre-COVID levels. Our operating margin in this segment was 10.8%, up 160 basis points from the prior year and our return on equity at 18.3% is well above pre-pandemic levels and the 15%-plus target that we set at SAM.  
Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-Service business. Similar to the past couple of quarters, we are making great strides in our as-a-Service offering with over 90 new enterprise GreenLake customers added, that is in Q2, bringing the total to well over 1,000.  
I am pleased to report that our Q2 '21 ARR was $678 million, which was up 30% year-over-year as reported. Total as-a-Service orders were up 41% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in North America and Central Europe. Our Edge-as-a-Service offerings also continued to grow revenue strong triple digits year-over-year.  
Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving our ARR growth targets of 30% to 40%, a CAGR from FY '20 to FY '23.  
Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date where you can clearly see the strong rebound and momentum from our Q2 '20 trough. For the past 2 quarters, revenue has exceeded our normal sequential seasonality, reflecting the improving demand environment. And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP EPS in Q2 by 70% year-over-year.  
Turning to Slide 6. We delivered a record non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q2 of 34.3% of revenues, which was up 60 basis points sequentially and up 210 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, operational services margin expansion from cost takeout and automation and a positive mix shift towards high-margin, software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and next-generation storage offering.  
We have also benefited from the new segmentation we implemented beginning of fiscal year '20 that has given us much better visibility into each business unit and enabled better operational discipline. 
Moving to Slide 7. You can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margin substantially from pandemic lows of -- to 10.2%, which is up 300 basis points from the prior year period. We have done this by driving further productivity benefits and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan while simultaneously increasing our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets. Q2 operating expenses also included planned increased hiring and spending on select investment to drive further growth. 
Turning to Slide 8. We generated a record first half levels of cash flow with $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and $931 million of free cash flow, which is up $1.5 billion year-over-year. This was primarily driven by the increased profitability, strong operational discipline and some in near timing-related benefits. I would like to underscore that this year, our free cash flow profile seasonality will be different as a result of our back-end-loaded restructuring costs and investment in inventory for our supply chain to cater for rising demand and chip shortages as the economic recovery accelerate. 
Now moving on to Slide 9, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet. As of April 30 quarter end, we have improved the operating company to a net cash neutral position with our strong free cash flow. Furthermore, we have made good progress securitizing some financial services-related debt through the ABS market and expect to have close to all of the U.S. portfolio securitized by year-end. The refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at a cheaper cost of debt capital as well as diversifying and segregating our balance sheet between our operating company and our financial services business. 
Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensures we have ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business, drive growth and execute on our strategy. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 10. I am very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in the demand environment and our strong operational performance to date. This will be our third guidance increase in SAM in October 2020. We now expect to grow non-GAAP operating profit by 25% to 35% and deliver fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.82 and $1.94. This is a $0.09 per share improvement at the midpoint of our prior EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.88 and a $0.22 per share improvement at the midpoint since SAM. 
With respect to supply chain, we have executed well to date with minimal impacts and continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible. We do see further industry-wide tightening and inflation persisting in the near term, which has been factored in our outlook from both a revenue and cost perspective, but overall demand remains strong. From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the momentum we saw in the first half. And while we continue to see further demand improvement, we remain prudent as certain geographies continue to navigate the pandemic, and we continue to observe uncertainties in the supply of commodity. 
More specifically for Q3 '21, we expect revenue to be in line with our normal sequential seasonality of up low single digits from Q2. For Q3 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.04 to $0.10 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 to $0.44. Additionally, given our record levels of cash flow in the first half and raised earnings outlook, I am very pleased to announce that we are also raising FY '21 free cash flow guidance to $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. That is a $350 million increase at the midpoint from our original SAM guidance. So overall, Antonio and I are very proud of the progress we have made in the first half. We have navigated well through the pandemic and are exiting the first half with improved revenue momentum, strong profitability and robust cash flow. 
Our growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC-MCS have accelerated top line performance. Our core business of Compute and Storage revenues are growing with improved margins, and our as-a-Service ARR is accelerating. We also continue to execute well against our cost optimization and resource allocation program, which has made us leaner, better resourced and positioned to capitalize on the economic recovery currently at play. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you."

So let me try and dissect the guidance we gave for Q3 and also the full year. So putting things in perspective. First, you know we are raising our FY '21 EPS outlook by $0.09 at the midpoint to $1.82 to $1.94 based on our Q2 outperformance. And we feel very confident for the rest of the year. This reflects what we see as continued improvement in customer spending, but also we want to remain prudent given the remaining pandemic and supply chain uncertainty. 
Specifically for Q3, it's important to note that we do expect revenue growth in line with normal FY '18, FY '19 sequential seasonality of up low single digits. We anchored you on FY '18 or FY '19 and not last year because of the disruption we suffered in the supply chain last year. So it's better to look at it from an FY '18, FY '19 viewpoint. 
You should expect that gross margins hold roughly flat relative to our H1 levels, near just under 34%. OpEx should be up somewhat as we continue to make select investments aligned to our strategy in key growth areas, and this is partially offset by further efficiencies we find. But most importantly, it is important that you note that OI&E will flip to an expense overall in the full year, and therefore, in the second half. 
OI&E in Q1 was a positive income, and in Q2 was a positive income. And now we're expecting for the full year '21 a $50 million expense, hence, the guidance that we're giving you overall for Q3. You can expect that the tax rates will be unchanged at 14%, like we said at SAM. And the net of all of this is that we expect our Q3 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.44, and we feel pretty comfortable about it."

I don't know if Tarek has any comments. I mean we see strong demand momentum right now. We quoted in our remarks that we're up mid-single digits and, therefore, we translate that conversion into revenue. But obviously, part of the improvement could come from the HPC acceptances. Remember that on HPC, our order to revenue is a little bit more lumpy because of the time between orders and revenue takes longer. But overall, what we are confident is the fact that we see obviously IT demand improving. But I'm really pleased with our innovation and our ability to execute against that innovation. The innovation we have across the portfolio is perfectly timed what we see in today's environment. 
We live in a much more distributed enterprise. Obviously, digital transformation is essential to operate in this digital economy, and the first step is connectivity. And I have to tell you, the Intelligent Edge business is absolutely incredibly strong. You saw in actual dollars, almost 20%. And we expect to continue to be super strong for the balance of the year into '22, honestly. And that's because we have a business at scale. You have a massive business at scale, and to give a point of reference, we already have 100,000 customers on that platform. 
We have 150 customers every day. We manage more than 1.1 million devices. And honestly, we actually manage data of 1 billion plus per hour, data points that comes through our cloud. And so we expect that to continue to be very strong. I think the core business has definitely stabilized, and we've seen pockets of improvement, particularly with Storage. And then the other service will continue to stay strong. 
Again, we are cautious about the supply chain aspect of this. But we position ourselves well for the second half, and that was all factored in our guidance, absolutely well factored in our guidance, so it's why we raised the guidance."

I think I heard you mention supply chain constraints and being cautious around that and COVID, in general, cost inflation, investments you're making and then the OI&E dynamics. Can you just rank those -- well, first, did I forget any? And then can you just rank those factors in terms of which are having the most impact on your back half EPS guidance?"

Thank you, Katy. So let me try and add a little bit more color to what we said already. So first of all, remember our cost optimization and allocation program.

So first of all, remember our cost optimization and allocation program. We exited FY '20 very lean, and this has driven a very strong performance in Q1 at $0.52 per share. This is a level of earnings that was actually benefiting from the fact that we have a very strong run rate entering into Q1. 
In Q2, you saw that momentum continuing with the EPS that we posted at $0.46 per share. Very comfortable with the level of investments that we are making, and this is also showing in the gross and operating margin expansion that we've demonstrated so far. 
So now when you also look at how this translates into free cash flow, obviously, we had a lot of free cash flow benefits into Q1, Q2 as a result of the earnings strength and which translated into free cash flow. But moving forward, what you have to factor into the guidance on earnings is the fact that there is some degree of uncertainty on supply chain, although, as Antonio said, the demand is very strong across the board. The demand is very strong in Aruba. The demand is very strong in Compute. And you can see that with units going up year-over-year. And also in HPC-MCS, we are seeing the revenue trending in the range that we guided at SAM. This is all good. 
Having said that, we have also to reckon 2 other dynamics aside from the cost optimization program and the demand. The other dynamic is OI&E, which affects EPS in Q3 and Q4. Q1, Q2, we had 2 income quarters as far as OI&E is concerned. They flip into an expense of $50 million for the full year; gives you an order of magnitude of what would be the EPS for each one of Q3, Q4. 
And then on free cash flow, the other final element that drives it is we have to deal with supply chain, and we continue to buffer inventory to be ready for the demand in fiscal year '21 for the second half, but also fiscal year '22. We do not expect that the situation on inventory is going to be all of a sudden setting up across the world and across the industries. And we've taken steps, and we'll continue to do so. 
So overall, we're managing, I would say, the resurgent demand environment very well. We're lean from an organization standpoint. Our earnings power is shown by the margins we're posting. And also, you could see that what we're doing on free cash flow, we're doing very, very well. So hopefully, that gives you a color to your questions with the rankings of the various effects at play."

And it's not just the IT demand, it's the fact that we have unique portfolio, edge-to-cloud, that's meeting the customer needs of today and future-ready for tomorrow. And so I think the fact is that when you look at the full year, right, we have raised guidance now 3 times. And to Tarek's point, it's more than 25% from the beginning of the year. And that's a testament of the momentum we have in the business. 
Then obviously, every quarter has ups and downs because of unique things like OI&E or maybe more inventory build-out. But in the end, the takeaway is that we are raising again the EPS for the full year and free cash flow."

The average is probably between 4, 5 years, Kyle, at this point in time. Definitely, it's a pent-up demand to modernize that infrastructure. But it's not just replacing the hardware for the sake of replacing hardware. It's to really bring that cloud experience to that computer source and more and more be able to consume it elastically as a service. And that's the unique value proposition we have, which is not only just the best infrastructure with ProLiant as a franchise, but the fact that we have a provisional life cycle management, and you should stay tuned for more announcement here shortly, but also be able to pivot that installed base to more a consumption base over time, and then more and more as workload-optimized solutions. 
And remember, these platforms come also in a different structure in the sense that you have more options and more technologies built into the platform. And so for us, it's a big opportunity. And I think an accelerator of that position is our GreenLake business. It's not just replacing the old infrastructure of the CapEx, but be able to bring and repatriate workloads on-prem where it makes sense, or actually whole workloads on-prem because now we can deliver a true cloud experience in our consumption-driven model."

There's also another aspect that we see the pent-up demand and really the need to modernize the infrastructure and the way the infrastructure is used. But also if the decision to actually modernize the infrastructure and move into consumption isn't made, it's not bad for us because we benefit from extended leasing with our financial services portfolio.

But it's always about bringing intellectual property and talent to accelerate our edge-to-cloud platform vision. 
Silver Peak was completed in September last year and now fully integrated to the business and now we start seeing the momentum in our Intelligent Edge business. And all the ones we are doing along the way, particularly around data and software-defined assets and so forth. So again, we continue to evaluate what is available there, notwithstanding the fact that we have to be incredibly disciplined. 
As you know, valuation seems to be a little bit too high for some of the assets. But again, if there is something out there that makes sense, we will evaluate it, and we will take the right action. But again, it's an important component of our strategy going forward. And we always talk about the Aruba-like type of things. But we have relayed everything, whatever is relevant for our strategy.

I mean, obviously, if you look about the way we operate and the growth in IoT and the need for connectivity, obviously, is continuing to grow. 
Interesting enough, 3 years ago, I said that the enterprise of the future will be edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And it's playing exactly that way. Unfortunately, through the COVID pandemic, we saw that acceleration. But when you think about digital transformation, right, obviously, we live in a digital economy. And the first step is to be connected. If you're not connected, you're not participating. That connectivity is not just any more users and devices, it's things. Everything is connected to the network. Everything computes, everything generates data. 
And so connectivity is at the forefront of the digital transformation. And obviously, remote working is requiring now the need for WiFi connectivity to a level we haven't seen before. But that's an example of what's happening out there. But I will say our innovation with a true cloud-native platform at massive scale. And again, the fact that we already have 100,000 customers, and we're adding 150 customers every day, that tells you the value proposition resonated. 
We can provision a WAN port, a LAN port or a WiFi port or a BLE or ZigBee, whatever is the means of protocol from the cloud. And we're able to do that in an intelligent and autonomous way. Because ultimately, it's about the data you collect and what experiences you can provide. And so we believe this is absolutely durable. We are very bullish about this business. We expect this business to continue to grow double digits for the balance of the year. And as we add more functionality by cloud platform, particularly with edge computing and 5G, we are going to accelerate that momentum. And when you talk to customers and partners, they love the Aruba experience. Absolutely, they love the simplicity. They love the fact that you improve their experience for their own business and then powers this new way to work. So that's why we are very excited. 
And the other thing is that the platform that Aruba runs the cloud is not the platform we run the rest of the company. When we deploy now one of the data services through the new announcements we made on May 4, or where we deploy compute or where we deploy workload-optimized, is running on the same back end that Aruba was originally created. And that's why we have a true edge-to-cloud platform. And then we lay on top of that the as-a-Service model, whether it's subscription and software, which is growing triple digits on Aruba or whether it's the as-a-Service model with GreenLake. And that's the unique differentiation we have in the marketplace. And that's why we feel very good about the growth prospect of this business. Tarek, on the OI&E?"

On the OI&E front, thanks for asking the question as to why we expect OI&E to flip into an expense in the second half. In OI&E, you have effectively 3 effects. The first one is the H3C economic contribution, and the timing of which shifts between quarters. Well, we're, like we said before, very happy with H3C and the economic interest that we have through them and the cash they return to us on a regular basis. So there's a timing element there for H3C. There is also interest expense that is the second force in the OI&E line. 
And then the third force is the Pathfinder portfolio, our venture portfolio, which has been doing extremely well in the first half, and we did flag this in my script. We said we had benefits from revaluations of our investment in Cohesity and IonQ. We had, in the first quarter in OI&E a $16 million income; in the second quarter, a $27 million income. This is on an aggregate basis across the 3 forces. So for the first half, $43 million of OI&E income, and we're guiding for the full year for an expense of $50 million. So that's a $90 million swing. 
And that $90 million swing, if you turn it into an EPS number, you might have to do the math yourself, it's about $0.07 to $0.08 of EPS for the full year, right? That's the thing you have to reckon when you compute your Q3 or Q4 EPS forecast. That's the swing factor there. It does not change the fact that our operating performance remains very, very solid. The swing factor at the OI&E level is explaining a little bit more, hopefully, the guidance for all of you on the call."

Listen, the booking momentum is incredibly strong in this business. So you have to look at the booking side and then you have to look at the revenue side. The bookings continue to be just amazing. And I quote that some of the deals we won, these are multimillion dollar deals. Seasonality in this business doesn't really play out that well because the fact of the matter is that you have these large systems that need to be built, shipped, installed. You have to run the workloads. And then only then when the customer accepts the system with the workload running that you can recognize revenue. 
And that time can vary. It can be as quick as 3 months; as long as a year, in some cases. Especially when you deploy these massive exascale systems, which we're going to do starting end of the year and then next year in 2022. And sometimes you need to run the workload for a month. But reinstalling the system from the factory image on the floor, sometimes, can take up to 60 days. It's just -- it's a size of football field. 
So I would not think about the seasonality. I think about the long-term growth of the business. We feel pretty good and confident about the CAGR. But even this year, we believe we're going to deliver the 8% to 12% growth, just this year in 2021, right? So this is about keeping the orders book momentum short term, the life cycle of the supply chain and install and acceptance as much as we can. And then this business is a lot of software, right, that gets built around the system itself. So that's why we're very bullish about this system -- this business. 
And remember, it's all on the back of the day. That's why we talk about AI and deep learning technologies. Data continue to grow exponentially, and you need more compute. That's a fact at the level you haven't seen before. Tarek, maybe you want to comment on…"

The pipeline that we are having in mind includes another $5 billion of exascale opportunity to be awarded over the next 3 years. 
The win rates that we observed are very high. We win 5 out of 6 contracts in the exascale space. It's an inherently lumpy business. So I think if you look at it on a quarterly basis, probably not the best picture. You have to look at it on a multiyear basis. And we feel very confident that we can achieve the 8% to 12% CAGR per year, including starting this year, fiscal year '21. 
And because of the lumpiness of the revenue, you also have lumpiness in profitability as a result of the revenue profile and the product mix. That doesn't worry us at all. It's the nature of the beast, so to speak. We feel that HPC-MCS is extremely well positioned as a business segment to continue to be a very strong tractor of growth for HPE overall."

So anyway, I know we are running out of time. Just to close, I'm very pleased with HPE's Q2 results that again, they are marked by strong revenue momentum, profitability and free cash flow. The overall demand is improving, but our execution, our innovation is perfectly timed to the customer needs that we see in the marketplace. And despite there is supply chain uncertainty around specific commodities, we factor all that in, in our ability to execute on the back half, and that's why we are raising, once again for the third time in the year, our EPS and free cash flow. 
And I believe the future is edge-to-cloud, and it's going to be consumption-based. Well, I think HPE has a unique value proposition and a set of offerings.

I am amazed by the resilience of our customers, partners and team members.  And I'm incredibly proud of the way Hewlett Packard Enterprise continues to serve the needs of our global communities during such an unusual and evolving circumstances. We delivered a very impressive third quarter of HPE with strong orders growth, expanded margins and record free cash flow. 
Overall, I am pleased to see how our differentiated portfolio is resonating with the market and our edge-to-cloud strategy is driving improved momentum across our businesses. Based on the strength of our Q3 performance and our confidence about our momentum in the market,  we are again raising our fiscal year 2021 EPS and free cash flow outlook, and we are also resuming stock repurchases. 
Revenue in Q3 was $6.9 billion, in line with our outlook and normal sequential seasonality. Our Q3 orders were up strong double digits year-over-year, and our year-to-date order volume has increased 11%, showing the strength of our edge-to-cloud offerings. We significantly expanded our non-GAAP gross and operating margins, driving our year-to-date non-GAAP operating profit and earnings per share up 28% and 27% year-over-year, respectively. 
We generated record year-to-date free cash flow of $1.5 billion. up $1.1 billion year-over-year, putting us well ahead of the original outlook we announced last October. I am particularly pleased that we were able to deliver these results while mitigating against industry-wide supply constraints by taking proactive inventory measures working closely with our suppliers and deploy our best-in-class engineering capabilities to establish specific response plans. 
The impact of the pandemic continue to accelerate the shift we predict years ago to an edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven world. Now more than ever, there is a greater need for secure connectivity, faster insights from data and a cloud experience everywhere. We expect these trends to continue. Digital transformation is no longer a priority but a strategic imperative. To help our customers transform their businesses and be future ready today, we have been focused on doubling down in key areas that are resonating strongly in the market. 
We had a record number of orders in both our Intelligent Edge business and High Performance Compute & Mission Critical Solutions business. Due to strong demand and execution, these growth businesses now make up nearly 25% of our total company revenue. Our Intelligent Edge business accelerated its momentum again in Q3, with 23% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by a record number of new orders. Strong customer demand for secure connectivity has generated a backlog 5x greater than at the close of Q3 last year, as customers increasingly look for solutions to collect, connect, analyze and act on data at the edge. 
We are leaning into this demand and continue to invest and innovate at the edge. In June, we announced new AI ops, IoT and security features for our Aruba Edge Services Platform, or ESP, designed to streamline network operations, maximize IT efficiency and more easily extend the network from the edge to the cloud. 
our Aruba ESP continues to gain traction with customers in different verticals. In the third quarter, customers including Save-A-Lot, Monument Health and Resorts and Casinos, all standardize their networks on Aruba ESP. In our High Performance Compute & Mission Critical Solutions business, revenue was up 9% year-over-year, driven by a record number of new orders. We also generated a record order book, which now exceeds $2.5 billion. 
The exponential growth in data, along with AI and big data analytics, are all driving an increased need for High Performance Computing & Mission Critical capabilities in enterprises of all sizes. To meet this demand, we bolster our artificial intelligence capabilities with the acquisition of AI, a start-up that delivers a puzzle software stack that to train AI models faster at any scale using its open source machine learning platform. 
We also continue to see an increasing number of customers accessing our high performance computer solutions as-a-Service through HPE GreenLake. With our HPE GreenLake Cloud Services for HPC, customers gained powerful specialized computing and AI capabilities with a sustainable cloud experience. 
For example, in Q3, HPE was awarded a $2 billion contract to be realized over a 10-year period with the National Security Agency to deliver high performance solutions through the HP GreenLake platform. The service will help the National Security Agency efficiently process data and unlock new insights in sustainable new ways. Our core businesses generated robust year-over-year orders growth as well as strong profitability and free cash flow in the quarter. 
Year-to-date, Compute and Storage orders are up mid-single digits, with Q3 operating margins of 11.2% and 15.1%, respectively. We continue to offer more of our core capabilities as-a-Service. In Q3, we introduced unified compute operations as-a-Service through our HP GreenLake Cloud Platform. This new cloud-based management service simplifies provisioning and automate the management of compute infrastructure wherever it resides. 
Our Storage business is transforming into a cloud-native software defined data services business through organic innovation and targeted acquisitions. In May, we introduced our new cloud data services available through HPE GreenLake as well as a new HPE Data Infrastructure. And just this week, we closed the acquisition of Zerto, an industry leader in cloud data management and protection and run some way of data recovery services, which will be soon available as-a-Service through HP GreenLake. 
This acquisition immediately positions HPE GreenLake in the high-growth data protection market with a proven scale solution. HPE was the first to market 4 years ago in delivering as-a-Service cloud experience on-premises in a colocation with HPE GreenLake. Today, our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform has more than 1,100 customers. Our annualized revenue run rate this quarter was $705 million, up 33% year-over-year, driven by strong as-a-Service orders growth, up 46% year-over-year. 
Organizations across sectors, including retail, health care, financial services and public sector, are turning to HPE GreenLake. For instance, we helped Liberty Mutual shift from a traditional CapEx IT spend to a new pay-as-we-go mobile, creating a cloud experience on-premises to provide transparency into consumption while improving their speed in adapting to capacity demands. 
They standardized critical workloads on HPE Synergy delivered through HPE GreenLake, resulting in a reduced data center footprint and significant cost savings, including a monthly unit rate well below public cloud alternatives. We also see in the power of the full HPE edge-to-cloud portfolio as customers are turning to HPE for integrated solutions that combine secure connectivity, data insight capabilities and cloud experiences. 
Woolworths Group Australia and New Zealand's largest retailer, selected HPE GreenLake to power its new payment platform. They needed a solution that combine a powerful mission-critical architecture with ability to scale and also provide a better cost efficiency back to W Pay and its merchant partners. Delivered through hpe GreenLake, their solution leverages our full edge-to-cloud portfolio, including HPE Aruba, HPe Nonstop, HPE Primera and HPE Synergy. HPE Pointnext services also provided expertise to us over the company's digital transformation. 
I believe this is a great example of the power of our HPE edge-to-cloud portfolio. To extend our leadership position in cloud services and further pivot as-a-Service, we are relentlessly innovating. We made several compelling announcements at HPE Discover in June. I am particularly excited about our new HPE GreenLake Lifehouse offering, a secure cloud-mated stack built with HPE software to autonomously optimize different workloads across hybrid estate, reducing time to deployment and operating costs. 
We also introduced Project Aurora to secure the enterprise, embedded in our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. Project Aurora automatically and continuously verifies and attest the integrity of the hardware, freeware operating systems, platforms and workloads, while also detecting advanced threats. And finally, demonstrating our continued commitment to acquiring assets that complement our own capabilities, we acquired data platform developer will accelerate HPE analytics run time to deliver high-performance analytics for engineers and business analysts.

I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antoni",2329,"Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights on Slides 1 and 2. So now let me discuss our Q3 performance, starting with Slide 3. 
I'm pleased to report that we are experiencing very strong demand across all of our businesses. Q3 was marked by accelerating order growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion and robust cash flow generation. Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q3 revenues of $6.9 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter and in line with normal sequential seasonality and also in line with our outlook that factored in some of the expected supply chain constraints we flagged. 
We're working to ensure disruption is minimal by taking proactive measures and coordinating with our world-class suppliers to establish tailored recovery plans. I am particularly proud of our non-GAAP gross margin that hit another record level of 34.7%, up 40 basis points sequentially and up 420 basis points over the prior year period. This is driven by our deliberate actions to shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings, strong pricing discipline and cost takeout. 
As previously indicated, we continue to invest in high-growth, margin-rich areas of our portfolio, both in R&D and go-to-market, particularly in Aruba Software and as-a-Service, which increased our non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter. We also booked 2 onetime charging totally $28 million for a legal settlement and bad debt associated with likely fraud involving a channel partner in APJ. 
Even with these investments and onetime charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 25% year-over-year increase in operating profit. We continue to be focused on driving further efficiencies in the business. Within other income and expense, we benefited from stronger operational performance in H3C and strong gains related to increased valuations in our Pathfinder venture portfolio. 
As a result, we now expect other income and expense for fiscal year '21 to be an income of approximately $50 million. With strong execution across the business and despite 2 unanticipated onetime charges, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.47, up 31% from the prior year and above the higher end of our outlook range for Q3. 
Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was $526 million. This puts us at a record $1.5 billion of year-to-date free cash flow, up $1.1 billion from the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in operating profit. Finally, the strength of our business has positioned us to contribute substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $157 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in October. 
We are also announcing today the resumption of share buybacks as a result of greater free cash flow generation and visibility. I'll come back to capital allocation more broadly when we discuss the outlook. Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 4. 
Our growth businesses, which now represent nearly 25% of our total company revenue, are executing strongly and experiencing record order levels. In the Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our top line momentum with record levels of orders and 23% year-over-year revenue growth. Switching was up over 20% year-over-year, whereas wireless LAN experienced more acute supply constraints and was up mid-single digits. Additionally, the Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year, which reflects enabling software platforms as well as Network-as-a-Service. 
We also continue to see strong operating margins at 15.8% in Q3, up 540 basis points year-over-year, which included a $17 million onetime legal settlement that impacted margins by 2 points. Silver Peak continues to perform strongly and contributed 7 points to the Intelligent Edge growth. In addition, we started generating meaningful revenue synergies by cross-selling the Aruba portfolio, which reinforces the merits of the Silver Peak deal. 
In HPC & MCS, demand strengthened even further with a record order level. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year as we continue to achieve more customer acceptance milestones and deliver on more than $2.5 billion of awarded contracts, including the contract that Antonio mentioned with the NSA worth $2 billion over 10 years. We remain on track to deliver on our full year and 3-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%. 
In Compute, revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting normal sequential seasonality and despite previously anticipated supply chain tightness. Operating margins of 11.2%, were up 190 basis points from the prior year, due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. Within Storage, revenue grew 1% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter, ahead of normal sequential seasonality, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. 
Nimble grew 10% year-over-year, with ongoing strong dHCI momentum, growing double digits year-over-year. All-Flash Array grew by over 30% year-over-year, led by Primera. The mix shift towards more software-rich platforms helped drive Storage operating margins to 15.1%, up 10 basis points year-over-year, offset by continued investments in our cloud data services. 
With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter year-over-year as reported with both order and revenue growth expected for fiscal year '21.  Within HPE Financial Services, revenue was flat year-over-year and sequentially. While our bad debt loss ratio did increase slightly to 94 basis points this quarter,  it was entirely due to a onetime $11 million reserve charge related to the already mentioned likely fraud in APJ by a channel partner. 
Absent this one-off event, our bad debt loss ratio would have improved to just 61 basis points aligned to pre-pandemic levels. More importantly, we continue to see improved cash collections above pre-pandemic levels. Our operating margin was 11.1%, up 300 basis points from the prior year. And our return on equity at 18.3%, is well above the 15% plus target set at SAM. 
Slide 5 highlights the key metrics of our growing as-a-Service business. We have made significant progress since our Analyst Day last October by adding over 200 new enterprise GreenLake customers to over 1,100 today and increasing our TCV by over $1 billion to a current lifetime TCV of well over $5 billion. 
For Q3 specifically, our ARR was $705 million, which was up 33% year-over-year as reported, and total as-a-Service orders were up 46% year-over-year. It is also important to note that the mix of our ARR is becoming more and more software-rich as we build out our GreenLake Cloud Platform, which is improving our margin profile. We look forward to providing more disclosure around our software and services mix at our Analyst Day later this fall, which I believe reinforces the significant value add of GreenLake. 
Overall, based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving our ARR growth target of 30% to 40% CAGR from FY '20 to FY '23. Slide 6 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year and sustained momentum for the last 3 quarters. The demand environment continues to strengthen. And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP EPS in Q3 by 31% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 7. We delivered another record non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q3 of 34.7% of revenues, which was up 40 basis points sequentially and up 420 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and next-generation Storage offerings. We have also benefited from our new segmentation we implemented beginning of fiscal year 2020, that gives us much better visibility into each business unit and enables the better resource allocation and discipline to drive operating leverage. 
Moving to Slide 8. You can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margin substantially from pandemic lows to 9.8%, which is up 190 basis points from the prior year period. We are driving further productivity benefits and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan, while simultaneously increasing our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets. 
As mentioned previously, Q3 operating expenses also included onetime charges not included in our guidance, totaling $28 million for a legal settlement and the likely for skiing involving a partner. Excluding these one-off charges, our operating margin would have been 10.2%.  
Turning to Slide 9. We generated a record year-to-date levels of cash flow with $2.9 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.5 billion of free cash flow, which is up $1.1 billion year-over-year. This was primarily driven by increased operating profit. I would like also to underscore that this year, our free cash flow seasonality will be different than in prior years. We expect increased Financial Services volume that include more than $150 million in Q4 financing for a very large deal that is predominantly GreenLake and will benefit our ARM margins for years to come. 
We also have further restructuring payments and growing working capital needs as we continue to buffer our inventory levels in the light of the disruption in the global IT supply chain. Now moving on to Slide 10, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet. As of July 31, the operating company net cash balance turned positive due to our strong free cash flow. Furthermore, we made additional progress during the quarter, securitizing over $750 million of financial services-related debt through the ABS market. 
The refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing market at a cheaper cost of debt capital as well as diversify and segregate our balance sheet between our operating company and our Financial Services business. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensure we have ample liquidity to run our operations, continuing to invest in our business to drive growth and return capital to shareholders. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 11. I'm very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in the demand environment and our strong execution. This will be the fourth guidance increase since SAM in October 2020. We now expect to deliver fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.88 and $1.96. With respect to supply chain, as indicated last quarter, industry-wide tightening somewhat constrained our supply as expected. We continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible. And you can see our efforts in inventory balances that increased $1.3 billion year-to-date that also reflects the strengthening demand environment and a substantial order book we have across the business. 
We expect the challenged supply chain conditions to persist until at least the middle of calendar year 2022 and have factored these into our revenues, costs and cash flow outlook. From a top line perspective, although we remain prudent given the challenged supply chain environment, we are very pleased with the accelerating Q3 order momentum across all segments of the business. More specifically for Q4 '21, we expect revenue to be above our normal sequential seasonality from Q3 and are comfortable with current consensus levels. 
For Q4 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.14 to $0.22 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.52. Additionally, given our record levels of free cash flow year-to-date and confidence in our raised outlook, I'm very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year '21 free cash flow guidance to $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, that is a $600 million increase at the midpoint from our original sand guidance with the top end of this free cash flow guidance range at the peak levels attained in fiscal year '19.  
As you recall, at the end of the first half of fiscal year 2020, we suspended our share buybacks to preserve liquidity in the context of the global pandemic disruption. Although we continue to operate in a challenged supply environment,  our order momentum and improved cash flow generation visibility give us confidence to reinstate our share repurchase program. We are targeting up to $250 million of share repurchases in Q4 of fiscal year '21, and  we'll update investors on our capital management policy for fiscal year '22 at SAM in October. 
As a reminder, we always follow a disciplined, return-based capital allocation framework to maximize long-term shareholder value. Our number one priority remains delivering sustainable profitable growth through both organic and inorganic M&A investments while remaining committed to paying dividends to our shareholders. In addition, we will consider opportunistic share buybacks when we see a favorable return for doing so. 
So overall, and to conclude, I am very proud of the progress we have made year-to-date in fiscal year '21. It's clear that our edge-to-cloud strategy is resonating with customers and driving improved momentum across all of our businesses. Our growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC & MCS have accelerated top line performance with record levels of orders. Our core business of Compute and Storage is demonstrating momentum with robust orders and improved margins and our as-a-Service ARR is accelerating. 
All of this translates to improving revenue momentum, strong profitability growth and record levels of free cash flow. We look forward to closing out our fiscal year much leaner, better resourced and positioned to capitalize on the strong demand environment. Lastly, as Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us for our virtual Securities Analyst Meeting in late October, where we will provide an update on our strategy, business insights and financial outlook. Now with that, let's open it up for questions."

I think you're implying, based on the rate free cash flow guide, that we'll do around $100 million of free cash flow in Q4. That, I think, would be one of the softest you've seen. So maybe just quantify some of the dynamics that are at play that's driving that talked about a few of them, but just quantify the headwind there? 
And then secondly, the focus has always been getting to $2 billion number longer term. Maybe touch on what are the key levers to get to this $2 billion number? And how much of that is self-help versus revenue driven?"

So yes, our free cash flow for Q4 is north of $100 million is actually implied in our guidance is about $150 million in Q4. And this figure reflects a different seasonal profile that we have had this year in terms of our revenue and expense profile, but also a couple of very important dynamics that I would like to underscore. 
First of all, we have to continue to make investments in our inventory level to withstand the supply chain constraints that we flagged for several quarters now. Second, in Q4 of fiscal year '21, in my script, I described a very, very large GreenLake deal that will impact free cash flow in Q4, but that will generate substantial ARR revenue in subsequent quarters. This is a deal in several hundred millions of dollars that we have not announced yet, but it is already something that we're financing, and this is affecting therefore, free cash flow already as of Q4 of fiscal year '21. 
Thirdly, we are still peaking on restructuring costs in fiscal year '21, and we feel very positive about our cost optimization and resource allocation program, which will wind down at the end of fiscal year '22. And so this is a nice segue to tell you about our guidance towards fiscal year '22 and the $2 billion target that we have. We continue to expect revenue growth in fiscal year '22 with the momentum that carries out of fiscal year '21. 
And  also, the restructuring cost program winding down will be a key determinant of our generation of free cash flow in fiscal year '22. So hopefully, I gave you color there. Antonio, you want to add something?"

And therefore, in many ways, we are almost a year ahead of our commitment. Because if you recall, we said we're going to return to normalized free cash flow in 2022. And the reality, even when you finance this large deal that the venture we're going to communicate has nothing to do with NSA deal, we are already almost the same number. So that's why we are so pleased on the momentum that we have, but it's a momentum based on the order growth and all the actions we have taken and the deliberate shift in our portfolio to higher margins. And that's what you see in our numbers in Q3, right? It's a record-breaking gross margin of 34.7%."

And we do that in the context of, obviously, supply availability, stealing demand in the right portfolio and obviously inflationary costs associated with some of the commodities. 
At the same time, remember, there is also new innovation, I guess, built in our products, which have structural impact in the sense that where you look at our infrastructure, right? New technologies drive 2/3 of the pricing in many ways in the But we could take closer actions all the time, Simon, and we will continue to do so.

We have in this context where you have a constrained supply environment to be very careful around managing pricing, right? And we have taken action that is translating in this record level of gross margin at 34.7%. Some of our competitors didn't take that action, and it's down to them and up to them. But we feel that the current environment is calling for a decent approach to pricing, and we see an encouraged balanced pricing behavior across the market. 
So more specifically, with respect to our units and AUPs in Compute, I'm sure someone will ask the question, AUP was up mid- to high single digits quarter-on-quarter, reflecting pass-through of commodity cost and richer configurations, as always, configurations that are richer play a big role in the AUP, but also pricing in this case. And units were flat quarter-over-quarter, given some expected supply chain constraints. 
So we feel pretty good about performance in Compute in that regard. It's still a business that we have to manage very, very carefully on a day-to-day basis because of the supply environment being volatile forces us to do so, but we still see scope for continuous gross margin improvement across the board and in compute as well."

The order book is very, very solid. 
Antonio underscored this across the board, our order book is super solid. Now the question is, how much of that can be really accelerated in terms of conversion in Q4. And it's every day is another day. So we're working through that. And this obviously has an impact on gross margins, right? Because the more you wait for fulfilling an order, the more you can have an adverse impact on gross margins. But we feel fairly comfortable with us managing this dynamic and particularly leveraging or pulling the levers across the board that we have, such as our revenue mix, I want to highlight to you the continuous growth in Aruba, this level of growth in Aruba on our Intelligent Edge business of 23% comes with very high-calorie revenue, and we feel very, very comfortable and pleased with that trend. 
Also, our growth in Storage, which comes with very high-calorie gross margin revenue is pleasing at 3%. We took share from some of our main competitors. And this gives you an idea that we have a few strings in our bow, so to speak, to actually continue to drive gross margins to better levels."

Just to be clear, when people ask me, hey, this is perishable? No. I can tell you, the answer is definitely no. I think it's because also customers realize it's not just a supply constraint, but a need to provision more compute and data insight capabilities. 
And then as I said earlier, even despite the fact that our Intelligent Edge business exited with a 5x backlog on that unique segment of the market, we still delivered 23% in constant currency, 27% growth. And that's why Tarek said, we expect revenue to continue to grow and in particular, '22. And then to the question that was asked earlier about margin, the margin strengthening over time because of the mix shift. And that Aruba is very important to us. But fundamentally, I think our edge-to-cloud vision and strategy is absolutely resonated in the market because customers need 3 things. 
They need secure connectivity in this cyber world, they need a cloud experience everywhere, and then they need data insights in my view.  And then we need to be able to consume it as-a-Service in an elastic way.

The order momentum and the order book remains strong and what we didn't convert in Q3 would convert in Q4 and subsequent quarters to specifically give you an idea of where we would have ended in Q3. we probably would have ended above seasonal trends that we see between Q2 and Q3 by a low single-digit percentage number. But the momentum is very strong in Q4 and also for '22. That's the interesting bit. 
In the environment that we're operating in, the demand is very solid. And the supply constraints, we don't see them ending before the first half of calendar year '22. So we just have to navigate this as the capacity of all our manufacturing partners is not back to pre-pandemic levels, and that will still take a good 2 to 3 quarters."

Let me start and Tarek is welcome to. Listen, as you said, right, this business is lumpy because of the time it takes to book the orders to build the ship at they install it and then most importantly, customer accept the order, meaning the workload that was intended to run on is active, is in production. And we normally see this trend accelerate in the back half of the year because of the way the acceptances work. 
So we absolutely expect a significant uptick here. And that's why we are very confident in our ability to deliver for the year 2021, the 8% to 12% growth that we committed since the beginning, actually 2021. And we have a number of deals that are all now running the -- what we call the testing cycles and fairly confident about the customer acceptances, which would allow us to recognize revenue. 
This has nothing to do with supply availability in many ways because, obviously, those systems, in many ways, has already shipped and they are already deployed.  It's just getting through the cycle for the customer to get the performance that they need. And there is quite a bit of tuning that gets done when the systems are deployed. 
But to Tarek's point, the demand is unbelievably strong. Put aside the $2 billion award that we got yesterday -- we announced yesterday, we continue to win multiple -- multimillion-dollar deals in many aspects, and you can see some of those, as we announced throughout the quarter. And that's the power of the portfolio we have in high-performance computing and specifically, tool for these AI and deep learning capabilities. 
And by the way, we have $2.5 billion of awarded business, which I don't consider backlog is business that will be delivered over the next 12 to 18 months, particularly the large scale systems, which are an amazing feat of technology, I will say."

I think we have a competitive advantage, and the competitive advantage come from many aspects the software.  Software that makes this consumption model -- through consumption model unlike some of the other ones that we're trying to catch up, which is more financial engineering in many ways, understand everybody is getting into the space. but we have years of leadership here. 
And the conversation goes as simple as this. I want the cloud experience on-prem and at the edge, and we can bring that through GreenLake because it is a true cloud experience that you can consume elastically on a per unit measure that we can measure all the way to core levels and be able to automate the whole experience through our software stack, which obviously model now is becoming a very important component of that. 
And that's why Tarek made the comment earlier, as we go through the SAM end of October, we're going to give a little better disclosure of that because the software content of the continues to increase. Aruba by definition, Shannon, is already software, right? And he said that a 3 -- triple-digit growth is happening in that business because you are subscribing to get connectivity. And our platform is a cloud platform at scale because we manage now more than 1.5 million devices. 
But it's not a pool, I will say. When customers are becoming way more sophisticated about the hybrid estate, where the the data and whether run the world, they realize that the vast majority are still on-premise and many of them will stay on-premise. It's just economics and physics. And we can deliver some experience on-prem and still give them a hybrid experience by managing the workloads and datasets outside their 4 walls. And GreenLake is absolutely resonating. And that's why you see us catering everything to GreenLake, whether it's connectivity, whether it's data services, whether it is elastic computing and more workload optimized services as we go along. 
And that's why I said earlier, this is all about acceleration on that. And between now and March, you're going to see a massive acceleration and that's why it's my number one priority. And by the way, as a revenue is accretive on a gross margin perspective. So Tarek, do you want to talk about that?"

So Shannon, what I would say is if you refer back to Slide 5 of our investor presentation, we showed you the stack of revenue that composes our ARR, right? So our GreenLake revenue is across all segments of Compute, HPC, MCS, Storage, Aruba and also HPE FS, as you can infer from that slide. And  the more we drive GreenLake by way of software, the more accretive it is to the overall gross margin of the company, that's a key lever to drive gross margin moving forward. 
We're driving gross margin across every single stream lane through the revenue mix and across also that revenue mix horizontally by way of pivoting the company to become an as-a-Service. So far,  what I could tell you is that the GreenLake gross margin is substantially higher than the average gross margin of the company that we posted today. And we look forward, Antonio and I to update you and every other member of the analyst community at our virtual SAM event in October, highlighting to you where we see the ARR growing and its mix by segment moving forward.

And I'm incredibly proud of the way Hewlett Packard Enterprise continues to serve the needs of our global communities during such an unusual and evolving circumstances. 
We delivered a very impressive third quarter at HPE with strong orders growth, expanded margins and record free cash flow. Overall, I am pleased to see how our differentiated portfolio is resonating with the market and our edge-to-cloud strategy is driving improved momentum across our businesses. Based on the strength of our Q3 performance and our confidence about our momentum in the market,  we are again raising our fiscal year 2021 EPS and free cash flow outlook, and we are also resuming stock repurchases. 
Revenue in Q3 was $6.9 billion, in line with our outlook and normal sequential seasonality. Our Q3 orders were up strong double digits year-over-year, and our year-to-date order volume has increased 11%, showing the strength of our edge-to-cloud offerings. We significantly expanded our non-GAAP gross and operating margins, driving our year-to-date non-GAAP operating profit and earnings per share, up 28% and 27% year-over-year, respectively. 
We generated record year-to-date free cash flow of $1.5 billion, up $1.1 billion year-over-year, putting us well ahead of the original outlook we announced last October. I am particularly pleased that we were able to deliver these results while mitigating against industry-wide supply constraints by taking proactive inventory measures working closely with our suppliers and deploy our best-in-class engineering capabilities to establish specific response plans. 
The impact of the pandemic continue to accelerate the shift we predicted years ago to an edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven world. Now more than ever, there is a greater need for secure connectivity, faster insights from data and a cloud experience everywhere. We expect these trends to continue. Digital transformation is no longer a priority but a strategic imperative. To help our customers transform their businesses and be future ready today, we have been focused on doubling down in key areas that are resonating strongly in the market. 
We had a record number of orders in both our Intelligent Edge business and High Performance Compute & Mission Critical Solutions business. Due to strong demand and execution, these growth businesses now make up nearly 25% of our total company revenue. 
Our Intelligent Edge business accelerated its momentum again in Q3, with 23% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by a record number of new orders. Strong customer demand for secure connectivity has generated a backlog 5x greater than at the close of Q3 last year, as customers increasingly look for solutions to collect, connect, analyze and act on data at the edge. 
We are leaning into this demand and continue to invest and innovate at the edge. In June, we announced new AI ops, IoT and security features for our Aruba Edge Services Platform, or ESP, designed to streamline network operations, maximize IT efficiency and more easily extend the network from the edge to the cloud. 
our Aruba ESP continues to gain traction with customers in different verticals. In the third quarter, customers including Save A Lot, Monument Health and Circa Resort & Casino, all standardized their networks on Aruba ESP. In our High Performance Compute & Mission Critical Solutions business, revenue was up 9% year-over-year, driven by a record number of new orders. We also generated a record order book, which now exceeds $2.5 billion. 
The exponential growth in data, along with AI and big data analytics, are all driving an increased need for High Performance Computing & Mission Critical capabilities in enterprises of all sizes. To meet this demand, we bolstered our artificial intelligence capabilities with the acquisition of Determined AI, a start-up that delivers a puzzle software stack that to train AI models faster at any scale using its open source machine learning platform. 
We also continued to see an increasing number of customers accessing our high performance computer solutions as-a-Service through HPE GreenLake. With our HPE GreenLake Cloud Services for HPC, customers gained powerful specialized computing and AI capabilities with a sustainable cloud experience. 
For example, in Q3, HPE was awarded a $2 billion contract to be realized over a 10-year period with the National Security Agency to deliver high performance computing solutions through the HP GreenLake platform. The service will help the National Security Agency efficiently process data and unlock new insights in sustainable new ways. Our core businesses generated robust year-over-year orders growth as well as strong profitability and free cash flow in the quarter. Year-to-date, Compute and Storage orders are up mid-single digits, with Q3 operating margins of 11.2% and 15.1%, respectively. 
We continue to offer more of our core capabilities as-a-Service. In Q3, we introduced unified compute operations as-a-Service through our HP GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. This new cloud-based management service simplifies provisioning and automates the management of compute infrastructure wherever it resides. 
Our Storage business is transforming into a cloud-native software defined data services business through organic innovation and targeted acquisitions. In May, we introduced our new cloud data services available through HPE GreenLake as well as a new HPE Alletra cloud native data infrastructure. And just this week, we closed the acquisition of Zerto, an industry leader in cloud data management and protection and run some way of data recovery services, which will be soon available as-a-Service through HPE GreenLake. 
This acquisition immediately positions HPE GreenLake in the high-growth data protection market with a proven scale solution. HPE was the first to market 4 years ago in delivering and as-a-Service cloud experience on-premises in a colocation or at the edge with HPE GreenLake. Today, our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform has more than 1,100 customers. Our annualized revenue run rate this quarter was $705 million, up 33% year-over-year, driven by strong as-a-Service orders growth, up 46% year-over-year. 
Organizations across sectors, including retail, health care, financial services and public sector, are turning to HPE GreenLake. For instance, we helped Liberty Mutual shift from a traditional CapEx IT spend to a new pay-as-you-go model, creating a cloud experience on-premises to provide transparency into consumption while improving their speed in adapting to capacity demands. 
They standardized critical workloads on HPE Synergy delivered through HPE GreenLake, resulting in a reduced data center footprint and significant cost savings, including a monthly unit rate well below public cloud alternatives. 
We also see in the power of the full HPE edge-to-cloud portfolio as customers are turning to HPE for integrated solutions that combine secure connectivity, data insight capabilities and cloud experiences. 
Woolworths Group Australia and New Zealand's largest retailer, selected HPE GreenLake to power its new Wpay payment platform. They needed a solution that combine a powerful mission-critical architecture with ability to scale and also provide a better cost efficiency back to Wpay and its merchant partners. Delivered through HPE GreenLake, their solution leverages our full edge-to-cloud portfolio, including HPE Aruba, HPE NonStop, HPE Primera and HPE Synergy. HPE Pointnext Services also provided expertise to us over the company's digital transformation. 
I believe this is a great example of the power of our HPE edge-to-cloud portfolio. To extend our leadership position in cloud services and further accelerate our pivot as-a-Service, we are relentlessly innovating. We made several compelling announcements at HPE Discover in June. I am particularly excited about our new HPE GreenLake Lighthouse offering, a secure cloud native stack built with HPE Ezmeral software to autonomously optimize different workloads across hybrid estate, reducing time to deployment and operating costs. 
We also introduced Project Aurora to secure the enterprise, embedded in our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. Project Aurora automatically and continuously verifies and attests the integrity of the hardware, freeware operating systems, platforms and workloads, while also detecting advanced threats. 
And finally, demonstrating our continued commitment to acquiring assets that complement our own capabilities, we acquired data platform developer Ampool. Ampool will accelerate HPE Ezmeral analytics run time to deliver high-performance analytics for engineers and business analysts. 
I am proud of HPE's performance in Q3 and year-to-date and the significant progress we have made in becoming the edge-to-cloud company. The momentum we have in the market compel us to move even further and faster, and our ability to transform with increasing speed is imperative. This transformation is my #1 priority. At this pivotal moment, our purpose to advance the way people in the work has never been more important. Our vision to become the edge-to-cloud company is proving its tremendous relevance and our portfolio is winning in the marketplace. 
Fueled by our purpose, vision and portfolio, we have the opportunity to build a more digitally enabled inclusive world. We have a mandate to imagine new digital transformation strategies that support our own ESG goals and those of our customers, leading to better business outcomes and societal impact. We will never waver from our commitment to being a force for good and a strategic partner for our customers. 
We will continue to bring bold new innovation to our customers, and we will continue to create value for our shareholders. And I'm grateful for the incredible team, and I'm confident in and excited about the future. 
I hope you will join us for our virtual Security Analyst Meeting on October 28 to hear more about our position in the market, our priorities and our outlook for the year ahead. 
I will now turn it over to Tarek."

I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antoni",2325,"Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights on Slides 1 and 2. So now let me discuss our Q3 performance, starting with Slide 3. 
I'm pleased to report that we are experiencing very strong demand across all of our businesses. Q3 was marked by accelerating order growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion and robust cash flow generation. Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q3 revenues of $6.9 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter and in line with normal sequential seasonality, also in line with our outlook that factored in some of the expected supply chain constraints we flagged. 
We're working to ensure disruption is minimal by taking proactive measures and coordinating with our world-class suppliers to establish tailored recovery plans. I am particularly proud of our non-GAAP gross margin that hit another record level of 34.7%, up 40 basis points sequentially and up 420 basis points from the prior year period. This is driven by our deliberate actions to shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings, strong pricing discipline and cost takeout. 
As previously indicated, we continue to invest in high-growth, margin-rich areas of our portfolio, both in R&D and go-to-market, particularly in Aruba Software and as-a-Service, which increased our non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter. We also booked 2 onetime charging totally $28 million for a legal settlement and bad debt associated with likely fraud involving a channel partner in APJ. 
Even with these investments and onetime charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 25% year-over-year increase in operating profit. We continue to be focused on driving further efficiencies in the business. Within other income and expense, we benefited from stronger operational performance in H3C and strong gains related to increased valuations in our Pathfinder venture portfolio. 
As a result, we now expect other income and expense for fiscal year '21 to be an income of approximately $50 million. With strong execution across the business and despite 2 unanticipated onetime charges, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.47, up 31% from the prior year and above the higher end of our outlook range for Q3. 
Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was $526 million. This puts us at a record $1.5 billion of year-to-date free cash flow, up $1.1 billion from the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in operating profit. Finally, the strength of our business has positioned us to contribute substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $157 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in October. 
We are also announcing today the resumption of share buybacks as a result of greater free cash flow generation and visibility. I'll come back to capital allocation more broadly when we discuss the outlook. 
Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 4. Our growth businesses, which now represent nearly 25% of our total company revenue, are executing strongly and experiencing record order levels. In the Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our top line momentum with record levels of orders and 23% year-over-year revenue growth. Switching was up over 20% year-over-year, whereas wireless LAN experienced more acute supply constraints and was up mid-single digits. Additionally, the Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year, which reflects enabling software platforms as well as Network-as-a-Service. 
We also continue to see strong operating margins at 15.8% in Q3, up 540 basis points year-over-year, which included a $17 million onetime legal settlement that impacted margins by 2 points. Silver Peak continues to perform strongly and contributed 7 points to the Intelligent Edge growth. In addition, we started generating meaningful revenue synergies by cross-selling the Aruba portfolio, which reinforces the merits of the Silver Peak deal. 
In HPC & MCS, demand strengthened even further with a record order level. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year as we continue to achieve more customer acceptance milestones and deliver on more than $2.5 billion of awarded contracts, including the contract that Antonio mentioned with the NSA worth $2 billion over 10 years. We remain on track to deliver on our full year and 3-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%. 
In Compute, revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting normal sequential seasonality despite previously anticipated supply chain tightness. Operating margins of 11.2%, were up 190 basis points from the prior year, due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. Within Storage, revenue grew 1% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter, ahead of normal sequential seasonality, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. 
Nimble grew 10% year-over-year, with ongoing strong dHCI momentum, growing double digits year-over-year. All-Flash Arrays grew by over 30% year-over-year, led by Primera. The mix shift towards more software-rich platforms helped drive Storage operating margins to 15.1%, up 10 basis points year-over-year, offset by continued investments in our cloud data services. 
With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter year-over-year as reported with both order and revenue growth expected for fiscal year '21.  Within HPE Financial Services, revenue was flat year-over-year and sequentially. While our bad debt loss ratio did increase slightly to 94 basis points this quarter, it was entirely due to a onetime $11 million reserve charge related to the already mentioned likely fraud in APJ by a channel partner. 
Absent this one-off event, our bad debt loss ratio would have improved to just 61 basis points aligned to pre-pandemic levels. More importantly, we continue to see improved cash collections above pre-pandemic levels. Our operating margin was 11.1%, up 300 basis points from the prior year. And our return on equity at 18.3%, is well above the 15% plus target set at SAM. 
Slide 5 highlights the key metrics of our growing as-a-Service business. We have made significant progress since our Analyst Day last October by adding over 200 new enterprise GreenLake customers to over 1,100 today and increasing our TCV by over $1 billion to a current lifetime TCV of well over $5 billion. 
For Q3 specifically, our ARR was $705 million, which was up 33% year-over-year as reported, and total as-a-Service orders were up 46% year-over-year. It is also important to note that the mix of our ARR is becoming more and more software-rich as we build out our GreenLake Cloud Platform, which is improving our margin profile. We look forward to providing more disclosure around our software and services mix at our Analyst Day later this fall, which I believe reinforces the significant value add of GreenLake. Overall, based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving our ARR growth target of 30% to 40% CAGR from FY '20 to FY '23. 
Slide 6 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year and sustained momentum for the last 3 quarters. The demand environment continues to strengthen. And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP EPS in Q3 by 31% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 7. We delivered another record non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q3 of 34.7% of revenues, which was up 40 basis points sequentially and up 420 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and next-generation storage offerings. We have also benefited from our new segmentation we implemented beginning of fiscal year 2020, that gives us much better visibility into each business unit and enables the better resource allocation and discipline to drive operating leverage. 
Moving to Slide 8. You can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margin substantially from pandemic lows to 9.8%, which is up 190 basis points from the prior year period. We are driving further productivity benefits and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan, while simultaneously increasing our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets. 
As mentioned previously, Q3 operating expenses also included onetime charges not included in our guidance, totaling $28 million for a legal settlement and the likely [ forgery ] involving a partner. Excluding these one-off charges, our operating margin would have been 10.2%.  
Turning to Slide 9. We generated a record year-to-date levels of cash flow with $2.9 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.5 billion of free cash flow, which is up $1.1 billion year-over-year. This was primarily driven by increased operating profit. I would like also to underscore that this year, our free cash flow seasonality will be different than in prior years. We expect increased Financial Services volume that include more than $150 million in Q4 financing for a very large deal that is predominantly GreenLake and will benefit our ARR margins for years to come. 
We also have further restructuring payments and growing working capital needs as we continue to buffer our inventory levels in the light of the disruption in the global IT supply chain. Now moving on to Slide 10, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet. As of July 31, the operating company net cash balance turned positive due to our strong free cash flow. Furthermore, we made additional progress during the quarter, securitizing over $750 million of financial services-related debt through the ABS market. 
The refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing market at a cheaper cost of debt capital as well as diversify and segregate our balance sheet between our operating company and our Financial Services business. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensure we have ample liquidity to run our operations, continuing to invest in our business to drive growth and return capital to shareholders. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 11. I'm very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in the demand environment and our strong execution. This will be the fourth guidance increase since SAM in October 2020. We now expect to deliver fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.88 and $1.96. With respect to supply chain, as indicated last quarter, industry-wide tightening somewhat constrained our supply as expected. We continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible. And you can see our efforts in inventory balances that increased $1.3 billion year-to-date that also reflects the strengthening demand environment and a substantial order book we have across the business. 
We expect the challenged supply chain conditions to persist until at least the middle of calendar year 2022 and have factored these into our revenues, costs and cash flow outlook. From a top line perspective, although we remain prudent given the challenged supply chain environment, we are very pleased with the accelerating Q3 order momentum across all segments of the business. More specifically for Q4 '21, we expect revenue to be above our normal sequential seasonality from Q3 and are comfortable with current consensus levels. 
For Q4 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.14 to $0.22 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.52. Additionally, given our record levels of free cash flow year-to-date and confidence in our raised outlook, I'm very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year '21 free cash flow guidance to $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, that is a $600 million increase at the midpoint from our original SAM guidance with the top end of this free cash flow guidance range at the peak levels attained in fiscal year '19.  
As you recall, at the end of the first half of fiscal year 2020, we suspended our share buybacks to preserve liquidity in the context of the global pandemic disruption. Although we continue to operate in a challenged supply environment, our order momentum and improved cash flow generation visibility give us confidence to reinstate our share repurchase program. We are targeting up to $250 million of share repurchases in Q4 of fiscal year '21, and we'll update investors on our capital management policy for fiscal year '22 at SAM in October. 
As a reminder, we always follow a disciplined, return-based capital allocation framework to maximize long-term shareholder value. Our #1 priority remains delivering sustainable profitable growth through both organic and inorganic M&A investments while remaining committed to paying dividends to our shareholders. In addition, we will consider opportunistic share buybacks when we see a favorable return for doing so. 
So overall, and to conclude, I am very proud of the progress we have made year-to-date in fiscal year '21. It's clear that our edge-to-cloud strategy is resonating with customers and driving improved momentum across all of our businesses. Our growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC/MCS have accelerated top line performance with record levels of orders. Our core business of Compute and Storage is demonstrating momentum with robust orders and improved margins and our as-a-Service ARR is accelerating. 
All of this translates to improving revenue momentum, strong profitability growth and record levels of free cash flow. We look forward to closing out our fiscal year much leaner, better resourced and positioned to capitalize on the strong demand environment. Lastly, as Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us for our virtual Securities Analyst Meeting in late October, where we will provide an update on our strategy, business insights and financial outlook. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions."

I think you're implying, based on the [ rate ] free cash flow guide, that we'll do around $100 million or so of free cash flow in Q4. That, I think, would be one of the softest [indiscernible] you've seen. So maybe just quantify some of the dynamics that are at play that's driving that part. You have talked about a few of them, but just quantify the headwind there? 
And then secondly, the focus has always been getting to this $2 billion free cash flow number longer term. Maybe touch on what are the key levers to get to this $2 billion number? And how much of that is self-help versus revenue driven?"

And this figure reflects a different seasonal profile that we have had this year in terms",289,"Sure. Thank you, Amit, for the question. So yes, our free cash flow for Q4 is north of $100 million is actually implied in our guidance is about $150 million in Q4. And this figure reflects a different seasonal profile that we have had this year in terms of our revenue and expense profile, but also a couple of very important dynamics that I would like to underscore. 
First of all, we have to continue to make investments in our inventory level to withstand the supply chain constraints that we flagged for several quarters now. Second, in Q4 of fiscal year '21, in my script, I described a very, very large GreenLake deal that will impact free cash flow in Q4, but that will generate substantial ARR revenue in subsequent quarters. This is a deal in several hundred millions of dollars that we have not announced yet, but it is already something that we're financing, and this is affecting therefore, free cash flow already as of Q4 of fiscal year '21. 
Thirdly, we are still peaking on restructuring costs in fiscal year '21, and we feel very positive about our cost optimization and resource allocation program, which will wind down at the end of fiscal year '22. And so this is a nice segue to tell you about our guidance towards fiscal year '22 and the $2 billion target that we have. We continue to expect revenue growth in fiscal year '22 with the momentum that carries out of fiscal year '21. 
And  also, the restructuring cost program winding down will be a key determinant of our generation of free cash flow in fiscal year '22. So hopefully, I gave you color there. Antonio, you want to add something?"
273983758,1677186527,2391257,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 02, 2021",2021-09-02,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","No. The only thing I would say, Amit, is that, listen, Tarek made this comment in his remarks is the fact of the matter on the high end, on the top end of that guidance, we give you $1.7 billion is almost the same number we achieved in 2020 -- 2019.

And therefore, in many ways, we are almost a year ahead of our commitment. Because if you recall, we said we're going to return to normalized free cash flow in 2022. And the reality, even when you finance this large deal that the venture we're going to communicate has nothing to do with NSA deal. We are already almost at the same number. So that's why we are so pleased on the momentum that we have, but it's a momentum based on the order growth and all the actions we have taken and the deliberate shift in our portfolio to higher margins. And that's what you see in our numbers in Q3, right? It's a record-breaking gross margin of 34.7%."

And the fact of the matter is that we have increased pricing even [indiscernible] that's a fact. And we do that in the context of, obviously, supply availability, [ still in ] demand in the right portfolio and obviously inflationary costs associated with some of the commodities. 
At the same time, remember, there is also new innovation, I guess, built in our products, which have structural impact in the sense that where you look at our infrastructure, right? New technologies drive 2/3 of the pricing in many ways in the [indiscernible]. But we could take closer actions all the time, Simon, and we will continue to do so. And that's part of the reason also why we see record breaking margins, but in addition to the fact that we are still in demand in the right place and driving the mix shift that we talked before. So Tarek, I know you want to get more specific probably."

We have in this context where you have a constrained supply environment to be very careful around managing pricing, right? And we have taken action that is translating in this record level of gross margin at 34.7%. Some of our competitors didn't take that action, and it's down to them and up to them. But we feel that the current environment is calling for a [ decent ] approach to pricing, and we see an encouraged balanced pricing behavior across the market. 
So more specifically, with respect to our units and AUPs in Compute, I'm sure someone will ask the question, AUP was up mid- to high single digits quarter-on-quarter, reflecting pass-through of commodity cost and richer configurations, as always, configurations that are richer play a big role in the AUP, but also pricing in this case. And units were flat quarter-over-quarter, given some expected supply chain constraints. 
So we feel pretty good about performance in Compute in that regard. It's still a business that we have to manage very, very carefully on a day-to-day basis because of the supply environment being volatile forces us to do so, but we still see scope for continuous gross margin improvement across the board and in compute as well."

The order book is very, very solid. 
Antonio underscored this across the board, our order book is super solid. Now the question is, how much of that can be really accelerate in terms of conversion in Q4. And it's every day is another day. So we're working through that. And this obviously has an impact on gross margins, right? Because the more you wait for fulfilling an order, the more you can have an adverse impact on gross margins. But we feel fairly comfortable with us managing this dynamic and particularly leveraging or pulling the levers across the board that we have, such as our revenue mix, I want to highlight to you the continuous growth in Aruba, this level of growth in Aruba on our Intelligent Edge business of 23% comes with very high-calorie revenue, and we feel very, very comfortable and pleased with that trend. 
Also, our growth in Storage, which comes with very high-calorie gross margin revenue is pleasing at 3%. We took share from some of our main competitors. And this gives you an idea that we have a few strings in our bow, so to speak, to actually continue to drive gross margins to better levels."

You can imagine a person involved with some of these conversations with suppliers. But if you look at our order buffering -- sorry, inventory buffering we took, right.

That said, as I look at this order book, there is so much potential upside here. It's all about the daily conversion. And so far, once -- we have not seen any cancellations. Just to be clear, when people ask me, hey, this is perishable? No. I can tell you, the answer is definitely no. I think it's because also customers realize it's not just a supply constraint, but a need to provision more compute and data insight capabilities.

And that's why Tarek said, we expect revenue to continue to grow and in particular, '22. And then to the question that was asked earlier about margin, the margin strengthening over time because of the mix shift. And that Aruba is very important to us. But fundamentally, I think our edge-to-cloud vision and strategy is absolutely resonated in the market because customers need 3 things. 
They need secure connectivity in this cyber world, they need a cloud experience everywhere, and then they need data insights yesterday in my view. And then we need to be able to consume it as-a-Service in an elastic way. We have all the 4 ingredients, and that's why we are going to accelerate further and faster this strategy because it's working."

If we could have converted more, we would have converted more, but it doesn't really matter.  The order momentum and the order book remains strong and what we didn't convert in Q3 would convert in Q4 and subsequent quarters. To specifically give you an idea of where we would have ended in Q3, we probably would have ended above seasonal trends that we see between Q2 and Q3 by a low single-digit percentage number. But the momentum is very strong in Q4 and also for '22. That's the interesting bit. 
In the environment that we're operating in, the demand is very solid. And the supply constraints, we don't see them ending before the first half of calendar year '22. So we just have to navigate this as the capacity of all our manufacturing partners is not back to pre-pandemic levels, and that will still take a good 2 to 3 quarters."

Let me start and Tarek is welcome to. Listen, as you said, right, this business is lumpy because of the time it takes to book the order to build the ship and they install it and then most importantly, customer accept the order, meaning the workload that was intended to run on is active, is in production. And we normally see this trend accelerate in the back half of the year because of the way the acceptances work. 
So we absolutely expect a significant uptick here. And that's why we are very confident in our ability to deliver for the year 2021, the 8% to 12% growth that we committed since the beginning, actually 2021. And we have a number of deals that are all now running the, what we call, the testing cycles and fairly confident about the customer acceptances, which would allow us to recognize revenue. 
This has nothing to do with supply availability in many ways because, obviously, those systems, in many ways, has already shipped and they are already deployed.  It's just getting through the cycle for the customer to get the performance that they need. And there is quite a bit of tuning that gets done when the systems are deployed. 
But to Tarek's point, the demand is unbelievably strong. Put aside the $2 billion award that we got yesterday -- we announced yesterday, we continue to win multiple -- multimillion-dollar deals in many aspects, and you can see some of those, as we announced throughout the quarter. And that's the power of the portfolio we have in high-performance computing and specifically, tool for these AI and deep learning capabilities. 
And by the way, we have $2.5 billion of awarded business, which I don't consider backlog is business that will be delivered over the next 12 to 18 months, particularly the large extra scale systems, which are an amazing feat of technology, I will say."

I think we have a competitive advantage, and the competitive advantage come from many aspects. One is the software.  Software that makes this consumption model -- through consumption model unlike some of the other ones that we're trying to catch up, which is more a financial engineering in many ways, understand everybody is getting into the space. but we have years of leadership here. 
And the conversation goes as simple as this. I want the cloud experience on-prem and at the edge, and we can bring that through GreenLake because it is a true cloud experience that you can consume elastically on a per unit measure that we can measure all the way to core levels and be able to automate the whole experience through our software stack, which obviously [ HPE Ezmeral ] now is becoming a very important component of that. 
And that's why Tarek made the comment earlier, as we go through the SAM end of October, we're going to give a little better disclosure of that because the software content of the ARR continues to increase. Aruba by definition, Shannon, is already all software, right? And he said that a 3 -- triple-digit growth is happening in that business because you are subscribing to get connectivity. And our platform is a cloud platform at scale because we manage now more than 1.5 million devices. 
But it's not a pool, I will say. When customers are becoming way more sophisticated about the hybrid estate, where they should host the data and whether you should run the [indiscernible], they realize that the vast majority are still on-premise and many of them will stay on-premise. It's just economics and physics. And we can deliver some experience on-prem and still give them a hybrid experience by managing the workloads and datasets outside their 4 walls. And GreenLake is absolutely resonating. And that's why you see us catering everything to GreenLake, whether it's connectivity, whether it's data services, whether it is elastic computing and more workload optimized services as we go along. 
And that's why I said earlier, this is all about acceleration on that. And between now and March, you're going to see a massive acceleration and that's why it's my #1 priority. And by the way, as revenue is accretive from a gross margin perspective. So Tarek, do you want to talk about that?"

So Shannon, what I would say is if you refer back to Slide 5 of our investor presentation, we showed you the stack of revenue that composes our ARR, right? So our GreenLake revenue is across all segments, so Compute, HPC/MCS, Storage, Aruba and also HPE FS, as you can infer from that slide. And the more we drive GreenLake by way of software, the more accretive it is to the overall gross margin of the company, that's a key lever to drive gross margin moving forward. 
We're driving gross margin across every single stream lane through the revenue mix and across also that revenue mix horizontally by way of pivoting the company to become an as-a-Service. So far,  what I could tell you is that the GreenLake gross margin is substantially higher than the average gross margin of the company that we posted today. And we look forward, Antonio and I to update you and every other member of the analyst community at our virtual SAM event in October, highlighting to you where we see the ARR growing and its mix by segment moving forward.

And for those of you who attended our virtual Security Analyst Meeting last month, thank you. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss how our edge-to-cloud strategy position us to capture an expanded market opportunity and accelerate shareholder value creation. 
HPE ended fiscal year 2021 with strong momentum. Customers are responding to our edge-to-cloud value proposition as evidenced by the record demand for our solutions. Demand accelerated in the second half of the year, driving fiscal year 2021 orders growth of 16% year-over-year. Revenue of $27.8 billion in fiscal year '21 grew in line with our long-term outlook, up 1% year-over-year. 
In fiscal year 2021, we executed very well, which enabled us to exceed our commitments across all financial metrics, even with a substantial order backlog. Our as-a-Service annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, of $796 million was up 36% year-over-year. We significantly improved our gross and operating margins, which increased our fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP operating profit by 25% year-over-year. 
We delivered fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.96, up 27% year-over-year. And we generated the fiscal year 2021 free cash flow of $1.6 billion, up $1 billion year-over-year, which translates to growth of 177%. This was a very strong performance, and it was particularly impressive against the backdrop of industry-wide supply constraints, which continue to challenge our ability to convert orders to revenue as quickly as we would like. 
We have a world-class global operations team that continues to work closely with a long-standing diverse network of suppliers. We continue to take proactive inventory measures to better position us to deliver against this robust customer demand. 
Our results in Q4 strengthened the momentum we have as we enter fiscal year '22. Increased demand in the quarter drove orders growth of 28% year-over-year, with particular strength in our as-a-Service orders, which grew an impressive 114% year-over-year, including a large network as-a-Service win. 
We also saw record levels of orders in key growth areas, including Intelligent Edge, High Performance Computing & Artificial Intelligence businesses. We delivered $7.4 billion in total Q4 revenue, which was up 7% sequentially and above normal sequential seasonality. We expanded our gross and operating margins, increasing our Q4 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share by 27% year-over-year. And we generated Q4 free cash flow of $94 million, in line with the outlook we provided at the end of Q3. 
Tarek will take you through our quarterly results in detail, but I would like to spend a little more time putting a full fiscal year in context for you. Our fiscal year 2021 results proved the relevance of our strategy to customers and the traction of our transformation to become the S2 cloud company. As we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, HPE is at the center of several compelling megatrends: the explosion of data at the edge, the mandate for a cloud experience everywhere and the need to extract value from data to generate insights. 
HPE is differentiated edge-to-cloud strategy uniquely positions us to capitalize on these trends and capture growing profitable markets. Our solutions and services help customers overcome the challenges of multi-generation IT and enable them to access, control and maximize the value of all their workloads and data everywhere. 
We are executing with focus and speed to deliver against our vision and strategy. We are making strategic investments and taking deliberate steps to continue to shift our business. And as I have said previously, this transformation is my #1 priority, and I'm proud of the progress we have made in fiscal year '21. 
Our Intelligent Edge business grew fiscal year '21 revenue 13% year-over-year with orders exceeding, for the first time, $4 billion. Customer demand was up strong double digits year-over-year as more customers look for ways to create new digital experiences at the edge and capitalize on the data generated there. But the industry-wide component shortages kept us for converting our full order momentum to revenue in Q4, and we enter fiscal year 2022 with record levels of backlog. 
Our market leadership at the edge remained very strong. HPE was positioned as the leader in -- one of the leaders in the Magic Quadrant Gartner provides for wireless access network edge infrastructure which is notable because HP is only one of the 2 companies to be positioned in the Leader Quadrant 4 years in a row. 
We continue to drive strong innovation in this business. In Q4, we introduced the industry-first distributed services switch which brings software-defined services and security right to where the data is created in process. Developed in partnership with Pensando, this solution eliminates legacy appliances and whole software needed to build the hybrid cloud demand demanded by modern applications and IT organizations. 
In Q4, we closed the largest network as-a-Service deal in HP history to help a large U.S. retailer enhance its customer and employee experience throughout the stores. In addition, the Major League soccer franchise FC Cincinnati standardized on Aruba at the TQL Stadium to deliver next-generation digital cashless, counterless fund and event experiences. The franchise deployed an end-to-end Aruba Edge Services platform network at its new 26,000 seats stadium to power this game day and special event experiences. 
Orders of HPE's High Performance Compute & AI offerings were also up strong double digits year-over-year. This record level of demand has generated an order book of awarded contracts now at $2.7 billion, excluding the important $2 billion win with the U.S. National Security Agency. HPE expanded our #1 market position in HPC with 37% market share as of calendar Q2 data, which is more than 14 points above the closest competitor. And according to the list of the top 500 supercomputers released just 2 weeks ago, 33 of the top 100 most powerful supercomputers in the world were built by HPE. This is more than any company. 
At the end of Q4, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center in at Berkeley Lab accepted the first phase of the promoter supercomputer. Powered by the HPE Cray EX system, Bermuda introduced a new generation of supercomputing capabilities to more than 8,000 scientists performing research for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science. 
HPE is uniquely positioned to bring the AI, deep learning and data analytics capabilities of our most advanced supercomputers to mainstream enterprises through the HPE GreenLake platform. In Q4, we announced that ENI, a global energy company selected HP GreenLake to upgrade its existing HPE supercomputer. Through HPE GreenLake, ENI can accelerate discover -- discovery of new energy sources with more accurate modeling and simulations as well as become more sustainable by monitor utilization and energy consumption within an as-a-Service solution. 
We continue to strengthen our Compute and Storage businesses where we saw strong orders and profitability in fiscal year 2021. In Compute, orders increased more than 10% in fiscal year '21 and we delivered operating margins of 10.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. We are making bold moves to transform our Storage business into a cloud-native data services business, which resulted in a high single-digit order growth and gross margin expansion, up 130 basis points year-over-year. 
And we continue to see high services attach rate, helping enable HP Pointnext orders to increase mid-single digits in fiscal year '21. This contributed to the overall performance of HPE Pointnext, which ended fiscal year '21 with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 of revenues, highlighting the potential for future revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond. 
In fiscal year 2021, we generated a strong momentum in our transformation to an as-a-Service company. Our company as-a-Service orders increased 61% year-over-year, with HPE GreenLake orders increasing 46% year-over-year. Our as-a-Service annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, of $796 million was up 36% year-over-year. The growth of our ARR is particularly noteworthy because this recurring revenue stream is high quality and high margin. During our Security Analyst Meeting last month, Tarek shared that more than 60% of our ARR mix is software and services, and we believe that portion will grow to more than 3/4 in the next 3 years. Our ARR gross margins are well above our corporate average gross margins today and the addition of high-value software content will drive margins even higher. 
Our pivot to an as-a-Service company is enabled by HPE Financial Services, which increased fiscal year 2021 financing volume 3% year-over-year driven by strong growth within HPE GreenLake. We continue to advance our leadership in our HP GreenLake offering. In September, we introduced HP GreenLake for data protection, which are cloud services designed to protect data across edge-to-cloud overcome brands of war attacks and deliver rapid data recovery. This new set of solutions marks our entry into the growing data protection as-a-Service market. Our acquisition of Zerto enabled us to add market-leading data protection to our cloud services portfolio to help enterprises take cyber threats and ransomware attacks head on. 
We also launched HP GreenLake for data analytics, which includes the industry-first, unified modern hybrid analytics and data lake platform. This strategically important solution positions HPE in the growing Unifi analytics market and helps customers accelerate modernization initiatives for all data across edge-to-cloud. 
We continue to see incredible response to our HP GreenLake offering. We added more than 300 new GreenLake customers during fiscal year '21, bringing our customer count to more than 1,250. New GreenLake logos represent an increasing share of orders with approximately 1/4 of Q4 GreenLake orders coming from new customers. Today, more than 900 partners sell HPE GreenLake, one of the largest partner of ecosystems selling as-a-Service offerings in the industry. We added more than $1.5 billion of GreenLake total contract value over the last year, bringing the total to more than $5.7 billion. 
Examples of new GreenLake logos includes family estates, the second largest family-owned winery in the world which adopted HPE GreenLake through our channel partner PKA technologies to add flexibility and scale its capacity to meet the increasing demand of automation. The HPE GreenLake solution powers the one in this automated warehouse, where approximately 60 different types of wines that produce mobile package and prepare for shipping while reducing overall IT costs. 
We also won a deal with ONGC, India's largest oil and natural gas company, which is used in the HP GreenLake platform to make one of the largest SAP implementations in the world more manageable and flexible. Our Q4 rounded out an impressive year for HPE and I'm proud of all we've had accomplished. We have made incredible progress in transforming to become the edge-to-cloud leader, executing on our strategy to help customers in truly differentiated ways and position ourselves for sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. 
At the same time, we have advanced our ESG initiatives, which in Q4 earned us a position on a highly competitive Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, placing in the 98 percentile. We exceeded our commitments in fiscal year '21, and our momentum is strong as we enter fiscal year '22 with a strategy more relevant to customers than ever before and a sharp focus on execution. 
With that, I will turn it over to Tarek to share additional details about the quarter. Tarek, over to you."

I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. And as usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter.",2307,"Thank you very much, Antonio. 
I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. And as usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key fiscal year '21 highlights on Slides 1 and 2, so now let me discuss our Q4 performance, starting with Slide 3. 
I am very pleased to report that we continue to see unprecedented demand across all our businesses with robust order growth up 28% year-over-year. Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q4 revenues of $7.4 billion, up 7% from the prior quarter above normal sequential seasonality and this despite increased supply chain challenges that we foreshadowed at SAM last month. It's also worth highlighting that $7.4 billion of revenue represents the highest level since Q1 of fiscal year '19, well before the pandemic. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 33%, which was up 230 basis points from the prior year. And this was driven by our deliberate actions to shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings, strong pricing discipline and cost takeout. As previously indicated, gross margins were pressured from prior quarter levels due to an increasing industry-wide shortages of certain components that have resulted in extended lead times and higher commodity costs underpinning backlogged orders. 
We continue to take proactive inventory measures and display healthy price discipline to minimize the impact of recent disruptions. We expect this dynamic supply chain situation to last well into calendar year 2022. 
We also continue to invest in high gross margin-rich areas of our portfolio. We've made investments in our overall go-to-market to accelerate our growth and our shift to an as-a-Service model. Even with these investments, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.7%, up 120 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 16% year-over-year increase in operating profit. 
Within other income and expense, we benefited from further strong gains related to increased valuations in our venture portfolio, an outstanding operational performance in HPC that I will address in more detail later. With strong execution across the business, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, up 27% from the prior year and at the high end of our outlook range for Q4. 
Excluding $2.2 billion of after-tax proceeds received from Oracle satisfaction of the judgment in the Itanium litigation, Q4 cash flow from operations was $784 million, and free cash flow was $94 million. For fiscal year '21, this brings our total cash flow from operations to $3.7 billion, up $1.5 billion from the prior year, and our free cash flow to $1.6 billion, up $1 billion from the prior year driven primarily by an increase in earnings. Our strong execution and cost optimization and resource allocation program has effectively put us 1 year ahead of schedule with respect to delivering our previous free cash flow targets. 
Finally, the strength of our cash flow has positioned us to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $157 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q1 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in January. We also reinstated our share repurchase program in Q4 buying $213 million in shares, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation and our view that the stock is undervalued. 
Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our accelerating as-a-Service business. We have made significant progress over the last year by adding over 300 new enterprise GreenLake customers to over 1,250 today and increasing our TCV by over $1.5 billion to our current lifetime TCV of over $5.7 billion. 
For Q4 specifically, our ARR was $796 million, which was up 36% year-over-year as reported and total as-a-Service orders were up 114% year-over-year, which represents an acceleration from Q3, demonstrating the strong momentum we are experiencing in this business. 
It's also important to remember the incremental disclosure we provided at SAM 2021, highlighting the significant proportion of software and services in our offerings that together make up more than 60% of the ARR mix today. We expect this mix percentage to expand to more than 75% by fiscal year '24 as we add more software capabilities driving further gross margin improvement. Overall, based on strong momentum this year, I'm very happy with how this business is progressing, which gives us confidence to increase our ARR growth targets by 5 points to a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year '21 to fiscal year '24. 
Let's now turn to our segment highlights on Slide 5. Our growth businesses, which now represent nearly 25% of our total company revenue, generated record levels of orders, up strong double digits. In the Intelligent Edge, revenue grew 2% year-over-year in Q4 and for fiscal year '21 was up 13%. Demand continued unabated in Q4 with order growth up over 50% year-over-year, but the component shortages we foreshadowed at SAM were more pronounced in our Aruba business. 
Additionally, our edge as-a-Service offerings were up trip triple digits year-over-year, significantly contributing to our ARR. We delivered a multimillion-dollar NaaS, Network-as-a-Service deal in Q4 for a large U.S. customer which represented more than 800 basis points headwind in the short term to Aruba revenue in Q4, but will help our long-term financial profile in the business. 
Aruba Services also continued to grow strongly, up high single digits. Looking forward, we expect it will take some time for supply chain challenges to ease, but we finished fiscal year '21 with over $4 billion in orders which will give us strong momentum through fiscal year '22. 
In HPC & AI, demand strengthened even further with another record level of orders. Revenue grew 35% sequentially and was flat year-over-year with a difficult compare. We did have customer acceptances of some large contracts get pushed out into fiscal year '22. And we now have $2.7 billion of awarded contracts in addition to the $2 billion contract awarded by the NSA, giving us confidence for next year and beyond. We expect robust revenue growth in fiscal year '22 to get us back within the range of our original long-term 8% to 12% CAGR outlook. 
In Compute, order growth was up strong double digits. Revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting above normal sequential seasonality and was up double digits year-over-year when normalizing for the Q4 FY '20 backlog. Operating margins of 9.4% were up 280 basis points from prior year due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. 
Within Storage, order growth accelerated and was up double digits year-over-year. Revenue grew 2% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter ahead of normal sequential seasonality driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. All-flash arrays grew 7% year-over-year, led by Primera, up strong double digits. Nimble grew 4% year-over-year with ongoing strong dHCI momentum, growing double digits year-over-year. Storage operating profit margin was 13.8%, reflecting OpEx investments to continue driving product mix shift towards more software-rich platforms, including our cloud data services. 
With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, orders accelerated and were up high single digits in Q4 and up mid-single digits for fiscal year '21. Most importantly, revenue also grew as reported overall for fiscal year '21, the first time in several years. This is, again, very important as we enter fiscal year '22 with strong momentum in our most profitable business. 
Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 18% year-over-year, driven by strong double-digit growth in GreenLake. Revenue was up 3% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Our profitability is also benefiting from higher residual values realization and lower borrowing costs as we continue to securitize our U.S. portfolio via the ABS market. Our operating margin was 14.1%, up 630 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 23.8% is well above the 18% plus target set at SAM 2021. 
Slide 6 highlights our revenue and EPS performance where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year and sustained momentum throughout fiscal year '21. As mentioned previously, Q4 revenue of $7.4 billion is the highest level we've delivered since Q1 '19. With a strong demand environment, our strategic business mix shift and execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we increased our Q4 non-GAAP EPS to $0.52, up 27% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 7. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q4 of 33%. While rates were impacted as expected sequentially from the supply chain challenges previously discussed, we expanded gross margins up 230 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses. In total, in fiscal year '21, we delivered nearly $900 million of incremental gross profit. 
Moving forward, we will face lingering supply chain challenges in the near term, but longer term, structural gross margins will improve from continuous mix shift towards the intelligent edge or IP storage Green Lake and all of our as-a-Service offerings. 
Moving to Slide 8. You can see we have utilized some of the incremental gross profit to make targeted growth investments while simultaneously expanding non-GAAP operating profit margins. We have increased our investment levels in R&D to fuel our long-term innovation engine and still selling costs to accelerate our growth and higher shift to our as-a-Service pivot. 
Even with these investments to drive long-term growth, we delivered operating margins in Q4 of 9.7%, up 120 basis points from the prior year. On Slide 9, we want to highlight our unique setup in China through our investment in HPC that has and continues to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. Our investment and commercial agreement gives us a route-to-market in the second largest, fastest-growing IT market in the world. 
As you know, we do not consolidate revenue and operating profit from HPC but recognize our 49% share of HPC's earnings through the equity interest statement line on our P&L as part of other income and expense. 
HPC has delivered outstanding operational performance throughout the year and generated $257 million of equity interest in fiscal year '21, which was up 21% from the prior year. This makes our business in China a very large contributor to our P&L, one that no other multinational has been able to replicate. 
Turning to Slide 10. We finished fiscal year '21 generating $3.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.6 billion of free cash flow, and this excluding, obviously, the $2.2 billion of after-tax, cash received from Oracle satisfaction of the Itanium litigation. 
Free cash flow was up $1 billion year-over-year and is $600 million more than the midpoint of our outlook at the start of fiscal year '20, primarily driven by increased earnings. Our cash flow profile is becoming more predictable and aligned to profitability as our restructuring costs diminish, and we grow our as-a-Service business beginning to recognize more deferred revenues from software and services. 
Moving on to Slide 11. We have made further progress in enhancing our balance sheet strength with a strong free cash flow and payment from Oracle. Following the receipt of the cash from the Itanium litigation, we redeemed early our $1 billion 4.65% coupon outstanding 2024 notes and this in a positive NPV transaction that is net debt-neutral. The premium paid was a GAAP-only expense in Q4, and we will realize meaningful interest expense savings over the next 3 years. We are now in an operating company net cash position of $1.8 billion. 
Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensure we have ample liquidity available to balance long-term growth investments with consistent return of capital to our shareholders. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 12. At our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, we provided our outlook for fiscal year '22, and I would like to encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. Having said that, let me reiterate the drill down into a few key components. 
We expect fiscal year '22 revenue growth in constant currency of 3% to 4%. As discussed, the supply chain environment remains very dynamic, and we expect component shortages with increased commodity costs, expedite and shipping fees to last for the next few quarters impacting near-term revenue and gross margins. 
In a nutshell, we expect to have more of a back-end loaded year in fiscal year '22 with the supply chain risk that we discussed reflected in our fiscal year '22 guidance. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $1.96 to $2.10 and free cash flow to be $1.8 billion to $2 billion. We expect free cash flow to be more in line with historical seasonality where the second half is a stronger generator of cash than the first half. 
Now specific to Q1 revenue, given the very strong backlog balanced by supply chain constraints, we expect revenue to be in line with normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q4 of fiscal year '21 and are comfortable with current consensus levels. We also expect gross margins to be pressured in the short term given supply chain. As a result, for Q1 '22, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.19 to $0.27 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.42 to $0.50. 
So overall, I'm very proud of our progress throughout a strong fiscal year '21. As Antonio said, we exceeded all our key financial targets in fiscal year '21, often by a significant margin. The demand environment has been incredibly strong across our business with acceleration in the second half of fiscal year '21 and demonstrating that our edge-to-cloud strategy is working well and that we are entering fiscal year '22 with strong momentum. We are now well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us and deliver against our fiscal year '22 outlook. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions."

Listen, we are super proud of the momentum we have in the market with HPE GreenLake. We believe it's truly differentiated in the market. And as we show you some 2/3 of that is already in the software and services, and we believe in 3 years, will be more than 75% of it, which obviously come with high margin and more durable revenue in many ways. 
What customers like about the model is the ability to procure everything from H to cloud from one integrated platform. And it's not just what I call Infrastructure as a Service or Hardware as a Service on premises in a colo or at the edge is the fact that they can consume anything from network as-a-Service, subscription to Aruba products to what I call private cloud to data services, which is part of the transformation we are driving in our storage portfolio. 
And as we said, $5.7 billion already in total contract value and in Q4, the growth was accelerated by a number of new logos, which again, we added 300 in fiscal year '21 which drove the order growth to 114%, okay? So when you think about this, we have been delivering 40, 50, 60 and in Q4 was 114%. And Aruba is one key component of that. But what we see now, Shannon, is also the Storage part of the is growing very rapidly. And that's why I'm excited about next year because we're also adding new capabilities to that platform, particularly in the early part of 2022. 
So overall, I will say this has been a home run. We believe we have years of advantage. We are disclosing all our numbers, as you see, versus some of our competitors are not sharing anything as far as I can see. And what I'm really pleased is that we have now 900 partners selling with us, co-selling, and you will see their offers in our platform here soon because that's the way we drive, fully push from both sides, direct and indirect. So Tarek, do you want to talk about the modeling?"

So first and foremost is one -- the first -- this first and largest network as-a-Service contract contributed to orders in Q4 substantially, but did not contribute to the ARR because the revenue will be recognized over time. But notwithstanding that, the ARR, if you really look at our ARR progression after quarter in fiscal year '21, it's outstanding. We did $649 million in Q1 of ARR, grew that to $678 million in Q2, $705 million in Q3 and now approaching $800 million, $796 million to be precise in Q4. 
So the momentum in this business is extremely strong, and there isn't a particular business unit that is contributing. We're executing an integrated strategy that is about edge, cloud and data. Right now, the main contributors are the various parts of the organization that fit these 3 pillars. Aruba is one of them. The Storage business unit is another one. We will also continue to expand our as-a-service offerings in HPC and AI because we see a tremendous opportunity there. And the future will tell us how big that opportunity will be for us. But we firmly believe in it."

Well, I mean, if you look at our results, right, once -- right, so we grew orders. Total company orders 16% year-over-year, but our revenue in actual dollars was up 3%. Obviously, there is a big divergence there between 16% and 3%, right? And that's",537,"Sure. Well, I mean, if you look at our results, right, once -- right, so we grew orders. Total company orders 16% year-over-year, but our revenue in actual dollars was up 3%. Obviously, there is a big divergence there between 16% and 3%, right? And that's driven by the supply availability. Despite the fact that we continue, I think, do a great job navigating through the challenge. And the one area I'm really particularly pleased, one say is the fact that linearity in the business in the way we approach customers that book orders is now more front end and back end in the quarter itself. 
I always talk about quarters having 13 weeks and what is amazing to me in the last couple of quarters, the bookings have been more on the front end than the back end, which allows us, actually. It's a little bit counterintuitive if you think about it. The more orders are -- bring early on, the more I can convert despite the supply chain challenges because I have more time and more velocity, if you will. 
So listen, as Tarek said, and I said in my remarks, short term, we're going to continue to navigate. This is an industry-wide challenge. But we're very confident with the actions we are taking ourselves. And the fact of the matter is that, that backlog is very durable. People asked me early on, have you seen cancellation? I can tell you right now, 0, no cancellations whatsoever. And the orders coming in every day, every week is incredibly strong. 
So we have to navigate the next quarter or 2. And then based on our understanding and the work we have done with our suppliers, the second half will be better. And then also remember, we have I think, world-class capabilities, both on the supply chain operations and our engineering capabilities to be able to adjust components based on the bond. And then also, remember, a big chunk of the backlog is related to acceptances in the customer base with HPC, which is already built and shipped. 
But as you know, we cannot recognize revenue until fully accepted. This quarter, we recognized a customer, which had a large order in HPC. But remember, in 2022, we have the large exascale deals and one of them is going to be very important for us as we think about the back half of the year. So that's why Tarek and I are very confident in that 3% to 4% guidance. And let's remind ourselves in the 3% to 4% guidance, we have 1 to 1.5 points of headwind because of the transition towards as a Service, right, which is great, is durable is long-term growth. And so you normalize for that, it's more like 5% to 5.5%, if you will. And then on top of that, you have to add the currency, which obviously is a headwind in the sense that the 3% to 4% is constant currency. So if you are all of that, we are more than like in the 7% to 8% growth. And remember that Q4 was a $7.4 billion, the largest quarter despite the supply chain going all the way back to 2019."

But on the same time, we should not underestimate the power of our portfolio because I got this question earlier on, you take this double-bookings? Perhaps in the commodity space, but not on the value space. We believe Aruba is unique and differentiated. This is not something you can swap by somebody else. And that business, it's a true mobile-first cloud-native approach, which drives a unique experience at the edge. And that's -- the momentum has happened for a number of quarters now despite the short-term challenge of supply. 
HPC, we are the clear #1 leader with 35% market share and 14 points advantage against the second competitor. And then the supercomputer, I don't think there's anybody that can match us. 35% of the top 100 supercomputers are all back and enterprise, and we're going to deliver the extra scale in '22. And Green Lake, again, the question about GreenLake is a true hybrid differentiated offerings from edge to cloud. And I think that has been in the making now for a number of years, and the pipeline is just amazing to me. 
And now we are getting better and better in closing deals faster and deploying the solution, which, remember, it's not just deploying it, it's also driving usage. And so it's a combination of growth in the current installed base and new logos, which I commented 300 new logos. So we believe there may be some in the commodity space, but the rest is because of our edge-to-cloud offering, which is resonating in the market, and we believe that's going to accelerate in 2022."

So in terms of customer segments, the demand remains very strong across the board and large enterprise customers, SaaS companies, telcos, and we see very robust demand from all these customers.

So in terms of customer segments, the demand remains very strong across the board and large enterprise customers, SaaS companies, telcos, and we see very robust demand from all these customers. With respect to unit growth, units have been roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, but the right comparison is a normalized year-over-year comparison. If you normalize for Q4 '20 units that were sold, but for orders that were generated in Q1 and Q2, you remember the dynamics of fiscal year '20, units have grown 13% Q4 '21 over normalized Q4 '20. Which is an excellent result for us. We're very pleased with it. 
And this comes together with very strong disciplines from our management team there in the compute space. We've executed a number of price increases ahead of price hikes of commodities and logistics costs coming up by way of expedite fees and container costs that have been rising quite dramatically, as you know. The AUP have risen overall at about 3%. When you think about this on a normalized basis, and we feel pretty good about our performance in Compute, both on the P, the price and the quantity. 
We feel that there is still strong demand moving forward, particularly in fiscal year '22 with the order book that we have been able to generate and the backlog that we have in that segment. But that comment that I just made is true and very true for Aruba where we feel a very strong order demand in Aruba and also in storage. So we feel pretty good about fiscal year '22, as Antonio commented a moment ago."

So first of all, our compute orders were up more than 10% in 2021. Our units normalized for -- remember, the 2020 backlog, if you remember, when the COVID started, we had a $750 million backlog which we cleared $500 million in Q3 2020 and $250 million in Q4. When you normalize for that, units are up. Obviously, AUPs are up for 2 reasons: number one, cost; and number two, structural changes. As we introduce the next generation of our Compute platform, call it, Gen 10 and 1, 5, and 11 you're going to see more options and more density in those platform, which drives structural changes, which are -- we believe those structural changes are sustainable, irrespective of the changes of the commodity cost. 
And then if you listen to what we said in 2020 and 2021 are pivot to different segments of the market, we said we want to focus on growing segments of the market, while enterprise is still super important. SaaS, Telco and Edge are 3 growing markets where we have been benefit from. Telco obviously, with a 5G deployment, our Intelligent Edge Solutions at the Edge particularly in retail, manufacturing and hospitality. And then obviously, the focus on the SaaS, which is not the big cloud providers, but Software-as-a-Service companies, which are driving quite significant growth. 
And then we have our own value of built into the platform with silicon roto trust and manageability. And all of this, by the way, is all now being delivered to HPE GreenLake as well. So GreenLake is a force multiplier for the growth in compute because the more we sell as-a-Service, the more recurring revenue and compute we're going to have over time. So I hope that answers the question."

So Katy, the most important comment I would make to you with respect to orders is that the acceleration of orders manifested itself very strongly in the second half of fiscal year '21.

So Katy, the most important comment I would make to you with respect to orders is that the acceleration of orders manifested itself very strongly in the second half of fiscal year '21. And it's continuing from here on, the demand remains very strong. We're getting orders every day, and the linearity is better even this quarter than it was in the prior quarter last year. 
The trough for our business was hit in the second quarter of 2020 ever since revenue has been edging up. And we're now at a point in Q4 '21, where we hit the revenue that is at the high watermark that is on the par with the first quarter of fiscal year '19 roughly. We do see the acceleration of the revenue growth year-over-year manifesting itself on a full year basis. But timing-wise, we did say in my script and hopefully, it was understood that the fiscal year '22 is going to be back-end loaded. 
Why is that? It's because we still have to navigate supply chain constraints and those supply chain constraints are probably not going to abate before the end of fiscal year '22 and most likely calendar year '22. Specifically for Q1, we're comfortable with current consensus levels on revenue and which also imply, as I said in my script, a seasonal decline of mid-single digits. But when you really look at the overall trend, year-over-year from now on, we do expect an acceleration of revenue that will be dampened a little bit by supply chain constraint that we're navigating day after day, month after month and quarter after quarter."

Now as you can imagine, I spend a lot of time with our global supply team driving the day-to-day operations with Tarek here. And obviously, we have to move at the first 2 quarters of the year. 
But I feel pretty good about accelerating that in the back half, a combination of supply availability and customer acceptances. But again, when you normalize the growth for everything I said earlier to, which is including the as-a-Service pivot, you should think about not 3 to 4 but more like 6 to 7 because that's the way we should think about it. And then in that, Remember, the growth of the ARR is going to continue to accelerate 35% to 45%. And hopefully, in 2022, we're going to get the credit for the transformation we drive in this business."

And then, Antonio, I want to touch this with you, which is you've talked a fair bit about the conviction in the orders that you have and how good they are and I think you've said about a lack of cancellation being a pretty big driver for it, therefore your confidence.

So Amit, as we shared in our scripts, we signed a very substantial Network-as-a-Service contract for the first time with a large U.S. retailer. And this had a headwind on revenue growth in Aruba of about 800 basis points and a headwind on operating margins of about 500 basis points. So if you were to normalize for it, you still realize -- you would realize that the double-digit growth in Aruba and high-teens margins are still there. And we're very comfortable they're there for us. 
Aruba is a 40% business, meaning we do see the top line growth to be in the high teens and the margins to be in the high teens as well, approaching a sum of 40% overall. Nothing has changed. We feel very comfortable, particularly knowing that the order book remains very strong. If anything, there was one part of our company that suffered a little bit more of supply chain constraints in Q4, it is Aruba. But it's just simply deferring revenue that could have been realized in Q4 into Q1 and Q2 of fiscal year '22. The order story remains incredibly strong, and the demand there is super solid.

I remember when I acquired Aruba in 2015 and then we merged it with the rest of HPE business, it was in the high 2s. Now we are $4 billion. And we, again, to Tarek's point, we believe this business is going to continue to grow double digits. We obviously have to think about this business long-term growth, particularly as we pivot more as-a-Service because the network as a service is a nascent market, but the subscription side is actually a growing and more established markets. 
So remember, there's 2 different value proposition here. I subscribed to a WiFi connectivity or a LAN port. That's today the triple-digit growth that Tarek talked early on, on the as-a-Service side. And then there is the nascent Network-as-a-Service, which the hardware component of that is totally deferred over the length of the contract. And when you have an excess of a $100-plus million deal, obviously, that has a huge impact. 
But it's good for the long-term durability, and that's why we are very bullish about this business. And listen, as I said earlier to Katy, we believe over time, this is going to alleviate the supply, and we're going to convert more of that.

We said we would be attaining $1.8 billion to $2 billion of free cash flow in fiscal year '22. And the increase in inventory is factored into the guidance. 
The guidance is more attained on free cash flow by way of earnings growth, number one. Number two, also by reduction of restructuring costs as our restructuring programs are winding down. And then yes, there is a bit of an offset headwind from inventory increases, but it's absolutely fine.

And for those of you who attended our virtual Security Analyst Meeting last month, thank you. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss how our edge-to-cloud strategy position us to capture an expanded market opportunity and accelerate shareholder value creation.  
HPE ended fiscal year 2021 with strong momentum. Customers are responding to our edge-to-cloud value proposition as evidenced by the record demand for our solutions. Demand accelerated in the second half of the year, driving fiscal year 2021 orders growth of 16% year-over-year. Revenue of $27.8 billion in fiscal year '21 grew in line with our long-term outlook, up 1% year-over-year.
In fiscal year 2021, we executed very well, which enable us to exceed our commitments across all financial metrics, even with a substantial order backlog. Our as a Service annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, of $796 million was up 36% year-over-year. We significantly improved our gross and operating margins, which increased our fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP operating profit by 25% year-over-year.
We delivered fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.96, up 27% year-over-year. And we generated fiscal year 2021 free cash flow of $1.6 billion, up $1 billion year-over-year, which translates to growth of 177%. This was a very strong performance, and it was particularly impressive against the backdrop of industry-wide supply constraints, which continued to challenge our ability to convert orders to revenue as quickly as we would like.  
We have a world-class global operations team that continues to work closely with our long-standing diverse network of suppliers. We continue to take proactive inventory measures to better position us to deliver against this robust customer demand.  
Our results in Q4 strengthened the momentum we have as we enter fiscal year '22. Increased demand in the quarter drove orders growth of 28% year-over-year, with particular strength in our as a Service orders, which grew an impressive 114% year-over-year, including a large Network as a Service win.
We also saw record levels of orders in key growth areas, including Intelligent Edge, High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence businesses. We delivered $7.4 billion in total Q4 revenue, which was up 7% sequentially and above normal sequential seasonality. We expanded our gross and operating margins, increasing our Q4 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share by 27% year-over-year. And we generated Q4 free cash flow of $94 million, in line with the outlook we provided at the end of Q3.  
Tarek will take you through our quarterly results in detail, but I would like to spend a little more time putting a full fiscal year in context for you. Our fiscal year 2021 results proved the relevance of our strategy to customers and the traction of our transformation to become the S2 cloud company. As we discussed at our Security Analyst Meeting last month, HPE is at the center of several compelling megatrends: the explosion of data at the edge, the mandate for a cloud experience everywhere and the need to extract value from data to generate insights.  
HPE is differentiated edge-to-cloud strategy uniquely position us to capitalize on these trends and capture growing profitable markets. Our solutions and services help customers overcome the challenges of multi-generation IT and enable them to access, control and maximize the value of all their workloads and data everywhere.
We are executing with focus and speed to deliver against our vision and strategy. We are making strategic investments and taking deliberate steps to continue to shift our business. And as I have said previously, this transformation is my #1 priority, and I'm proud of the progress we have made in fiscal year '21.  
Our Intelligent Edge business grew fiscal year '21 revenue 13% year-over-year with orders exceeding, for the first time, $4 billion. Customer demand was up strong double digits year-over-year as more customers look for ways to create new digital experiences at the edge and capitalize on the data generated there. But the industry-wide component shortages kept us from converting our full order momentum to revenue in Q4, and we enter fiscal year 2022 with record levels of backlog.
Our market leadership at the edge remained very strong. HPE was positioned as the leader in -- one of the leaders in the Magic Quadrant Gartner provides for wireless access network edge infrastructure, which is notable because HP is only one of the 2 companies to be positioned in the Leader Quadrant 4 years in a row.
We continue to drive strong innovation in this business. In Q4, we introduced the industry-first distributed services switch, which brings software-defined services and security right to where the data is created in process. Developed in partnership with Pensando, this solution eliminates legacy appliances and whole software needed to build the hybrid cloud demand, demanded by modern applications and IT organizations.
In Q4, we closed the largest Network as a Service deal in HP history to help a large U.S. retailer enhance its customer and employee experience throughout the stores. In addition, the Major League Soccer franchise FC Cincinnati standardized on Aruba at the TQL Stadium to deliver next-generation digital cashless, counterless fun and event experiences. The franchise deployed an end-to-end Aruba Edge Services Platform network at its new 26,000 seats stadium to power this game day and special event experiences.  
Orders of HPE's High Performance Compute & AI offerings were also up strong double digits year-over-year. This record level of demand has generated an order book of awarded contracts now at $2.7 billion, excluding the important $2 billion win with the U.S. National Security Agency. 
HPE expanded our #1 market position in HPC with 37% market share as of calendar Q2 data, which is more than 14 points above the closest competitor. And according to the list of the top 500 supercomputers released just 2 weeks ago, 33 of the top 100 most powerful supercomputers in the world were built by HPE. This is more than any company.
At the end of Q4, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, NERSC, at Berkeley's Lab accepted the first phase of the promoter supercomputer. Powered by the HPE Cray EX system, [ our model ] introduced a new generation of supercomputing capabilities to more than 8,000 scientists performing research for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.  
HPE is uniquely positioned to bring the AI, deep learning and data analytics capabilities of our most advanced supercomputers to mainstream enterprises through the HPE GreenLake platform. In Q4, we announced that Eni, a global energy company, selected HP GreenLake to upgrade its existing HPE supercomputer. Through HPE GreenLake, Eni can accelerate discover -- discovery of new energy sources with more accurate modeling and simulations as well as become more sustainable by monitored utilization and energy consumption within an as a Service solution.  
We continue to strengthen our Compute and Storage businesses where we saw strong orders and profitability in fiscal year 2021. In Compute, orders increased more than 10% in fiscal year '21 and we delivered operating margins of 10.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. We are making bold moves to transform our Storage business into a cloud-native data services business, which resulted in a high single-digit order growth and gross margin expansion, up 130 basis points year-over-year.  
And we continue to see high services attach rate, helping enable HP Pointnext orders to increase mid-single digits in fiscal year '21. This contributed to the overall performance of HPE Pointnext, which ended fiscal year '21 with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 of revenues, highlighting the potential for future revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond.
In fiscal year 2021, we generated strong momentum in our transformation to an as a Service company. Our company as a Service orders increased 61% year-over-year, with HPE GreenLake orders increasing 46% year-over-year. Our as a Service annualized revenue run rate or ARR of $796 million was up 36% year-over-year. 
The growth of our ARR is particularly noteworthy because this recurring revenue stream is high-quality and high-margin. During our Security Analyst Meeting last month, Tarek shared that more than 60% of our ARR mix is software and services, and we believe that portion will grow to more than 3/4 in the next 3 years. Our ARR gross margins are well above our corporate average gross margins today and the addition of high-value software content will drive margins even higher.  
Our pivot to an as a Service company is enabled by HPE Financial Services, which increased fiscal year 2021 financing volume 3% year-over-year driven by strong growth within HPE GreenLake. We continue to advance our leadership in our HP GreenLake offering. In September, we introduced HP GreenLake for data protection, which are cloud services designed to protect data across edge-to-cloud, overcome ransomware attacks and deliver rapid data recovery. 
This new set of solutions marks our entry into the growing data protection as a Service market. Our acquisition of Zerto enable us to add market-leading data protection to our cloud services portfolio to help enterprises take cyber threats and ransomware attacks head on.
We also launched HP GreenLake for data analytics, which includes the industry-first, unified modern hybrid analytics and data lake platform. This strategically important solution positions HPE in the growing unified analytics market and helps customers accelerate modernization initiatives for all data across edge-to-cloud.
We continue to see incredible response to our HP GreenLake offering. We added more than 300 new GreenLake customers during fiscal year '21, bringing our customer count to more than 1,250. New GreenLake logos represent an increasing share of orders with approximately 1/4 of Q4 GreenLake orders coming from new customers. 
Today, more than 900 partners sell HPE GreenLake, one of the largest partner ecosystems selling as a Service offerings in the industry. We added more than $1.5 billion of GreenLake total contract value over the last year, bringing the total to more than $5.7 billion.
Examples of new GreenLake logos includes Trinchero Family Estates, the second largest family-owned winery in the world, which adopted HPE GreenLake through our channel partner PKA Technologies to add flexibility and scale its capacity to meet the increasing demand of automation. The HPE GreenLake solution powers the winery's automated warehouse, where approximately 60 different types of wines are produced, bottled, packaged and prepared for shipping while reducing overall IT costs.
We also won a deal with ONGC, India's largest oil and natural gas company, which is using the HP GreenLake platform to make one of the largest SAP implementations in the world more manageable and flexible. Our Q4 rounded out an impressive year for HPE and I'm proud of all we have accomplished. We have made incredible progress in transforming to become the edge-to-cloud leader, executing on our strategy to help customers in truly differentiated ways and position ourselves for sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. 
At the same time, we have advanced our ESG initiatives, which in Q4 earned us a position on a highly competitive Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, placing in the 98 percentile. We exceeded our commitments in fiscal year '21, and our momentum is strong as we enter fiscal year '22 with a strategy more relevant to customers than ever before and a sharp focus on execution. 
With that, I will turn it over to Tarek to share additional details about the quarter. Tarek, over to you."

I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. And as usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. An",2323,"Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. And as usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key fiscal year '21 highlights on Slides 1 and 2, so now let me discuss our Q4 performance, starting with Slide 3. 
I am very pleased to report that we continue to see unprecedented demand across all our businesses with robust order growth up 28% year-over-year. Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q4 revenues of $7.4 billion, up 7% from the prior quarter above normal sequential seasonality and this despite increased supply chain challenges that we foreshadowed at SAM last month. It's also worth highlighting that $7.4 billion of revenue represents the highest level since Q1 of fiscal year '19, well before the pandemic. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 33%, which was up 230 basis points from the prior year. And this was driven by our deliberate actions to shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings, strong pricing discipline and cost takeout. As previously indicated, gross margins were pressured from prior quarter levels due to an increasing industry-wide shortages of certain components that have resulted in extended lead times and higher commodity costs underpinning backlogged orders. 
We continue to take proactive inventory measures and display healthy price discipline to minimize the impact of recent disruptions. We expect this dynamic supply chain situation to last well into calendar year 2022. We also continue to invest in high gross margin-rich areas of our portfolio. 
We've made investments in our overall go-to-market to accelerate our growth and our shift to an as a Service model. Even with these investments, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.7%, up 120 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 16% year-over-year increase in operating profit. 
Within other income and expense, we benefited from further strong gains related to increased valuations in our Pathfinder venture portfolio, an outstanding operational performance in HPC that I will address in more detail later. With strong execution across the business, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, up 27% from the prior year and at the high end of our outlook range for Q4.
Excluding $2.2 billion of after-tax proceeds received from Oracle satisfaction of the judgment in the Itanium litigation, Q4 cash flow from operations was $784 million, and free cash flow was $94 million. For fiscal year '21, this brings our total cash flow from operations to $3.7 billion, up $1.5 billion from the prior year, and our free cash flow to $1.6 billion, up $1 billion from the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in earnings. Our strong execution and cost optimization and resource allocation program has effectively put us 1 year ahead of schedule with respect to delivering our previous free cash flow targets.
Finally, the strength of our cash flow has positioned us to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $157 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q1 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in January. We also reinstated our share repurchase program in Q4 buying $213 million in shares, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation and our view that the stock is undervalued. 
Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our accelerating as a Service business. We have made significant progress over the last year by adding over 300 new enterprise GreenLake customers to over 1,250 today and increasing our TCV by over $1.5 billion to our current lifetime TCV of over $5.7 billion. 
For Q4 specifically, our ARR was $796 million, which was up 36% year-over-year as reported and total as a Service orders were up 114% year-over-year, which represents an acceleration from Q3, demonstrating the strong momentum we are experiencing in this business. 
It's also important to remember the incremental disclosure we provided at SAM 2021, highlighting the significant proportion of software and services in our offerings that together make up more than 60% of the ARR mix today. We expect this mix percentage to expand to more than 75% by fiscal year '24 as we add more software capabilities driving further gross margin improvement. Overall, based on strong momentum this year, I'm very happy with how this business is progressing, which gives us confidence to increase our ARR growth targets by 5 points to a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year '21 to fiscal year '24. 
Let's now turn to our segment highlights on Slide 5. Our growth businesses, which now represent nearly 25% of our total company revenue, generated record levels of orders, up strong double digits. In the Intelligent Edge, revenue grew 2% year-over-year in Q4 and for fiscal year '21 was up 13%. Demand continued unabated in Q4 with order growth up over 50% year-over-year, but the component shortages we foreshadowed at SAM were more pronounced in our Aruba business.
Additionally, our edge as a Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year, significantly contributing to our ARR. We delivered a multimillion-dollar NaaS, Network as a Service deal in Q4 for a large U.S. customer, which represented more than 800 basis points headwind in the short term to Aruba revenue in Q4, but will help our long-term financial profile in the business. 
Aruba Services also continued to grow strongly, up high single digits. Looking forward, we expect it will take some time for supply chain challenges to ease, but we finished fiscal year '21 with over $4 billion in orders which will give us strong momentum through fiscal year '22. 
In HPC and AI, demand strengthened even further with another record level of orders. Revenue grew 35% sequentially and was flat year-over-year with a difficult compare. We did have customer acceptances of some large contracts get pushed out into fiscal year '22. And we now have $2.7 billion of awarded contract in addition to the $2 billion contract awarded by the NSA, giving us confidence for next year and beyond. We expect robust revenue growth in fiscal year '22 to get us back within the range of our original long-term 8% to 12% CAGR outlook. 
In Compute, order growth was up strong double digits. Revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting above normal sequential seasonality and was up double digits year-over-year when normalizing for the Q4 FY '20 backlog. Operating margins of 9.4% were up 280 basis points from prior year due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. 
Within Storage, order growth accelerated and was up double digits year-over-year. Revenue grew 2% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter ahead of normal sequential seasonality driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. All-flash arrays grew 7% year-over-year, led by Primera, up strong double digits. Nimble grew 4% year-over-year with ongoing strong dHCI momentum, growing double digits year-over-year. Storage operating profit margin was 13.8%, reflecting OpEx investments to continue driving product mix shift towards more software-rich platforms, including our cloud data services. 
With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, orders accelerated and were up high single digits in Q4 and up mid-single digits for fiscal year '21. Most importantly, revenue also grew as reported overall for fiscal year '21, the first time in several years. This is, again, very important as we enter fiscal year '22 with strong momentum in our most profitable business.
Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 18% year-over-year, driven by strong double-digit growth in GreenLake. Revenue was up 3% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Our profitability is also benefiting from higher residual values realization and lower borrowing costs as we continue to securitize our U.S. portfolio via the ABS market. Our operating margin was 14.1%, up 630 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 23.8% is well above the 18% plus target set at SAM 2021. 
Slide 6 highlights our revenue and EPS performance, where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year and sustained momentum throughout fiscal year '21. As mentioned previously, Q4 revenue of $7.4 billion is the highest level we've delivered since Q1 '19. With a strong demand environment, our strategic business mix shift and execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we increased our Q4 non-GAAP EPS to $0.52, up 27% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 7. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q4 of 33%. While rates were impacted as expected sequentially from the supply chain challenges previously discussed, we expanded gross margins up 230 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses. In total, in fiscal year '21, we delivered nearly $900 million of incremental gross profit. 
Moving forward, we will face lingering supply chain challenges in the near term, but longer term, structural gross margins will improve from continuous mix shift towards the Intelligent Edge, all IP storage, GreenLake and all of our as a Service offerings. 
Moving to Slide 8. You can see we have utilized some of the incremental gross profit to make targeted growth investments while simultaneously expanding non-GAAP operating profit margins. We have increased our investment levels in R&D to fuel our long-term innovation engine and still selling costs to accelerate our growth and higher shift to our as a Service pivot.
Even with these investments to drive long-term growth, we delivered operating margins in Q4 of 9.7%, up 120 basis points from the prior year. On Slide 9, we want to highlight our unique setup in China through our investment in HPC that has and continues to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. Our investment and commercial agreement gives us a route-to-market in the second largest, fastest-growing IT market in the world. As you know, we do not consolidate revenue and operating profit from HPC, but recognize our 49% share of HPC's earnings through the equity interest statement line on our P&L as part of other income and expense. 
HPC has delivered outstanding operational performance throughout the year and generated $257 million of equity interest in fiscal year '21, which was up 21% from the prior year. This makes our business in China a very large contributor to our P&L, one that no other multinational has been able to replicate. 
Turning to Slide 10. We finished fiscal year '21 generating $3.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.6 billion of free cash flow, and this excluding, obviously, the $2.2 billion of after-tax, cash received from Oracle satisfaction of the Itanium litigation. 
Free cash flow was up $1 billion year-over-year and is $600 million more than the midpoint of our outlook at the start of fiscal year '20, primarily driven by increased earnings. Our cash flow profile is becoming more predictable and aligned to profitability as our restructuring costs diminish, and we grow our as a Service business beginning to recognize more deferred revenues from software and services. 
Moving on to Slide 11. We have made further progress in enhancing our balance sheet strength with a strong free cash flow and payment from Oracle. Following the receipt of the cash from the Itanium litigation, we redeemed early our $1 billion 4.65% coupon outstanding 2024 notes and this in a positive NPV transaction that is net debt-neutral. The make-whole premium paid was a GAAP-only expense in Q4, and we will realize meaningful interest expense savings over the next 3 years. 
We are now in an operating company net cash position of $1.8 billion. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensure we have ample liquidity available to balance long-term growth investments with consistent return of capital to our shareholders.
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 12. At our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, we provided our outlook for fiscal year '22, and I would like to encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. Having said that, let me reiterate the drill down into a few key components.
We expect fiscal year '22 revenue growth in constant currency of 3% to 4%. As discussed, the supply chain environment remains very dynamic, and we expect component shortages with increased commodity costs, expedite and shipping fees to last for the next few quarters impacting near-term revenue and gross margins.
In a nutshell, we expect to have more of a back-end loaded year in fiscal year '22 with the supply chain risk that we discussed reflected in our fiscal year '22 guidance. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $1.96 to $2.10 and free cash flow to be $1.8 billion to $2 billion. We expect free cash flow to be more in line with historical seasonality where the second half is a stronger generator of cash than the first half. 
Now specific to Q1 revenue, given the very strong backlog balanced by supply chain constraints, we expect revenue to be in line with normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q4 of fiscal year '21 and are comfortable with current consensus levels. We also expect gross margins to be pressured in the short term given supply chain. As a result, for Q1 '22, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.19 to $0.27 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.42 to $0.50. 
So overall, I'm very proud of our progress throughout a strong fiscal year '21. As Antonio said, we exceeded all our key financial targets in fiscal year '21, often by a significant margin. The demand environment has been incredibly strong across our business with acceleration in the second half of fiscal year '21, demonstrating that our edge-to-cloud strategy is working well and that we are entering fiscal year '22 with strong momentum. We are now well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us and deliver against our fiscal year '22 outlook. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions."

And I don't know maybe if you can give a little bit more on the composition of the as a Service? Is there any one product or service that's really driving that business at this point in time?"

Listen, we are super proud of the momentum we have in the market with HPE GreenLake. We believe it's truly differentiated in the market. And as we show you some 2/3 of that is already in the software and services, and we believe in 3 years, will be more than 75% of it, which obviously come with high margin and more durable revenue in many ways. 
What customers like about the model is the ability to procure everything from edge to cloud from one integrated platform. And it's not just what I call Infrastructure as a Service or Hardware as a Service on premises in a colo or at the edge, is the fact that they can consume anything from Network as a Service, subscription to Aruba products, to what I call private cloud to data services, which is part of the transformation we are driving in our storage portfolio. 
And as we said, $5.7 billion already in total contract value and in Q4, the growth was accelerated by a number of new logos, which again, we added 300 in fiscal year '21 which drove the order growth to 114%, okay? So when you think about this, we have been delivering 40, 50, 60 and in Q4 was 114%. And Aruba is one key component of that. But what we see now, Shannon, is also the Storage part of the is growing very rapidly. And that's why I'm excited about next year because we're also adding new capabilities to that platform, particularly in the early part of 2022. 
So overall, I will say this has been a home run. We believe we have years of advantage. We are disclosing all our numbers, as you see, versus some of our competitors are not sharing anything as far as I can see. And what I'm really pleased is that we have now 900 partners selling with us, co-selling, and you will see their offers in our platform here soon because that's the way we drive, fully push from both sides, direct and indirect. 
So Tarek, do you want to talk about the modeling?"

So first and foremost is one -- the first -- this first and largest Network as a Service contract contributed to orders in Q4 substantially, but did not contribute to the ARR because the revenue will be recognized over time. But notwithstanding that, the ARR, if you really look at our ARR progression quarter after quarter in fiscal year '21, it's outstanding. We did $649 million in Q1 of ARR, grew that to $678 million in Q2, $705 million in Q3 and now approaching $800 million, $796 million to be precise in Q4. 
So the momentum in this business is extremely strong, and there isn't a particular business unit that is contributing. We're executing an integrated strategy that is about edge, cloud and data. Right now, the main contributors are the various parts of the organization that fit these 3 pillars. Aruba is one of them. The Storage business unit is another one. We will also continue to expand our as a Service offerings in HPC and AI because we see a tremendous opportunity there. And the future will tell us how big that opportunity will be for us. But we firmly believe in it."

Well, I mean, if you look at our results, right, once -- right, so we grew orders. Total company orders 16% year-over-year, but our revenue in actual dollars was up 3%. Obviously, there is a big divergence there between 16% and 3%, right? And that",537,"Sure. Well, I mean, if you look at our results, right, once -- right, so we grew orders. Total company orders 16% year-over-year, but our revenue in actual dollars was up 3%. Obviously, there is a big divergence there between 16% and 3%, right? 
And that's driven by the supply availability. Despite the fact that we continue, I think, do a great job navigating through the challenge. And then one area I'm really particularly pleased, one say is the fact that linearity in the business in the way we approach customers that book orders is now more front end and back end in the quarter itself. 
I always talk about quarters having 13 weeks and what is amazing to me in the last couple of quarters, the bookings have been more on the front end than the back end, which allows us, actually. It's a little bit counterintuitive if you think about it. The more orders are -- bring early on, the more I can convert despite the supply chain challenges because I have more time and more velocity, if you will. 
So listen, as Tarek said, and I said in my remarks, short term, we're going to continue to navigate. This is an industry-wide challenge. But we're very confident with the actions we are taking ourselves. And the fact of the matter is that, that backlog is very durable. People asked me early on, have you seen cancellation? I can tell you right now, 0, no cancellations whatsoever. And the orders coming in every day, every week is incredibly strong. 
So we have to navigate the next quarter or 2. And then based on our understanding and the work we have done with our suppliers, the second half will be better. And then also remember, we have I think, world-class capabilities, both on the supply chain operations and our engineering capabilities to be able to adjust components based on the bond. And then also, remember, a big chunk of the backlog is related to acceptances in the customer base with HPC, which is already built and shipped. 
But as you know, we cannot recognize revenue until fully accepted. This quarter, we recognized a customer, which had a large order in HPC. But remember, in 2022, we have the large exascale deals and one of them is going to be very important for us as we think about the back half of the year. 
So that's why Tarek and I are very confident in that 3% to 4% guidance. And let's remind ourselves in the 3% to 4% guidance, we have 1 to 1.5 point of headwind because of the transition to as a Service, right, which is great. It's durable. It's long-term growth. And so you normalize for that, it's more like 5% to 5.5%, if you will. 
And then on top of that, you have to add the currency, which obviously is a headwind in the sense that the 3% to 4% is constant currency. So if you add all of that, we are more than like in the 7% to 8% growth. And remember that Q4 was a $7.4 billion, the largest quarter despite the supply chain going all the way back to 2019."

It's a strong momentum and clearly was stronger in Q3 and Q4 than the first half of the year. I think it's a combination, Simon. I think that obviously, there is a market demand out there driven by the recovery in the economy. I think customers also worry about the impact of the supply that we'll have in the short midterm. 
But on the same time, we should not underestimate the power of our portfolio because I got this question earlier on, you think this is double-bookings? Perhaps in the commodity space, but not on the value space. We believe Aruba is unique and differentiated. This is not something you can swap by somebody else. And that business is a true mobile-first cloud-native approach, which drives a unique experience at the edge. And that's -- the momentum has happened for a number of quarters now, despite the short-term challenge of supply. 
HPC, we are the clear #1 leader with 35% market share and 14 points advantage against the second competitor. And then the supercomputer, I don't think there's anybody that can match us. 35% of the top 100 supercomputers are all back and enterprise, and we're going to deliver the extra scale in '22. And GreenLake, again, the question about GreenLake is a true hybrid differentiated offerings from edge to cloud. And I think that has been in the making now for a number of years, and the pipeline is just amazing to me. 
And now we are getting better and better in closing deals faster and deploying the solution, which, remember, it's not just deploying it, it's also driving usage. And so it's a combination of growth in the current installed base and new logos, which I commented 300 new logos. So we believe there may be some in the commodity space, but the rest is because of our edge-to-cloud offering, which is resonating in the market, and we believe that's going to accelerate in 2022."

So in terms of customer segments, the demand remains very strong across the board and large enterprise customers, SaaS companies, telcos, and we see very robust demand from all these customers. 
With respect to unit growth, units have been roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, but the right comparison is a normalized year-over-year comparison. If you normalize for Q4 '20 units that were sold, but for orders that were generated in Q1 and Q2, you remember the dynamics of fiscal year '20, units have grown 13% Q4 '21 over normalized Q4 '20, which is an excellent result for us. We're very pleased with it.
And this comes together with very strong disciplines from our management team there in the compute space. We've executed a number of price increases ahead of price hikes of commodities and logistics costs coming up by way of expedite fees and container costs that have been rising quite dramatically, as you know. The AUP have risen overall at about 3%. When you think about this on a normalized basis, and we feel pretty good about our performance in Compute, both on the P, the price and the quantity. 
We feel that there is still strong demand moving forward, particularly in fiscal year '22 with the order book that we have been able to generate and the backlog that we have in that segment. But that comment that I just made is true and very true for Aruba where we feel a very strong order demand in Aruba and also in storage. So we feel pretty good about fiscal year '22, as Antonio commented a moment ago."

Just to add a few comments. In simple terms, this is the way to think about it. So first of all, our compute orders were up more than 10% in 2021.

So first of all, our compute orders were up more than 10% in 2021. Our units normalized for -- remember, the 2020 backlog, if you remember, when the COVID started, we had a $750 million backlog which we cleared $500 million in Q3 2020 and $250 million in Q4. When you normalize for that, units are up. 
Obviously, AUPs are up for 2 reasons: number one, cost; and number two, structural changes. As we introduce the next generation of our Compute platform, call it, Gen10 [ Form 5 and 11 ], you're going to see more options and more density in those platform, which drives structural changes, which are -- we believe those structural changes are sustainable, irrespective of the changes of the commodity cost. 
And then if you listen to what we said in 2020 and 2021 are pivot to different segments of the market, we said we want to focus on growing segments of the market, while enterprise is still super important. SaaS, Telco and Edge are 3 growing markets where we have been benefit from. Telco, obviously, with a 5G deployment, our Intelligent Edge Solutions at the Edge particularly in retail, manufacturing and hospitality. And then obviously, the focus on the SaaS, which is not the big cloud providers, but Software as a Service companies, which are driving quite significant growth. 
And then we have our own value built into the platform with silicon root of trust and manageability. And all of this, by the way, is all now being delivered to HPE GreenLake as well. So GreenLake is a force multiplier for the growth in compute because the more we sell as a Service, the more recurring revenue and compute we're going to have over time. So I hope that answers the question."

So Katy, the most important comment I would make to you with respect to orders is that the acceleration of orders manifested itself very strongly in the second half of fiscal year '21. And it's continuing from here on, the demand remains very strong. We're getting orders every day, and the linearity is better even this quarter than it was in the prior quarter last year.
The trough for our business was hit in the second quarter of 2020 ever since revenue has been edging up. And we're now at a point in Q4 '21, where we hit the revenue that is at the high watermark that is on the par with the first quarter of fiscal year '19 roughly. We do see the acceleration of the revenue growth year-over-year manifesting itself on a full year basis. But timing-wise, we did say in my script and hopefully, it was understood that the fiscal year '22 is going to be back-end loaded. 
Why is that? It's because we still have to navigate supply chain constraints and those supply chain constraints are probably not going to abate before the end of fiscal year '22 and most likely calendar year '22. Specifically for Q1, we're comfortable with current consensus levels on revenue and which also imply, as I said in my script, a seasonal decline of mid-single digits. 
But when you really look at the overall trend, year-over-year from now on, we do expect an acceleration of revenue that will be dampened a little bit by supply chain constraint that we're navigating day after day, month after month and quarter after quarter."

And what excites me is that I -- knowing what I know about our new offerings and acceleration of innovation particularly in the first calendar quarter, we believe that's going to be a turbocharge. Now as you can imagine, I spend a lot of time with our global supply team driving the day-to-day operations with Tarek here. And obviously, we have to navigate the first 2 quarters of the year. 
But I feel pretty good about accelerating that in the back half, a combination of supply availability and customer acceptances. But again, when you normalize the growth for everything I said earlier to Wamsi, which is including the as a Service pivot, you should think about not 3 to 4, but more like 6 to 7 because that's the way we should think about it. 
And then in that, remember, the growth of the ARR is going to continue to accelerate at 35% to 45%. And hopefully, in 2022, we're going to get the credit for the transformation we drive in this business."

And this had a headwind on revenue growth in Aruba of about 800 basis points and a headwind on operating margins of about 500 basis points. So if you were to normalize for it, you still realize -- you would realize that the double-digit growth in Aruba and high-teens margins are still there. And we're very comfortable they're there for us. 
Aruba is a 40% business, meaning we do see the top line growth to be in the high teens and the margins to be in the high teens as well, approaching a sum of 40% overall. Nothing has changed. We feel very comfortable, particularly knowing that the order book remains very strong. If anything, there was one part of our company that suffered a little bit more of supply chain constraints in Q4, it is Aruba. 
But it's just simply deferring revenue that could have been realized in Q4 into Q1 and Q2 of fiscal year '22. The order story remains incredibly strong, and the demand there is super solid. So we're very confident about the prospects of Aruba for fiscal year '22."

I remember when I acquired Aruba in 2015 and then we merged it with the rest of HPE business, it was in the high 2s. Now we are $4 billion. And we, again, to Tarek's point, we believe this business is going to continue to grow double digits. We obviously have to think about this business long-term growth, particularly as we pivot more as a Service because the network as a Service is a nascent market, but the subscription side is actually a growing and more established markets.
So remember, there's 2 different value proposition here. I subscribed to a WiFi connectivity or a LAN port. That's today the triple-digit growth that Tarek talked early on, on the as a Service side. And then there is the nascent Network as a Service, which the hardware component of that is totally deferred over the length of the contract. And when you have an excess of a $100-plus million deal, obviously, that has a huge impact. 
But it's good for the long-term durability, and that's why we are very bullish about this business. And listen, as I said earlier to Katy, we believe over time, this is going to alleviate the supply, and we're going to convert more of that.

We've been buffering inventory for the past 5 quarters to navigate supply chain constraints. Obviously, this leads to a situation where our inventory levels are higher than in some cases, we would like, but it's necessary and it's okay. It doesn't really impact our free cash flow guidance for fiscal year '22, which I'm very happy to reiterate. We said we would be attaining $1.8 billion to $2 billion of free cash flow in fiscal year '22. And the increase in inventory is factored into the guidance. 
The guidance is more attained on free cash flow by way of earnings growth, number one. Number two, also by reduction of restructuring costs as our restructuring programs are winding down. And then yes, there is a bit of an offset, a headwind from inventory increases, but it's absolutely fine. 
When you're having your order book in the way we have it, you got to get -- be ahead of the curve by way of buffering inventory, and that's what we've been doing for the past 5 quarters. And we'll continue to do so in fiscal year '22."

I will say, first of all, since the question was not asked, but I maybe answer proactively is Tarek talked about the restructuring. We are winding down that program, and we are well on track to deliver that commitment that we made to our shareholders. Remember with the net $800 million at this time. So very pleased with that, which makes us a more lean and agile company. And part of that is also the ability to execute faster. 
One of the big changes we made also was the way we compensate our sales force on orders, and this is what you see. We are now confident based on our systems implementation. If you recall, we started 3 years ago, and we are also getting close to that completion, allowed us to make some changes here in the way we drive the business going forward. And I think this is all about operational excellence and execution.
On the inventory side, I think the team has done a remarkable job driving working capital and -- but also at the same time, making the right long-term bets on this inventory, which give us not just the ability to convert but pricing power. And as I said in the Security Analyst Meeting, we tend to be the market leader in changing prices, and we will continue to do so because it's the right thing to do at the right time. And so we will continue to manage that inventory as needed for our customers and for delivering of numbers."

And for those of you who attended our virtual Security Analyst Meeting last month, thank you. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss how our edge-to-cloud strategy position us to capture an expanded market opportunity and accelerate shareholder value creation.  
HPE ended fiscal year 2021 with strong momentum. Customers are responding to our edge-to-cloud value proposition as evidenced by the record demand for our solutions. Demand accelerated in the second half of the year, driving fiscal year 2021 orders growth of 16% year-over-year. Revenue of $27.8 billion in fiscal year '21 grew in line with our long-term outlook, up 1% year-over-year.
In fiscal year 2021, we executed very well, which enable us to exceed our commitments across all financial metrics, even with a substantial order backlog. Our as a Service annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, of $796 million was up 36% year-over-year. We significantly improved our gross and operating margins, which increased our fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP operating profit by 25% year-over-year.
We delivered fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.96, up 27% year-over-year. And we generated fiscal year 2021 free cash flow of $1.6 billion, up $1 billion year-over-year, which translates to growth of 177%. This was a very strong performance, and it was particularly impressive against the backdrop of industry-wide supply constraints, which continued to challenge our ability to convert orders to revenue as quickly as we would like.  
We have a world-class global operations team that continues to work closely with our long-standing diverse network of suppliers. We continue to take proactive inventory measures to better position us to deliver against this robust customer demand.  
Our results in Q4 strengthened the momentum we have as we enter fiscal year '22. Increased demand in the quarter drove orders growth of 28% year-over-year, with particular strength in our as a Service orders, which grew an impressive 114% year-over-year, including a large Network as a Service win.
We also saw record levels of orders in key growth areas, including Intelligent Edge, High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence businesses. We delivered $7.4 billion in total Q4 revenue, which was up 7% sequentially and above normal sequential seasonality. We expanded our gross and operating margins, increasing our Q4 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share by 27% year-over-year. And we generated Q4 free cash flow of $94 million, in line with the outlook we provided at the end of Q3.  
Tarek will take you through our quarterly results in detail, but I would like to spend a little more time putting a full fiscal year in context for you. Our fiscal year 2021 results proved the relevance of our strategy to customers and the traction of our transformation to become the S2 cloud company. As we discussed at our Security Analyst Meeting last month, HPE is at the center of several compelling megatrends: the explosion of data at the edge, the mandate for a cloud experience everywhere and the need to extract value from data to generate insights.  
HPE is differentiated edge-to-cloud strategy uniquely position us to capitalize on these trends and capture growing profitable markets. Our solutions and services help customers overcome the challenges of multi-generation IT and enable them to access, control and maximize the value of all their workloads and data everywhere.
We are executing with focus and speed to deliver against our vision and strategy. We are making strategic investments and taking deliberate steps to continue to shift our business. And as I have said previously, this transformation is my #1 priority, and I'm proud of the progress we have made in fiscal year '21.  
Our Intelligent Edge business grew fiscal year '21 revenue 13% year-over-year with orders exceeding, for the first time, $4 billion. Customer demand was up strong double digits year-over-year as more customers look for ways to create new digital experiences at the edge and capitalize on the data generated there. But the industry-wide component shortages kept us from converting our full order momentum to revenue in Q4, and we enter fiscal year 2022 with record levels of backlog.
Our market leadership at the edge remained very strong. HPE was positioned as the leader in -- one of the leaders in the Magic Quadrant Gartner provides for wireless access network edge infrastructure, which is notable because HP is only one of the 2 companies to be positioned in the Leader Quadrant 4 years in a row.
We continue to drive strong innovation in this business. In Q4, we introduced the industry-first distributed services switch, which brings software-defined services and security right to where the data is created in process. Developed in partnership with Pensando, this solution eliminates legacy appliances and whole software needed to build the hybrid cloud demand, demanded by modern applications and IT organizations.
In Q4, we closed the largest Network as a Service deal in HP history to help a large U.S. retailer enhance its customer and employee experience throughout the stores. In addition, the Major League Soccer franchise FC Cincinnati standardized on Aruba at the TQL Stadium to deliver next-generation digital cashless, counterless fun and event experiences. The franchise deployed an end-to-end Aruba Edge Services Platform network at its new 26,000 seats stadium to power this game day and special event experiences.  
Orders of HPE's High Performance Compute & AI offerings were also up strong double digits year-over-year. This record level of demand has generated an order book of awarded contracts now at $2.7 billion, excluding the important $2 billion win with the U.S. National Security Agency. 
HPE expanded our #1 market position in HPC with 37% market share as of calendar Q2 data, which is more than 14 points above the closest competitor. And according to the list of the top 500 supercomputers released just 2 weeks ago, 33 of the top 100 most powerful supercomputers in the world were built by HPE. This is more than any company.
At the end of Q4, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, NERSC, at Berkeley's Lab accepted the first phase of the promoter supercomputer. Powered by the HPE Cray EX system, [ our model ] introduced a new generation of supercomputing capabilities to more than 8,000 scientists performing research for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.  
HPE is uniquely positioned to bring the AI, deep learning and data analytics capabilities of our most advanced supercomputers to mainstream enterprises through the HPE GreenLake platform. In Q4, we announced that Eni, a global energy company, selected HP GreenLake to upgrade its existing HPE supercomputer. Through HPE GreenLake, Eni can accelerate discover -- discovery of new energy sources with more accurate modeling and simulations as well as become more sustainable by monitored utilization and energy consumption within an as a Service solution.  
We continue to strengthen our Compute and Storage businesses where we saw strong orders and profitability in fiscal year 2021. In Compute, orders increased more than 10% in fiscal year '21 and we delivered operating margins of 10.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. We are making bold moves to transform our Storage business into a cloud-native data services business, which resulted in a high single-digit order growth and gross margin expansion, up 130 basis points year-over-year.  
And we continue to see high services attach rate, helping enable HP Pointnext orders to increase mid-single digits in fiscal year '21. This contributed to the overall performance of HPE Pointnext, which ended fiscal year '21 with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 of revenues, highlighting the potential for future revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond.
In fiscal year 2021, we generated strong momentum in our transformation to an as a Service company. Our company as a Service orders increased 61% year-over-year, with HPE GreenLake orders increasing 46% year-over-year. Our as a Service annualized revenue run rate or ARR of $796 million was up 36% year-over-year. 
The growth of our ARR is particularly noteworthy because this recurring revenue stream is high-quality and high-margin. During our Security Analyst Meeting last month, Tarek shared that more than 60% of our ARR mix is software and services, and we believe that portion will grow to more than 3/4 in the next 3 years. Our ARR gross margins are well above our corporate average gross margins today and the addition of high-value software content will drive margins even higher.  
Our pivot to an as a Service company is enabled by HPE Financial Services, which increased fiscal year 2021 financing volume 3% year-over-year driven by strong growth within HPE GreenLake. We continue to advance our leadership in our HP GreenLake offering. In September, we introduced HP GreenLake for data protection, which are cloud services designed to protect data across edge-to-cloud, overcome ransomware attacks and deliver rapid data recovery. 
This new set of solutions marks our entry into the growing data protection as a Service market. Our acquisition of Zerto enable us to add market-leading data protection to our cloud services portfolio to help enterprises take cyber threats and ransomware attacks head on.
We also launched HP GreenLake for data analytics, which includes the industry-first, unified modern hybrid analytics and data lake platform. This strategically important solution positions HPE in the growing unified analytics market and helps customers accelerate modernization initiatives for all data across edge-to-cloud.
We continue to see incredible response to our HP GreenLake offering. We added more than 300 new GreenLake customers during fiscal year '21, bringing our customer count to more than 1,250. New GreenLake logos represent an increasing share of orders with approximately 1/4 of Q4 GreenLake orders coming from new customers. 
Today, more than 900 partners sell HPE GreenLake, one of the largest partner ecosystems selling as a Service offerings in the industry. We added more than $1.5 billion of GreenLake total contract value over the last year, bringing the total to more than $5.7 billion.
Examples of new GreenLake logos includes Trinchero Family Estates, the second largest family-owned winery in the world, which adopted HPE GreenLake through our channel partner PKA Technologies to add flexibility and scale its capacity to meet the increasing demand of automation. The HPE GreenLake solution powers the winery's automated warehouse, where approximately 60 different types of wines are produced, bottled, packaged and prepared for shipping while reducing overall IT costs.
We also won a deal with ONGC, India's largest oil and natural gas company, which is using the HP GreenLake platform to make one of the largest SAP implementations in the world more manageable and flexible. Our Q4 rounded out an impressive year for HPE and I'm proud of all we have accomplished. We have made incredible progress in transforming to become the edge-to-cloud leader, executing on our strategy to help customers in truly differentiated ways and position ourselves for sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. 
At the same time, we have advanced our ESG initiatives, which in Q4 earned us a position on a highly competitive Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, placing in the 98 percentile. We exceeded our commitments in fiscal year '21, and our momentum is strong as we enter fiscal year '22 with a strategy more relevant to customers than ever before and a sharp focus on execution. 
With that, I will turn it over to Tarek to share additional details about the quarter. Tarek, over to you."

I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. And as usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. An",2323,"Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. And as usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key fiscal year '21 highlights on Slides 1 and 2, so now let me discuss our Q4 performance, starting with Slide 3. 
I am very pleased to report that we continue to see unprecedented demand across all our businesses with robust order growth up 28% year-over-year. Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q4 revenues of $7.4 billion, up 7% from the prior quarter above normal sequential seasonality and this despite increased supply chain challenges that we foreshadowed at SAM last month. It's also worth highlighting that $7.4 billion of revenue represents the highest level since Q1 of fiscal year '19, well before the pandemic. 
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 33%, which was up 230 basis points from the prior year. And this was driven by our deliberate actions to shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings, strong pricing discipline and cost takeout. As previously indicated, gross margins were pressured from prior quarter levels due to an increasing industry-wide shortages of certain components that have resulted in extended lead times and higher commodity costs underpinning backlogged orders. 
We continue to take proactive inventory measures and display healthy price discipline to minimize the impact of recent disruptions. We expect this dynamic supply chain situation to last well into calendar year 2022. We also continue to invest in high gross margin-rich areas of our portfolio. 
We've made investments in our overall go-to-market to accelerate our growth and our shift to an as a Service model. Even with these investments, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.7%, up 120 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 16% year-over-year increase in operating profit. 
Within other income and expense, we benefited from further strong gains related to increased valuations in our Pathfinder venture portfolio, an outstanding operational performance in HPC that I will address in more detail later. With strong execution across the business, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, up 27% from the prior year and at the high end of our outlook range for Q4.
Excluding $2.2 billion of after-tax proceeds received from Oracle satisfaction of the judgment in the Itanium litigation, Q4 cash flow from operations was $784 million, and free cash flow was $94 million. For fiscal year '21, this brings our total cash flow from operations to $3.7 billion, up $1.5 billion from the prior year, and our free cash flow to $1.6 billion, up $1 billion from the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in earnings. Our strong execution and cost optimization and resource allocation program has effectively put us 1 year ahead of schedule with respect to delivering our previous free cash flow targets.
Finally, the strength of our cash flow has positioned us to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $157 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q1 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in January. We also reinstated our share repurchase program in Q4 buying $213 million in shares, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation and our view that the stock is undervalued. 
Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our accelerating as a Service business. We have made significant progress over the last year by adding over 300 new enterprise GreenLake customers to over 1,250 today and increasing our TCV by over $1.5 billion to our current lifetime TCV of over $5.7 billion. 
For Q4 specifically, our ARR was $796 million, which was up 36% year-over-year as reported and total as a Service orders were up 114% year-over-year, which represents an acceleration from Q3, demonstrating the strong momentum we are experiencing in this business. 
It's also important to remember the incremental disclosure we provided at SAM 2021, highlighting the significant proportion of software and services in our offerings that together make up more than 60% of the ARR mix today. We expect this mix percentage to expand to more than 75% by fiscal year '24 as we add more software capabilities driving further gross margin improvement. Overall, based on strong momentum this year, I'm very happy with how this business is progressing, which gives us confidence to increase our ARR growth targets by 5 points to a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year '21 to fiscal year '24. 
Let's now turn to our segment highlights on Slide 5. Our growth businesses, which now represent nearly 25% of our total company revenue, generated record levels of orders, up strong double digits. In the Intelligent Edge, revenue grew 2% year-over-year in Q4 and for fiscal year '21 was up 13%. Demand continued unabated in Q4 with order growth up over 50% year-over-year, but the component shortages we foreshadowed at SAM were more pronounced in our Aruba business.
Additionally, our edge as a Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year, significantly contributing to our ARR. We delivered a multimillion-dollar NaaS, Network as a Service deal in Q4 for a large U.S. customer, which represented more than 800 basis points headwind in the short term to Aruba revenue in Q4, but will help our long-term financial profile in the business. 
Aruba Services also continued to grow strongly, up high single digits. Looking forward, we expect it will take some time for supply chain challenges to ease, but we finished fiscal year '21 with over $4 billion in orders which will give us strong momentum through fiscal year '22. 
In HPC and AI, demand strengthened even further with another record level of orders. Revenue grew 35% sequentially and was flat year-over-year with a difficult compare. We did have customer acceptances of some large contracts get pushed out into fiscal year '22. And we now have $2.7 billion of awarded contract in addition to the $2 billion contract awarded by the NSA, giving us confidence for next year and beyond. We expect robust revenue growth in fiscal year '22 to get us back within the range of our original long-term 8% to 12% CAGR outlook. 
In Compute, order growth was up strong double digits. Revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting above normal sequential seasonality and was up double digits year-over-year when normalizing for the Q4 FY '20 backlog. Operating margins of 9.4% were up 280 basis points from prior year due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. 
Within Storage, order growth accelerated and was up double digits year-over-year. Revenue grew 2% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter ahead of normal sequential seasonality driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. All-flash arrays grew 7% year-over-year, led by Primera, up strong double digits. Nimble grew 4% year-over-year with ongoing strong dHCI momentum, growing double digits year-over-year. Storage operating profit margin was 13.8%, reflecting OpEx investments to continue driving product mix shift towards more software-rich platforms, including our cloud data services. 
With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, orders accelerated and were up high single digits in Q4 and up mid-single digits for fiscal year '21. Most importantly, revenue also grew as reported overall for fiscal year '21, the first time in several years. This is, again, very important as we enter fiscal year '22 with strong momentum in our most profitable business.
Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 18% year-over-year, driven by strong double-digit growth in GreenLake. Revenue was up 3% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Our profitability is also benefiting from higher residual values realization and lower borrowing costs as we continue to securitize our U.S. portfolio via the ABS market. Our operating margin was 14.1%, up 630 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 23.8% is well above the 18% plus target set at SAM 2021. 
Slide 6 highlights our revenue and EPS performance, where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year and sustained momentum throughout fiscal year '21. As mentioned previously, Q4 revenue of $7.4 billion is the highest level we've delivered since Q1 '19. With a strong demand environment, our strategic business mix shift and execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we increased our Q4 non-GAAP EPS to $0.52, up 27% year-over-year. 
Turning to Slide 7. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q4 of 33%. While rates were impacted as expected sequentially from the supply chain challenges previously discussed, we expanded gross margins up 230 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses. In total, in fiscal year '21, we delivered nearly $900 million of incremental gross profit. 
Moving forward, we will face lingering supply chain challenges in the near term, but longer term, structural gross margins will improve from continuous mix shift towards the Intelligent Edge, all IP storage, GreenLake and all of our as a Service offerings. 
Moving to Slide 8. You can see we have utilized some of the incremental gross profit to make targeted growth investments while simultaneously expanding non-GAAP operating profit margins. We have increased our investment levels in R&D to fuel our long-term innovation engine and still selling costs to accelerate our growth and higher shift to our as a Service pivot.
Even with these investments to drive long-term growth, we delivered operating margins in Q4 of 9.7%, up 120 basis points from the prior year. On Slide 9, we want to highlight our unique setup in China through our investment in HPC that has and continues to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. Our investment and commercial agreement gives us a route-to-market in the second largest, fastest-growing IT market in the world. As you know, we do not consolidate revenue and operating profit from HPC, but recognize our 49% share of HPC's earnings through the equity interest statement line on our P&L as part of other income and expense. 
HPC has delivered outstanding operational performance throughout the year and generated $257 million of equity interest in fiscal year '21, which was up 21% from the prior year. This makes our business in China a very large contributor to our P&L, one that no other multinational has been able to replicate. 
Turning to Slide 10. We finished fiscal year '21 generating $3.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.6 billion of free cash flow, and this excluding, obviously, the $2.2 billion of after-tax, cash received from Oracle satisfaction of the Itanium litigation. 
Free cash flow was up $1 billion year-over-year and is $600 million more than the midpoint of our outlook at the start of fiscal year '20, primarily driven by increased earnings. Our cash flow profile is becoming more predictable and aligned to profitability as our restructuring costs diminish, and we grow our as a Service business beginning to recognize more deferred revenues from software and services. 
Moving on to Slide 11. We have made further progress in enhancing our balance sheet strength with a strong free cash flow and payment from Oracle. Following the receipt of the cash from the Itanium litigation, we redeemed early our $1 billion 4.65% coupon outstanding 2024 notes and this in a positive NPV transaction that is net debt-neutral. The make-whole premium paid was a GAAP-only expense in Q4, and we will realize meaningful interest expense savings over the next 3 years. 
We are now in an operating company net cash position of $1.8 billion. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensure we have ample liquidity available to balance long-term growth investments with consistent return of capital to our shareholders.
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 12. At our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, we provided our outlook for fiscal year '22, and I would like to encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. Having said that, let me reiterate the drill down into a few key components.
We expect fiscal year '22 revenue growth in constant currency of 3% to 4%. As discussed, the supply chain environment remains very dynamic, and we expect component shortages with increased commodity costs, expedite and shipping fees to last for the next few quarters impacting near-term revenue and gross margins.
In a nutshell, we expect to have more of a back-end loaded year in fiscal year '22 with the supply chain risk that we discussed reflected in our fiscal year '22 guidance. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $1.96 to $2.10 and free cash flow to be $1.8 billion to $2 billion. We expect free cash flow to be more in line with historical seasonality where the second half is a stronger generator of cash than the first half. 
Now specific to Q1 revenue, given the very strong backlog balanced by supply chain constraints, we expect revenue to be in line with normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q4 of fiscal year '21 and are comfortable with current consensus levels. We also expect gross margins to be pressured in the short term given supply chain. As a result, for Q1 '22, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.19 to $0.27 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.42 to $0.50. 
So overall, I'm very proud of our progress throughout a strong fiscal year '21. As Antonio said, we exceeded all our key financial targets in fiscal year '21, often by a significant margin. The demand environment has been incredibly strong across our business with acceleration in the second half of fiscal year '21, demonstrating that our edge-to-cloud strategy is working well and that we are entering fiscal year '22 with strong momentum. We are now well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us and deliver against our fiscal year '22 outlook. 
Now with that, let's open it up for questions."

Listen, we are super proud of the momentum we have in the market with HPE GreenLake. We believe it's truly differentiated in the market. And as we show you some 2/3 of that is already in the software and services, and we believe in 3 years, will be more than 75% of it, which obviously come with high margin and more durable revenue in many ways. 
What customers like about the model is the ability to procure everything from edge to cloud from one integrated platform. And it's not just what I call Infrastructure as a Service or Hardware as a Service on premises in a colo or at the edge, is the fact that they can consume anything from Network as a Service, subscription to Aruba products, to what I call private cloud to data services, which is part of the transformation we are driving in our storage portfolio. 
And as we said, $5.7 billion already in total contract value and in Q4, the growth was accelerated by a number of new logos, which again, we added 300 in fiscal year '21 which drove the order growth to 114%, okay? So when you think about this, we have been delivering 40, 50, 60 and in Q4 was 114%. And Aruba is one key component of that. But what we see now, Shannon, is also the Storage part of the is growing very rapidly. And that's why I'm excited about next year because we're also adding new capabilities to that platform, particularly in the early part of 2022. 
So overall, I will say this has been a home run. We believe we have years of advantage. We are disclosing all our numbers, as you see, versus some of our competitors are not sharing anything as far as I can see. And what I'm really pleased is that we have now 900 partners selling with us, co-selling, and you will see their offers in our platform here soon because that's the way we drive, fully push from both sides, direct and indirect. 
So Tarek, do you want to talk about the modeling?"

So first and foremost is one -- the first -- this first and largest Network as a Service contract contributed to orders in Q4 substantially, but did not contribute to the ARR because the revenue will be recognized over time. But notwithstanding that, the ARR, if you really look at our ARR progression quarter after quarter in fiscal year '21, it's outstanding. We did $649 million in Q1 of ARR, grew that to $678 million in Q2, $705 million in Q3 and now approaching $800 million, $796 million to be precise in Q4. 
So the momentum in this business is extremely strong, and there isn't a particular business unit that is contributing. We're executing an integrated strategy that is about edge, cloud and data. Right now, the main contributors are the various parts of the organization that fit these 3 pillars. Aruba is one of them. The Storage business unit is another one. We will also continue to expand our as a Service offerings in HPC and AI because we see a tremendous opportunity there. And the future will tell us how big that opportunity will be for us. But we firmly believe in it."

So just trying to understand like what gives you the confidence that these will resolve itself? And what gives you the confidence that this is -- this back-end loaded year is going to pan out as you're seeing it now?"

Well, I mean, if you look at our results, right, once -- right, so we grew orders. Total company orders 16% year-over-year, but our revenue in actual dollars was up 3%. Obviously, there is a big divergence there between 16% and 3%, right? And that",537,"Sure. Well, I mean, if you look at our results, right, once -- right, so we grew orders. Total company orders 16% year-over-year, but our revenue in actual dollars was up 3%. Obviously, there is a big divergence there between 16% and 3%, right? 
And that's driven by the supply availability. Despite the fact that we continue, I think, do a great job navigating through the challenge. And then one area I'm really particularly pleased, one say is the fact that linearity in the business in the way we approach customers that book orders is now more front end and back end in the quarter itself. 
I always talk about quarters having 13 weeks and what is amazing to me in the last couple of quarters, the bookings have been more on the front end than the back end, which allows us, actually. It's a little bit counterintuitive if you think about it. The more orders are -- bring early on, the more I can convert despite the supply chain challenges because I have more time and more velocity, if you will. 
So listen, as Tarek said, and I said in my remarks, short term, we're going to continue to navigate. This is an industry-wide challenge. But we're very confident with the actions we are taking ourselves. And the fact of the matter is that, that backlog is very durable. People asked me early on, have you seen cancellation? I can tell you right now, 0, no cancellations whatsoever. And the orders coming in every day, every week is incredibly strong. 
So we have to navigate the next quarter or 2. And then based on our understanding and the work we have done with our suppliers, the second half will be better. And then also remember, we have I think, world-class capabilities, both on the supply chain operations and our engineering capabilities to be able to adjust components based on the bond. And then also, remember, a big chunk of the backlog is related to acceptances in the customer base with HPC, which is already built and shipped. 
But as you know, we cannot recognize revenue until fully accepted. This quarter, we recognized a customer, which had a large order in HPC. But remember, in 2022, we have the large exascale deals and one of them is going to be very important for us as we think about the back half of the year. 
So that's why Tarek and I are very confident in that 3% to 4% guidance. And let's remind ourselves in the 3% to 4% guidance, we have 1 to 1.5 point of headwind because of the transition to as a Service, right, which is great. It's durable. It's long-term growth. And so you normalize for that, it's more like 5% to 5.5%, if you will. 
And then on top of that, you have to add the currency, which obviously is a headwind in the sense that the 3% to 4% is constant currency. So if you add all of that, we are more than like in the 7% to 8% growth. And remember that Q4 was a $7.4 billion, the largest quarter despite the supply chain going all the way back to 2019."

It's a strong momentum and clearly was stronger in Q3 and Q4 than the first half of the year. I think it's a combination, Simon. I think that obviously, there is a market demand out there driven by the recovery in the economy. I think customers also worry about the impact of the supply that we'll have in the short midterm. 
But on the same time, we should not underestimate the power of our portfolio because I got this question earlier on, you think this is double-bookings? Perhaps in the commodity space, but not on the value space. We believe Aruba is unique and differentiated. This is not something you can swap by somebody else. And that business is a true mobile-first cloud-native approach, which drives a unique experience at the edge. And that's -- the momentum has happened for a number of quarters now, despite the short-term challenge of supply. 
HPC, we are the clear #1 leader with 35% market share and 14 points advantage against the second competitor. And then the supercomputer, I don't think there's anybody that can match us. 35% of the top 100 supercomputers are all back and enterprise, and we're going to deliver the extra scale in '22. And GreenLake, again, the question about GreenLake is a true hybrid differentiated offerings from edge to cloud. And I think that has been in the making now for a number of years, and the pipeline is just amazing to me. 
And now we are getting better and better in closing deals faster and deploying the solution, which, remember, it's not just deploying it, it's also driving usage. And so it's a combination of growth in the current installed base and new logos, which I commented 300 new logos. So we believe there may be some in the commodity space, but the rest is because of our edge-to-cloud offering, which is resonating in the market, and we believe that's going to accelerate in 2022."

So in terms of customer segments, the demand remains very strong across the board and large enterprise customers, SaaS companies, telcos, and we see very robust demand from all these customers. 
With respect to unit growth, units have been roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, but the right comparison is a normalized year-over-year comparison. If you normalize for Q4 '20 units that were sold, but for orders that were generated in Q1 and Q2, you remember the dynamics of fiscal year '20, units have grown 13% Q4 '21 over normalized Q4 '20, which is an excellent result for us. We're very pleased with it.
And this comes together with very strong disciplines from our management team there in the compute space. We've executed a number of price increases ahead of price hikes of commodities and logistics costs coming up by way of expedite fees and container costs that have been rising quite dramatically, as you know. The AUP have risen overall at about 3%. When you think about this on a normalized basis, and we feel pretty good about our performance in Compute, both on the P, the price and the quantity. 
We feel that there is still strong demand moving forward, particularly in fiscal year '22 with the order book that we have been able to generate and the backlog that we have in that segment. But that comment that I just made is true and very true for Aruba where we feel a very strong order demand in Aruba and also in storage. So we feel pretty good about fiscal year '22, as Antonio commented a moment ago."

Just to add a few comments. In simple terms, this is the way to think about it. So first of all, our compute orders were up more than 10% in 2021.

So first of all, our compute orders were up more than 10% in 2021. Our units normalized for -- remember, the 2020 backlog, if you remember, when the COVID started, we had a $750 million backlog which we cleared $500 million in Q3 2020 and $250 million in Q4. When you normalize for that, units are up. 
Obviously, AUPs are up for 2 reasons: number one, cost; and number two, structural changes. As we introduce the next generation of our Compute platform, call it, Gen10 [ Form 5 and 11 ], you're going to see more options and more density in those platform, which drives structural changes, which are -- we believe those structural changes are sustainable, irrespective of the changes of the commodity cost. 
And then if you listen to what we said in 2020 and 2021 are pivot to different segments of the market, we said we want to focus on growing segments of the market, while enterprise is still super important. SaaS, Telco and Edge are 3 growing markets where we have been benefit from. Telco, obviously, with a 5G deployment, our Intelligent Edge Solutions at the Edge particularly in retail, manufacturing and hospitality. And then obviously, the focus on the SaaS, which is not the big cloud providers, but Software as a Service companies, which are driving quite significant growth. 
And then we have our own value built into the platform with silicon root of trust and manageability. And all of this, by the way, is all now being delivered to HPE GreenLake as well. So GreenLake is a force multiplier for the growth in compute because the more we sell as a Service, the more recurring revenue and compute we're going to have over time. So I hope that answers the question."

So Katy, the most important comment I would make to you with respect to orders is that the acceleration of orders manifested itself very strongly in the second half of fiscal year '21. And it's continuing from here on, the demand remains very strong.",270,"Yes. So Katy, the most important comment I would make to you with respect to orders is that the acceleration of orders manifested itself very strongly in the second half of fiscal year '21. And it's continuing from here on, the demand remains very strong. We're getting orders every day, and the linearity is better even this quarter than it was in the prior quarter last year.
The trough for our business was hit in the second quarter of 2020 ever since revenue has been edging up. And we're now at a point in Q4 '21, where we hit the revenue that is at the high watermark that is on the par with the first quarter of fiscal year '19 roughly. We do see the acceleration of the revenue growth year-over-year manifesting itself on a full year basis. But timing-wise, we did say in my script and hopefully, it was understood that the fiscal year '22 is going to be back-end loaded. 
Why is that? It's because we still have to navigate supply chain constraints and those supply chain constraints are probably not going to abate before the end of fiscal year '22 and most likely calendar year '22. Specifically for Q1, we're comfortable with current consensus levels on revenue and which also imply, as I said in my script, a seasonal decline of mid-single digits. 
But when you really look at the overall trend, year-over-year from now on, we do expect an acceleration of revenue that will be dampened a little bit by supply chain constraint that we're navigating day after day, month after month and quarter after quarter."

Katy, I think in addition to what Tarek said, first of all, I don't see the demand abating anytime soon. I actually see that continue to accelerate. And what is amazing to me is that in the areas where we place a particular focus, we see amazing growth. 
And what excites me is that I -- knowing what I know about our new offerings and acceleration of innovation particularly in the first calendar quarter, we believe that's going to be a turbocharge. Now as you can imagine, I spend a lot of time with our global supply team driving the day-to-day operations with Tarek here. And obviously, we have to navigate the first 2 quarters of the year. 
But I feel pretty good about accelerating that in the back half, a combination of supply availability and customer acceptances. But again, when you normalize the growth for everything I said earlier to Wamsi, which is including the as a Service pivot, you should think about not 3 to 4, but more like 6 to 7 because that's the way we should think about it. 
And then in that, remember, the growth of the ARR is going to continue to accelerate at 35% to 45%. And hopefully, in 2022, we're going to get the credit for the transformation we drive in this business."

So I would love to understand kind of what's happening there. How do you see that business ramp up through fiscal '22? 
And then, Antonio, I want to touch this with you, which is you've talked a fair bit about the conviction in the orders that you have and how good they are and I think you've said about a lack of cancellation being a pretty big driver for it -- driver for your confidence. I would imagine cancellations will only happen when supply chain issues alleviate versus right now. Is that fair? And if so, are there other things you're looking at in your business that gives you confidence that these orders will convert?"

So Amit, as we shared in our scripts, we signed a very substantial Network as a Service contract for the first time with a large U.S. retailer. And this had a headwind on revenue growth in Aruba of about 800 basis points and a headwind on operating margins of about 500 basis points. So if you were to normalize for it, you still realize -- you would realize that the double-digit growth in Aruba and high-teens margins are still there. And we're very comfortable they're there for us. 
Aruba is a 40% business, meaning we do see the top line growth to be in the high teens and the margins to be in the high teens as well, approaching a sum of 40% overall. Nothing has changed. We feel very comfortable, particularly knowing that the order book remains very strong. If anything, there was one part of our company that suffered a little bit more of supply chain constraints in Q4, it is Aruba. 
But it's just simply deferring revenue that could have been realized in Q4 into Q1 and Q2 of fiscal year '22. The order story remains incredibly strong, and the demand there is super solid. So we're very confident about the prospects of Aruba for fiscal year '22."

Remember what we said in our commentary, right, that this is the first year that Aruba crossed the $4 billion mark in orders. 
I remember when I acquired Aruba in 2015 and then we merged it with the rest of HPE business, it was in the high 2s. Now we are $4 billion. And we, again, to Tarek's point, we believe this business is going to continue to grow double digits. We obviously have to think about this business long-term growth, particularly as we pivot more as a Service because the network as a Service is a nascent market, but the subscription side is actually a growing and more established markets.
So remember, there's 2 different value proposition here. I subscribed to a WiFi connectivity or a LAN port. That's today the triple-digit growth that Tarek talked early on, on the as a Service side. And then there is the nascent Network as a Service, which the hardware component of that is totally deferred over the length of the contract. And when you have an excess of a $100-plus million deal, obviously, that has a huge impact. 
But it's good for the long-term durability, and that's why we are very bullish about this business. And listen, as I said earlier to Katy, we believe over time, this is going to alleviate the supply, and we're going to convert more of that. But we actually with a backlog I've never seen in my life, and obviously, our customers need connectivity to operate in this digital economy."

We've been buffering inventory for the past 5 quarters to navigate supply chain constraints. Obviously, this leads to a situation where our inventory levels are higher than in some cases, we would like, but it's necessary and it's okay. It doesn't really impact our free cash flow guidance for fiscal year '22, which I'm very happy to reiterate. We said we would be attaining $1.8 billion to $2 billion of free cash flow in fiscal year '22. And the increase in inventory is factored into the guidance. 
The guidance is more attained on free cash flow by way of earnings growth, number one. Number two, also by reduction of restructuring costs as our restructuring programs are winding down. And then yes, there is a bit of an offset, a headwind from inventory increases, but it's absolutely fine. 
When you're having your order book in the way we have it, you got to get -- be ahead of the curve by way of buffering inventory, and that's what we've been doing for the past 5 quarters. And we'll continue to do so in fiscal year '22."

We are winding down that program, and we are well on track to deliver that commitment that we made to our shareholders. Remember with the net $800 million at this time. So very pleased with that, which makes us a more lean and agile company. And part of that is also the ability to execute faster. 
One of the big changes we made also was the way we compensate our sales force on orders, and this is what you see. We are now confident based on our systems implementation. If you recall, we started 3 years ago, and we are also getting close to that completion, allowed us to make some changes here in the way we drive the business going forward. And I think this is all about operational excellence and execution.
On the inventory side, I think the team has done a remarkable job driving working capital and -- but also at the same time, making the right long-term bets on this inventory, which give us not just the ability to convert but pricing power. And as I said in the Security Analyst Meeting, we tend to be the market leader in changing prices, and we will continue to do so because it's the right thing to do at the right time.
