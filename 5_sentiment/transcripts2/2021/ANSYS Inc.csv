24893,702211189,2223190,"ANSYS, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","ANSYS, Inc.","Executives","Sales activity, which we believe was driven by a combination of deferred customer spending from earlier quarters, greater-than-expected end of year customer budgets in the Americas and in EMEA, coupled with increased albeit cautious optimism in the econom",1660,"Sales activity, which we believe was driven by a combination of deferred customer spending from earlier quarters, greater-than-expected end of year customer budgets in the Americas and in EMEA, coupled with increased albeit cautious optimism in the economy, thanks to the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines and expected government stimulus activities. During Q4, we closed nearly 100 deals over $1 million, a total that includes 8 deals in the 8 figures. One of those agreements was the second largest deal in the history of the company, a 5-year $79 million contract with an enterprise customer. While economic conditions forces global company to reduce expenses across the business, it's renewed and expanded its use of ANSYS core solver technology worldwide. And added newly acquired ANSYS technologies, including electronics reliability and dynamic analysis. This contract reflects the customer's long-term decision to standardize on ANSYS technology over other vendors and to reduce its reliance on physical testing and is a testament to ANSYS' market leadership. As we have consistently said, our have become increasingly back-end loaded due primarily to the timing of large deals. This steady progression has allowed us sales and operations teams to support an increasingly higher magnitude of business in the fourth quarter of each year. Our strong q4 2020 execution drove record quarterly ACV which was over $100 million higher than the previous largest quarter in Q4 of 2019. The strength and volume of business that we closed in Q4 resulted in annual ACV growth of almost 10% in constant currency. 
The year developed largely as we had predicted in our May 2020 call with regards to our performance by industry, geography and company size. During the year, we exceeded our expectations with enterprise customers including closing the 3 largest deals in our history. That speaks to the importance of ANSYS' integrated multiphysics simulation capabilities that connect all the major physics as well as to the trusted partnerships that we have built with our enterprise customers. 
Moving to products. We advanced our strategy of Pervasive Simulation with our recent delivery of ANSYS 2021 release 1 to our customers. With R1, engineers can harness the advances in simulation technology, together with ever-increasing computing power to drive new levels of product innovation. This comprehensive release features advances across our entire integrated multiphysics portfolio and our simulation platform, including in ANSYS Cloud, where customers can now scale beyond 1,000 cores for a single job. In ANSYS Discovery, which now includes automated thermal analysis to predict fluid and solid thermal behaviors for electronic cooling and heat management devices. And ANSYS Sherlock, where customers can now incorporate ANSYS mechanical's random vibration analysis into their design for reliability workflow, thereby improving product reliability and lifetime. 
Another key element of R1 is ANSYS HFSS Mesh fusion. This breakthrough solution simplifies the development of modern electronic products, which are incredibly complex systems consisting of multiple interacting components. Today, engineers can analyze these systems using 1 of 2 suboptimal techniques, either individual component simulation with manual combination, which can be Arrapo or a 1 size fits all approach, which can result in long simulation times. Using ANSYS HFSS mesh fusions game-changing technology, an engineer can solve each component at a level of fidelity most relevant for that component and then HFSS automatically fuses the results. This virtually eradicates the costs and the risks of traditional methods, enabling engineers to efficiently design and optimize complex products. Samsung Electronics is using HFSS mesh fusion to create optimal designs and to shrink design cycle times and costs for its next-generation flat screen televisions. The electronics giant uses this innovative technology to develop advanced designs that were previously unimaginable. 
Moving to M&A. In Q4, we closed our acquisition of Analytical Graphics, Inc., or AGI. With AGI, we will be able to address a broader market called digital mission engineering, which combines mission simulation and analysis from AGI with component and system-level simulation from ANSYS. Based on a third-party market analysis and primary interviews with industry experts, we believe that the AGI acquisition increases ANSYS' total addressable market by $800 million. That market is being fueled by the replacement of open source code, unsustainable in-house code and the ongoing growth in the number of missions. Our combined portfolio will enable customers to simulate up and down the stack starting at the chip level and going all the way up to customers' entire mission, increasing the likelihood of success and saving them time, money and other crucial resources. 
This week, we announced a relationship with Keysight, which connects AGI's mission analysis software with Keysight's high fidelity RS systems modeling capability. This partnership builds on an existing relationship, which empowers engineers to evaluate mission level behavior and is a key enabler for aerospace applications, amongst others. PTC, another partner, continues to see success with its OEM of ANSYS technology. In its most recent earnings call, PTC reported that Creo powered by ANSYS products grew bookings by more than 20% in the quarter. The company highlighted 1 such deal at Shock linger, which added Creo simulation live to help spark innovation and decrease product development cycle times. 
As we look ahead to 2021, I'd like to reflect on the COVID-19 pandemic and put it in context of the ANSYS business. COVID had an adverse impact on our 2020 results, most pronounced in Q2 and Q3 with some customers choosing to be cautious with their spending. However, our strong execution in the back half of the year, including the record q4 performance, resulted in ACV above the high end of our updated May guidance and within the originally established range for the year. We are seeing a continuation of Q4's cautious optimism in our customer base with the expectation that the economic pressures of the pandemic will start to ease in the second half of 2021, but tempered by concerns with virus mutations and vaccine rollout schedules. 
The takeaway is that we're assuming greater uncertainty in the timing of sales activities than we would have, had this been a non-COVID year. We are also planning for 2021 to be heavily back-end loaded. Similar to or even slightly more pronounced in 2020. And we expect a wider range of outcomes in our full year projections as was the case in 2020. You will hear more about our guidance for 2021 shortly. 
Let me now move to the long-term to when the pandemic is behind us. While we are not in a position to quantify these considerations, I believe that some customers will cut back during the pandemic will increase spending in R&D and simulation to compensate for other investments in 2020. More important, however, I believe that we will see a number of tailwinds that serve to increase the post pandemic market growth rates as compared with our pre-pandemic projections. First, in a recent survey of nearly 900 executives and managers across industries, the firm McKinsey found the pandemic may have accelerated digital transformation by as much as a decade. I believe this is particularly relevant for our customers and that they will hasten their digital transformations post-pandemic. In the process driving increased and deeper use of simulation. 
The pandemic proved that R&D engineers are effective when working from home. And that they can use simulation to successfully develop products even with no access to their physical labs. As companies move to hybrid work models post pandemic, they must accelerate their digital transformations to replace legacy product development processes with modern tools and techniques. Multiphysics simulation with its core value proposition of helping to accelerate time to market and to deliver cost savings will be key to these transformations. 
Next, the pandemic seems to have pushed customers to accelerate roadmaps and to innovate faster in areas such as telecommunications and consumer electronics. We are also seeing increased R&D in the creation of eco-friendly products such as electric vehicles and lightweight, fuel-efficient aircraft engines, as we discussed in our last earnings call. All of these products are sophisticated and complex and require integrated multiphysics simulation for design and development. That will continue to drive increased post pandemic demand across our entire portfolio, including our newly acquired AGI mission offerings. 
To summarize, despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic, Q4 was an outstanding quarter, marked by record financial results. Looking long term, we believe that the pandemic may actually cause our total addressable market to go faster than our pre-pandemic projections. This makes me confident that as the market leader, ANSYS will be able to continue to drive strong and profitable long-term growth. 
Our next speaker is Maria Shields. As you may know, Maria has been our CFO since 1998. And for those of you counting, that's 90 quarterly earnings calls. She's been instrumental in guiding ANSYS on a remarkable journey from our initial public offering in 1996 to our status today as a simulation industry leader. And it's very fitting that we have delivered record results in her last full quarter as CFO. On March 1, she will transition into a new role of Senior Vice President of Administration, where she will focus on company culture, talent and technology to help us operate at even greater efficiencies. 
Former board member, Nicole Anasenes will succeed Maria as CFO on March 1. With her experience in the tech sector as well as the knowledge of ANSYS, Nicole has hit the ground running since joining ANSYS full-time in December. In addition to the traditional CFO responsibilities, Nicole will directly oversee our M&A function as well as ANSYS' digital transformation. Nicole was CFO and COO at Squarespace, she was CFO at Infor, and spent 17 years with IBM in various leadership positions in finance, mergers and acquisitions and market development including as CFO of IBM software Middleware business and its cloud business. I'll now turn the call over to Maria to discuss our Q4 and 2020 financials, and then to Nicole to give details around the 2021 outlook and assumptions for the year. Maria?"

I truly appreciate the kind words and your ongoing support and partnership over the past 4 years. Hello, everyone. We are very pleased to report another strong quarter, resulting in record financial performance for both the quarter and the year. I'll spend a few minutes walking through an overview of the Q4 financial highlights. And then I'll turn the call over to Nicole to add qualitative and quantitative color around our initial outlook and key assumptions for the first quarter and full year 2021. Before I get into the details of our financial highlights, I would like to take a moment to say thank you to the entire ANSYS team. Your focus on execution collaboration and ongoing commitment to customer excellence enabled us to finish with both a record quarter and year across both operational and financial fronts. Despite the many uncertainties and disruptions that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also very excited about the closing of the AGI acquisition in early December. And the positive progress that the teams have made on integration activities. We closed the quarter with total revenue of $628 million or constant currency growth of 24%, and  operating margin and EPS results that were both well above the high end of our Q4 guidance. This is quite a testament to the strength and durability of the ANSYS business model. Particularly when you consider the strong comparable of Q4 2019. Let me also add that consistent with every quarter of this past year, our revenue results as we closed out 2020 and were driven by solid sales execution. 
Other key financial metrics for the quarter continue, with 20% constant currency growth in ACV to a total of $666 million, of which 83% was from recurring sources. This compares to 78% in last year's fourth quarter. This is a new record for Q4 with respect to both total ACV and the percentage that is attributable to recurring sources. Q4's revenue results reflect the continued trend in solid lease sales that we've been experiencing throughout 2020, with a record 54% constant currency increase in lease license revenue. For the first time in 2020, in the fourth quarter, we reported a return to growth in the paid up software license line with 11% growth in constant currency. This yielded 38% constant currency growth in our software license revenue. The increase in lease license sales, combined with high renewal rates on maintenance contracts contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q4 total of $967 million, an 11% increase over last year's comparable balance. The strong top line results, combined with our continued focus on fiscal discipline, helped to drive a fourth quarter gross margin of 92% and an operating margin of 52%, which finished well above the high end of our q4 guidance. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q4 was 19.5%, in line with our expectations. 
The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $2.96 and which also finished well above the high end of our guidance. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the fourth quarter with cash flow from operations that totaled $174 million, a 25% increase over last year's fourth quarter. The quarter's cash flow benefited from very strong receivables collection as well as the deferral of certain tax payments into 2021. And this translated to a new record of $547 million for the full year. We closed the year with a total of $913 million in cash and short-term investments, and a total debt balance of $798 million. 
Let me just close by saying that we are extremely fortunate to have finished 2020 with the best financial performance in our 50 year history. These results are a testament to the resiliency of the ANSYS business model, and to the tenacity, dedication and hard work of our employees, customers and partners. Now let me turn the call over to Nicole, who will continue with the topic of guidance. Nicole?"

First, I want to echo Maria's congratulations and gratitude to the entire ANSYS team for such an amazing 2020. And together, we delivered stellar outcomes in the face of unprecedented business uncertainty, the 1 ANSYS culture of teamwork",1131,"Thank you, Maria. First, I want to echo Maria's congratulations and gratitude to the entire ANSYS team for such an amazing 2020. And together, we delivered stellar outcomes in the face of unprecedented business uncertainty, the 1 ANSYS culture of teamwork and commitment to customer success that drove those results is 1 of the many reasons I am so thrilled to join the team. 
Looking into 2021, I want to share some of the key dynamics we have factored into our guidance. Due to the continued uncertainty about the timing and impact of a return to normal business operations post the pandemic. Our guidance ranges continue to be wider than those we have historically provided pre pandemic. We anticipate that the current environment will continue through the first half of the year and expect a recovery in the business environment during the second half of the year with increased global economic stimulus and the global availability of vaccines. We continue to believe the impact will have a disproportionate effect on our small and medium-sized customers versus larger customers throughout 2021. We estimate trade restrictions between the U.S. and China have adversely impact our annual sales by approximately   $25 million  . While the trade environment has been rapidly changing and may continue to do so under the new U.S. administration, our outlook factors in the existing trade restrictions and dynamics that are in place today. We are expecting to see a continued mix shift from perpetual licenses to lease licenses as customers continue to find the flexibility of lease licensing and operating on the cloud more appealing. The reduced capital outlay associated with the leasing model is also more appealing to certain customers during a time of economic uncertainty. Our blended renewal rates across maintenance and leases have historically been approximately   90% ], with the renewal rates on maintenance agreements being even higher. Our renewal rates have remained high, with only a slight reduction as compared to our historical experience. And our assumptions are that they will tick up slightly in 2021 toward historical levels. We continue to adjust our spending to reflect our expectations for the pace at which economic recovery will occur. While balancing the need to invest for the long-term opportunity that we see ahead. We have also maintained and intend to continue our commitment to invest in our acquired companies as well as R&D in certain digital transformation projects as those projects are critical to our ability to operate efficiently and scale the business for future growth. We completed the acquisition of AGI on December 1, and have factored the expected impact into guidance, which translates to approximately 1 negative point of margin. We expect this dilutive impact to be the most pronounced in the first year post acquisition, consistent with our past experiences and approach to integration. As we look ahead to 2021, we expect to see a very similar seasonal pattern as we've seen in prior years, with a disproportionately large Q4, driven by customer planning and year-end spending patterns. 
In Q4 2020, we saw an outsized shift in customer behavior in December relative to what has historically occurred. There was a significant and unexpected acceleration in customer decisions to both purchase and pay. We exceeded the high end of our q4 2020 guidance on ACV by $26 million with 20% constant currency growth and full year 2020 cash flow guidance by $72 million and grew   9%  . The our strong finish leaves us optimistic and reinforces our belief that customers view simulation is essential and will continue to invest in their own digital transformation. Our full-year 2021 guidance reflects an improvement in momentum in both ACV and cash flow. However, some of the impact of that momentum started in December of 2020. And which was seen in the overachievement above the high end of our guidance. While this momentum is positive, the dynamic also negatively affects 2021 growth comparisons for key financial metrics. For example, the $26 million of overachievement in ACV creates a   2%   headwind to 2021 ACV growth. Although the environment remains fluid, and we are still in the midst of the pandemic, we believe that if post COVID economic recovery and the current trade environment remains in line with our expectations, our long-term guidance of $2 billion ACV in 2022 is attainable. 
Now let me get to the specifics of our guidance. In full-year 2021, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of   $1,790,000,000   to   $1,875,000,000    which is growth of 6% to 11% or 3% to 8% in constant currency, and EPS of $6.44 to $6.92. For Q1 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $360 million, which is 8% to 17% growth or 5% to 12% in constant currency. And EPS of $0.73 to $0.90. Our outlook for full year 2021 is to maintain industry-leading operating margins, which we expect to be in the range of 40% to 41%, and  Q1 2021 operating margin in the range of 24% to 27.5%. The lower Q1 2021 operating margins reflect the seasonal nature of our business, with a relatively lower revenue contribution in the quarter, similar to what we experienced in Q1 of last year with an operating margin below 30%. 
For full-year 2021, we expect ACV in the range of $1,750,000,000 $1,825,000,000. Which translates to 8% to 13% growth or 6% to 11% in constant currency. As we mentioned earlier, we expect ACV to be highly skewed towards the fourth quarter. We are expecting to deliver full year operating cash flow in a range of $475 million to $515 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV and profitability. It considers the continued trend of request for extended payment terms negotiated in new contracts as well as the timing of certain early collections and deferred tax payments in 2020 and that collectively raised full year 2020 cash flow and lowers the full year 2021 outlook. Additional details related to the cash flow guidance and specific impact to full year 2020 and 2021 and are more fully provided in our prepared remarks document. Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q1 and full-year 2021 are also contained in the prepared remarks document. I am so proud of and thrilled to be part of the team who has delivered such outstanding results despite so many macro headwinds and business disruptions during a time of personal hardship for many. I am confident that with this team, we will be able to continue to deliver on our strategy of pervasive simulation and help our customers achieve their innovation and sustainability goals.

Is this expectations for all the different components of the TAM, given the core simulation and then the growth opportunities in IoT and electrification and others?

So my comments very specifically in the script on TAM, one was around the increase in TAM as a result of the AGI acquisition, which which we said added about $800 million to our total addressable market. The other comments about tailwinds that I spoke of were more -- were harder to quantify. As I said in the script, the point about digital transformation is that we have seen we have seen customers embrace simulation more during the pandemic. And certainly, with the recognition that their engineers could work from home effectively away from corporate labs, that's also been another tailwind for the use of simulation. So we expect to see that continue, certainly with the value proposition of simulation being able to drive product to market faster and save money. So that's a tailwind. And the second 1 that I pointed to was, in certain areas, we've seen increased levels of investment. Now those are -- I specifically call our telecommunications and electronics consumer, and those are areas which require multiphysics simulation analysis. So it really reflects on the multi physical nature of our portfolio, which I think was the question that you were asking. But also, the other interesting thing that we've noticed, which I pointed to in the comments, is in the area of eco-friendly products. And I'm not sure if it's coincident or there's a coevality here with the pandemic. But with the -- in that area, we've seen certainly increased levels of investment whether it's electric vehicle, which we've identified and pointed to before, but also on other things like lightweighting and eco-friendly aircraft engines and others. And so this area continues to be also an area of increased growth and something that requires multi physic simulation. So that was the context of my comments, Jackson."

If you look at usage, the demand for ANSYS Cloud continue to increase. And we've seen usage increasing by over 100% between 2019 and 2020. And what's interesting, and I think I mentioned this in the last call as well, we've had customers who've used ANSYS cloud and reached a much more efficient than solution they would have on-premises. For example, Rockwell Automation, I think I mentioned, is using ANSYS Cloud to accelerate its product development process, and they showed that they were able to reduce simulations run times by about 50%, which allows, obviously, their engineers to solve problems more accurately. And the reason for that is because ANSYS cloud is optimized for the ANSYS workload, and we've done some work to make sure that the azure infrastructure and which it runs as appropriate, and we can take advantage of the latest hardware and interconnect that Azure has available. So absolutely, ANSYS Cloud is certainly something that are customers taking advantage of during this time. We've made the majority of our flagships available on ANSYS Cloud, mechanical, fluids, electromagnetics, et cetera. I just talked about the scale out that we have available there on the script as well as things like new workloads like optics, SPEOs, VRX. So we're seeing the usage across all of our physics, and we're obviously seeing greater usage. And that, coupled with the flexibility that we have, which allows customers to bring their own license or bring their own hardware license or software license or just moving in pure SaaS world, that hybrid flexibility that we can afford, I think gives customers a lot of options. That being said, while we're excited about the cloud offering, and we're very encouraged by the rapid progress, I think it's important to note that the majority of our customers today use ANSYS products on-premises in their own data centers or in their own private cloud, and so ANSYS Cloud is obviously growing rapidly, but it's still a very small piece of our business today and for the foreseeable future."

There's a lot that we could go through, and I'm -- I, maybe in the interest of time, I'll just focus on a couple of things. When you think about our journey as a company, we've gone from providing point technologies back when we started like structures. Over the years, we've brought together a comprehensive set of physics through a combination of acquisitions as well as organic development. And now we have a full-fledged set of physics that are integrated together. And it's this integration capability across all of these physics that's profoundly important. And we've continued to add to that with materials technologies, for example, with optimization capabilities, et cetera. And that has led to the building up of our platform capability, which is profoundly important to be able to address and provide that agility to support different industry applications. And because we have all of these multiphysics capabilities integrated together and exposed on a platform, that makes it easier for our customers as well as our own ACE engineers to build industry-specific or customer-specific solutions that take advantage of the core capabilities that we provide as well as integrate with core components that might be available from outside of our own ecosystem. So that's been the direction that we're pursuing. Our technology is available both on-premises and in the cloud. And I think we have a very robust and a very strong technical underpinnings to be able to support not only the more traditional use case where you're dealing with the use of simulation of the tool, but also the use of simulation within as part of an integrated platform to deliver value-added applications to customers. And you're seeing this in some of the announcements that we've made. You referenced 1 of them with respect to BMW. We've made some announcements in the health care space and others where we're working with partners who are able to provide application-specific intelligence that wraps on top of our simulation solutions because of the way we're that architecting our platforms and our capability. 
Now with respect to the long-term road map, I would refer you, 1 of those key elements is the platform. And obviously, we just talked about platform a second ago. Another area that perhaps might be interesting is AI/ML I where we've talked about the use of machine learning, we see that -- we continue to make investments in AI/ML capability because we really see AI/ML as an orthogonal but supportive technology simulation. Simulation makes AI/ML better. The insight from AI/ML better and AI/ML can support insights from simulation. And you see this, you see these technologies and techniques already being incorporated into our products. You see this, for example, in our semiconductor portfolio, and you continue to see this integrated into other aspects of our products, whether it comes to usability, whether it comes to helping customers or helping engineers navigate the solution space and so forth. And we can obviously go into more details, but in the interest of time, let's just leave it at that."

So your question is really how we are integrating with some of these larger customers and how are we working with them? So if you recall, when we went through the go-to-market transformation that we spoke off a couple of years ago, and when we really started to accelerate in the last couple of years, it was around putting together a traditional customer pyramid where we had enterprise customers at the top of the pyramid and enterprise customers were deemed to be such, not only because they had significant spending powers and have large and complex problems to solve. And therefore, we're spending a lot of money on R&D. But also because we had enterprise customers who were who are being supported by specialized teams. And so we would have -- we were able to allocate to these enterprise customers, dedicated account management, both on the technical side as well as the sales side to help navigate through the account. That process has been underway for a few years. When you -- and so that gives us within some of these large customers, it gives us great relationships and a very good understanding of what's going on and we've been able to help educate the customers about the capabilities that ANSYS can provide. That, coupled with the other comment I made about digital transformation, clearly, this is an important area for customers and in the digital transformation of that product life cycle continues to be important. The pandemic, as I mentioned earlier, accelerated that and made it clear and manifest customers that they need to enable their engineers to be able to work from anywhere. And that's obviously possible through a digital thread and simulation in some sense is the most -- the Purest digital representation of a product. And so that's the second sort of growth spread about the recognition that people can be effective, engineers can be effective to taking advantage of the technology from wherever. I think the third and perhaps the most important is that, look, at the end of the day, simulation provides tremendous value to customers. They are -- we've talked about this for a long time. We've said, look, we can help you accelerate product to market. that's 1 area, that drives top line revenue growth. And we've also said, we can help you save money. We can help you save money because you don't have to build physical prototypes, you can do the proverbial more with less. And that also resonates with customers, especially in tough economic times. So when you put all of this stuff together, it's no wonder that we're seeing some large deals from customers. This is not accidental. This has been planned. This has been multi-years and planning to make sure that we build these relationships to help them with their digital transformation and to continue to drive investments in the portfolio and to continue to show the value that simulation we provide."

And we talked about a number of areas. We talked about the core business. We talked about, which is the historical use of simulation and the design and validation phase of the product life cycle, we talked about high-growth solutions like electric vehicles or electrification, autonomy, IoT, 5G. And then we talked about simulation being used in nontraditional use cases and things like predictive maintenance through digital twins and so forth. And what we did when we presented when we presented that, as we pointed out that the -- that there was more predictability on the base case use cases of simulation as it's historically been. But in some of these longer-term opportunities, in particular, simulation being used, for example, in predictive maintenance and digital twins, we pointed out that there was a significant amount of variability, depending on the rate of adoption of digital technologies and we talked about how that was being affected by assumptions you make about the pace and rate of deployment of capabilities that may have historically not used simulation. So that's the -- that's where we were a couple of years ago. The observations that we've seen in the pandemic, as I said in my script, have been very specifically on certain areas. The digital transformation comment is real. Customers are recognizing they need to spend more -- they pay more attention to the digital transformation. We've talked a lot about this on the call already. And so that, we believe, represents an aggregate tailwind, an acceleration of activities that may have taken place already, but those that's an acceleration. and when you start to think about some of these other areas like electronics, consumer electronic -- consumer electronics, telecommunications, again, the pandemic caused people to think more about what does it mean for the communications infrastructure how do I interact with my office working remotely, et cetera, and you started to see that level of interest in the end markets, which has obviously translated into increased demand in the electronics and high-tech vertical for us, which translates across to a number of our products. And as I said, in certain areas like green, it's not clear that it's directly related to the pandemic, but we continue to see increased focus on this. Perhaps it's because of broader recognition of the importance of ESG initiatives, maybe it's because of the pandemic, but we're continuing to see more activities there. And again, this entire area of getting to an eco-friendly set of products accelerates activities that might otherwise have taken longer, come in a little bit earlier. So I think the core recognition in the elements of the market remain what we had talked about, the question is timing. And as I said also in the call, it's hard for us to quantify what the effects of these tailwinds are going to be. So I want to be very clear that we see this anecdotally, but it's hard -- we are not quantifying the effects of these tailwinds at this point."

I think in the past, ANSYS has talked about how R&D budgets are 1 of the first budgets to be restored out of the downturns and ANSYS as a company typically sees kind of the inflection faster than maybe some of your peers in the industrial space.

But when I look at your guidance, it implies that ACV growth doesn't really get much better on an organic basis next year. So I guess, what's driving that? Are there certain end markets or GEOs that you're seeing caution? Or is it just conservatism? I know there is a CFO -- with the CFO transition, just trying to understand what would drive such a relatively cautious outlook given the strong results you put up here in the quarter?"

And I'd say the first thing I'd point out is what Maria spoke about, which is significant overachievement of ACV and therefore, revenue in the rest of the P&L in the quarter. And so that overachievement on the ACV side alone is about a 2-point headwind to growth year-to-year. And so what we're seeing really -- what we saw in the fourth quarter leaves us a lot of optimism that things -- once that we get through the capitulation of the pandemic that things that there's a strong demand for simulation that customers are accelerating their digital transformation and that we are well positioned based on the investments we've made in the portfolio. Over the past couple of years because we've been investing through the pandemic that come out of it with a position of strength that we're going to benefit from it. I think what we're expecting to see and what's baked into the guidance is that, generally speaking, the first half is going to continue to have its ups and downs really because of COVID uncertainty. And by the second half of the year, we expect to see more momentum in economic activity as things start to open up and government continue to do the right thing to support economic development. And so we have visibility into the first quarter as to the full year pipeline. And the guidance really reflects the strength of the pipeline. And like other years, we're expecting to see it more back-end loaded from an ACV and a revenue perspective, driven by the timing of large multiyear deals and customer planning activities. So from our perspective, sitting here in February, it's just a little difficult to predict such a significant level of overachievement that we saw in the fourth quarter, sitting where we're at right now. But the situation is solid and will continue engaging with you throughout the year to update it as we do more."

Q4 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, capping off the most successful year in our 50-year history.

Q4 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, capping off the most successful year in our 50-year history. We beat our financial guidance for the quarter across all key metrics, including revenue, ACV, earnings per share and cash flow. 
Q4 saw stronger-than-expected sales activity, which we believe was driven by a combination of deferred customer spending from earlier quarters, greater-than-expected end of year customer budgets in the Americas and in EMEA, coupled with increased albeit cautious optimism in the economy, thanks to the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines and expected government stimulus activities. 
During Q4, we closed nearly 100 deals over $1 million, a total that includes 8 deals in the 8 figures. One of those agreements was the second largest deal in the history of the company, a 5-year $79 million contract with an enterprise customer. While economic conditions forces global company to reduce expenses across the business, it's renewed and expanded its use of ANSYS core solver technology worldwide. And added newly acquired ANSYS technologies, including electronics reliability and dynamic analysis. This contract reflects the customer's long-term decision to standardize on ANSYS technology over other vendors and to reduce its reliance on physical testing and is a testament to ANSYS' market leadership. 
As we have consistently said, our years have become increasingly back-end loaded due primarily to the timing of large deals. This steady progression has allowed us sales and operations teams to support an increasingly higher magnitude of business in the fourth quarter of each year. Our strong q4 2020 execution drove record quarterly ACV which was over $100 million higher than the previous largest quarter in Q4 of 2019. The strength and volume of business that we closed in Q4 resulted in annual ACV growth of almost 10% in constant currency
The year developed largely as we had predicted in our May 2020 call with regards to our performance by industry, geography and company size. During the year, we exceeded our expectations with enterprise customers including closing the 3 largest deals in our history. That speaks to the importance of ANSYS' integrated multiphysics simulation capabilities that connect all the major physics as well as to the trusted partnerships that we have built with our enterprise customers.  
Moving to products. We advanced our strategy of Pervasive Simulation with our recent delivery of ANSYS 2021 release 1 to our customers. With R1, engineers can harness the advances in simulation technology, together with ever-increasing computing power to drive new levels of product innovation. This comprehensive release features advances across our entire integrated multiphysics portfolio and our simulation platform, including in ANSYS Cloud, where customers can now scale beyond 1,000 cores for a single job. In ANSYS Discovery, which now includes automated thermal analysis to predict fluid and solid thermal behaviors for electronic cooling and heat management devices. And ANSYS Sherlock, where customers can now incorporate ANSYS Mechanical's random vibration analysis into their design for reliability workflow, thereby improving product reliability and lifetime.  
Another key element of R1 is ANSYS HFSS Mesh Fusion. This breakthrough solution simplifies the development of modern electronic products, which are incredibly complex systems consisting of multiple interacting components. Today, engineers can analyze these systems using 1 of 2 suboptimal techniques, either individual component simulation with manual combination, which can be error prone or a one-size-fits-all approach, which can result in long simulation time. Using ANSYS HFSS Mesh Fusions game-changing technology, an engineer can solve each component at a level of fidelity most relevant for that component and then HFSS automatically fuses the results. This virtually eradicates the costs and the risks of traditional methods, enabling engineers to efficiently design and optimize complex products. Samsung Electronics is using HFSS Mesh Fusion to create optimal designs and to shrink design cycle times and costs for its next-generation flat screen televisions. The electronics giant uses this innovative technology to develop advanced designs that were previously unimaginable.  
Moving to M&A. In Q4, we closed our acquisition of Analytical Graphics, Inc., or AGI. With AGI, we will be able to address a broader market called digital mission engineering, which combines mission simulation and analysis from AGI with component and system-level simulation from ANSYS. Based on a third-party market analysis and primary interviews with industry experts, we believe that the AGI acquisition increases ANSYS' total addressable market by $800 million. That market is being fueled by the replacement of open-source code, unsustainable in-house code and the ongoing growth in the number of missions. 
Our combined portfolio will enable customers to simulate up and down the stack starting at the chip level and going all the way up to customers' entire mission, increasing the likelihood of success and saving them time, money and other crucial resources. 
This week, we announced a relationship with Keysight, which connects AGI's mission analysis software with Keysight's high fidelity RS systems modeling capability. This partnership builds on an existing relationship, which empowers engineers to evaluate mission level behavior and is a key enabler for aerospace applications, amongst others. 
PTC, another partner, continues to see success with its OEM of ANSYS technology. In its most recent earnings call, PTC reported that Creo powered by ANSYS products grew bookings by more than 20% in the quarter. The company highlighted one such deal at Shock linger, which added Creo simulation live to help spark innovation and decrease product development cycle times. 
As we look ahead to 2021, I'd like to reflect on the COVID-19 pandemic and put it in context of the ANSYS business. COVID had an adverse impact on our 2020 results, most pronounced in Q2 and Q3 with some customers choosing to be cautious with their spending. However, our strong execution in the back half of the year, including the record Q4 performance, resulted in ACV above the high end of our updated May guidance and within the originally established range for the year. We are seeing a continuation of Q4's cautious optimism in our customer base with the expectation that the economic pressures of the pandemic will start to ease in the second half of 2021, but tempered by concerns with virus mutations and vaccine rollout schedules. 
The takeaway is that we're assuming greater uncertainty in the timing of sales activities than we would have, had this been a non-COVID year. We are also planning for 2021 to be heavily back-end loaded. Similar to or even slightly more pronounced in 2020. And we expect a wider range of outcomes in our full year projections as was the case in 2020. You will hear more about our guidance for 2021 shortly. 
Let me now move to the long-term to when the pandemic is behind us. While we are not in a position to quantify these considerations, I believe that some customers will cut back during the pandemic, will increase spending in R&D and simulation to compensate for other investments in 2020. More important, however, I believe that we will see a number of tailwinds that serve to increase the post pandemic market growth rates as compared with our pre-pandemic projections. 
First, in a recent survey of nearly 900 executives and managers across industries, the firm McKinsey found the pandemic may have accelerated digital transformation by as much as a decade. I believe this is particularly relevant for our customers and that they will hasten their digital transformations post-pandemic. In the process driving increased and deeper use of simulation. 
The pandemic proved that R&D engineers are effective when working from home. And that they can use simulation to successfully develop products even with no access to their physical labs. As companies move to hybrid work models post pandemic, they must accelerate their digital transformations to replace legacy product development processes with modern tools and techniques. Multiphysics simulation with its core value proposition of helping to accelerate time to market and to deliver cost savings will be key to these transformations. 
Next, the pandemic seems to have pushed customers to accelerate roadmaps and to innovate faster in areas such as telecommunications and consumer electronics. We are also seeing increased R&D in the creation of eco-friendly products such as electric vehicles and lightweight, fuel-efficient aircraft engines, as we discussed in our last earnings call. All of these products are sophisticated and complex and require integrated multiphysics simulation for design and development. That will continue to drive increased post-pandemic demand across our entire portfolio, including our newly acquired AGI mission offerings. 
To summarize, despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic, Q4 was an outstanding quarter, marked by record financial results. Looking long term, we believe that the pandemic may actually cause our total addressable market to go faster than our pre-pandemic projections. This makes me confident that as the market leader, ANSYS will be able to continue to drive strong and profitable long-term growth. 
Our next speaker is Maria Shields. As you may know, Maria has been our CFO since 1998. And for those of you counting, that's 90 quarterly earnings calls. She's been instrumental in guiding ANSYS on a remarkable journey from our initial public offering in 1996 to our status today as a simulation industry leader. And it's very fitting that we have delivered record results in her last full quarter as CFO. On March 1, she will transition into a new role of Senior Vice President of Administration, where she will focus on company culture, talent and technology to help us operate at even greater efficiencies. 
Former board member, Nicole Anasenes will succeed Maria as CFO on March 1. With her experience in the tech sector as well as the knowledge of ANSYS, Nicole has hit the ground running since joining ANSYS full-time in December. In addition to the traditional CFO responsibilities, Nicole will directly oversee our M&A function as well as ANSYS' digital transformation. Nicole was CFO and COO at Squarespace, she was CFO at Infor, and spent 17 years with IBM in various leadership positions in finance, mergers and acquisitions and market development including as CFO of IBM's software middleware business and its cloud business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Maria to discuss our Q4 and 2020 financials, and then to Nicole to give details around the 2021 outlook and assumptions for the year. Maria?"

I truly appreciate the kind words and your ongoing support and partnership over the past 4 years. 
Hello, everyone. We are very pleased to report another strong quarter, resulting in record financial performance for both the quarter and the year. I'll spend a few minutes walking through an overview of the Q4 financial highlights. And then I'll turn the call over to Nicole to add qualitative and quantitative color around our initial outlook and key assumptions for the first quarter and full year 2021. 
Before I get into the details of our financial highlights, I would like to take a moment to say thank you to the entire ANSYS team. Your focus on execution, collaboration and ongoing commitment to customer excellence, enabled us to finish with both a record quarter and year across both operational and financial fronts. Despite the many uncertainties and disruptions that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We are also very excited about the closing of the AGI acquisition in early December. And the positive progress that the teams have made on integration activities. 
We closed the quarter with total revenue of $628 million or constant currency growth of 24%, and operating margin and EPS results that were both well above the high end of our Q4 guidance. This is quite a testament to the strength and durability of the ANSYS business model. Particularly when you consider the strong comparable of Q4 2019. Let me also add that consistent with every quarter of this past year, our revenue results as we closed out 2020 and were driven by solid sales execution. 
Other key financial metrics for the quarter continue, with 20% constant currency growth in ACV to a total of $666 million, of which 83% was from recurring sources. This compares to 78% in last year's fourth quarter. This is a new record for Q4 with respect to both total ACV and the percentage that is attributable to recurring sources. 
Q4's revenue results reflect the continued trend in solid lease sales that we've been experiencing throughout 2020, with a record 54% constant currency increase in lease license revenue. 
For the first time in 2020, in the fourth quarter, we reported a return to growth in the paid up software license line with 11% growth in constant currency. This yielded [78%] constant currency growth in our software license revenue. The increase in lease license sales, combined with high renewal rates on maintenance contracts contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q4 total of $967 million, an 11% increase over last year's comparable balance. The strong top line results, combined with our continued focus on fiscal discipline, helped to drive a fourth quarter gross margin of 92% and an operating margin of 52%, which finished well above the high end of our Q4 guidance. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q4 was 19.5%, in line with our expectations. 
The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $2.96 and which also finished well above the high end of our guidance. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the fourth quarter with cash flow from operations that totaled $174 million, a 25% increase over last year's fourth quarter. The quarter's cash flow benefited from very strong receivables collection as well as the deferral of certain tax payments into 2021. And this translated to a new record of $547 million for the full year. We closed the year with a total of $913 million in cash and short-term investments, and a total debt balance of $798 million. 
Let me just close by saying that we are extremely fortunate to have finished 2020 with the best financial performance in our 50 year history. These results are a testament to the resiliency of the ANSYS business model, and to the tenacity, dedication and hard work of our employees, customers and partners. 
Now let me turn the call over to Nicole, who will continue with the topic of guidance. Nicole?"

First, I want to echo Maria's congratulations and gratitude to the entire ANSYS team for such an amazing 2020. And together, we delivered stellar outcomes in the face of unprecedented business uncertainty, the 1 ANSYS culture of teamwork",1132,"Thank you, Maria. First, I want to echo Maria's congratulations and gratitude to the entire ANSYS team for such an amazing 2020. And together, we delivered stellar outcomes in the face of unprecedented business uncertainty, the 1 ANSYS culture of teamwork and commitment to customer success that drove those results is 1 of the many reasons I am so thrilled to join the team. 
Looking into 2021, I want to share some of the key dynamics we have factored into our guidance. Due to the continued uncertainty about the timing and impact of a return to normal business operations post the pandemic, our guidance ranges continue to be wider than those we have historically provided pre pandemic. We anticipate that the current environment will continue through the first half of the year and expect a recovery in the business environment during the second half of the year with increased global economic stimulus and the global availability of vaccines. 
We continue to believe the impact will have a disproportionate effect on our small and medium-sized customers versus larger customers throughout 2021. We estimate trade restrictions between the U.S. and China have adversely impact our annual sales by approximately [$25 million]. 
While the trade environment has been rapidly changing and may continue to do so under the new U.S. administration, our outlook factors in the existing trade restrictions and dynamics that are in place today. We are expecting to see a continued mix shift from perpetual licenses to lease licenses as customers continue to find the flexibility of lease licensing and operating on the cloud more appealing. The reduced capital outlay associated with the leasing model is also more appealing to certain customers during a time of economic uncertainty. 
Our blended renewal rates across maintenance and leases have historically been approximately 90%, with the renewal rates on maintenance agreements being even higher. Our renewal rates have remained high, with only a slight reduction as compared to our historical experience. And our assumptions are that they will pick up slightly in 2021 toward historical levels. 
We continue to adjust our spending to reflect our expectations for the pace at which economic recovery will occur while balancing the need to invest for the long-term opportunity that we see ahead. 
We have also maintained and intend to continue our commitment to invest in our acquired companies as well as R&D in certain digital transformation projects as those projects are critical to our ability to operate efficiently and scale the business for future growth. We completed the acquisition of AGI on December 1, and have factored the expected impact into guidance, which translates to approximately 1 negative point of margin. We expect this dilutive impact to be the most pronounced in the first year post acquisition, consistent with our past experiences and approach to integration. 
As we look ahead to 2021, we expect to see a very similar seasonal pattern as we've seen in prior years, with a disproportionately large Q4, driven by customer planning and year-end spending patterns. 
In Q4 2020, we saw an outsized shift in customer behavior in December relative to what has historically occurred. There was a significant and unexpected acceleration in customer decisions to both purchase and pay. We exceeded the high end of our Q4 2020 guidance on ACV by $26 million with 20% constant currency growth and full year 2020 cash flow guidance by $72 million and grew 9%. 
Our strong finish leaves us optimistic and reinforces our belief that customers view simulation is essential and will continue to invest in their own digital transformation. 
Our full-year 2021 guidance reflects an improvement in momentum in both ACV and cash flow. However, some of the impact of that momentum started in December of 2020, which was seen in the overachievement above the high end of our guidance. While this momentum is positive, the dynamic also negatively affects 2021 growth comparisons for key financial metrics. For example, the $26 million of overachievement in ACV creates a [ 82% ] headwind to 2021 ACV growth. 
Although the environment remains fluid, and we are still in the midst of the pandemic, we believe that if post COVID economic recovery and the current trade environment remains in line with our expectations, our long-term guidance of $2 billion ACV in 2022 is attainable. 
Now let me get to the specifics of our guidance. In full-year 2021, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.790 billion to $1.875 billion, which is growth of 6% to 11% or 3% to 8% in constant currency, and EPS of $6.44 to $6.92. 
For Q1 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $360 million, which is 8% to 17% growth or 5% to 12% in constant currency. And EPS of $0.73 to $0.90. 
Our outlook for full year 2021 is to maintain industry-leading operating margins, which we expect to be in the range of 40% to 41%, and  Q1 2021 operating margin in the range of 24% to 27.5%. The lower Q1 2021 operating margins reflect the seasonal nature of our business, with a relatively lower revenue contribution in the quarter, similar to what we experienced in Q1 of last year with an operating margin below 30%. 
For full-year 2021, we expect ACV in the range of $1.750 billion to $1.825 billion, which translates to 8% to 13% growth or 6% to 11% in constant currency. As we mentioned earlier, we expect ACV to be highly skewed towards the fourth quarter. 
We are expecting to deliver full year operating cash flow in a range of $475 million to $515 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV and profitability. It considers the continued trend of request for extended payment terms negotiated in new contracts as well as the timing of certain early collections and deferred tax payments in 2020 and that collectively raised full year 2020 cash flow and lowers the full year 2021 outlook. 
Additional details related to the cash flow guidance and specific impact to full year 2020 and 2021 are more fully provided in our prepared remarks document. 
Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q1 and full-year 2021 are also contained in the prepared remarks document. 
I am so proud of and thrilled to be part of the team who has delivered such outstanding results despite so many macro headwinds and business disruptions during a time of personal hardship for many. I am confident that with this team, we will be able to continue to deliver on our strategy of pervasive simulation and help our customers achieve their innovation and sustainability goals.

First question, though, is for Ajei and your comments about the TAM growth pre and post-pandemic. So can we just get a little bit more color? Is this expectations for all the different components of the TAM, given the core simulation and then the growth opportunities in IoT and electrification and others? Or were you talking specifically about just maybe 1 or 2 components of that total TAM mix?"

The other comments about",301,"Jack, thanks for the question. So my comments very specifically in the script on TAM, one was around the increase in TAM as a result of the AGI acquisition, which we said added about $800 million to our total addressable market. 
The other comments about tailwinds that I spoke of were more -- were harder to quantify. As I said in the script, the point about digital transformation is that we have seen customers embrace simulation more during the pandemic. And certainly, with the recognition that their engineers could work from home effectively away from corporate labs, that's also been another tailwind for the use of simulation. So we expect to see that continue, certainly with the value proposition of simulation being able to drive product to market faster and save money. So that's a tailwind. 
And the second 1 that I pointed to was, in certain areas, we've seen increased levels of investment. Now those are -- I specifically call our telecommunications and electronics consumer, and those are areas which require multiphysics simulation analysis. So it really reflects on the multi physical nature of our portfolio, which I think was the question that you were asking. 
But also, the other interesting thing that we've noticed, which I pointed to in the comments, is in the area of eco-friendly products. And I'm not sure if it's coincident or there's a coevality here with the pandemic. But with the -- in that area, we've seen certainly increased levels of investment whether it's electric vehicle, which we've identified and pointed to before, but also on other things like lightweighting and eco-friendly aircraft engines and others. And so this area continues to be also an area of increased growth and something that requires multiphysics simulation. So that was the context of my comments, Jackson."

So if your question -- the question was about ANSYS Cloud and I guess usage during the pandemic or during the last year. If you look at usage, the demand for ANSYS Cloud continue to increase. And we've seen usage increasing by over 100% between 2019",366,"Yes. So if your question -- the question was about ANSYS Cloud and I guess usage during the pandemic or during the last year. If you look at usage, the demand for ANSYS Cloud continue to increase. And we've seen usage increasing by over 100% between 2019 and 2020. And what's interesting, and I think I mentioned this in the last call as well, we've had customers who've used ANSYS Cloud and reached a much more efficient than solution they would have on-premises. 
For example, Rockwell Automation, I think I mentioned, is using ANSYS Cloud to accelerate its product development process, and they showed that they were able to reduce simulations run times by about 50%, which allows, obviously, their engineers to solve problems more accurately. And the reason for that is because ANSYS Cloud is optimized for the ANSYS workload, and we've done some work to make sure that the Azure infrastructure and which it runs as appropriate, and we can take advantage of the latest hardware and interconnect that Azure has available. So absolutely, ANSYS Cloud is certainly something that customers taking advantage of during this time. We've made the majority of our flagships available on ANSYS Cloud, mechanical, fluids, electromagnetics, et cetera. I just talked about the scale out that we have available there on the script as well as things like new workloads like OPTIS, SPEOS, VRX. 
So we're seeing the usage across all of our physics, and we're obviously seeing greater usage. And that, coupled with the flexibility that we have, which allows customers to bring their own license or bring their own hardware license or software license or just moving in to a SaaS world, that hybrid flexibility that we can afford, I think gives customers a lot of options. 
That being said, while we're excited about the cloud offering, and we're very encouraged by the rapid progress, I think it's important to note that the majority of our customers today use ANSYS products on-premises in their own data centers or in their own private cloud, and so ANSYS Cloud is obviously growing rapidly, but it's still a very small piece of our business today and for the foreseeable future."

There's a lot that we could go through, and I'm -- I, maybe in the interest of time, I'll just focus on a couple of things. When you think about our journey as a company, we've gone from providing point technologies back when we started like structures. Over the years, we've brought together a comprehensive set of physics through a combination of acquisitions as well as organic development. And now we have a full-fledged set of physics that are integrated together. And it's this integration capability across all of these physics that's profoundly important. And we've continued to add to that with materials technologies, for example, with optimization capabilities, et cetera. And that has led to the building up of our platform capability, which is profoundly important to be able to address and provide that agility to support different industry applications. And because we have all of these multiphysics capabilities integrated together and exposed on a platform, that makes it easier for our customers as well as our own ACE engineers to build industry-specific or customer-specific solutions that take advantage of the core capabilities that we provide as well as integrate with core components that might be available from outside of our own ecosystem. 
So that's been the direction that we're pursuing. Our technology is available both on-premises and in the cloud. And I think we have a very robust and a very strong technical underpinnings to be able to support not only the more traditional use case where you're dealing with. We use the simulation of the tool, but also we the use of simulation within as part of an integrated platform to deliver value-added applications to customers. And you're seeing this in some of the announcements that we've made. You referenced one of them with respect to BMW. We've made some announcements in the health care space and others where we're working with partners who are able to provide application-specific intelligence that wraps on top of our simulation solutions because of the way we're that architecting our platforms and our capability. 
Now with respect to the long-term road map, I would refer you, one of those key elements is the platform. And obviously, we just talked about platform a second ago. Another area that perhaps might be interesting is AI/ML where we've talked about the use of machine learning. We see that we continue to make investments in AI/ML capability because we really see AI/ML as an orthogonal but supportive technology simulation. Simulation makes AI/ML better, the insight from AI/ML better and AI/ML can support insights from simulation. 
And you see this -- you see these technologies and techniques already being incorporated into our products. You see this, for example, in our semiconductor portfolio, and you continue to see this integrated into other aspects of our products, whether it comes to usability, whether it comes to helping customers or helping engineers navigate the solution space and so forth. And we can obviously go into more details, but in the interest of time, let's just leave those there."

So your question is really how we are integrating with some of these larger customers and how are we working with them? So if you recall, when we went through the go-to-market transformation that we spoke off a couple of years ago, and when we really started to accelerate in the last couple of years, it was around putting together a traditional customer pyramid where we had enterprise customers at the top of the pyramid and enterprise customers were deemed to be such, not only because they had significant spending powers and have large and complex problems to solve. And therefore, we're spending a lot of money on R&D. But also because we had enterprise customers who were -- who are being supported by specialized teams. And so we would have -- we were able to allocate to these enterprise customers, dedicated account management, both on the technical side as well as the sales side to help navigate through the account. 
That process has been underway for a few years. When you -- and so that gives us within some of these large customers, it gives us great relationships and a very good understanding of what's going on and we've been able to help educate the customers about the capabilities that ANSYS can provide. That, coupled with the other comment I made about digital transformation. Clearly, this is an important area for customers and in -- the digital transformation of that product life cycle continues to be important. The pandemic, as I've mentioned earlier, accelerated that and made it clear and manifest customers that they need to enable their engineers to be able to work from anywhere. And that's obviously possible through a digital thread and simulation in some sense is the most -- the purest digital representation of a product. 
And so that was -- that's the second sort of broad thread about the recognition that people can be effective, engineers can be effective to taking advantage of the technology from wherever. I think the third and perhaps the most important is that, look, at the end of the day, simulation provides tremendous value to customers. They are -- we've talked about this for a long time. We've said, look, we can help you accelerate product to market, that's one area, that drives top line revenue growth. And we've also said, we can help you save money. We can help you save money because you don't have to build physical prototypes, you can do the proverbial more with less. And that also resonates with customers, especially in tough economic times. 
So when you put all of this stuff together, it's no wonder that we're seeing some large deals from customers. This is not accidental. This has been planned. This has been multi-years and planning to make sure that we build these relationships to help them with their digital transformation and to continue to drive investments in the portfolio and to continue to show the value that simulation will provide."

And we talked about a number of area",550,"Well, firstly, with respect to our analysis of the TAM, if you go back to our Investor Day from a couple of years ago, 2019, we did a pretty comprehensive analysis of the TAM and where it is today and where it's going. And we talked about a number of areas. We talked about the core business. We talked about, which is the historical use of simulation and the design and validation phase of the product life cycle. We talked about high-growth solutions like electric vehicles or electrification, autonomy, IoT, 5G. And then we talked about simulation being used in nontraditional use cases and things like predictive maintenance through digital twins and so forth. 
And what we did when we presented when we presented that, as we pointed out that the -- that there was more predictability on the base case use cases of simulation as it's historically been. But in some of these longer-term opportunities, in particular, simulation being used, for example, in predictive maintenance and digital twins, we pointed out that there was a significant amount of variability, depending on the rate of adoption of digital technologies and we talked about how that was being affected by assumptions you make about the pace and rate of deployment of capabilities that may have historically not used simulation. 
So that's the -- that's where we were a couple of years ago. The observations that we've seen in the pandemic, as I said in my script, have been very specifically on certain areas. The digital transformation comment is real. Customers are recognizing they need to spend more -- to pay more attention to the digital transformation. We've talked a lot about this on the call already. And so that, we believe, represents an aggregate tailwind, an acceleration of activities that may have taken place already, but those -- that's an acceleration. And when you start to think about some of these other areas like electronics, consumer electronic -- consumer electronics, telecommunications, again, the pandemic caused people to think more about what does it mean for the communications infrastructure? How do I interact with my office working remotely, et cetera? And you started to see that level of interest in the end markets, which has obviously translated into increased demand in the electronics and high-tech vertical for us, which translates across to a number of our products. 
And as I said, in certain areas like green, it's not clear that it's directly related to the pandemic, but we continue to see increased focus on this. Perhaps it's because of broader recognition of the importance of ESG initiatives, maybe it's because of the pandemic, but we're continuing to see more activities there. And again, this entire area of getting to an eco-friendly set of products accelerates activities that might otherwise have taken longer, come in a little bit earlier. 
So I think the core recognition in the elements of the market remain what we had talked about, the question is timing. And as I said also in the call, it's hard for us to quantify what the effects of these tailwinds are going to be. So I want to be very clear that we see this anecdotally, but it's hard -- we are not quantifying the effects of these tailwinds at this point."

I think in the past, ANSYS has talked about how R&D budgets are one of the first budgets to be restored out of the downturns and ANSYS as a company typically sees kind of the inflection faster than maybe some of your peers in the industrial space. And I guess with the strong Q4, you put up 20% constant currency organic ACV growth, large deals, budget flush, it would appear that certainly, you're seeing some strength here, and some might see -- might argue you're seeing some of these budgets come back online. But when I look at your guidance, it implies that ACV growth doesn't really get much better on an organic basis next year. So I guess, what's driving that? Are there certain end markets or GEOs that you're seeing caution? Or is it just conservatism? I know there is a CFO -- with the CFO transition, just trying to understand what would drive such a relatively cautious outlook given the strong results you put up here in the quarter?"

And I'd say the first thing I'd point out is what Maria spoke about, which is significant overachievement of ACV and therefore, revenue in the rest of the P&L in the quarter",340,"So let me characterize kind of some of the assumptions that we put into guidance. And I'd say the first thing I'd point out is what Maria spoke about, which is significant overachievement of ACV and therefore, revenue in the rest of the P&L in the quarter. And so that overachievement on the ACV side alone is about a 2-point headwind to growth year-to-year. 
And so what we're seeing really -- what we saw in the fourth quarter leaves us a lot of optimism that things -- once that we get through the capitulation of the pandemic that things -- that there's a strong demand for simulation that customers are accelerating their digital transformation and that we are well positioned based on the investments we've made in the portfolio over the past couple of years, because we've been investing through the pandemic that come out of it with a position of strength that we're going to benefit from it. 
I think what we're expecting to see and what's baked into the guidance is that, generally speaking, the first half is going to continue to have its ups and downs really because of COVID uncertainty. And by the second half of the year, we expect to see more momentum in economic activity as things start to open up and government continue to do the right thing to support economic development. And so we have visibility into the first quarter as to the full year pipeline. And the guidance really reflects the strength of the pipeline. And like other years, we're expecting to see it more back-end loaded from an ACV and a revenue perspective, driven by the timing of large multiyear deals and customer planning activities. 
So from our perspective, sitting here in February, it's just a little difficult to predict such a significant level of overachievement that we saw in the fourth quarter, sitting where we're at right now. But the situation is fluid and will continue engaging with you throughout the year to update it as we know more."

The manufacturer is also using ANSYS simulation to identify the sources of electromagnetic noise to prevent interference and wireless communications. This new contract deepens and expands the customer's use of ANSYS solutions for wireless communications, autonomy, explicit dynamics, materials intelligence and electrification. 
We saw numerous examples of simulation spurring product innovation and reducing development costs at our recently concluded Simulation World Virtual Conference. Nearly 40,000 engineers, designers, executives, students, investors and members of the press registered for this event, which showcased simulation success stories from a number of ANSYS customers from small start-ups, to multinational organizations that span industries, including Northrop Grumman, Whirlpool, Medtronic, SC Microelectronics, Boeing and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Participants attended tracks on electrification, autonomy, digital transformation, 5G connectivity and digital mission engineering and listen to simulation use cases for vaccine distribution, spacecraft risk mitigation, crack propagation and gas turbines, virtual crash testing and automobiles and so on. 
We heard from Formula One's Red Bull Racing, which is relied on the power of pervasive simulation to provide a competitive edge. Red Bull Racing's engineering team operates within a tight development window to optimize its racecar aerodynamics and shave milliseconds off lap times. With only a few days between competition, ANSYS simulation becomes the team's virtual wind tunnel to run external aerodynamic analysis. Simulation is also key to developing the chassis control circuits in selecting the right materials and in ensuring driver safety through virtual crash analysis. We had an entire track dedicated to electrification, where start-up Lucid Motors discuss taking advantage of simulation to develop its luxury electric automobile entirely on a computer, significantly reducing the need for physical prototypes. 
Lucid achieved its goal of creating a battery that will run for 400 miles on a single charge while providing enough power to propel the car from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds. In the process, the company addressed key customer needs, solve difficult engineering problems and brought a world-class vehicle to market in a fraction of the time required by conventional approaches. Electrification, of course, is not limited to ground vehicles. Simulation led breakthroughs in battery technologies are powering all-electric aircraft. 
During Simulation World, we also heard from Air Race E, which is sponsoring a series of international racing competitions for electric aircraft. Air Race E teams are using ANSYS simulation to develop batteries that deliver more power with less weight and designing electric powertrains that overcome difficult thermal and high-voltage challenges. The lessons learned from these races could advance the development and adoption of electrification for commercial aircraft. 
Nokia discussed its use of ANSYS HFSS and our electromagnetic solutions to investigate and optimize material properties and the performance of phased antenna arrays. By using ANSYS simulation, Nokia was not only able to develop an alternative design that was fast, inexpensive and accurate, but also one that facilitates design sharing with vendors and mobile network operators. One of the most exciting presentations was from NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, which highlighted simulations role in the perseverance Rova mission. The JPL simulated every component of the landing, giving engineers confidence that the Rova would successfully endure the so-called 7 minutes of terror From atmospheric entry to landing. 
Simulation was also used to ensure that the Mission Ingenuity Helicopter could navigate the thin atmosphere. Simulation World  let me more confident than ever that the ANSYS strategy of pervasive simulation is working, with over 60 hours of content and more than 300 speakers from companies around the world, there are simply too many ANSYS customer success stories to mention on this call. So I encourage you to visit simulationworld.com to learn how ANSYS simulation is changing the way these organizations are developing, testing and operating their next-generation products. 
ANSYS partners were represented in Simulation World as well. Microsoft sponsored several sessions where they highlighted how users can leverage the Microsoft Azure cloud platform to gain easy access to high-performance computing resources directly from ANSYS products. Rockwell Automation discussed the key role that simulation plays in production, automation and digital transformation. In the PTC sessions, we learned how Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS Simulation are driving a sea change in product development. 
We also heard how ANSYS and Synopsys are bringing their integrated capabilities to cover a variety of multiphysics domain like power, timing, reliability and thermal simulation to maximize the speed and density achievable and advanced multi-die systems while ensuring robust reliability. Turning to ESG. ANSYS recently published our annual corporate responsibility report, which highlights progress across our environmental, social and governance initiatives. On ansys.com, you can view the report and learn more about how those pillars are driving long-term growth for our stakeholders through responsible and sustainable business activities. 
I'm also proud that company has named ANSYS to its list of the world's most innovative companies. ANSYS joins the prestigious list of organizations, including Microsoft, Spacex, Sony and Honeywell. Fast Company has also recognized our digital twin at the human heart as one of its 2021 world-changing ideas. To summarize, Q1 was another great quarter for ANSYS, resulting in us beating our guidance for revenue, operating margin and EPS. 
The energy and enthusiasm seen during Simulation World and the strength of our customer pipeline gives me even more confidence in the importance of simulation in the effectiveness of our pervasive simulation strategy and in our ability to meet our newly increased outlook for 2021.

Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our first quarter financial performance and provide color around our outlook and assumptions for Q2 and 2021. Our strong Q1 results reflect outstandin",1193,"Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our first quarter financial performance and provide color around our outlook and assumptions for Q2 and 2021. Our strong Q1 results reflect outstanding execution across our business, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS all above our Q1 guidance. As Ajei mentioned, in Q1, our large customer behavior was as expected, and we were encouraged to see more momentum with our small and medium-sized customers. We're increasingly optimistic about SMB customer behavior for the full year based on the new deal activity we saw in Q1, which was broad-based across industries and geographies. 
Now let me discuss some of our Q1 financial highlights. Q1 ACV was $319.4 million and grew 6% or 3% in constant currency, with strong performance from the channel and 78% of ACV coming from recurring sources. Q1 total non-GAAP revenue was $372.1 million and grew 20% or 17% in constant currency. We saw strong performance in lease revenue, driven by new leases signed in the first quarter. In addition, we had a higher mix of sales than expected from perpetual licenses, which drives more upfront revenue recognition. 
The largest contribution to the growth in perpetual licenses came from Asia Pacific. We closed the quarter with a total balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $936.5 million, representing a 12% increase over last year's first quarter balance. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline. This yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 88.5% and an operating margin of 33.5%, which was better than our Q1 guidance. Operating margins were positively impacted by revenue performance above our guidance as well as the timing of expenses. The result with first quarter EPS of $1.12, which was also above our guidance. Similar to operating margins, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of expenses. 
Our effective tax rate in Q1 was 19%, which is the tax rate that we expect for the remainder of 2021. Our cash flow from operations in Q1 totaled $171.1 million, which benefited from higher collections, given the strong Q4 finish in 2020. We ended the quarter with almost $1 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We continue to build confidence in our outlook for the year. Coming off our strong finish in Q1, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and increasing our ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. 
This increase reflects the strong financial performance in the first quarter and our pipeline while being mindful of regional uncertainties in a continuously evolving global pandemic environment. Let me also add that these increases to guidance occurred despite increased headwinds from currency exchange rates since initiating our full year guidance in February. For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $415 million to $445 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.43 to $1.67. 
As I mentioned, for the full year, we are raising our ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook. We are increasing our full year ACV outlook range to 1 billion 760 million to 1 billion 825 million. This represents growth of 9% to 13% or 7% to 11% in constant currency. The increase to full year ACV reflects our Q1 performance, which exceeded our expectations and increased confidence in our full year pipeline, offset by approximately $14 million of foreign exchange headwind. 
As a result, operationally, we are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by $19 million, which translates to an increase of over 1 point of constant currency growth compared to our February guidance. As a reminder, it is best to look at full year ACV growth as quarters can be variable. This year, quarterly ACV growth rates will vary based on how the pandemic impacted quarterly sales in 2020. Overall, we expect first half and second half ACV growth rates to be roughly similar to each other. Consistent with prior years, the dollar value of ACV will be highly skewed towards the second half of the year. We expect non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of 1 billion 810 million to 1 billion 875 million, which is a growth of 7% to 11% or 5% to 9% in constant currency. 
Similar to our ACV guidance, this increase reflects our strong Q1 revenue performance, offset by approximately $14 million of foreign exchange headwind. As a result, operationally, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $24 million, which translates to a constant currency growth of 1.5 points higher than the midpoint of our February guidance. As you know, ASC 606 introduces revenue growth volatility within the quarters. However, on a full year basis, revenue is less variable. We expect revenue growth to be higher in the first half versus the second half based on the mix of license types in our pipeline. Consistent with prior years, we expect the fourth quarter to be our largest revenue quarter in absolute dollars. We are increasing our full year EPS outlook and now expect EPS to be in the range of $6.69 to $7.10. This increase incorporates our strong Q1 performance and a favorable $0.14 gain on an investment that we expect to record in other income in the second quarter and is offset by approximately $0.06 of foreign exchange headwind. 
It is worth noting that some of our strong Q1 EPS performance was driven by the timing of expenses that will occur in the remainder of the year as we redeploy spending to focused areas of investment. Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. We are increasing our 2021 outlook to a range of $480 million to $520 million. This increase relates to payments we are no longer expecting to make, offset by approximately $5 million of foreign exchange headwind. We were pleased with our strong start to the year in operating cash flow. But as a reminder, we would expect cash flow to be skewed towards the fourth quarter based on the timing of large deals and whether they close in the beginning or the end of the quarter. 
For modeling purposes, we're expecting second quarter operating margin of 34.5% to 38%. And for the full year, we continue to expect operating margins of 40% to 41%. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and fiscal year '21 are contained in the prepared remarks document. I would like to thank the ANSYS team for their exceptional execution during the quarter, which drove our strong Q1 financial and operational results. Our incredible technology, talent and deep customer relationships drives our optimism in the long-term outlook for ANSYS. 
Our focus on execution and investing in the business combined with the strength of our recurring business and growing sales pipeline provide a strong foundation to deliver on our 2021 goals as well as our longer-term financial targets. Operator, we will now open the phone line to take questions."

And the question there is, how is that affected or might -- how it continue to affect your internal investments, resource requirements, pipeline, foreseeability, any of those sorts of metrics pursuant to that higher customer concentration? 
And then secondly, there are a number of external and internal technology catalysts coming up, some of which were mentioned at Simulation World a couple of weeks ago. For instance, you have a new upcoming ANSYS Rockwell integration coming up. You have additional solvers for ANSYS Cloud coming up over the summer, I think, with the R2 release, plus some additional high core count configurations. Microsoft is going to be previewing manufacturing cloud. And then lastly, the materials business unit is going to be expanding, I think, more into the fluids area. So lots going on in the technology pipeline. Maybe you could talk about how any role of those are factored into your thinking?"

So Jay, maybe I'll take the first question. I'm going to have Ajei take the second question. So as you point out, our strategy of pervasive simulation is playing out in the market and more and more customers are making larger and larger investments in there. And I think that it speaks to the strength of the strategy and the strength of the portfolio that customers are kind of going in going all-in on ANSYS to help them accelerate product development. 
What I would say about the overall level of investment, I would say it's consistent with the strategy that we've had to be able to allow customers to evaluate to leverage our technology using multiphysics solutions. And so that benefits our large customers, of course, but it benefits all customers. And I think that the momentum that we saw in SMB, as an example, is just one kind of proof point that would indicate that a purchase broader. 
So it's not as though we have a set of products and a set of investments that are for only large customers and only small customers, those investments get really diversified across the customer base. And so it's really about the personalization of the selling motion and how we engage with customers, which has been pretty consistent across the past couple of years. So I don't see anything that's any meaningfully different -- that would be any meaningfully different from an investment standpoint."

When you think about smaller versus larger customers, we have over 1,000 customers have gone through the ANSYS start-up program. And these companies tend to be some of the most innovative companies in their use of simulation and they push the envelope. Oftentimes because they approach the problem with no frequency of how to build a solution, and they're in a position to take advantage of the best technologies and the best solutions in the market, and of course, they turn to ANSYS. And so we have -- we are seeing the technologies that we are building and developing being used across the board by large companies as well as small companies. 
And you alluded, and you mentioned several of these technologies, I think it's fair to say that the strategy that we laid out a few years ago, pervasive simulation is working. And if you recall, what we said there at the time was that we were going to diversify or focus from just focusing on the high-end analyst to with a broader set of individuals, so it's a broader engineering population so that we could address the needs of engineers across the entire product development life cycle. 
And you talked about our relationship with Rockwell. That's a great example where we're trying to address the needs of the manufacturing engineer, for example. And in other areas with digital twin technologies, we can go after operations, engineers and so on. So there's a very different -- it's a very different approach than we may have had 5 or 7 years ago. It's a much broader approach. And as you see, the technologies that we have developed, the acquisitions that we've made have all been in support of the core of the business as well as this diversification towards the pervasive simulation strategy, and it benefits both large companies as well as small companies."

So in February, we spoke about more modest expectations for hiring in 2021, particularly in the first half. So in the second half of last year, we brought on about 300 new hires, plus we acquired AGI. And our focus -- employee experience is a very high priority for us at ANSYS. And given all of those people that we brought on Board, our focus in -- at least in the first half of the year is really primarily to ensure all of them are properly onboarded, feeling engaged. And as all of us know, it's a little bit more challenging to do that during these times of COVID where we can't see each other. 
So to date, we're a bit under objective, but that objective was a bit more modest. And so overall, we consider ourselves really on track, and we would expect to close the gap throughout the year. This is more of a matter of our own intentionality around our customer experience and the competitiveness in the market and the ability to attract talent has not changed."

We've won an Employer of Choice Awards, which I think is important as well. So all of that points to a great culture within the company. And given the technology and given the capabilities that we provide, frankly, for a number of students graduating from engineering school, what we do and the technologies that we provide represent their career objectives. They want to work in ANSYS. What we do is essentially what they've been training for as they've been getting their bachelor's degrees with their masters degrees or even their PhDs. And so we have that capability to attract, I think, top-quality talent into the organization, both from universities as well as from -- as well as people who are working in other organizations.

And you start to look at the increase in capacity that translates into the need for more simulation and that translates into the need for more ANSYS. And because of the breadth of the portfolio because we have the ability to support multiphysics simulations, I think this is in a very, very good position. 
If you look at our capabilities for advanced process nodes for semiconductors, if you look at the abilities -- capabilities that we have for 3D ICs, that's where, as I said, this multiphysics portfolio that we have really shines.

Overall, first quarter tends to be kind of the smallest revenue generation quarter just based on the pattern of our customers' purchases and behavior. With that said, our overall business is the cost structure associated with our business is largely people, which is not variable. And so the margin profile as we go throughout the year is going to be much more elevated in the back half of the year and much more muted in the first half of the year. 
And so we -- that's a normal pattern we saw -- we see it -- we saw it in 1Q. We've seen it in prior years. And so we would expect that pattern overall to follow suit."

They typically don't have the financial resources that larger organizations do, and therefore, have to be a little bit more conservative with cash. Obviously, now we're in a situation where there is vaccine rollout in parts of the world. Obviously, we have tragic situations in parts of the globe, like, for example, the situation in India. 
But at the same time, we have a broad-based perception that there's going to be a recovery around the world, and that translates into the economy coming back. So we certainly see that in general across the space and SMB is no exception. In many cases, the smaller customers are seeing the need to catch up with activities that they may have missed out on. And so there's perhaps an even greater emphasis on trying to drive some of this work. 
The other point here is that we have global channel partners. And our channel partners oftentimes manage the relationships with the small and medium businesses. And so we have many, many arms and legs on the Street working with these smaller companies to help them get to the stage where they can get back and get back into the main line of their operations.

The customer that I referenced in the call was, in fact, a long time existing customer of ANSYS. And they obviously were in a position to renew some of their existing relationship of some of their existing product usage and expand in other areas. And so that was a good relationship, and that was important for us to be able to manage. They expanded, for example, into materials, that was a new area for us. And that came in, as you recall, through an acquisition that we did a few years ago, with Granta. What we're excited about in the broader automotive space is, I mean, you pointed to electrification, you pointed to autonomy. With electrification, clearly, the imperative seems to have continued to accelerate, and there is -- there continues to be activity, frankly, in all of the geos and through the supply chain. 
The complexity of electrification, new government mandates becoming carbon neutral, frankly, all of those things are driving a huge demand for simulation. And we're seeing a wide adoption of our electric machine design solutions as customers try to get to more reliable and efficient motors for electric vehicle powertrains. We're seeing battery and battery management system designs. Those are areas where simulation is growing as you have new regulations in place regarding things like thermal runaway, which is the major cause of fires in electric vehicles. 
And then, of course, you see customers who are trying to focus on EMI and C testing, things like cable harnesses. So there's just a number of situations and examples of electrification, which represent, frankly, a significant level of investment across the board. And then, of course, with respect to autonomy, that continues to be an area of ongoing interest. And you see certainly a lot of customers participating in that space. I would argue that the market expectations of when we will have fully autonomous vehicles on the market has been pushed back because I think people are coming to terms with the complexity involved in creating a fully autonomous car on public streets. And so that's being pushed back. 
But if you look at the work that we've been doing, we announced this partnership with BMW back in 2019. And over the last couple of years almost, we've had tremendous amount of positive customer feedback supporting our efforts. Earlier last year, we announced a partnership with that focused on hazard detection capabilities for autonomous driving. We've partnered with NVIDIA. We talked of the NVIDIA conferences where we've talked about our advanced radar capabilities. We've done some work with Velodyne on their LIDAR design. 
So it's -- we have a comprehensive set of capabilities in a partnership strategy with autonomy. Most recently, you may have seen we announced a partnership with National Instruments, which was another important partner who's taken where we can work with our physics sensors. So we've got a partnership strategy with autonomy, which allows us to address the breadth and the complexity of that market as it develops as well. So I'm very excited about the both of those markets. They represent tailwinds. And frankly, we were early to invest in that space because we saw those -- we saw both electrification and autonomy is being important, and I think our investments have been validated."

So the ANSYS start-up program is really targeting companies that are very, very early in their life cycle. They may be pre-revenue, they may have very small amounts of revenue. And we work with them as they continue to develop their capabilities. And as I said, in many cases, we'll continue to push the envelope for simulation and what's possible. If I mentioned a Simulation World, there were -- we had a number of companies speak. You certainly heard from -- I mentioned Lucid Motors, that was an example of a company in our start-up program. Relativity, you may have heard me speak about them as well. Their business model is as a service. They're using our additive solutions in our suite of technologies to be able to create to be able to create satellites and launch vehicles for low earth orbit. 
So very -- it's a very exciting group of companies. Obviously, small and medium business is not only related to the start-up program. We have others as well, who are just smaller companies who participate in that program. Our expectation for the start-up program is that they continue to participate in -- they participate as part of members of the start-up program. And once their revenue reaches a certain level, they then graduate, if you will, into being mainline ANSYS customers.

And in particular, I talked about engine manufacturers and how we are working closely with them. Some of the challenges that they have that they're dealing with are quite significant. When you think about an aircraft engine, it is a really sophisticated component -- it is a sophisticated machine and the tolerances are remarkably small. And so it requires the use of multiphysic simulation. It's a combination of fluids of structures, of thermal, all of those things come together to be able to solve these problems. And of course, our customers are now struggling with not just the traditional use cases, but next-generation use cases. For example, with eco-friendly and green initiatives, there is a significant amount of pressure on the commercial aerospace world to be able to come up with more efficient aircraft design.

And so certainly, that's a threat trend in the industry, but it's a -- but getting to these lighter weight, fuel-efficient, eco-friendly engines continues to be initiative.

I think it's important to realize that when we are talking about infrastructure investment, certainly, we see the opportunity with heavy industries, construction equipment, manufacturing. So there are a number of industries for where we have strong exposure, which we think will benefit from investment in infrastructure. And you're right, of course, about construction in and of itself, but it goes significantly beyond that. 
And then even in the context of construction, as you start to look at next-generation techniques like digital twins and physics-based digital twins, we have technology and capability that would be relevant. So we are very excited about the infrastructure -- investments in infrastructure, we think that would benefit us and certainly the customers whom we serve."

And so there's a relationship between those 2 things. Overall, we feel that the long -- that over the long term, there will be a continued shift towards the leasing model. Customers have very dynamic development, R&D needs and project change and needs change over time. And so the leasing model provides customers with the level of flexibility to be able to use the capabilities that they need to as they need them over time and change those things over time. 
And so overall, the long-term pattern and the momentum seems to be favoring more towards that more flexible model. And that's consistent with trends that are in the market today around customers wanting subscription licenses and more time-based licenses. So I would say there's nothing that we're seeing that is a sea change in preference. But in any given quarter, depending on the mix of customers, depending on the geographic region of customers, I wouldn't be surprised to see a dynamic like we saw in the quarter."

I am excited to report that Q1 was an excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we beat our financial guidance for revenue, operating margin and EPS. I'm also pleased that we are ahead of our internal plan for ACV. This is significant because, as I explained on our previous call, ACV is heavily loaded towards the back end of the year following the pattern of the past several years. And we are seeing the continued strengthening of the pipeline of ANSYS customer activities across all major geographies. The strong Q1 and our growing sales pipeline, coupled with our excellent Q4 last year, gives us increased confidence in the momentum of our business and in our ability to execute against our goals. 
As a result, we are increasing our annual guidance for ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow. We expect to see annual ACV growth, for example, to increase by over 1 percentage point in constant currency at the midpoint of our new guidance range. Nicole will provide more details in just a few minutes. In Q1, we were pleased to see that small and medium-sized customers who had slowed their purchasing decisions during the pandemic, showed stronger-than-expected sales growth across geographies and industries. Large customer behavior was as anticipated. From an industry perspective, our traditionally strong sector of hi-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation continue to be our largest contributors. Our largest deal in the quarter was a 5-year multimillion-dollar agreement with a large North American automotive OEM. This long-time customer is realizing savings by using ANSYS Simulation for its strategic warranty cost control initiative. 
The manufacturer is also using ANSYS Simulation to identify the sources of electromagnetic noise to prevent interference and wireless communications. This new contract deepens and expands the customer's use of ANSYS solutions for wireless communications, autonomy, explicit dynamics, materials intelligence and electrification. 
We saw numerous examples of simulation spurring product innovation and reducing development costs at our recently concluded Simulation World Virtual Conference. Nearly 40,000 engineers, designers, executives, students, investors and members of the press registered for this event, which showcased simulation success stories from a number of ANSYS customers, from small start-ups, to multinational organizations to span industries, including Northrop Grumman, Whirlpool, Medtronic, SC Microelectronics, Boeing and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Participants attended tracks on electrification, autonomy, digital transformation, 5G connectivity and digital mission engineering and listened to simulation use cases for vaccine distribution, spacecraft risk mitigation, crack propagation and gas turbines, virtual crash testing and automobiles and so on. 
We heard from Formula One's Red Bull Racing, which is relied on the power of pervasive simulation to provide a competitive edge. Red Bull Racing's engineering team operates within a tight development window to optimize its racecar aerodynamics and shave milliseconds off lap times. With only a few days between competition, ANSYS Simulation becomes the team's virtual wind tunnel to run external aerodynamic analysis. Simulation is also key to developing the chassis control circuits, in selecting the right materials and in ensuring driver safety through virtual crash analysis. We had an entire track dedicated to electrification, where start-up Lucid Motors discussed taking advantage of simulation to develop its luxury electric automobile entirely on a computer, significantly reducing the need for physical prototypes. 
Lucid achieved its goal of creating a battery that will run for 400 miles on a single charge while providing enough power to propel the car from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds. In the process, the company addressed key customer needs, solved difficult engineering problems and brought a world-class vehicle to market in a fraction of the time required by conventional approaches. Electrification, of course, is not limited to ground vehicles. Simulation-led breakthroughs in battery technologies are powering all-electric aircraft. 
During Simulation World, we also heard from Air Race E, which is sponsoring a series of international racing competitions for electric aircraft. Air Race E teams are using ANSYS Simulation to develop batteries to deliver more power with less weight. And designing electric powertrains that overcome difficult thermal and high-voltage challenges. The lessons learned from these races could advance the development and adoption of electrification for commercial aircraft. 
Nokia discussed its use of ANSYS HFSS and our electromagnetic solutions to investigate and optimize material properties and the performance of phased antenna arrays. By using ANSYS Simulation, Nokia was not only able to develop an alternative design that was fast, inexpensive and accurate, but also one that facilitates design sharing with vendors and mobile network operators. One of the most exciting presentations was from NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, which highlighted simulation's role in the Mars Perseverance Rover mission. The JPL simulated every component of the landing, giving engineers confidence that the Rover would successfully endure the so-called 7 minutes of terror from atmospheric entry to landing. 
Simulation was also used to ensure that the Mission Ingenuity Helicopter could navigate the thin Marsian atmosphere. Simulation World let me more confident than ever that the ANSYS strategy of pervasive simulation is working. With over 60 hours of content and more than 300 speakers from companies around the world, there are simply too many ANSYS customer success stories to mention on this call. So I encourage you to visit simulationworld.com to learn how ANSYS Simulation is changing the way these organizations are developing, testing and operating their next-generation products. 
ANSYS partners were represented in Simulation World as well. Microsoft sponsored several sessions where they highlighted how users can leverage the Microsoft Azure cloud platform to gain easy access to high-performance computing resources directly from ANSYS products. Rockwell Automation discussed the key role that simulation plays in production, automation and digital transformation. In the PTC sessions, we learned how Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS Simulation are driving a key change in product development. 
We also heard how ANSYS and Synopsys are bringing their integrated capabilities to cover a variety of multiphysics domain like power, timing, reliability and thermal simulation to maximize the speed and density achievable in advanced multi-die systems while ensuring robust reliability. 
Turning to ESG. ANSYS recently published our annual corporate responsibility report, which highlights progress across our environmental, social and governance initiatives. On ansys.com, you can view the report and learn more about how those pillars are driving long-term growth for our stakeholders through responsible and sustainable business activities. 
I'm also proud that Fast Company has named ANSYS to its list of the world's most innovative companies. ANSYS joins the prestigious list of organizations, including Microsoft, SpaceX, Sony and Honeywell. Fast Company has also recognized our digital twin at the human heart as one of its 2021 world-changing ideas. To summarize, Q1 was another great quarter for ANSYS, resulting in us beating our guidance for revenue, operating margin and EPS. 
The energy and enthusiasm seen during Simulation World and the strength of our customer pipeline gives me even more confidence in the importance of simulation, in the effectiveness of our pervasive simulation strategy and in our ability to meet our newly increased outlook for 2021. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole?"
24893,711457188,2272714,"ANSYS, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","ANSYS, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our first quarter financial performance and provide color around our outlook and assumptions for Q2 and 2021. Our strong Q1 results reflect outstandin",1185,"Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our first quarter financial performance and provide color around our outlook and assumptions for Q2 and 2021. Our strong Q1 results reflect outstanding execution across our business, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS all above our Q1 guidance. As Ajei mentioned, in Q1, our large customer behavior was as expected, and we were encouraged to see more momentum with our small and medium-sized customers. We're increasingly optimistic about SMB customer behavior for the full year based on the new deal activity we saw in Q1, which was broad-based across industries and geographies. 
Now let me discuss some of our Q1 financial highlights. Q1 ACV was $319.4 million and grew 6% or 3% in constant currency, with strong performance from the channel and 78% of ACV coming from recurring sources. Q1 total non-GAAP revenue was $372.1 million and grew 20% or 17% in constant currency. We saw strong performance in lease revenue, driven by new leases signed in the first quarter. In addition, we had a higher mix of sales than expected from perpetual licenses, which drives more upfront revenue recognition. 
The largest contribution to the growth in perpetual licenses came from Asia Pacific. We closed the quarter with a total balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $936.5 million, representing a 12% increase over last year's first quarter balance. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline. This yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 88.5% and an operating margin of 33.5%, which was better than our Q1 guidance. Operating margins were positively impacted by revenue performance above our guidance as well as the timing of expenses. The result was first quarter EPS of $1.12, which was also above our guidance. Similar to operating margins, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of expenses. 
Our effective tax rate in Q1 was 19%, which is the tax rate that we expect for the remainder of 2021. Our cash flow from operations in Q1 totaled $171.1 million, which benefited from higher collections, given the strong Q4 finish in 2020. We ended the quarter with almost $1 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. 
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We continue to build confidence in our outlook for the year. Coming off our strong finish in Q1, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and increasing our ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This increase reflects the strong financial performance in the first quarter and our pipeline while being mindful of regional uncertainties in a continuously evolving global pandemic environment. Let me also add that these increases to guidance occurred despite increased headwinds from currency exchange rates since initiating our full year guidance in February. 
For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $415 million to $445 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.43 to $1.67. As I mentioned, for the full year, we are raising our ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook. We are increasing our full year ACV outlook range to $1.760 billion to $1.825 billion. This represents growth of 9% to 13% or 7% to 11% in constant currency. The increase to full year ACV reflects our Q1 performance, which exceeded our expectations and increased confidence in our full year pipeline, offset by approximately $14 million of foreign exchange headwind. 
As a result, operationally, we are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by $19 million, which translates to an increase of over 1 point of constant currency growth compared to our February guidance. As a reminder, it is best to look at full year ACV growth as quarters can be variable. This year, quarterly ACV growth rates will vary based on how the pandemic impacted quarterly sales in 2020. Overall, we expect first half and second half ACV growth rates to be roughly similar to each other. Consistent with prior years, the dollar value of ACV will be highly skewed towards the second half of the year. We expect non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.810 billion to $1.875 billion, which is a growth of 7% to 11% or 5% to 9% in constant currency. 
Similar to our ACV guidance, this increase reflects our strong Q1 revenue performance, offset by approximately $14 million of foreign exchange headwind. As a result, operationally, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $24 million, which translates to a constant currency growth of 1.5 points higher than the midpoint of our February guidance. As you know, ASC 606 introduces revenue growth volatility within the quarters. However, on a full year basis, revenue is less variable. We expect revenue growth to be higher in the first half versus the second half based on the mix of license types in our pipeline. Consistent with prior years, we expect the fourth quarter to be our largest revenue quarter in absolute dollars. 
We are increasing our full year EPS outlook and now expect EPS to be in the range of $6.69 to $7.10. This increase incorporates our strong Q1 performance and a favorable $0.14 gain on an investment that we expect to record in other income in the second quarter and is offset by approximately $0.06 of foreign exchange headwind. It is worth noting that some of our strong Q1 EPS performance was driven by the timing of expenses that will occur in the remainder of the year as we redeploy spending to focused areas of investment. 
Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. We are increasing our 2021 outlook to a range of $480 million to $520 million. This increase relates to payments we are no longer expecting to make, offset by approximately $5 million of foreign exchange headwind. We were pleased with our strong start to the year in operating cash flow. But as a reminder, we would expect cash flow to be skewed towards the fourth quarter based on the timing of large deals and whether they close in the beginning or the end of the quarter. 
For modeling purposes, we're expecting second quarter operating margin of 34.5% to 38%. And for the full year, we continue to expect operating margins of 40% to 41%. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and fiscal year '21 are contained in the prepared remarks document. 
I would like to thank the ANSYS team for their exceptional execution during the quarter, which drove our strong Q1 financial and operational results. Our incredible technology, talent and deep customer relationships drives our optimism in the long-term outlook for ANSYS. Our focus on execution and investing in the business combined with the strength of our recurring business and growing sales pipeline provide a strong foundation to deliver on our 2021 goals as well as our longer-term financial targets.

And if you have significant large deals in the pipeline that could affect that and that's why it gives you the most of the confidence?"

So I would say -- I would characterize our outlook to be consistent with what we saw in Q1, which was that large deal performance came in and enterprises came in as we expected them to behave. And we have some more growing optimism around the kind of improvement in the patterns of the smaller customer set, which, as you recall, was the customer set that we were a little bit more cautious about coming into the year. 
And so I'd say the shape of the things that came out in Q1 are similar things that affect our outlook for the full year."

And the question there is, how is that affected or might -- how it might continue to affect your internal investments, resource requirements, pipeline foreseeability, any of those sorts of metrics pursuant to that higher customer concentration? 
And then secondly, there are a number of external and internal technology catalysts coming up, some of which were mentioned at Simulation World a couple of weeks ago. For instance, you have a new upcoming ANSYS Rockwell integration coming up. You have additional solvers for ANSYS Cloud coming up over the summer, I think, with the R2 release, plus some additional high core count configurations. Microsoft is going to be previewing manufacturing cloud. And then lastly, the materials business unit is going to be expanding, I think, more into the fluids area. So lots going on in the technology pipeline. Maybe you could talk about how any one of those are factored into your thinking?"

So Jay, maybe I'll take the first question. I'm going to have Ajei take the second question. So as you point out, our strategy of pervasive simulation is playing out in the market and more and more customers are making larger and larger investments in there. And I think that it speaks to the strength of the strategy and the strength of the portfolio that customers are kind of going in going all-in on ANSYS to help them accelerate product development. 
What I would say about the overall level of investment, I would say it's consistent with the strategy that we've had to be able to allow customers to evaluate, to leverage our technology using multiphysics solutions. And so that benefits our large customers, of course, but it benefits all customers. And I think that the momentum that we saw in SMB, as an example, is just one kind of proof point that would indicate that it's a purchase order. 
So it's not as though we have a set of products and a set of investments that are for only large customers and only small customers, those investments get really diversified across the customer base. And so it's really about the personalization of the selling motion and how we engage with customers, which has been pretty consistent across the past couple of years. So I don't see anything that's any meaningfully different -- that would be any meaningfully different from an investment standpoint."

When you think about smaller versus larger customers, we have over 1,000 customers have gone through the ANSYS start-up program. And these companies tend to be some of the most innovative companies in their use of simulation and they push the envelope. Oftentimes because they approach the problem with no frequency of how to build a solution, and they're in a position to take advantage of the best technologies and the best solutions in the market, and of course, they turn to ANSYS. And so we have -- we are seeing the technologies that we are building and developing being used across the board by large companies as well as small companies. 
And you alluded, and you mentioned several of these technologies. I think it's fair to say that the strategy that we laid out a few years ago, pervasive simulation is working. And if you recall, what we said there at the time was that we were going to diversify or focus from just focusing on the high-end analyst to with a broader set of individuals, so it's a broader engineering population so that we could address the needs of engineers across the entire product development life cycle. 
And you talked about our relationship with Rockwell. That's a great example where we're trying to address the needs of the manufacturing engineer, for example. And in other areas with digital twin technologies, we can go after operations engineers and so on. So there's a very different -- it's a very different approach than we may have had 5 or 7 years ago. It's a much broader approach. And as you see, the technologies that we have developed, the acquisitions that we've made have all been in support of the core of the business as well as this diversification towards the pervasive simulation strategy, and it benefits both large companies as well as small companies."

And as all of us know, it's a little bit more challenging to do that during these times of COVID where we can't see each other. 
So to date, we're a bit behind our objective, but that objective was a bit more modest.

With that said, our overall business is -- the cost structure associated with our business is largely people, which is not variable. And so the margin profile as we go throughout the year is going to be much more elevated in the back half of the year and much more muted in the first half of the year.

They typically don't have the financial resources that larger organizations do, and therefore, have to be a little bit more conservative with cash. Obviously, now we're in a situation where there is vaccine rollout in parts of the world. Obviously, we have tragic situations in parts of the globe, like, for example, the situation in India. 
But at the same time, we have a broad-based perception that there's going to be a recovery around the world, and that translates into the economy coming back. So we certainly see that in general across the space and SMB is no exception. In many cases, the smaller customers are seeing the need to catch up with activities that they may have missed out on. And so there's perhaps an even greater emphasis on trying to drive some of this work. 
The other point here is that we have global channel partners. And our channel partners oftentimes manage the relationships with the small and medium businesses. And so we have many, many arms and legs on the Street working with these smaller companies to help them get to the stage where they can get back into the main line of their operations.

The customer that I referenced in the call was, in fact, a long time existing customer of ANSYS. And they obviously were in a position to renew some of their existing relationship of some of their existing product usage and expand in other areas. And so that was a good relationship, and that was important for us to be able to manage. They expanded, for example, into materials, that was a new area for us. And that came in, as you recall, through an acquisition that we did a few years ago, with Granta. What we're excited about in the broader automotive space is, I mean, you pointed to electrification, you pointed to autonomy. With electrification, clearly, the imperative seems to have continued to accelerate, and there is -- there continues to be activity, frankly, in all of the geos and through the supply chain. 
The complexity of electrification, new government mandates to becoming carbon neutral, frankly, all of those things are driving a huge demand for simulation. And we're seeing a wide adoption of our electric machine design solutions as customers try to get to more reliable and efficient motors for electric vehicle powertrains. We're seeing battery and battery management system designs. Those are areas where simulation is growing as you have new regulations in place regarding things like thermal runaway, which is the major cause of fires in electric vehicles. 
And then, of course, you see customers who are trying to focus on EMI and C testing, things like cable harnesses. So there's just a number of situations and examples of electrification, which represent, frankly, a significant level of investment across the board. And then, of course, with respect to autonomy, that continues to be an area of ongoing interest. And you see certainly a lot of customers participating in that space. I would argue that the market expectations of when we will have fully autonomous vehicles on the market has been pushed back because I think people are coming to terms with the complexity involved in creating a fully autonomous car on public streets. And so that's being pushed back. 
But if you look at the work that we've been doing, we announced this partnership with BMW back in 2019. And over the last couple of years almost, we've had tremendous amount of positive customer feedback supporting our efforts. Earlier last year, we announced a partnership with FLIR that focused on hazard detection capabilities for autonomous driving. We've partnered with NVIDIA. We talked at the NVIDIA conferences where we've talked about our advanced radar capabilities. We've done some work with Velodyne on their LIDAR design. 
So it's -- we have a comprehensive set of capabilities in a partnership strategy with autonomy. Most recently, you may have seen we announced a partnership with National Instruments, which was another important partner who's taken where we can work with our physics sensors. So we've got a partnership strategy with autonomy, which allows us to address the breadth and the complexity of that market as it develops as well. So I'm very excited about both of those markets. They represent tailwinds. And frankly, we were early to invest in that space because we saw those -- we saw both electrification and autonomy is being important, and I think our investments have been validated."

If -- I mentioned at Simulation World, there were -- we had a number of companies speak. You certainly heard from -- I mentioned Lucid Motors, that was an example of a company in our start-up program. Relativity, you may have heard me speak about them as well. Their business model is as a service. They're using our additive solutions and in our suite of technologies to be able to create  satellites and launch vehicles for low earth orbit.

They're also more subject to any capitulation that continues to be in the market as the COVID pandemic kind of -- we get out of the pandemic. And so I would say our outlook includes a portion of that coming back. And it's really centered around -- we try to be transparent about what we see right -- what we see in front of us as opposed to speculate on how behavior can change. And so that's kind of how we've thought about the recovery in the context of our outlook."

And we are, I would argue, unequal in the marketplace in terms of our expertise in physics-based simulation. We've got deep and lasting customer relationships. And frankly, that's allowed us to drive innovation across the portfolio, and it's allowed us to create a very efficient and sustainable business model and a very deep competitive mode. And that strength of the business model, it's no wonder that competitors want to try to enter the space because they see this as being an attractive model, perhaps more attractive than the markets in which they participate in. 
And over the years, we've seen competitors try to enter the space with a point solution or two. And in the meantime, we've continued to expand our physics. We've achieved integrated multiphysics at scale. I mean, some of our most -- some of our solutions scale up to 200,000 cores, for example, in our CFD space, and that's just an enormous capability for our customers. And we continue to deepen and broaden our understanding of customer pain points. We've added new techniques to be able to solve them. We've -- and you see these advancements taking place across our entire portfolio. 
So I'm very excited about our portfolio. I think we're laser-focused on customer success. We have a strategy that we're executing. This is the right strategy for us. By being able to broaden and deepen our capabilities in physics, we continue to support our customers from small to large across a number of different industries. And I think that puts us in a very good position competitively. And frankly, if there are any -- one of a smaller company gets acquired by another company, it fundamentally doesn't make any difference in our competitive dynamic as we see the market."

And in particular, I talked about engine manufacturers and how we are working closely with them. Some of the challenges that they have, that they're dealing with are quite significant. When you think about an aircraft engine, it is a really sophisticated component -- it is a sophisticated machine and the tolerances are remarkably small. And so it requires the use of multiphysics simulation. It's a combination of fluids of structures, of thermal, all of those things come together to be able to solve these problems. And of course, our customers are now struggling with not just the traditional use cases, but next-generation use cases. For example, with eco-friendly and green initiatives, there is a significant amount of pressure on the commercial aerospace world to be able to come up with more efficient aircraft design. 
I talked in the script about electric aircraft, but that's still some time away. And so certainly, that's a trend in the industry. But it's a -- but getting to these lighter weight, fuel-efficient, eco-friendly engines continues to be an initiative. What's important to realize is that aircraft programs, engine programs, for example, or aircraft programs, in general, are multiyear initiatives. These are not things that change on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So these are multiyear initiatives with significant amounts of R&D that stretches over a long period of time.

Customers have very dynamic development, R&D needs and project change and needs change over time. And so the leasing model provides customers with the level of flexibility to be able to use the capabilities that they need to as they need them over time and change those things over time. 
And so overall, the long-term pattern and the momentum seems to be favoring more towards that more flexible model. And that's consistent with trends that are in the market today around customers wanting subscription licenses and more time-based licenses.

Q4 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, capping off the most successful year in our 50-year history. We beat our financial guidance for the quarter across all key metrics, including revenue, ACV, e",1707,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q4 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, capping off the most successful year in our 50-year history. We beat our financial guidance for the quarter across all key metrics, including revenue, ACV, earnings per share and cash flow. 
Q4 saw stronger-than-expected sales activity, which we believe was driven by a combination of deferred customer spending from earlier quarters, greater-than-expected end of year customer budgets in the Americas and in EMEA, coupled with increased albeit cautious optimism in the economy, thanks to the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines and expected government stimulus activities. 
During Q4, we closed nearly 100 deals over $1 million, a total that includes 8 deals in the 8 figures. One of those agreements was the second largest deal in the history of the company, a 5-year $79 million contract with an enterprise customer. While economic conditions forces global company to reduce expenses across the business, it's renewed and expanded its use of ANSYS core solver technology worldwide. And added newly acquired ANSYS technologies, including electronics reliability and dynamic analysis. This contract reflects the customer's long-term decision to standardize on ANSYS technology over other vendors and to reduce its reliance on physical testing and is a testament to ANSYS' market leadership. 
As we have consistently said, our years have become increasingly back-end loaded due primarily to the timing of large deals. This steady progression has allowed us sales and operations teams to support an increasingly higher magnitude of business in the fourth quarter of each year. Our strong q4 2020 execution drove record quarterly ACV which was over $100 million higher than the previous largest quarter in Q4 of 2019. The strength and volume of business that we closed in Q4 resulted in annual ACV growth of almost 10% in constant currency.
The year developed largely as we had predicted in our May 2020 call with regards to our performance by industry, geography and company size. During the year, we exceeded our expectations with enterprise customers including closing the 3 largest deals in our history. That speaks to the importance of ANSYS' integrated multiphysics simulation capabilities that connect all the major physics as well as to the trusted partnerships that we have built with our enterprise customers.  
Moving to products. We advanced our strategy of Pervasive Simulation with our recent delivery of ANSYS 2021 release 1 to our customers. With R1, engineers can harness the advances in simulation technology, together with ever-increasing computing power to drive new levels of product innovation. This comprehensive release features advances across our entire integrated multiphysics portfolio and our simulation platform, including in ANSYS Cloud, where customers can now scale beyond 1,000 cores for a single job. In ANSYS Discovery, which now includes automated thermal analysis to predict fluid and solid thermal behaviors for electronic cooling and heat management devices. And ANSYS Sherlock, where customers can now incorporate ANSYS Mechanical's random vibration analysis into their design for reliability workflow, thereby improving product reliability and lifetime.  
Another key element of R1 is ANSYS HFSS Mesh Fusion. This breakthrough solution simplifies the development of modern electronic products, which are incredibly complex systems consisting of multiple interacting components. Today, engineers can analyze these systems using 1 of 2 suboptimal techniques, either individual component simulation with manual combination, which can be error prone or a one-size-fits-all approach, which can result in long simulation time. Using ANSYS HFSS Mesh Fusions game-changing technology, an engineer can solve each component at a level of fidelity most relevant for that component and then HFSS automatically fuses the results. This virtually eradicates the costs and the risks of traditional methods, enabling engineers to efficiently design and optimize complex products. Samsung Electronics is using HFSS Mesh Fusion to create optimal designs and to shrink design cycle times and costs for its next-generation flat screen televisions. The electronics giant uses this innovative technology to develop advanced designs that were previously unimaginable.  
Moving to M&A. In Q4, we closed our acquisition of Analytical Graphics, Inc., or AGI. With AGI, we will be able to address a broader market called digital mission engineering, which combines mission simulation and analysis from AGI with component and system-level simulation from ANSYS. Based on a third-party market analysis and primary interviews with industry experts, we believe that the AGI acquisition increases ANSYS' total addressable market by $800 million. That market is being fueled by the replacement of open-source code, unsustainable in-house code and the ongoing growth in the number of missions. 
Our combined portfolio will enable customers to simulate up and down the stack starting at the chip level and going all the way up to customers' entire mission, increasing the likelihood of success and saving them time, money and other crucial resources. 
This week, we announced a relationship with Keysight, which connects AGI's mission analysis software with Keysight's high fidelity RS systems modeling capability. This partnership builds on an existing relationship, which empowers engineers to evaluate mission level behavior and is a key enabler for aerospace applications, amongst others. 
PTC, another partner, continues to see success with its OEM of ANSYS technology. In its most recent earnings call, PTC reported that Creo powered by ANSYS products grew bookings by more than 20% in the quarter. The company highlighted one such deal at Shock linger, which added Creo simulation live to help spark innovation and decrease product development cycle times. 
As we look ahead to 2021, I'd like to reflect on the COVID-19 pandemic and put it in context of the ANSYS business. COVID had an adverse impact on our 2020 results, most pronounced in Q2 and Q3 with some customers choosing to be cautious with their spending. However, our strong execution in the back half of the year, including the record Q4 performance, resulted in ACV above the high end of our updated May guidance and within the originally established range for the year. We are seeing a continuation of Q4's cautious optimism in our customer base with the expectation that the economic pressures of the pandemic will start to ease in the second half of 2021, but tempered by concerns with virus mutations and vaccine rollout schedules. 
The takeaway is that we're assuming greater uncertainty in the timing of sales activities than we would have, had this been a non-COVID year. We are also planning for 2021 to be heavily back-end loaded. Similar to or even slightly more pronounced in 2020. And we expect a wider range of outcomes in our full year projections as was the case in 2020. You will hear more about our guidance for 2021 shortly. 
Let me now move to the long-term to when the pandemic is behind us. While we are not in a position to quantify these considerations, I believe that some customers will cut back during the pandemic, will increase spending in R&D and simulation to compensate for other investments in 2020. More important, however, I believe that we will see a number of tailwinds that serve to increase the post pandemic market growth rates as compared with our pre-pandemic projections. 
First, in a recent survey of nearly 900 executives and managers across industries, the firm McKinsey found the pandemic may have accelerated digital transformation by as much as a decade. I believe this is particularly relevant for our customers and that they will hasten their digital transformations post-pandemic. In the process driving increased and deeper use of simulation. 
The pandemic proved that R&D engineers are effective when working from home. And that they can use simulation to successfully develop products even with no access to their physical labs. As companies move to hybrid work models post pandemic, they must accelerate their digital transformations to replace legacy product development processes with modern tools and techniques. Multiphysics simulation with its core value proposition of helping to accelerate time to market and to deliver cost savings will be key to these transformations. 
Next, the pandemic seems to have pushed customers to accelerate roadmaps and to innovate faster in areas such as telecommunications and consumer electronics. We are also seeing increased R&D in the creation of eco-friendly products such as electric vehicles and lightweight, fuel-efficient aircraft engines, as we discussed in our last earnings call. All of these products are sophisticated and complex and require integrated multiphysics simulation for design and development. That will continue to drive increased post-pandemic demand across our entire portfolio, including our newly acquired AGI mission offerings. 
To summarize, despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic, Q4 was an outstanding quarter, marked by record financial results. Looking long term, we believe that the pandemic may actually cause our total addressable market to go faster than our pre-pandemic projections. This makes me confident that as the market leader, ANSYS will be able to continue to drive strong and profitable long-term growth. 
Our next speaker is Maria Shields. As you may know, Maria has been our CFO since 1998. And for those of you counting, that's 90 quarterly earnings calls. She's been instrumental in guiding ANSYS on a remarkable journey from our initial public offering in 1996 to our status today as a simulation industry leader. And it's very fitting that we have delivered record results in her last full quarter as CFO. On March 1, she will transition into a new role of Senior Vice President of Administration, where she will focus on company culture, talent and technology to help us operate at even greater efficiencies. 
Former board member, Nicole Anasenes will succeed Maria as CFO on March 1. With her experience in the tech sector as well as the knowledge of ANSYS, Nicole has hit the ground running since joining ANSYS full-time in December. In addition to the traditional CFO responsibilities, Nicole will directly oversee our M&A function as well as ANSYS' digital transformation. Nicole was CFO and COO at Squarespace, she was CFO at Infor, and spent 17 years with IBM in various leadership positions in finance, mergers and acquisitions and market development including as CFO of IBM's software middleware business and its cloud business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Maria to discuss our Q4 and 2020 financials, and then to Nicole to give details around the 2021 outlook and assumptions for the year. Maria?"

I truly appreciate the kind words and your ongoing support and partnership over the past 4 years. 
Hello, everyone. We are very pleased to report another strong quarter, resulting in record financial performance for both the quarter and the year. I'll spend a few minutes walking through an overview of the Q4 financial highlights. And then I'll turn the call over to Nicole to add qualitative and quantitative color around our initial outlook and key assumptions for the first quarter and full year 2021. 
Before I get into the details of our financial highlights, I would like to take a moment to say thank you to the entire ANSYS team. Your focus on execution, collaboration and ongoing commitment to customer excellence, enabled us to finish with both a record quarter and year across both operational and financial fronts. Despite the many uncertainties and disruptions that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We are also very excited about the closing of the AGI acquisition in early December. And the positive progress that the teams have made on integration activities. 
We closed the quarter with total revenue of $628 million or constant currency growth of 24%, and operating margin and EPS results that were both well above the high end of our Q4 guidance. This is quite a testament to the strength and durability of the ANSYS business model. Particularly when you consider the strong comparable of Q4 2019. Let me also add that consistent with every quarter of this past year, our revenue results as we closed out 2020 and were driven by solid sales execution. 
Other key financial metrics for the quarter continue, with 20% constant currency growth in ACV to a total of $666 million, of which 83% was from recurring sources. This compares to 78% in last year's fourth quarter. This is a new record for Q4 with respect to both total ACV and the percentage that is attributable to recurring sources. 
Q4's revenue results reflect the continued trend in solid lease sales that we've been experiencing throughout 2020, with a record 54% constant currency increase in lease license revenue. 
For the first time in 2020, in the fourth quarter, we reported a return to growth in the paid up software license line with 11% growth in constant currency. This yielded 38% constant currency growth in our software license revenue. The increase in lease license sales, combined with high renewal rates on maintenance contracts contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q4 total of $967 million, an 11% increase over last year's comparable balance. The strong top line results, combined with our continued focus on fiscal discipline, helped to drive a fourth quarter gross margin of 92% and an operating margin of 52%, which finished well above the high end of our Q4 guidance. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q4 was 19.5%, in line with our expectations. 
The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $2.96 and which also finished well above the high end of our guidance. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the fourth quarter with cash flow from operations that totaled $174 million, a 25% increase over last year's fourth quarter. The quarter's cash flow benefited from very strong receivables collection as well as the deferral of certain tax payments into 2021. And this translated to a new record of $547 million for the full year. We closed the year with a total of $913 million in cash and short-term investments, and a total debt balance of $798 million. 
Let me just close by saying that we are extremely fortunate to have finished 2020 with the best financial performance in our 50 year history. These results are a testament to the resiliency of the ANSYS business model, and to the tenacity, dedication and hard work of our employees, customers and partners. 
Now let me turn the call over to Nicole, who will continue with the topic of guidance. Nicole?"

First, I want to echo Maria's congratulations and gratitude to the entire ANSYS team for such an amazing 2020. And together, we delivered stellar outcomes in the face of unprecedented business uncertainty, the 1 ANSYS culture of teamwork",1130,"Thank you, Maria. First, I want to echo Maria's congratulations and gratitude to the entire ANSYS team for such an amazing 2020. And together, we delivered stellar outcomes in the face of unprecedented business uncertainty, the 1 ANSYS culture of teamwork and commitment to customer success that drove those results is one of the many reasons I am so thrilled to join the team. 
Looking into 2021, I want to share some of the key dynamics we have factored into our guidance. Due to the continued uncertainty about the timing and impact of a return to normal business operations post the pandemic, our guidance ranges continue to be wider than those we have historically provided pre pandemic. We anticipate that the current environment will continue through the first half of the year and expect a recovery in the business environment during the second half of the year with increased global economic stimulus and the global availability of vaccines. 
We continue to believe the impact will have a disproportionate effect on our small and medium-sized customers versus larger customers throughout 2021. We estimate trade restrictions between the U.S. and China have adversely impact our annual sales by approximately $25 million. 
While the trade environment has been rapidly changing and may continue to do so under the new U.S. administration, our outlook factors in the existing trade restrictions and dynamics that are in place today. We are expecting to see a continued mix shift from perpetual licenses to lease licenses as customers continue to find the flexibility of lease licensing and operating on the cloud more appealing. The reduced capital outlay associated with the leasing model is also more appealing to certain customers during a time of economic uncertainty. 
Our blended renewal rates across maintenance and leases have historically been approximately 90%, with the renewal rates on maintenance agreements being even higher. Our renewal rates have remained high, with only a slight reduction as compared to our historical experience. And our assumptions are that they will pick up slightly in 2021 toward historical levels. 
We continue to adjust our spending to reflect our expectations for the pace at which economic recovery will occur while balancing the need to invest for the long-term opportunity that we see ahead. 
We have also maintained and intend to continue our commitment to invest in our acquired companies as well as R&D in certain digital transformation projects as those projects are critical to our ability to operate efficiently and scale the business for future growth. We completed the acquisition of AGI on December 1, and have factored the expected impact into guidance, which translates to approximately 1 negative point of margin. We expect this dilutive impact to be the most pronounced in the first year post acquisition, consistent with our past experiences and approach to integration. 
As we look ahead to 2021, we expect to see a very similar seasonal pattern as we've seen in prior years, with a disproportionately large Q4, driven by customer planning and year-end spending patterns. 
In Q4 2020, we saw an outsized shift in customer behavior in December relative to what has historically occurred. There was a significant and unexpected acceleration in customer decisions to both purchase and pay. We exceeded the high end of our Q4 2020 guidance on ACV by $26 million with 20% constant currency growth and full year 2020 cash flow guidance by $72 million and grew 9%. 
Our strong finish leaves us optimistic and reinforces our belief that customers view simulation is essential and will continue to invest in their own digital transformation. 
Our full-year 2021 guidance reflects an improvement in momentum in both ACV and cash flow. However, some of the impact of that momentum started in December of 2020, which was seen in the overachievement above the high end of our guidance. While this momentum is positive, the dynamic also negatively affects 2021 growth comparisons for key financial metrics. For example, the $26 million of overachievement in ACV creates a 2% headwind to 2021 ACV growth. 
Although the environment remains fluid, and we are still in the midst of the pandemic, we believe that if post COVID economic recovery and the current trade environment remains in line with our expectations, our long-term guidance of $2 billion ACV in 2022 is attainable. 
Now let me get to the specifics of our guidance. In full-year 2021, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.790 billion to $1.875 billion, which is growth of 6% to 11% or 3% to 8% in constant currency, and EPS of $6.44 to $6.92. 
For Q1 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $360 million, which is 8% to 17% growth or 5% to 12% in constant currency. And EPS of $0.73 to $0.90. 
Our outlook for full year 2021 is to maintain industry-leading operating margins, which we expect to be in the range of 40% to 41%, and Q1 2021 operating margin in the range of 24% to 27.5%. The lower Q1 2021 operating margins reflect the seasonal nature of our business, with a relatively lower revenue contribution in the quarter, similar to what we experienced in Q1 of last year with an operating margin below 30%. 
For full-year 2021, we expect ACV in the range of $1.750 billion to $1.825 billion, which translates to 8% to 13% growth or 6% to 11% in constant currency. As we mentioned earlier, we expect ACV to be highly skewed towards the fourth quarter. 
We are expecting to deliver full year operating cash flow in a range of $475 million to $515 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV and profitability. It considers the continued trend of request for extended payment terms negotiated in new contracts as well as the timing of certain early collections and deferred tax payments in 2020 and that collectively raised full year 2020 cash flow and lowers the full year 2021 outlook. 
Additional details related to the cash flow guidance and specific impact to full year 2020 and 2021 are more fully provided in our prepared remarks document. 
Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q1 and full-year 2021 are also contained in the prepared remarks document. 
I am so proud of and thrilled to be part of the team who has delivered such outstanding results despite so many macro headwinds and business disruptions during a time of personal hardship for many. I am confident that with this team, we will be able to continue to deliver on our strategy of pervasive simulation and help our customers achieve their innovation and sustainability goals.

First question, though, is for Ajei and your comments about the TAM growth pre and post-pandemic. So can we just get a little bit more color? Is this expectations for all the different components of the TAM, given the core simulation and then the growth opportunities in IoT and electrification and others? Or were you talking specifically about just maybe 1 or 2 components of that total TAM mix?"

So my comments very specifically in the script on TAM, one was around the increase in TAM as a result of the AGI acquisition, which we said added about $800 million to our total addressable market. 
The other comments about tailwinds that I spoke of were more -- were harder to quantify. As I said in the script, the point about digital transformation is that we have seen customers embrace simulation more during the pandemic. And certainly, with the recognition that their engineers could work from home effectively away from corporate labs, that's also been another tailwind for the use of simulation. So we expect to see that continue, certainly with the value proposition of simulation being able to drive product to market faster and save money. So that's a tailwind. 
And the second one that I pointed to was, in certain areas, we've seen increased levels of investment. Now those are -- I specifically call our telecommunications and consumer electronics, and those are areas which require multiphysics simulation analysis. So it really reflects on the multi physical nature of our portfolio, which I think was the question that you were asking. 
But also, the other interesting thing that we've noticed, which I pointed to in the comments, is in the area of eco-friendly products. And I'm not sure if it's coincident or there's a coevality here with the pandemic. But with the -- in that area, we've seen certainly increased levels of investment whether it's electric vehicle, which we've identified and pointed to before, but also on other things like lightweighting and eco-friendly aircraft engines and others. And so this area continues to be also an area of increased growth and something that requires multiphysics simulation. So that was the context of my comments, Jackson."

So if your question -- the question was about ANSYS Cloud and I guess usage during the pandemic or during the last year. If you look at usage, the demand for ANSYS Cloud continue to increase.

If you look at usage, the demand for ANSYS Cloud continue to increase. And we've seen usage increasing by over 100% between 2019 and 2020. And what's interesting, and I think I mentioned this in the last call as well, we've had customers who've used ANSYS Cloud and reached a much more efficient solution than they would have on-premises. 
For example, Rockwell Automation, I think I mentioned, is using ANSYS Cloud to accelerate its product development process, and they showed that they were able to reduce simulations run times by about 50%, which allows, obviously, their engineers to solve problems more accurately. And the reason for that is because ANSYS Cloud is optimized for the ANSYS workload, and we've done some work to make sure that the Azure infrastructure and which it runs as appropriate, and we can take advantage of the latest hardware and interconnect that Azure has available. So absolutely, ANSYS Cloud is certainly something that customers taking advantage of during this time. We've made the majority of our flagships available on ANSYS Cloud, mechanical, fluids, electromagnetics, et cetera. I just talked about the scale out that we have available there on the script as well as things like new workloads like OPTIS, SPEOS, VRX. 
So we're seeing the usage across all of our physics, and we're obviously seeing greater usage. And that, coupled with the flexibility that we have, which allows customers to bring their own license or bring their own hardware license or software license or just moving in to a SaaS world, that hybrid flexibility that we can afford, I think gives customers a lot of options. 
That being said, while we're excited about the cloud offering, and we're very encouraged by the rapid progress, I think it's important to note that the majority of our customers today use ANSYS products on-premises in their own data centers or in their own private cloud, and so ANSYS Cloud is obviously growing rapidly, but it's still a very small piece of our business today and for the foreseeable future."

So how is that factoring into your thinking on results over the next couple of years?

There's a lot that we could go through, and I'm -- I, maybe in the interest of time, I'll just focus on a couple of things. When you think about our journey as a company, we've gone from providing point technologies back when we started like structures. Over the years, we've brought together a comprehensive set of physics through a combination of acquisitions as well as organic development. 
And now we have a full-fledged set of physics that are integrated together. And it's this integration capability across all of these physics that's profoundly important. And we've continued to add to that with materials technologies, for example, with optimization capabilities, et cetera. And that has led to the building up of our platform capability, which is profoundly important to be able to address and provide that agility to support different industry applications. 
And because we have all of these multiphysics capabilities integrated together and exposed on a platform, that makes it easier for our customers as well as our own ACE engineers to build industry-specific or customer-specific solutions that take advantage of the core capabilities that we provide as well as integrate with core components that might be available from outside of our own ecosystem. 
So that's been the direction that we're pursuing. Our technology is available both on-premises and in the cloud. And I think we have a very robust and a very strong technical underpinnings to be able to support not only the more traditional use case where you're dealing with. We use the simulation of the tool, but also we the use of simulation within as part of an integrated platform to deliver value-added applications to customers. And you're seeing this in some of the announcements that we've made. You referenced one of them with respect to BMW. We've made some announcements in the health care space and others where we're working with partners who are able to provide application-specific intelligence that wraps on top of our simulation solutions because of the way we're that architecting our platforms and our capability. 
Now with respect to the long-term road map, I would refer you, one of those key elements is the platform. And obviously, we just talked about platform a second ago. Another area that perhaps might be interesting is AI/ML where we've talked about the use of machine learning. We see that we continue to make investments in AI/ML capability because we really see AI/ML as an orthogonal but supportive technology simulation. Simulation makes AI/ML better, the insight from AI/ML better and AI/ML can support insights from simulation. 
And you see this -- you see these technologies and techniques already being incorporated into our products. You see this, for example, in our semiconductor portfolio, and you continue to see this integrated into other aspects of our products, whether it comes to usability, whether it comes to helping customers or helping engineers navigate the solution space and so forth. And we can obviously go into more details, but in the interest of time, let's just leave those there."

And maybe, Ajei, can you talk a little bit about the predictability of those deals and what you've learned over the last few years, especially in terms of the sales cycles or the pipeline? It seems like the ability be able to close those deals during the pandemic definitely shows that there's an increased activity. So maybe just a little bit of color around how those sale cycles maybe have evolved over the last few years?"

So your question is really how we are integrating with some of these larger customers and how are we working with them? So if you recall, when we went through the go-to-market transformation that we spoke off a couple of years ago, and when we really started to accelerate in the last couple of years, it was around putting together a traditional customer pyramid where we had enterprise customers at the top of the pyramid and enterprise customers were deemed to be such, not only because they had significant spending powers and have large and complex problems to solve. And therefore, we're spending a lot of money on R&D. But also because we had enterprise customers who were -- who are being supported by specialized teams. And so we would have -- we were able to allocate to these enterprise customers, dedicated account management, both on the technical side as well as the sales side to help navigate through the account. 
That process has been underway for a few years. When you -- and so that gives us within some of these large customers, it gives us great relationships and a very good understanding of what's going on and we've been able to help educate the customers about the capabilities that ANSYS can provide. That, coupled with the other comment I made about digital transformation. Clearly, this is an important area for customers and in -- the digital transformation of that product life cycle continues to be important. The pandemic, as I've mentioned earlier, accelerated that and made it clear and manifest customers that they need to enable their engineers to be able to work from anywhere. And that's obviously possible through a digital thread and simulation in some sense is the most -- the purest digital representation of a product. 
And so that was -- that's the second sort of broad thread about the recognition that people can be effective, engineers can be effective to taking advantage of the technology from wherever. I think the third and perhaps the most important is that, look, at the end of the day, simulation provides tremendous value to customers. They are -- we've talked about this for a long time. We've said, look, we can help you accelerate product to market, that's one area, that drives top line revenue growth. And we've also said, we can help you save money. We can help you save money because you don't have to build physical prototypes, you can do the proverbial more with less. And that also resonates with customers, especially in tough economic times. 
So when you put all of this stuff together, it's no wonder that we're seeing some large deals from customers. This is not accidental. This has been planned. This has been multi-years and planning to make sure that we build these relationships to help them with their digital transformation and to continue to drive investments in the portfolio and to continue to show the value that simulation will provide."

And we talked about a number of area",547,"Well, firstly, with respect to our analysis of the TAM, if you go back to our Investor Day from a couple of years ago, 2019, we did a pretty comprehensive analysis of the TAM and where it is today and where it's going. And we talked about a number of areas. We talked about the core business. We talked about, which is the historical use of simulation and the design and validation phase of the product life cycle. We talked about high-growth solutions like electric vehicles or electrification, autonomy, IoT, 5G. And then we talked about simulation being used in nontraditional use cases and things like predictive maintenance through digital twins and so forth. 
And what we did when we presented that, as we pointed out that the -- that there was more predictability on the base case use cases of simulation as it's historically been. But in some of these longer-term opportunities, in particular, simulation being used, for example, in predictive maintenance and digital twins, we pointed out that there was a significant amount of variability, depending on the rate of adoption of digital technologies and we talked about how that was being affected by assumptions you make about the pace and rate of deployment of capabilities that may have historically not used simulation. 
So that's the -- that's where we were a couple of years ago. The observations that we've seen in the pandemic, as I said in my script, have been very specifically on certain areas. The digital transformation comment is real. Customers are recognizing they need to spend more -- to pay more attention to the digital transformation. We've talked a lot about this on the call already. And so that, we believe, represents an aggregate tailwind, an acceleration of activities that may have taken place already, but those -- that's an acceleration. And when you start to think about some of these other areas like electronics, consumer electronic -- consumer electronics, telecommunications, again, the pandemic caused people to think more about what does it mean for the communications infrastructure? How do I interact with my office working remotely, et cetera? And you started to see that level of interest in the end markets, which has obviously translated into increased demand in the electronics and high-tech vertical for us, which translates across to a number of our products. 
And as I said, in certain areas like green, it's not clear that it's directly related to the pandemic, but we continue to see increased focus on this. Perhaps it's because of broader recognition of the importance of ESG initiatives, maybe it's because of the pandemic, but we're continuing to see more activities there. And again, this entire area of getting to an eco-friendly set of products accelerates activities that might otherwise have taken longer, come in a little bit earlier. 
So I think the core recognition in the elements of the market remain what we had talked about, the question is timing. And as I said also in the call, it's hard for us to quantify what the effects of these tailwinds are going to be. So I want to be very clear that we see this anecdotally, but it's hard -- we are not quantifying the effects of these tailwinds at this point."

I think in the past, ANSYS has talked about how R&D budgets are one of the first budgets to be restored out of the downturns and ANSYS as a company typically sees kind of the inflection faster than maybe some of your peers in the industrial space. And I guess with the strong Q4, you put up 20% constant currency organic ACV growth, large deals, budget flush, it would appear that certainly, you're seeing some strength here, and some might see -- might argue you're seeing some of these budgets come back online. But when I look at your guidance, it implies that ACV growth doesn't really get much better on an organic basis next year. So I guess, what's driving that? Are there certain end markets or GEOs that you're seeing caution? Or is it just conservatism? I know there is a CFO -- with the CFO transition, just trying to understand what would drive such a relatively cautious outlook given the strong results you put up here in the quarter?"

So let me characterize kind of some of the assumptions that we put into guidance. And I'd say the first thing I'd point out is what Maria spoke about, which is significant overachievement of ACV and therefore,",347,"Yes. Thanks, Tyler. Thanks for your question. So let me characterize kind of some of the assumptions that we put into guidance. And I'd say the first thing I'd point out is what Maria spoke about, which is significant overachievement of ACV and therefore, revenue in the rest of the P&L in the quarter. And so that overachievement on the ACV side alone is about a 2-point headwind to growth year-to-year. 
And so what we're seeing really -- what we saw in the fourth quarter leaves us a lot of optimism that things -- once that we get through the capitulation of the pandemic that things -- that there's a strong demand for simulation that customers are accelerating their digital transformation and that we are well positioned based on the investments we've made in the portfolio over the past couple of years, because we've been investing through the pandemic that come out of it with a position of strength that we're going to benefit from it. 
I think what we're expecting to see and what's baked into the guidance is that, generally speaking, the first half is going to continue to have its ups and downs really because of COVID uncertainty. And by the second half of the year, we expect to see more momentum in economic activity as things start to open up and government continue to do the right thing to support economic development. And so we have visibility into the first quarter as to the full year pipeline. And the guidance really reflects the strength of the pipeline. And like other years, we're expecting to see it more back-end loaded from an ACV and a revenue perspective, driven by the timing of large multiyear deals and customer planning activities. 
So from our perspective, sitting here in February, it's just a little difficult to predict such a significant level of overachievement that we saw in the fourth quarter, sitting where we're at right now. But the situation is fluid and will continue engaging with you throughout the year to update it as we know more."

Q4 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, capping off the most successful year in our 50-year history.

Q4 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, capping off the most successful year in our 50-year history. We beat our financial guidance for the quarter across all key metrics, including revenue, ACV, earnings per share and cash flow. 
Q4 saw stronger-than-expected sales activity, which we believe was driven by a combination of deferred customer spending from earlier quarters, greater-than-expected end of year customer budgets in the Americas and in EMEA, coupled with increased albeit cautious optimism in the economy, thanks to the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines and expected government stimulus activities. 
During Q4, we closed nearly 100 deals over $1 million, a total that includes 8 deals in the 8 figures. One of those agreements was the second largest deal in the history of the company, a 5-year $79 million contract with an enterprise customer. While economic conditions forces global company to reduce expenses across the business, it's renewed and expanded its use of ANSYS core solver technology worldwide. And added newly acquired ANSYS technologies, including electronics reliability and dynamic analysis. This contract reflects the customer's long-term decision to standardize on ANSYS technology over other vendors and to reduce its reliance on physical testing and is a testament to ANSYS' market leadership. 
As we have consistently said, our years have become increasingly back-end loaded due primarily to the timing of large deals. This steady progression has allowed us sales and operations teams to support an increasingly higher magnitude of business in the fourth quarter of each year. Our strong q4 2020 execution drove record quarterly ACV which was over $100 million higher than the previous largest quarter in Q4 of 2019. The strength and volume of business that we closed in Q4 resulted in annual ACV growth of almost 10% in constant currency.
The year developed largely as we had predicted in our May 2020 call with regards to our performance by industry, geography and company size. During the year, we exceeded our expectations with enterprise customers including closing the 3 largest deals in our history. That speaks to the importance of ANSYS' integrated multiphysics simulation capabilities that connect all the major physics as well as to the trusted partnerships that we have built with our enterprise customers.  
Moving to products. We advanced our strategy of Pervasive Simulation with our recent delivery of ANSYS 2021 release 1 to our customers. With R1, engineers can harness the advances in simulation technology, together with ever-increasing computing power to drive new levels of product innovation. This comprehensive release features advances across our entire integrated multiphysics portfolio and our simulation platform, including in ANSYS Cloud, where customers can now scale beyond 1,000 cores for a single job. In ANSYS Discovery, which now includes automated thermal analysis to predict fluid and solid thermal behaviors for electronic cooling and heat management devices. And ANSYS Sherlock, where customers can now incorporate ANSYS Mechanical's random vibration analysis into their design for reliability workflow, thereby improving product reliability and lifetime.  
Another key element of R1 is ANSYS HFSS Mesh Fusion. This breakthrough solution simplifies the development of modern electronic products, which are incredibly complex systems consisting of multiple interacting components. Today, engineers can analyze these systems using 1 of 2 suboptimal techniques, either individual component simulation with manual combination, which can be error prone or a one-size-fits-all approach, which can result in long simulation time. Using ANSYS HFSS Mesh Fusions game-changing technology, an engineer can solve each component at a level of fidelity most relevant for that component and then HFSS automatically fuses the results. This virtually eradicates the costs and the risks of traditional methods, enabling engineers to efficiently design and optimize complex products. Samsung Electronics is using HFSS Mesh Fusion to create optimal designs and to shrink design cycle times and costs for its next-generation flat screen televisions. The electronics giant uses this innovative technology to develop advanced designs that were previously unimaginable.  
Moving to M&A. In Q4, we closed our acquisition of Analytical Graphics, Inc., or AGI. With AGI, we will be able to address a broader market called digital mission engineering, which combines mission simulation and analysis from AGI with component and system-level simulation from ANSYS. Based on a third-party market analysis and primary interviews with industry experts, we believe that the AGI acquisition increases ANSYS' total addressable market by $800 million. That market is being fueled by the replacement of open-source code, unsustainable in-house code and the ongoing growth in the number of missions. 
Our combined portfolio will enable customers to simulate up and down the stack starting at the chip level and going all the way up to customers' entire mission, increasing the likelihood of success and saving them time, money and other crucial resources. 
This week, we announced a relationship with Keysight, which connects AGI's mission analysis software with Keysight's high fidelity RS systems modeling capability. This partnership builds on an existing relationship, which empowers engineers to evaluate mission level behavior and is a key enabler for aerospace applications, amongst others. 
PTC, another partner, continues to see success with its OEM of ANSYS technology. In its most recent earnings call, PTC reported that Creo powered by ANSYS products grew bookings by more than 20% in the quarter. The company highlighted one such deal at Shock linger, which added Creo simulation live to help spark innovation and decrease product development cycle times. 
As we look ahead to 2021, I'd like to reflect on the COVID-19 pandemic and put it in context of the ANSYS business. COVID had an adverse impact on our 2020 results, most pronounced in Q2 and Q3 with some customers choosing to be cautious with their spending. However, our strong execution in the back half of the year, including the record Q4 performance, resulted in ACV above the high end of our updated May guidance and within the originally established range for the year. We are seeing a continuation of Q4's cautious optimism in our customer base with the expectation that the economic pressures of the pandemic will start to ease in the second half of 2021, but tempered by concerns with virus mutations and vaccine rollout schedules. 
The takeaway is that we're assuming greater uncertainty in the timing of sales activities than we would have, had this been a non-COVID year. We are also planning for 2021 to be heavily back-end loaded. Similar to or even slightly more pronounced in 2020. And we expect a wider range of outcomes in our full year projections as was the case in 2020. You will hear more about our guidance for 2021 shortly. 
Let me now move to the long-term to when the pandemic is behind us. While we are not in a position to quantify these considerations, I believe that some customers will cut back during the pandemic, will increase spending in R&D and simulation to compensate for other investments in 2020. More important, however, I believe that we will see a number of tailwinds that serve to increase the post pandemic market growth rates as compared with our pre-pandemic projections. 
First, in a recent survey of nearly 900 executives and managers across industries, the firm McKinsey found the pandemic may have accelerated digital transformation by as much as a decade. I believe this is particularly relevant for our customers and that they will hasten their digital transformations post-pandemic. In the process driving increased and deeper use of simulation. 
The pandemic proved that R&D engineers are effective when working from home. And that they can use simulation to successfully develop products even with no access to their physical labs. As companies move to hybrid work models post pandemic, they must accelerate their digital transformations to replace legacy product development processes with modern tools and techniques. Multiphysics simulation with its core value proposition of helping to accelerate time to market and to deliver cost savings will be key to these transformations. 
Next, the pandemic seems to have pushed customers to accelerate roadmaps and to innovate faster in areas such as telecommunications and consumer electronics. We are also seeing increased R&D in the creation of eco-friendly products such as electric vehicles and lightweight, fuel-efficient aircraft engines, as we discussed in our last earnings call. All of these products are sophisticated and complex and require integrated multiphysics simulation for design and development. That will continue to drive increased post-pandemic demand across our entire portfolio, including our newly acquired AGI mission offerings. 
To summarize, despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic, Q4 was an outstanding quarter, marked by record financial results. Looking long term, we believe that the pandemic may actually cause our total addressable market to go faster than our pre-pandemic projections. This makes me confident that as the market leader, ANSYS will be able to continue to drive strong and profitable long-term growth. 
Our next speaker is Maria Shields. As you may know, Maria has been our CFO since 1998. And for those of you counting, that's 90 quarterly earnings calls. She's been instrumental in guiding ANSYS on a remarkable journey from our initial public offering in 1996 to our status today as a simulation industry leader. And it's very fitting that we have delivered record results in her last full quarter as CFO. On March 1, she will transition into a new role of Senior Vice President of Administration, where she will focus on company culture, talent and technology to help us operate at even greater efficiencies. 
Former board member, Nicole Anasenes will succeed Maria as CFO on March 1. With her experience in the tech sector as well as the knowledge of ANSYS, Nicole has hit the ground running since joining ANSYS full-time in December. In addition to the traditional CFO responsibilities, Nicole will directly oversee our M&A function as well as ANSYS' digital transformation. Nicole was CFO and COO at Squarespace, she was CFO at Infor, and spent 17 years with IBM in various leadership positions in finance, mergers and acquisitions and market development including as CFO of IBM's software middleware business and its cloud business. 
I'll now turn the call over to Maria to discuss our Q4 and 2020 financials, and then to Nicole to give details around the 2021 outlook and assumptions for the year. Maria?"

I truly appreciate the kind words and your ongoing support and partnership over the past 4 years. 
Hello, everyone. We are very pleased to report another strong quarter, resulting in record financial performance for both the quarter and the year. I'll spend a few minutes walking through an overview of the Q4 financial highlights. And then I'll turn the call over to Nicole to add qualitative and quantitative color around our initial outlook and key assumptions for the first quarter and full year 2021. 
Before I get into the details of our financial highlights, I would like to take a moment to say thank you to the entire ANSYS team. Your focus on execution, collaboration and ongoing commitment to customer excellence, enabled us to finish with both a record quarter and year across both operational and financial fronts. Despite the many uncertainties and disruptions that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We are also very excited about the closing of the AGI acquisition in early December. And the positive progress that the teams have made on integration activities. 
We closed the quarter with total revenue of $628 million or constant currency growth of 24%, and operating margin and EPS results that were both well above the high end of our Q4 guidance. This is quite a testament to the strength and durability of the ANSYS business model. Particularly when you consider the strong comparable of Q4 2019. Let me also add that consistent with every quarter of this past year, our revenue results as we closed out 2020 and were driven by solid sales execution. 
Other key financial metrics for the quarter continue, with 20% constant currency growth in ACV to a total of $666 million, of which 83% was from recurring sources. This compares to 78% in last year's fourth quarter. This is a new record for Q4 with respect to both total ACV and the percentage that is attributable to recurring sources. 
Q4's revenue results reflect the continued trend in solid lease sales that we've been experiencing throughout 2020, with a record 54% constant currency increase in lease license revenue. 
For the first time in 2020, in the fourth quarter, we reported a return to growth in the paid up software license line with 11% growth in constant currency. This yielded 38% constant currency growth in our software license revenue. The increase in lease license sales, combined with high renewal rates on maintenance contracts contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q4 total of $967 million, an 11% increase over last year's comparable balance. The strong top line results, combined with our continued focus on fiscal discipline, helped to drive a fourth quarter gross margin of 92% and an operating margin of 52%, which finished well above the high end of our Q4 guidance. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q4 was 19.5%, in line with our expectations. 
The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $2.96 and which also finished well above the high end of our guidance. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the fourth quarter with cash flow from operations that totaled $174 million, a 25% increase over last year's fourth quarter. The quarter's cash flow benefited from very strong receivables collection as well as the deferral of certain tax payments into 2021. And this translated to a new record of $547 million for the full year. We closed the year with a total of $913 million in cash and short-term investments, and a total debt balance of $798 million. 
Let me just close by saying that we are extremely fortunate to have finished 2020 with the best financial performance in our 50 year history. These results are a testament to the resiliency of the ANSYS business model, and to the tenacity, dedication and hard work of our employees, customers and partners. 
Now let me turn the call over to Nicole, who will continue with the topic of guidance. Nicole?"

First, I want to echo Maria's congratulations and gratitude to the entire ANSYS team for such an amazing 2020. And together, we delivered stellar outcomes in the face of unprecedented business uncertainty, the 1 ANSYS culture of teamwork and commitment to customer success that drove those results is one of the many reasons I am so thrilled to join the team. 
Looking into 2021, I want to share some of the key dynamics we have factored into our guidance. Due to the continued uncertainty about the timing and impact of a return to normal business operations post the pandemic, our guidance ranges continue to be wider than those we have historically provided pre pandemic. We anticipate that the current environment will continue through the first half of the year and expect a recovery in the business environment during the second half of the year with increased global economic stimulus and the global availability of vaccines. 
We continue to believe the impact will have a disproportionate effect on our small and medium-sized customers versus larger customers throughout 2021. We estimate trade restrictions between the U.S. and China have adversely impact our annual sales by approximately $25 million. 
While the trade environment has been rapidly changing and may continue to do so under the new U.S. administration, our outlook factors in the existing trade restrictions and dynamics that are in place today. We are expecting to see a continued mix shift from perpetual licenses to lease licenses as customers continue to find the flexibility of lease licensing and operating on the cloud more appealing. The reduced capital outlay associated with the leasing model is also more appealing to certain customers during a time of economic uncertainty. 
Our blended renewal rates across maintenance and leases have historically been approximately 90%, with the renewal rates on maintenance agreements being even higher. Our renewal rates have remained high, with only a slight reduction as compared to our historical experience. And our assumptions are that they will pick up slightly in 2021 toward historical levels. 
We continue to adjust our spending to reflect our expectations for the pace at which economic recovery will occur while balancing the need to invest for the long-term opportunity that we see ahead. 
We have also maintained and intend to continue our commitment to invest in our acquired companies as well as R&D in certain digital transformation projects as those projects are critical to our ability to operate efficiently and scale the business for future growth. We completed the acquisition of AGI on December 1, and have factored the expected impact into guidance, which translates to approximately 1 negative point of margin. We expect this dilutive impact to be the most pronounced in the first year post acquisition, consistent with our past experiences and approach to integration. 
As we look ahead to 2021, we expect to see a very similar seasonal pattern as we've seen in prior years, with a disproportionately large Q4, driven by customer planning and year-end spending patterns. 
In Q4 2020, we saw an outsized shift in customer behavior in December relative to what has historically occurred. There was a significant and unexpected acceleration in customer decisions to both purchase and pay. We exceeded the high end of our Q4 2020 guidance on ACV by $26 million with 20% constant currency growth and full year 2020 cash flow guidance by $72 million and grew 9%. 
Our strong finish leaves us optimistic and reinforces our belief that customers view simulation is essential and will continue to invest in their own digital transformation. 
Our full-year 2021 guidance reflects an improvement in momentum in both ACV and cash flow. However, some of the impact of that momentum started in December of 2020, which was seen in the overachievement above the high end of our guidance. While this momentum is positive, the dynamic also negatively affects 2021 growth comparisons for key financial metrics. For example, the $26 million of overachievement in ACV creates a 2% headwind to 2021 ACV growth. 
Although the environment remains fluid, and we are still in the midst of the pandemic, we believe that if post COVID economic recovery and the current trade environment remains in line with our expectations, our long-term guidance of $2 billion ACV in 2022 is attainable. 
Now let me get to the specifics of our guidance. In full-year 2021, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.790 billion to $1.875 billion, which is growth of 6% to 11% or 3% to 8% in constant currency, and EPS of $6.44 to $6.92. 
For Q1 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $360 million, which is 8% to 17% growth or 5% to 12% in constant currency. And EPS of $0.73 to $0.90. 
Our outlook for full year 2021 is to maintain industry-leading operating margins, which we expect to be in the range of 40% to 41%, and Q1 2021 operating margin in the range of 24% to 27.5%. The lower Q1 2021 operating margins reflect the seasonal nature of our business, with a relatively lower revenue contribution in the quarter, similar to what we experienced in Q1 of last year with an operating margin below 30%. 
For full-year 2021, we expect ACV in the range of $1.750 billion to $1.825 billion, which translates to 8% to 13% growth or 6% to 11% in constant currency. As we mentioned earlier, we expect ACV to be highly skewed towards the fourth quarter. 
We are expecting to deliver full year operating cash flow in a range of $475 million to $515 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV and profitability. It considers the continued trend of request for extended payment terms negotiated in new contracts as well as the timing of certain early collections and deferred tax payments in 2020 and that collectively raised full year 2020 cash flow and lowers the full year 2021 outlook. 
Additional details related to the cash flow guidance and specific impact to full year 2020 and 2021 are more fully provided in our prepared remarks document. 
Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q1 and full-year 2021 are also contained in the prepared remarks document. 
I am so proud of and thrilled to be part of the team who has delivered such outstanding results despite so many macro headwinds and business disruptions during a time of personal hardship for many. I am confident that with this team, we will be able to continue to deliver on our strategy of pervasive simulation and help our customers achieve their innovation and sustainability goals.

First question, though, is for Ajei and your comments about the TAM growth pre and post-pandemic. So can we just get a little bit more color? Is this expectations for all the different components of the TAM, given the core simulation and then the growth opportunities in IoT and electrification and others? Or were you talking specifically about just maybe 1 or 2 components of that total TAM mix?"

The other comments about",301,"Jack, thanks for the question. So my comments very specifically in the script on TAM, one was around the increase in TAM as a result of the AGI acquisition, which we said added about $800 million to our total addressable market. 
The other comments about tailwinds that I spoke of were more -- were harder to quantify. As I said in the script, the point about digital transformation is that we have seen customers embrace simulation more during the pandemic. And certainly, with the recognition that their engineers could work from home effectively away from corporate labs, that's also been another tailwind for the use of simulation. So we expect to see that continue, certainly with the value proposition of simulation being able to drive product to market faster and save money. So that's a tailwind. 
And the second one that I pointed to was, in certain areas, we've seen increased levels of investment. Now those are -- I specifically call our telecommunications and consumer electronics, and those are areas which require multiphysics simulation analysis. So it really reflects on the multi physical nature of our portfolio, which I think was the question that you were asking. 
But also, the other interesting thing that we've noticed, which I pointed to in the comments, is in the area of eco-friendly products. And I'm not sure if it's coincident or there's a coevality here with the pandemic. But with the -- in that area, we've seen certainly increased levels of investment whether it's electric vehicle, which we've identified and pointed to before, but also on other things like lightweighting and eco-friendly aircraft engines and others. And so this area continues to be also an area of increased growth and something that requires multiphysics simulation. So that was the context of my comments, Jackson."

So if your question -- the question was about ANSYS Cloud and I guess usage during the pandemic or during the last year. If you look at usage, the demand for ANSYS Cloud continue to increase.

If you look at usage, the demand for ANSYS Cloud continue to increase. And we've seen usage increasing by over 100% between 2019 and 2020. And what's interesting, and I think I mentioned this in the last call as well, we've had customers who've used ANSYS Cloud and reached a much more efficient solution than they would have on-premises. 
For example, Rockwell Automation, I think I mentioned, is using ANSYS Cloud to accelerate its product development process, and they showed that they were able to reduce simulations run times by about 50%, which allows, obviously, their engineers to solve problems more accurately. And the reason for that is because ANSYS Cloud is optimized for the ANSYS workload, and we've done some work to make sure that the Azure infrastructure and which it runs as appropriate, and we can take advantage of the latest hardware and interconnect that Azure has available. So absolutely, ANSYS Cloud is certainly something that customers taking advantage of during this time. We've made the majority of our flagships available on ANSYS Cloud, mechanical, fluids, electromagnetics, et cetera. I just talked about the scale out that we have available there on the script as well as things like new workloads like OPTIS, SPEOS, VRX. 
So we're seeing the usage across all of our physics, and we're obviously seeing greater usage. And that, coupled with the flexibility that we have, which allows customers to bring their own license or bring their own hardware license or software license or just moving in to a SaaS world, that hybrid flexibility that we can afford, I think gives customers a lot of options. 
That being said, while we're excited about the cloud offering, and we're very encouraged by the rapid progress, I think it's important to note that the majority of our customers today use ANSYS products on-premises in their own data centers or in their own private cloud, and so ANSYS Cloud is obviously growing rapidly, but it's still a very small piece of our business today and for the foreseeable future."

There's a lot that we could go through, and I'm -- I, maybe in the interest of time, I'll just focus on a couple of things. When you think about our journey as a company, we've gone from providing point technologies back when we started like structures. Over the years, we've brought together a comprehensive set of physics through a combination of acquisitions as well as organic development. 
And now we have a full-fledged set of physics that are integrated together. And it's this integration capability across all of these physics that's profoundly important. And we've continued to add to that with materials technologies, for example, with optimization capabilities, et cetera. And that has led to the building up of our platform capability, which is profoundly important to be able to address and provide that agility to support different industry applications. 
And because we have all of these multiphysics capabilities integrated together and exposed on a platform, that makes it easier for our customers as well as our own ACE engineers to build industry-specific or customer-specific solutions that take advantage of the core capabilities that we provide as well as integrate with core components that might be available from outside of our own ecosystem. 
So that's been the direction that we're pursuing. Our technology is available both on-premises and in the cloud. And I think we have a very robust and a very strong technical underpinnings to be able to support not only the more traditional use case where you're dealing with. We use the simulation of the tool, but also we the use of simulation within as part of an integrated platform to deliver value-added applications to customers. And you're seeing this in some of the announcements that we've made. You referenced one of them with respect to BMW. We've made some announcements in the health care space and others where we're working with partners who are able to provide application-specific intelligence that wraps on top of our simulation solutions because of the way we're that architecting our platforms and our capability. 
Now with respect to the long-term road map, I would refer you, one of those key elements is the platform. And obviously, we just talked about platform a second ago. Another area that perhaps might be interesting is AI/ML where we've talked about the use of machine learning. We see that we continue to make investments in AI/ML capability because we really see AI/ML as an orthogonal but supportive technology simulation. Simulation makes AI/ML better, the insight from AI/ML better and AI/ML can support insights from simulation. 
And you see this -- you see these technologies and techniques already being incorporated into our products. You see this, for example, in our semiconductor portfolio, and you continue to see this integrated into other aspects of our products, whether it comes to usability, whether it comes to helping customers or helping engineers navigate the solution space and so forth. And we can obviously go into more details, but in the interest of time, let's just leave those there."

So your question is really how we are integrating with some of these larger customers and how are we working with them? So if you recall, when we went through the go-to-market transformation that we spoke off a couple of years ago, and when we really started to accelerate in the last couple of years, it was around putting together a traditional customer pyramid where we had enterprise customers at the top of the pyramid and enterprise customers were deemed to be such, not only because they had significant spending powers and have large and complex problems to solve. And therefore, we're spending a lot of money on R&D. But also because we had enterprise customers who were -- who are being supported by specialized teams. And so we would have -- we were able to allocate to these enterprise customers, dedicated account management, both on the technical side as well as the sales side to help navigate through the account. 
That process has been underway for a few years. When you -- and so that gives us within some of these large customers, it gives us great relationships and a very good understanding of what's going on and we've been able to help educate the customers about the capabilities that ANSYS can provide. That, coupled with the other comment I made about digital transformation. Clearly, this is an important area for customers and in -- the digital transformation of that product life cycle continues to be important. The pandemic, as I've mentioned earlier, accelerated that and made it clear and manifest customers that they need to enable their engineers to be able to work from anywhere. And that's obviously possible through a digital thread and simulation in some sense is the most -- the purest digital representation of a product. 
And so that was -- that's the second sort of broad thread about the recognition that people can be effective, engineers can be effective to taking advantage of the technology from wherever. I think the third and perhaps the most important is that, look, at the end of the day, simulation provides tremendous value to customers. They are -- we've talked about this for a long time. We've said, look, we can help you accelerate product to market, that's one area, that drives top line revenue growth. And we've also said, we can help you save money. We can help you save money because you don't have to build physical prototypes, you can do the proverbial more with less. And that also resonates with customers, especially in tough economic times. 
So when you put all of this stuff together, it's no wonder that we're seeing some large deals from customers. This is not accidental. This has been planned. This has been multi-years and planning to make sure that we build these relationships to help them with their digital transformation and to continue to drive investments in the portfolio and to continue to show the value that simulation will provide."

And we talked about a number of areas. We talked about the core business. We talked about, which is the historical use of simulation and the design and validation phase of the product life cycle. We talked about high-growth solutions like electric vehicles or electrification, autonomy, IoT, 5G. And then we talked about simulation being used in nontraditional use cases and things like predictive maintenance through digital twins and so forth. 
And what we did when we presented that, as we pointed out that the -- that there was more predictability on the base case use cases of simulation as it's historically been. But in some of these longer-term opportunities, in particular, simulation being used, for example, in predictive maintenance and digital twins, we pointed out that there was a significant amount of variability, depending on the rate of adoption of digital technologies and we talked about how that was being affected by assumptions you make about the pace and rate of deployment of capabilities that may have historically not used simulation. 
So that's the -- that's where we were a couple of years ago. The observations that we've seen in the pandemic, as I said in my script, have been very specifically on certain areas. The digital transformation comment is real. Customers are recognizing they need to spend more -- to pay more attention to the digital transformation. We've talked a lot about this on the call already. And so that, we believe, represents an aggregate tailwind, an acceleration of activities that may have taken place already, but those -- that's an acceleration. And when you start to think about some of these other areas like electronics, consumer electronic -- consumer electronics, telecommunications, again, the pandemic caused people to think more about what does it mean for the communications infrastructure? How do I interact with my office working remotely, et cetera? And you started to see that level of interest in the end markets, which has obviously translated into increased demand in the electronics and high-tech vertical for us, which translates across to a number of our products. 
And as I said, in certain areas like green, it's not clear that it's directly related to the pandemic, but we continue to see increased focus on this. Perhaps it's because of broader recognition of the importance of ESG initiatives, maybe it's because of the pandemic, but we're continuing to see more activities there. And again, this entire area of getting to an eco-friendly set of products accelerates activities that might otherwise have taken longer, come in a little bit earlier. 
So I think the core recognition in the elements of the market remain what we had talked about, the question is timing. And as I said also in the call, it's hard for us to quantify what the effects of these tailwinds are going to be. So I want to be very clear that we see this anecdotally, but it's hard -- we are not quantifying the effects of these tailwinds at this point."

I think in the past, ANSYS has talked about how R&D budgets are one of the first budgets to be restored out of the downturns and ANSYS as a company typically sees kind of the inflection faster than maybe some of your peers in the industrial space. And I guess with the strong Q4, you put up 20% constant currency organic ACV growth, large deals, budget flush, it would appear that certainly, you're seeing some strength here, and some might see -- might argue you're seeing some of these budgets come back online. But when I look at your guidance, it implies that ACV growth doesn't really get much better on an organic basis next year. So I guess, what's driving that? Are there certain end markets or GEOs that you're seeing caution? Or is it just conservatism? I know there is a CFO -- with the CFO transition, just trying to understand what would drive such a relatively cautious outlook given the strong results you put up here in the quarter?"

So let me characterize kind of some of the assumptions that we put into guidance. And I'd say the first thing I'd point out is what Maria spoke about, which is significant overachievement of ACV and therefore, revenue in the rest of the P&L in the quarter. And so that overachievement on the ACV side alone is about a 2-point headwind to growth year-to-year. 
And so what we're seeing really -- what we saw in the fourth quarter leaves us a lot of optimism that things -- once that we get through the capitulation of the pandemic that things -- that there's a strong demand for simulation that customers are accelerating their digital transformation and that we are well positioned based on the investments we've made in the portfolio over the past couple of years, because we've been investing through the pandemic that come out of it with a position of strength that we're going to benefit from it. 
I think what we're expecting to see and what's baked into the guidance is that, generally speaking, the first half is going to continue to have its ups and downs really because of COVID uncertainty. And by the second half of the year, we expect to see more momentum in economic activity as things start to open up and government continue to do the right thing to support economic development. And so we have visibility into the first quarter as to the full year pipeline. And the guidance really reflects the strength of the pipeline. And like other years, we're expecting to see it more back-end loaded from an ACV and a revenue perspective, driven by the timing of large multiyear deals and customer planning activities. 
So from our perspective, sitting here in February, it's just a little difficult to predict such a significant level of overachievement that we saw in the fourth quarter, sitting where we're at right now. But the situation is fluid and will continue engaging with you throughout the year to update it as we know more."

Q2 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we significantly beat our financial guidance across all our key metrics.

Q2 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we significantly beat our financial guidance across all our key metrics. I'm particularly pleased with our ACV performance for the quarter, which grew at nearly 23% in constant currency.
Our growing momentum from Q4 of 2020 and the first half of this year gives us increased confidence in our business and in our ability to execute against our goals. It is also further validation of our strategy of pervasive simulation, where simulation is used throughout the product development process by engineers in every discipline. That strategy, combined with our best-in-class multiphysics products, our comprehensive go-to-market approach and our deep and lasting customer relationships, has paved the way for our consistent success.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve with the uncertainties of the Delta variant making headlines around the world. Despite these uncertainties, our customers are continuing to invest in innovation, R&D and product design to drive their future successes. As such, we are continuing to see demand for ANSYS simulation increase in the marketplace, and our pipeline for the remainder of 2021 is strong. As a result of that continued strength and our track record of execution, we are once, again, increasing our annual guidance for ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow. Nicole will provide more details in just a few minutes.
Looking at Q2, all our major geographies performed well, with the Americas leading the way. I'm very proud of our team in India, which came in above our internal plan despite challenging COVID-19-related conditions in the country. From an industry perspective, high-tech and semiconductors, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation were our top verticals. We also saw ongoing strength with our enterprise customers. Following the trend of the past 2 quarters, we saw improved spending with small- and medium-sized customers. While these smaller customers have not yet returned to their pre-pandemic spending levels, the progress we've seen over the past several months gives me added confidence in the future.
One of the largest deals of the quarter was with a North American leader in semiconductors. This $39 million multiyear agreement ensures that the company will have the necessary capacity to run 5-nanometer and eventually 3-nanometer designs on ANSYS Redhawk-SC, our gold standard, powered noise and reliability sign-off solution for digital design.
The company has also standardized on ANSYS multiphysics technology across chip, package and system to reduce power consumption, thereby increasing its competitiveness in the marketplace. We also closed a $30 million agreement with a long-time automotive customer. This leader in electric vehicle technology has expanded its use of mechanical, fluids and electromagnetic solutions and has adopted additional ANSYS technologies, including automated design analysis, multibody dynamics and process integration and design optimization. This customer is working with the ANSYS AIM team to jointly develop workflows for noise and vibration analysis and topology optimization. The company is also using ANSYS Discovery to decrease its simulation backlog and get products to market faster, all the while holding the line on development costs.
Just a few weeks ago, we unveiled ANSYS 2021 Release 2, which features advances across our multiphysics product line, from structured fluids and electromagnetics, to materials, photonics and embedded software. R2 includes a number of advancements in core physics, simplified workflows and integrated data management.
Our solutions are based on our case of experience and cannot be easily duplicated creating high barriers to entry for potential competitors. While I could spend the entire hour detailing each product's capabilities, today, I will focus on just one key differentiator, which cuts across our entire portfolio, namely scalability.
As customer problems become increasingly more challenging, the size of those challenges require simulation software that could scale to unprecedented levels. Throughout our history, ANSYS has been a leader in product scalability and we have extended that leadership in recent releases. Our ability to create high resolution, fluid mechanic simulations with practical turnaround times enables customers to solve next-generation challenges, ranging from rotating machinery, to external aerodynamics, to environmental simulations.
4 years ago, an Fluence scaled to nearly 200,000 CPU cores, enabling customers to solve challenging problems faster than ever by calculating billions of cells. To the best of our knowledge, that remains a record for commercial computational fluid dynamics code. This massive scalability has enabled our customer at the Technical University in Eindhoven to solve a complex aerodynamic problem with 3 billion computational cells with 20 billion unknowns. The most recent advances in ANSYS 2021 R2 have sped up parallel mesh generation by 20x, removing what is often the bottleneck for detailed simulations of transient phenomena, which occur in aerodynamics and gas turbine simulations. That 225x speed up over the last decade has enabled ANSYS customers to reduce simulation time on a full thermal mechanical model from 2 weeks to 1.5 hours. And now with ANSYS 2021 R2, those calculations could take just minutes, leading to improved product reliability as users run more simulations faster. That breakthrough was made possible by doubling the core counts, while reducing the memory required by 40%. 
In our latest LS-DYNA release, we have significantly improved performance, which enables customers to run transient behavior studies with 28 trillion calculated variables, and that's trillion with a T. That means safer cars and more reliable electronics.
A global high-tech customer use ANSYS HFSS and our new ANSYS mesh fusion to solve a previously unsolved integrated circuit and packaging problem by scaling across the multi-node HPC cluster with 18 terabytes of RAM and 576 cores. In ANSYS 2021 R2, we introduced the P+ measure, which extends mesh fusion to deliver additional speed and capacity. P+ has sped up meshing on PCB bond wire package models by 18x, which will bring new innovations to the 5G, autonomy and industrial Internet of Things market.
ANSYS semiconductor customers are using next-generation distributed and grid computing techniques to model and solve chips with 2.6 trillion or more devices. ANSYS RedHawk-SC set a capacity and performance record in Power Integrity sign-off last year by extracting 66 billion electrical nodes on the design of GPU and solving it over 2,400 CPUs in a fully distributed manner. In ANSYS 2021 R2, our solver performance doubled, enabling customers to sign off even larger chip designs using the same compute resources and run time.
Scalability is one of ANSYS' many differentiators and is becoming increasingly important to our customers as they develop next-generation products. We believe that our history of product scalability, along with accuracy, ease of use and speed to solution create a difficult environment for any would-be competitor, while giving our users the functionality they need to solve the most challenging product problems.
We are continuing to train the next generation of engineers in the use of ANSYS solutions by expanding our free offering for students. To date, nearly 2 million students around the world have downloaded our products. And just a few weeks ago, we launched an additional offering for students to download our electronics desktop and to enroll in ANSYS innovation courses for training. These students now have access to our leading electronics products, including HFSS, Maxwell and Icepak to train them in developing the products of tomorrow. And thanks to our new partnership, Cornell University will design and develop online training courses with real-world applications from ANSYS.
Moving to partnerships. I'm excited to announce that we have expanded our work with TSMC to include new certifications for ANSYS RedHawk and ANSYS Totem. These new certifications for power network extraction, power integrity and reliability, signal electromigration and transistor level custom designs enable joint customers to meet critical power, thermal and reality standards for next-generation product applications.
ANSYS continues to be recognized for our inventive approach to engineering technology. I'm proud that for the third year in a row, Fast Company has named us one of the best places to work for innovators. I'm even more excited that 5 of my colleagues have been recognized with the prestigious women of color STEM awards. These awards showcase the outstanding scientific and engineering achievements of women around the world, and ANSYS is proud of these pioneers who serve as an inspiration for us all.
Turning to our Environmental, Social & Governance initiatives. I'm pleased that MSCI has upgraded our ESG rating to AA, naming us a leader in the software and services industry. MSCI cited ANSYS' comprehensive talent pipeline relative to our peers, our focus on business ethics and our capabilities in helping customers to innovate in areas such as clean technologies.
To summarize, Q2 was another great quarter for ANSYS and a further validation that our pervasive simulation strategy is resonating with the market. Our strong sales pipeline, our ongoing momentum with enterprise customers, the resurgence of small and medium businesses and our continued leadership across our product portfolio give me further confidence in our ability to meet our newly increased outlook for 2021. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Nicole."
24893,1674158708,2364392,"ANSYS, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","ANSYS, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our second quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q3 and 2021.Our strong Q2 results reflect an outsta",1086,"Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our second quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q3 and 2021.
Our strong Q2 results reflect an outstanding execution across our business, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS all above our Q2 guidance. As Ajei mentioned, Q2 ACV was especially strong and exceeded our expectations. Both our large enterprise customer and our small and medium-sized customer spending patterns performed better than expected, and our growth during the quarter was broad-based.
Now let me discuss some of our Q2 financial highlights. Q2 ACV was $430.5 million and grew year-over-year 25% or 23% in constant currency. We saw strong performance across customer types, geographies and industries. ACV from recurring sources represented 82% of the total. Q2 total revenue was $452.6 million and grew 16% or 14% in constant currency, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Like ACV, Q2 revenue growth was from across the business.
In the first half of 2021, we had strong top line performance, with ACV and revenue both growing double digit, 16% and 18%, respectively. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $927.1 million, representing a 10% increase over last year's second quarter balance. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline. This yielded a solid second quarter gross margin of 90% and an operating margin of 41.7%, which is better than our Q2 guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by revenue performance above our guidance as well as the timing of investments.
The result was second quarter EPS of $1.85, which was also above the high end of our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of investments. Our effective tax rate in Q2 was 19%, the tax rate we expect for the remainder of 2021. Our cash flow from operations in Q2 totaled $118.9 million, which benefited from strong collections, driven by a reduction in the percent of receivables past due and was partially offset by differences in the timing of tax payments as compared to Q2 2020. We ended the quarter with $958.2 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet.
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We continue to build confidence in our outlook for the year. Coming off our strong finish in Q2, we are initiating guidance for Q3 and increasing our ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This increase reflects the strong broad-based financial performance in the second quarter and our current sales pipeline.
For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $400 million to $425 million and EPS in the range of $1.22 to $1.39. As I mentioned, for the full year, we are raising our ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook. We are increasing our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.845 billion. This represents growth of 11.4% to 14.1% or 10.8% to 13.5% in constant currency. We are raising our full year ACV guidance to reflect the Q2 performance, which exceeded our expectations and our increased confidence in the full year pipeline. This raise was offset by a few million dollars of currency headwinds. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by $30 million, which translates to an increase of quarterly growth rates in 2021 will vary with Q2 and Q3 being the strongest 2 quarters. Based on our performance in Q2, we expect Q2 to have the highest ACV growth rate for the year. 
As a reminder, we still expect Q4 growth to be muted given the Q4 2020 growth comparison. Consistent with prior years, the dollar value of ACV will be highly skewed towards the fourth quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.84 billion to $1.89 billion, which is growth of 8.5% to 11.5% or 7.3% to 10.2% in constant currency. Similar to our ACV guidance, this increase reflects our strong Q2 revenue performance and increased confidence in our full year pipeline, offset by a few million dollars of currency headwind. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $23 million, which translates to constant currency growth of 1.5 points higher than the midpoint of our May guidance.
As you know, ASC 606 introduces revenue growth volatility within the quarter. However, on a full year revenue basis, revenue growth is less variable. In the second half of 2021, we expect revenue growth to be impacted by the year-over-year compare and mix of business. We are increasing our full year EPS and now expect EPS to be in the range of $6.85 to $7.15. This increase incorporates our strong Q2 performance and is offset by a few cents of currency headwinds. It is worth noting that some of our strong Q2 EPS performance was driven by the timing of investments that moved from Q2 to the second half of the year.
Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. We are increasing our 2021 outlook to a range of $495 million to $535 million. This increase is driven by stronger collections expected during the year and continued improvement in payment terms toward pre-pandemic levels. We are pleased with our strong first half in operating cash flow. But as a reminder, second half cash flow is most impacted by whether large Q4 deals closed near the beginning or the end of the quarter.
For modeling purposes, we're expecting third quarter operating margin in the range of 34% to 36.5%. And for the full year, we continue to expect operating margin to be in the range of 40% to 41%. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2021 are contained in the prepared remarks document.
I would like to thank the ANSYS team for their continued commitment to our customers and fellow colleagues during this prolonged time of uncertainty. The team delivered exceptional execution during the quarter, which drove our strong Q2 financial performance. The combination of best-in-class execution, with a strong recurring business model and growing sales pipeline, sets us up well to deliver on our 2021 outlook as well as our longer-term financial objectives.

I would say that it went back to a very similar pattern that we saw in Q1, which was it was broad-based across geographies and industries. As you recall, coming into the year, we were a little bit cautious about SMB and kind of the underlying momentum of SMB and we had expected enterprise customers to perform as expected. I would say in the second quarter, we got a bit more out of the enterprise than we expected to get, which was great because it's shown people are really seriously committing to their R&D portfolios and accelerating development, but we saw for the second quarter in a row that resurgence on the SMB side. And there wasn't anything that was specific localized or kind of in narrow form, it was just kind of everywhere. So I would say it's that really kind of broad-based performance that we saw really in the second quarter and the first half that contributed to the confidence that we had in raising our overall ACV for the year by the 2.7 points at constant currency."

So that is exactly the right way to look at it.
So there's 2 components to it. There's the collections piece along the ACV side, and then there's the payment side. And so on the collection side, we've seen -- we have seen an improvement at a more accelerated rate, both in terms of lack of asking for extension on payment terms, people catching up on aged payments and people overall maintaining a level of current balance at higher rates than they had through the pandemic. So all of that is, I think, contributing to the acceleration on -- part of the acceleration on the cash flow side.
The headwind in this particular quarter was really tax payments and the timing of tax payments, particularly in a quarter can have a more distorting dynamic overall. And so as you recall, last year, there were some deferral incentives during the pandemic that raised cash flow in the second quarter. And then this year, those payments were due as expected in the second quarter.
And so overall, I would expect to see still a little bit of situation and volatility in the relationship between the 2 just because of the nature of the payments piece is not kind of back to normalized levels. But what you can count on is that underneath the covers, the momentum around collections and customers kind of behavior around that has been quite good, and we're really happy with where we're at."

Did you have any pull-ins potentially from a quarter as well?"

So as you know, ANSYS Cloud provides managed access to HPC resources and that allows our customers to essentially learn larger and higher fidelity simulations. And as you know, the Cloud also supports a very flexible licensing model, and that includes an elastic pay-as-you-go model as well as a hybrid model that allows customers to mix and match elastic as well as lease licenses.
Now we have a number of internal metrics that we deploy to measure the business. And we are seeing probably a 5x, 5x greater usage as compared with this time last year. So very nice growth as a result of the activities that we've done as well as, of course, external conditions with people working from home.
This year, if you think about what we've done to augment the cloud, we've added cloud support for ANSYS LSTC for ANSYS-DYNA for our Lumerical products. We've completed SOC2 certification. And we also continue to focus on the overall customer experience. And that's really translated very positively for customers. And we -- a couple of months ago -- a few months ago, we published a release about a customer [indiscernible] who talked about how they could speed up their simulations by 7x, which obviously is a significant perspective because they're able to take advantage of the most recent and most capable hardware in the cloud as well as the cloud capabilities that we have.
So we're very excited about our cloud direction. We have made all of the necessary investments. And of course, it's still early days because we're talking about a relatively small portion of our business."

So as you recall, there was -- there were dynamics last year where perpetual was a little bit more muted. And I think what you're seeing this year is just some of the return of some of that business overall.
But if you look at the business over longer periods of time, the growth and acceleration of the business is really driven by the lease model, and the perpetual business has been roughly flat over those longer periods of time. In terms of the second half, I think one of the dynamics that we saw in Q4 last year was not only exceeding the high end of guidance by $45 million, but there was a significant perpetual mix in Q4. And so how we're looking at it on a go-forward basis is not really expecting net repeat performance in Q4 overall is some of the underlying factors are baked into the guidance."

As you know, some of those products organically developed, others came in through acquisition. And we embark on activities such as an M&A or organic development, specifically when we see opportunities in the market where customers are either leading us or where we see an opportunity to provide greater functionality to solve the customer problem.
And so all of the acquisitions were in all of the internal development that we do is driven by an analysis of what that market would look like. And I'm delighted that we're generally seeing what we expected to pan out is, in fact, panning out. You talked about Lumerical photonics. That's obviously a very important part. If you think about data centers, for example, and we're seeing obvious traction there because this product is -- fits into our overall portfolio. So when we go to customers, we can go to them with a broader set of capabilities that includes critical capabilities such as Lumerical that you mentioned, that we can -- where we can go in and talk about an end-to-end solution that addresses the needs that the customer may have. And you see that repeated across our portfolio, where smaller products are playing important roles in being able to stitch together an end-to-end workflow to allow customers to solve some of the most complex problems that they're dealing with.
So I think that's -- hopefully, that addresses your first question. With respect to your second question, I'm excited, obviously, with our performance in high-tech and semiconductor. The -- I no longer think of the Apache acquisition. That's part of our semiconductor organization, and has been for a number of years. And obviously, we have a number of deep integrations across our portfolio between our semiconductor business and our electromagnetics activities, and you start to think about next-generation products like 3D IC and challenges, and that's when the entire ANSYS portfolio comes in going from our semiconductor portfolio all the way through our multiphysics, if you will.
And so I'm very excited about the portfolio, the capabilities. I think we have market-leading products across the board there, and customers tell us that they're able to solve tremendous challenges with our offerings, and we're excited about the future."

So we're not anticipating in our guidance any increase -- any meaningful change in the trajectory of the services business.
In terms of the skill sets that you're referring to, I'd say that, yes, we are hiring. We are investing in the business. We're investing in the areas that you and Ajei just discussed now around helping our customers connect to physics the other multiphysics. And so those are skill sets that we continue to invest in.

It's -- I think it's really difficult to point to a specific allocation of one bucket to another because these things are all related to each other. Look, at the end of the day, if you just reflect on the ANSYS portfolio, what we've built is a market-leading set of capabilities of individual physics, which are connected together. And so this multiphysics capability is what's necessary for customers as they solve some of the most challenging problems that they're dealing with.
And so when you think about electrification, for example, or 5G or IoT, all of these areas are complex. Customers are investing a significant amount of money. They're looking for simulation offerings to be able to support them in their R&D efforts. And we have the technology, we have the capabilities, we have the relationships, and we can support them on their journey. So that's a very important aspect. You've got to have the right goods when people need them. 
The second thing is that, obviously, around the world, we are seeing customers recognizing that there is going to be an end to the pandemic and that they have to continue to make investments in R&D. And you're certainly the small and medium business customers are perhaps most [indiscernible] of that because they are -- But earlier in the pandemic, you saw a shutdown for SMB customers, right? They -- they're most concerned about cash. They're most concerned about the potential demand future because these are smaller companies and have less -- they have lesser cash resources than some of the larger companies.
But what we're seeing now is obviously an opening up of spending there, which is reflective of the fact that customers around the world, not just SMB customers, customers around the world are looking at the world after things completely open up again or certainly after a pandemic world, post-pandemic world where things start to get back to normal with respect to the broader economy, which means -- and they recognized that in order for them to be successful, they have to have products that people want. And that means more investment in R&D and more investment in product design, as I mentioned in my comments.
So the demand is also increasing. And I think that those 2 things work together. You have to have the right products. You have to have the growing demand. If you didn't have either one of them, you wouldn't necessarily be able to deliver the results. And I think that we are -- that's what -- that's exactly what we're seeing, and we're very excited about what we can provide to our customers and where the market is going."

So look, we're very excited about Discovery. And I think we have to make it a little bit more tangible, perhaps I can go back to the example I gave in the script, which was one of our customers who's using Discovery in a very interesting way.
So for this particular customer, some of the detailed flow and thermal management simulation is done by experts using ANSYS flagship products. But the typical turnaround time is maybe 60 days because of the complexity of the simulation and they have a relatively small analyst team serving a larger design team. So they introduced Discovery as a way for the design engineers to do some of the simpler simulation on their own. So things like flow distribution or pressure drops. So they're able to do that by themselves and they can improve the design of their components before they hand off the design for a complete system simulation to the expert analyst. So that's an example where the whole thesis that we had was this is something that design engineers could use to really amplify the capability of the analyst that's something that's borne out here.
And for this customer, they're also using -- they also had some outsourced CAE spend, and they're using Discovery now to help train their designers on some basic structural analysis so they can limit some source work and simple geometry changes. And what that does for them is it changes the design iteration time and it takes it down from a couple of weeks to a couple of days.
So that gives you some perspective. We're very excited about the technology. We continue to make advances in the technology. And obviously, I mentioned a couple of customer examples. You talked briefly about PTC and the use of Creo Simulation Live. And on PTC's earnings call last week, I believe they reported continued traction with increased expansions driven by a migration around Creo 7. As you know, they are OEMing our Discovery products into Creo, Creo Simulation Live, Creo Simulation. And that -- Creo 7 is their latest enterprise release. And so obviously, there's increased traction that comes from that. And they also talked about a customer win where the real-time simulation capabilities we're helping to simplify the customers' design process.
So we're very excited about the technology. It continues to perform as we had expected. Obviously, it's a relatively small piece of our business, but the market dynamics around what we're seeing is strong."

During the quarter, you had put out a press release about a customer looks like expanding the relationship they had with ANSYS.

You've talked in the past about sustainability and how you can help your customers, but the drumbeat just seems to be getting louder and louder. Are you seeing customers accelerate any decisions around this sustainability focus? Or is it still -- is that still kind of an extra add-on benefit to what you're already bringing to the customer?"

When you look at -- let's say, for example, a big trend in the automotive industry, which is around electrification, right? Obviously, that is -- there's a discussion about the future of the internal combustion engine and the rating pace at which electric cars and vehicles will be adopted broadly. And you're seeing car companies, for example, making the decision to just simply move from one to the other. And that's obviously driven in part by issues of emissions and being more eco-friendly.
We talked last year about -- in the aerospace industry, we talked about some customer wins, where the motivation for the customer was really to make their engines more fuel efficient. So it was about lightweighting. It was about reduced fuel consumption, increased efficiency of fuel. And so even in aircraft engines, for example, you're seeing that as being a primary driver for new design of engines.
And so it's absolutely a part of a broader trend. I mentioned Vanword earlier. They're, of course, building a sustainable offshore wind turbines and they're a simulation user. But again, their focus is on renewable energy sources. So compliance purposes as well as eco-friendly, all of these things are drivers of product design and product requirements and obviously, to ensure that customers can meet those standards, simulation plays a really important role."

As you look at the shift from ACE development to electrical vehicles, obviously, a completely different product. Is there -- do you have a sense at this stage as they move away from ICE design and new model introductions to pure electrical? What does the ANSYS footprint change in the auto vertical look like? Does it grow? Or does it -- I mean, obviously, 10 years from now, maybe we have a lot less ICE engineers out there? And secondly, you called out in your prepared remarks, the health care vertical and a large win in using simulation software to train some algorithms. Can you just expand on that a bit? And how big might that opportunity be in the health care vertical?"

So we can help them with",654,"Firstly, with respect to automotive, what's exciting for us is that we have the technology and the capabilities from a product perspective and a relationship perspective to support our customers as they go through that transition. So we can help them with battery management technologies. We can help them with electric drivetrains, electric motor design, all of the elements that you would expect that would sort of go into the replacement of the internal combustion engine with an electric battery-powered environment.
But above and beyond that, if you think about the challenges that some of our customers are facing as they make this transition, and electric car is not just simply an internal combustion car with one means of propulsion replacing another, it's an opportunity for our customers to redesign. In fact, they have to redesign it because the assumptions that are previously made of an engine in the front of the car, where -- which concentrates the weight in the front of the car, those assumptions are no longer relevant because perhaps now you have a battery that's uniformly distributed across the floor of the car. And so that changes the weight distribution and changes the assumptions of the way that the car was originally designed.
And so there is a significant rethinking taking place in these car companies, especially the auto companies, who've historically relied on the reuse of technology from one generation to another. There is a rethinking of saying, what does it mean for us to support this to build an electric car? And so that -- all of that leads to and drives increased use of simulation and certainly for ANSYS Simulation. 
If you think about crash design, right? So the problems that you may have been dealing with earlier for crash might have been, how do you think about the passenger? Will the passenger be protected? And that's a complex multiphysics problem because you're dealing with the structural integrity, you're dealing with the deployment of the airbag, which is a fluids problem. So there's multiphysics problems in nature that need to be addressed through simulation.
Now the question is, it goes above and beyond that, and it says, well, what is the likelihood of a fire -- some kind of a catastrophic fire that might take place as a result of a battery rupture? Can you solve that problem? So it starts to become more and more challenging. And so this transition is not just a matter of supporting the design of the engine per se, it is the actual car in the aggregate, and that sort of plays well to our strength and our capabilities.
Now with respect to your second question about health care, while health care is still overall a very -- relatively small part of the ANSYS business, simulation continues to grow, and we do well in, for example, the design and the manufacturing of medical devices, and that was obviously reflected in the performance in the quarter. But as we look to the future, we are excited about the increased use of simulation as a validation in the market.
So the use of in silico trials as opposed to just in vitro, in vivo and the use of simulation techniques supporting that, those in silico trials, I think, is really helpful. And we're working with early adopters who are using simulation to target specific surgical outcomes. And this is obviously early, early stage. There's not really much revenue associated with a very, very early stage, but this is about how do you support a physician as they're making decisions about surgery. Those are -- at the end of the day, some of those can be simplified into problems of computational fluid dynamics. And of course, we have fantastic technology in that space. And so being able to put all of that together and packaging that, I think that's certainly something for the future."

Q2 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we significantly beat our financial guidance across all our key metrics. I'm particularly pleased with our ACV performance for the quarter, which grew at nearly 23% in constant currency. 
Our growing momentum from Q4 of 2020 and the first half of this year gives us increased confidence in our business and in our ability to execute against our goals. It is also further validation of our strategy of pervasive simulation, where simulation is used throughout the product development process by engineers in every discipline. That strategy, combined with our best-in-class multiphysics products, our comprehensive go-to-market approach and our deep and lasting customer relationships, has paved the way for our consistent success. 
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve with the uncertainties of the Delta variant making headlines around the world. Despite these uncertainties, our customers are continuing to invest in innovation, R&D and product design to drive their future successes. As such, we are continuing to see demand for ANSYS simulation increase in the marketplace, and our pipeline for the remainder of 2021 is strong. As a result of that continued strength and our track record of execution, we are once, again, increasing our annual guidance for ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow. Nicole will provide more details in just a few minutes. 
Looking at Q2. All our major geographies performed well, with the Americas leading the way. I'm very proud of our team in India, which came in above our internal plan, despite challenging COVID-19-related conditions in the country. From an industry perspective, high-tech and semiconductors, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation were our top verticals. We also saw ongoing strength with our enterprise customers. Following the trend of the past 2 quarters, we saw improved spending with small- and medium-sized customers. While these smaller customers have not yet returned to their pre-pandemic spending levels, the progress we've seen over the past several months gives me added confidence in the future. 
One of the largest deals of the quarter was with a North American leader in semiconductors. This $39 million multiyear agreement ensures that the company will have the necessary capacity to run 5-nanometer and eventually, 3-nanometer designs on Ansys Redhawk-SC, our gold standard, powered noise and reliability sign-off solution for digital design. 
The company has also standardized on ANSYS multiphysics technology across chip, package and system to reduce power consumption, thereby increasing its competitiveness in the marketplace. We also closed a $30 million agreement with a long-time automotive customer. This leader in electric vehicle technology has expanded its use of mechanical, fluids and electromagnetic solutions and has adopted additional ANSYS technologies, including automated design analyses, multibody dynamics and process integration and design optimization. This customer is working with the ANSYS ACE teams to jointly develop workflows for noise and vibration analysis and topology optimization. 
The company is also using ANSYS Discovery to decrease its simulation backlog and get products to market faster, all the while holding the line on development costs. 
Just a few weeks ago, we unveiled ANSYS 2021 Release 2, which features advances across our multiphysics product line, from structured fluids and electromagnetics, to materials, photonics and embedded software. R2 includes a number of advancements in core physics, simplified workflows and integrated data management. 
Our solutions are based on our case of experience and cannot be easily duplicated, creating high barriers to entry for potential competitors. While I could spend the entire hour detailing each product's capabilities, today, I will focus on just one key differentiator, which cuts across our entire portfolio, namely scalability. 
As customer problems become increasingly more challenging, the size of those challenges require simulation software that could scale to unprecedented levels. Throughout our history, ANSYS has been a leader in product scalability and we have extended that leadership in recent releases. Our ability to create high resolution, fluid mechanic simulations with practical turnaround times enables customers to solve next-generation challenges, ranging from rotating machinery, to external aerodynamics, to environmental simulations. 
4 years ago, Ansys FLUENT scaled to nearly 200,000 CPU cores, enabling customers to solve challenging problems faster than ever by calculating billions of cells. To the best of our knowledge, that remains a record for commercial computational fluid dynamics code. This massive scalability has enabled our customer at the Technical University in Eindhoven to solve a complex aerodynamic problem with 3 billion computational cells with 20 billion unknowns. The most recent advances in Ansys 2021 R2 have sped up parallel mesh generation by 20x, removing what is often the bottleneck for detailed simulations of transient phenomena, which occur in aerodynamics and gas turbine simulations. 
That 225x speed up over the last decade has enabled Ansys customers to reduce simulation time on a full thermal mechanical model from 2 weeks to 1.5 hours. And now with Ansys 2021 R2, those calculations could take just minutes, leading to improved product reliability as users run more simulations faster. That breakthrough was made possible by doubling the core counts, while reducing the memory required by 40%.  
In our latest LS-DYNA release, we have significantly improved performance, which enables customers to run transient behavior studies with 28 trillion calculated variables, and that's trillion with a T. That means safer cars and more reliable electronics. 
A global high-tech customer use Ansys HFSS and our new Ansys Mesh fusion to solve a previously unsolved integrated circuit and packaging problem by scaling across the multi-node HPC cluster with 18 terabytes of RAM and 576 cores. In Ansys 2021 R2, we introduced the Phi Plus measure, which extends mesh fusion to deliver additional speed and capacity. Phi Plus has sped up meshing on PCB plus bondwire package models by 18x, which will bring new innovations to the 5G, autonomy and industrial Internet of Things market. 
Ansys semiconductor customers are using next-generation distributed and grid computing techniques to model and solve chips with 2.6 trillion or more devices. Ansys RedHawk-SC set a capacity and performance record in Power Integrity sign-off last year by extracting 66 billion electrical nodes on the design of a GPU and solving it over 2,400 CPUs in a fully distributed manner. In Ansys 2021 R2, our solver performance doubled, enabling customers to sign off even larger chip designs using the same compute resources and run time. 
Scalability is one of Ansys' many differentiators and is becoming increasingly important to our customers as they develop next-generation products. We believe that our history of product scalability, along with accuracy, ease of use and speed to solution create a difficult environment for any would-be competitor, while giving our users the functionality they need to solve the most challenging product problems. 
We are continuing to train the next generation of engineers in the use of Ansys solutions by expanding our free offering for students. To date, nearly 2 million students around the world have downloaded our products. And just a few weeks ago, we launched an additional offering for students to download our electronics desktop and to enroll in Ansys innovation courses for training. These students now have access to our leading electronics products, including HFSS, Maxwell and Icepak to train them in developing the products of tomorrow. And thanks to our new partnership, Cornell University will design and develop online training courses with real-world applications from Ansys. 
Moving to partnerships. I'm excited to announce that we have expanded our work with TSMC to include new certifications for Ansys RedHawk and Ansys Totem. These new certifications for power network extraction, power integrity and reliability, signal electromigration and transistor level custom designs enable joint customers to meet critical power, thermal and reality standards for next-generation product applications. 
Ansys continues to be recognized for our inventive approach to engineering technology. I'm proud that for the third year in a row, Fast Company has named us one of the best places to work for innovators. I'm even more excited that 5 of my colleagues have been recognized with the prestigious Women of Color STEM Awards. These awards showcase the outstanding scientific and engineering achievements of women around the world, and Ansys is proud of these pioneers who serve as an inspiration for us all. 
Turning to our Environmental, Social & Governance initiatives. I'm pleased that MSCI has upgraded our ESG rating to AA, naming us a leader in the software and services industry. MSCI cited Ansys' comprehensive talent pipeline relative to our peers, our focus on business ethics and our capabilities in helping customers to innovate in areas such as clean technologies. 
To summarize, Q2 was another great quarter for Ansys and a further validation that our pervasive simulation strategy is resonating with the market. Our strong sales pipeline, our ongoing momentum with enterprise customers, the resurgence of small and medium businesses and our continued leadership across our product portfolio give me further confidence in our ability to meet our newly increased outlook for 2021.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Nicole."

Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our second quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q3 and 2021. Our strong Q2 results reflect an outst",1122,"Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our second quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q3 and 2021. 
Our strong Q2 results reflect an outstanding execution across our business, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS all above our Q2 guidance. As Ajei mentioned, Q2 ACV was especially strong and exceeded our expectations. Both our large enterprise customer and our small and medium-sized customer spending patterns performed better than expected, and our growth during the quarter was broad-based. 
Now let me discuss some of our Q2 financial highlights. Q2 ACV was $430.5 million and grew year-over-year, 25% or 23%, in constant currency. We saw strong performance across customer types, geographies and industries. ACV from recurring sources represented 82% of the total. Q2 total revenue was $452.6 million and grew 16% or 14% in constant currency, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Like ACV, Q2 revenue growth was from across the business. 
In the first half of 2021, we had strong top line performance, with ACV and revenue both growing double digit, 16% and 18%, respectively. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $927.1 million, representing a 10% increase over last year's second quarter balance. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline. This yielded a solid second quarter gross margin of 90% and an operating margin of 41.7%, which is better than our Q2 guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by revenue performance above our guidance as well as the timing of investments. 
The result was second quarter EPS of $1.85, which was also above the high end of our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of investments. Our effective tax rate in Q2 was 19%, the tax rate we expect for the remainder of 2021. Our cash flow from operations in Q2 totaled $118.9 million, which benefited from strong collections, driven by a reduction in the percent of receivables past due and was partially offset by differences in the timing of tax payments as compared to Q2 2020. We ended the quarter with $958.2 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. 
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We continue to build confidence in our outlook for the year. Coming off our strong finish in Q2, we are initiating guidance for Q3 and increasing our ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This increase reflects the strong broad-based financial performance in the second quarter and our current sales pipeline. 
For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $400 million to $425 million and EPS in the range of $1.22 to $1.39. As I mentioned, for the full year, we are raising our ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook. We are increasing our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.845 billion. This represents growth of 11.4% to 14.1% or 10.8% to 13.5% in constant currency. We are raising our full year ACV guidance to reflect the Q2 performance, which exceeded our expectations and our increased confidence in the full year pipeline. 
This raise was offset by a few million dollars of currency headwinds. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by $30 million, which translates to an increase of 2.7 points of constant currency growth compared to our May guidance. As a reminder, it is best to look at full year AVC growth as quarterly growth can be variable. As we mentioned in May, ACV quarterly growth rates in 2021 will vary with Q2 and Q3 being the strongest 2 quarters. Based on our performance in Q2, we expect Q2 to have the highest ACV growth rate for the year. As a reminder, we still expect Q4 growth to be muted given the Q4 2020 growth comparison. Consistent with prior years, the dollar value of ACV will be highly skewed towards the fourth quarter. 
We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.840 billion to $1.890 billion, which is growth of 8.5% to 11.5% or 7.3% to 10.2% in constant currency. Similar to our ACV guidance, this increase reflects our strong Q2 revenue performance and increased confidence in our full year pipeline, offset by a few million dollars of currency headwind. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $23 million, which translates to constant currency growth of 1.5 points higher than the midpoint of our May guidance. 
As you know, ASC 606 introduces revenue growth volatility within the quarters. However, on a full year revenue basis, revenue growth is less variable. In the second half of 2021, we expect revenue growth to be impacted by the year-over-year compare and mix of business. We are increasing our full year EPS and now expect EPS to be in the range of $6.85 to $7.15. This increase incorporates our strong Q2 performance and is offset by a few cents of currency headwinds. It is worth noting that some of our strong Q2 EPS performance was driven by the timing of investments that moved from Q2 to the second half of the year. 
Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. We are increasing our 2021 outlook to a range of $495 million to $535 million. This increase is driven by stronger collections expected during the year and continued improvement in payment terms toward pre-pandemic levels. We are pleased with our strong first half in operating cash flow. But as a reminder, second half cash flow is most impacted by whether large Q4 deals closed near the beginning or the end of the quarter. 
For modeling purposes, we're expecting third quarter operating margin in the range of 34% to 36.5%. And for the full year, we continue to expect operating margin to be in the range of 40% to 41%. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2021 are contained in the prepared remarks document. 
I would like to thank the Ansys team for their continued commitment to our customers and fellow colleagues during this prolonged time of uncertainty. The team delivered exceptional execution during the quarter, which drove our strong Q2 financial performance. The combination of best-in-class execution, with a strong recurring business model and growing sales pipeline, sets us up well to deliver on our 2021 outlook as well as our longer-term financial objectives.

I would say that it went back to a very similar pattern that we saw in Q1, which was -- it was broad-based across geographies and industries. As you recall, coming into the year, we were a little bit cautious about SMB and kind of the underlying momentum of SMB and we had expected enterprise customers to perform as expected. I would say in the second quarter, we got a bit more out of the enterprise than we expected to get, which was great because it's shown people are really seriously committing to their R&D portfolios and accelerating development, but we saw for the second quarter in a row that resurgence on the SMB side. 
And there wasn't anything that was specific localized or kind of in narrow form, it was just kind of everywhere.

Is that something that we could -- is that something that as you continue to perform, it felt kind is replicable going forward? Yes, just maybe a little bit in light of potential investments is something that you might also balance out on the other side?"

So that is exactly the right way to look at it. So there's 2 components to it. There's the collections piece along the ACV side, and then there's the payment side. And so on the collection side, we've seen -- we have seen an improvement at a more accelerated rate, both in terms of lack of asking for extension on payment terms, people catching up on aged payments, and people overall maintaining a level of current balance at higher rates than they had through the pandemic. So all of that is, I think, contributing to the acceleration on -- part of the acceleration on the cash flow side.
The headwind in this particular quarter was really tax payments and the timing of tax payments, particularly in a quarter can have a more distorting dynamic overall. And so as you recall, last year, there were some deferral incentives during the pandemic that raised cash flow in the second quarter. And then this year, those payments were due as expected in the second quarter.
And so overall, I would expect to see still a little bit of situation and volatility in the relationship between the 2 just because of the nature of the payments piece is not kind of back to normalized levels. But what you can count on is that underneath the covers, the momentum around collections and customers kind of behavior around that has been quite good, and we're really happy with where we're at."

And as you know, the Cloud also supports a very flexible licensing model, and that includes an elastic pay-as-you-go model as well as a hybrid model that allows customers to mix and match elastic as well as these licenses.
Now we have a number of internal metrics that we deploy to measure business. And we are seeing probably a 5x, 5x greater usage as compared with this time last year. So very nice growth as a result of the activities that we've done as well as, of course, external conditions with people working from home.
This year, if you think about what we've done to augment the cloud, we've added cloud support for Ansys LSTC for Ansys DYNA for our Lumerical products. We've completed SOC2 certification. And we also continue to focus on the overall customer experience. And that's really translated very positively for customers. And we -- a couple of months ago -- a few months ago, we published a release about a customer, Van Oord, who talked about how they could speed up their simulations by 7x, which obviously is a significant perspective because they're able to take advantage of the most recent and most capable hardware in the cloud as well as the cloud capabilities that we have.
So we're very excited about our cloud direction. We have made all of the necessary investments. And of course, it's still early days because we're talking about a relatively small portion of our business."

And I think what you're seeing this year is just some of the return of some of that business overall.
But if you look at the business over longer periods of time, the growth and acceleration of the business is really driven by the lease model, and the perpetual business has been roughly flat over those longer periods of time. In terms of the second half, I think one of the dynamics that we saw in Q4 last year was not only exceeding the high end of guidance by $45 million, but there was a significant perpetual mix in Q4. And so how we're looking at it on a go-forward basis is not really expecting net repeat performance in Q4 overall is some of the underlying factors are baked into the guidance."

As you know, some of those products organically developed, others came in through acquisition. And we embark on activities such as an M&A or organic development, specifically when we see opportunities in the market where customers are either leading us or where we see an opportunity to provide greater functionality to solve the customer problem.
And so all of the acquisitions were in all of the internal development that we do is driven by an analysis of what that market would look like. And I'm delighted that we're generally seeing what we expected to pan out is, in fact, panning out. You talked about Lumerical photonics. That's obviously a very important part. As you think about data centers, for example, and we're seeing obvious traction there because this product is -- fits into our overall portfolio. 
So when we go to customers, we can go to them with a broader set of capabilities that includes critical capabilities such as Lumerical that you mentioned, that we can -- where we can go in and talk about an end-to-end solution that addresses the needs that the customer may have. And you see that repeated across our portfolio, where smaller products are playing important roles in being able to stitch together an end-to-end workflow to allow customers to solve some of the most complex problems that they're dealing with. So I think that's -- hopefully, that addresses your first question. 
With respect to your second question, I'm excited, obviously, with our performance in high-tech and semiconductor. The -- I no longer think of the Apache acquisition. That's part of our semiconductor organization, and has been for a number of years. And obviously, we have a number of deep integrations across our portfolio between our semiconductor business and our electromagnetics activities. And you start to think about next-generation products like 3D-IC and challenges, and that's when the entire ANSYS portfolio comes in going from our semiconductor portfolio, all the way through our more Neutonian physics, if you will.
And so I'm very excited about the portfolio, the capabilities. I think we have market-leading products across the board there, and customers tell us that they're able to solve tremendous challenges with our offerings, and we're excited about the future."

So we're not anticipating in our guidance any increase -- any meaningful change in the trajectory of the services business.
In terms of the skill sets that you're referring to, I'd say that, yes, we are hiring. We are investing in the business. We're investing in the areas that you and Ajei just discussed now around helping our customers connect to physics, the other multiphysics. And so those are skill sets that we continue to invest in. And that services business is also -- that investment in the services business is also a reflection of the momentum we're seeing in the pipeline around sales because those individuals also support selling process to some degree.

It's -- I think it's really difficult to point to a specific allocation of one bucket to another because these things are all related to each other. Look, at the end of the day, if you just reflect on the Ansys portfolio, what we've built is a market-leading set of capabilities of individual physics, which are connected together. And so this multiphysics capability is what's necessary for customers as they solve some of the most challenging problems that they're dealing with.
And so when you think about electrification, for example, or 5G or IoT, all of these areas are complex. Customers are investing a significant amount of money. They're looking for simulation offerings to be able to support them in their R&D efforts. And we have the technology, we have the capabilities, we have the relationships, and we can support them on their journey. So that's a very important aspect. You've got to have the right goods when people need them. 
The second thing is that, obviously, around the world, we are seeing customers recognizing that there is going to be an end to the pandemic and that they have to continue to make investments in R&D. And you're certainly the small and medium business customers are perhaps most emblematic of that because they are -- but earlier in the pandemic, you saw a shutdown for SMB customers, right? They -- they're most concerned about cash. They're most concerned about the potential demand future because these are smaller companies and they have less -- they have lesser cash resources than some of the larger companies.
But what we're seeing now is obviously an opening up of spending there, which is reflective of the fact that customers around the world, not just SMB customers. Customers around the world are looking at the world after things completely open up again or certainly after a pandemic world, post-pandemic world, where things start to get back to normal with respect to the broader economy, which means -- and they recognized that in order for them to be successful, they have to have products that people want. And that means more investment in R&D and more investment in product design, as I mentioned in my comments.
So the demand is also increasing. And I think that those 2 things work together. You have to have the right products. You have to have the growing demand. If you didn't have either one of them, you wouldn't necessarily be able to deliver the results. And I think that we are -- that's what -- that's exactly what we're seeing, and we're very excited about what we can provide to our customers and where the market is going."

So look, we're very excited about Discovery. And I think we have to make it a little bit more tangible, perhaps I can go back to the example I gave in the script, which was one of our customers who's using Discovery in a very interesting way.
So for this particular customer, some of the detailed flow and thermal management simulation is done by experts using Ansys flagship products. But the typical turnaround time is maybe 60 days because of the complexity of the simulation and they have a relatively small analyst team, serving a larger design team. So they introduced Discovery as a way for the design engineers to do some of the simpler simulation on their own. So things like flow distribution or pressure drops. 
So they're able to do that by themselves and they can improve the design of their components before they hand off the design for a complete system simulation to the expert analyst. So that's an example where the whole thesis that we had was this is something that design engineers could use to really amplify the capability of the analyst. That's something that's borne out here.
And for this customer, they're also using -- they also had some outsourced CAE spend, and they're using Discovery now to help train their designers on some basic structural analysis so they can limit some of this outsource work and simple geometry changes. And what that does for them is it changes the design iteration time and it takes it down from a couple of weeks to a couple of days.
So that gives you some perspective. We're very excited about the technology. We continue to make advances in the technology. And obviously, I mentioned a couple of customer examples. You talked briefly about PTC and the use of Creo Simulation Live. And on PTC's earnings call last week, I believe they reported continued traction with increased expansions, driven by a migration around Creo 7. As you know, they are OEM-ing our Discovery products into Creo, Creo Simulation Live, Creo Ansys Simulation. 
And that -- Creo 7 is their latest enterprise release. And so obviously, there's increased traction that comes from that. And they also talked about a customer win where the real-time simulation capabilities were helping to simplify the customers' design process.
So we're very excited about the technology. It continues to perform as we had expected. Obviously, it's a relatively small piece of our business, but the market dynamics around what we're seeing is strong."

During the quarter, you had put out a press release about a customer looks like expanding the relationship they had with Ansys. One of the things that I found interesting was more stringent regulations around greenhouse gas reduction and they're using simulation to help that.
You've talked in the past about sustainability and how you can help your customers, but the drumbeat just seems to be getting louder and louder. Are you seeing customers accelerate any decisions around this sustainability focus? Or is it still -- is that still kind of an extra add-on benefit to what you're already bringing to the customer?"

When you look at -- let's say, for example, a big trend in the automotive industry, which is around electrification, right? Obviously, that is -- there's a discussion about the future of the internal combustion engine and the rating pace at which electric cars and vehicles will be adopted broadly. And you're seeing car companies, for example, making the decision to just simply move from one to the other. And that's obviously driven in part by issues of emissions and being more eco-friendly.
We talked last year about -- in the aerospace industry, we talked about some customer wins, where the motivation for the customer was really to make their engines more fuel efficient. So it was about lightweighting. It was about reduced fuel consumption, increased efficiency of fuel. And so even in aircraft engines, for example, you're seeing that as being a primary driver for new design of engines.
And so it's absolutely a part of a broader trend. I mentioned Van Oord earlier. They're, of course, building a sustainable offshore wind turbines and they're a simulation user. But again, their focus is on renewable energy sources. So compliance purposes as well as eco-friendly, all of these things are drivers of product design and product requirements. And obviously, to ensure that customers can meet those standards, simulation plays a really important role."

What's exciting for us is that we have the technology and the capabilities from a product perspective and a relationship perspective to support our customers as they go through that transition. So we can help them with",656,"Firstly, with respect to automotive. What's exciting for us is that we have the technology and the capabilities from a product perspective and a relationship perspective to support our customers as they go through that transition. So we can help them with battery management technologies. We can help them with electric drivetrains, electric motor design, all of the elements that you would expect that would sort of go into the replacement of the internal combustion engine with an electric battery-powered environment.
But above and beyond that, if you think about the challenges that some of our customers are facing as they make this transition. An electric car is not just simply an internal combustion car with one means of propulsion replacing another, it's an opportunity for our customers to redesign. In fact, they have to redesign it because the assumptions that are previously made of an engine in the front of the car, where -- which concentrates the weight in the front of the car, those assumptions are no longer relevant because perhaps now you have a battery that's uniformly distributed across the floor of the car. And so that changes the weight distribution and changes the assumptions of the way that the car was originally designed.
And so there is a significant rethinking taking place in these car companies, especially the auto companies, who've historically relied on the reuse of technology from one generation to another. There is a rethinking of saying, what does it mean for us to support this to build an electric car? And so that -- all of that leads to and drives increased use of simulation and certainly for Ansys Simulation. 
If you think about crash design, right? So the problems that you may have been dealing with earlier for crash might have been, how do you think about the passenger? Will the passenger be protected? And that's a complex multiphysics problem because you're dealing with the structural integrity, you're dealing with the deployment of the airbag, which is a fluids problem. So there's a multiphysics problems in nature that need to be addressed through simulation.
Now the question is, it goes above and beyond that, and it says, well, what is the likelihood of a fire -- some kind of a catastrophic fire that might take place as a result of a battery rupture? Can you solve that problem? So it starts to become more and more challenging. And so this transition is not just a matter of supporting the design of the engine per se, it is the actual car in the aggregate, and that sort of plays well to our strength and our capabilities.
Now with respect to your second question about health care. While health care is still an overall, a very -- relatively small part of the Ansys business, simulation continues to grow, and we do well in, for example, the design and the manufacturing of medical devices, and that was obviously reflected in the performance in the quarter. But as we look to the future, we are excited about the increased use of simulation as a validation in the market. So the use of in silico trials as opposed to just in vitro, in vivo, and the use of simulation techniques supporting that, those in silico trials, I think, is really helpful. 
And we're working with early adopters who are using simulation to target specific surgical outcomes. And this is obviously early, early stage. There's not really much revenue associated with a very, very early stage, but this is about how do you support a physician as they're making decisions about surgery. Those are -- at the end of the day, some of those can be simplified into problems of computational fluid dynamics. And of course, we have fantastic technology in that space. And so being able to put all of that together and packaging that, I think that's certainly something for the future."

Q3 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. With strong ACV growth in the quarter, I'm delighted that year-to-date, we're on a stated goal of double-digit ACV growth with tuck-in acquisitions. Our accomplishments thus far in 2021 are further evidence of the success of our strategy of making simulation pervasive across the product life cycle, our multiphysics product leadership and our strong customer relationships. Those factors, combined with customers' continued investment in R&D initiatives, are driving demand for ANSYS' multiphysics solutions. 
with a robust deal pipeline and momentum in the business bolstering our confidence, we are raising our full year financial guidance above and beyond the impact of our strong Q3 top line performance. Nicole will have the details in a few minutes. 
From vertical and geographical perspective, our Q3 results came in as expected. The high-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation sectors were again our largest contributors. 
Looking at our major geographies, the Americas again led the way, followed by Asia Pacific. We expect each region to have its largest quarter in Q4 with this quarterly skew to be more pronounced in Q4 for Europe. 
One of Q3's highlights was a 3-year $58 million agreement with a North American high-tech customer. From an ACV perspective, this deal was the second largest multiyear contract in our history. This customer was already using solutions from across the ANSYS multiphysics portfolio and is now expanding its number of simulation users. It is using ANSYS for diverse applications, ranging from ensuring the reliability of radio frequency systems to meeting sustainability goals across this product line and to chip package system analysis for power and signal integrity. 
Another key deal in Q3 was a multiyear agreement with Seagate Technology, a leader in mass data storage solutions. Seagate is a long-time ANSYS customer, and this new contract broadens the company's use of multiphysics simulation to address next-generation product challenges faced by its global customer base. For example, Seagate is using ANSYS multiphysics products to assess thermal effects and acoustics to create a seamless workflow to enable higher capacity hard drives and to streamline process integration for heat-assisted magnetic recording. The company also now has access to our optical suite of products to drive further innovation. 
As we have discussed, our small- and medium-sized customers, or SMBs, were disproportionately affected by the pandemic. However, during the last few quarters, we are seeing a recovery, and SMB customers have increased their investment in ANSYS simulation. Our ongoing increase in sales from our SMB customers give me further confidence as we plan for Q4 and beyond. 
During these calls, I typically give you some insights into various aspects of the ANSYS business. In the past, I discussed our best-in-class electromagnetic solutions, our unparalleled product scalability and the extreme accuracy of our structural solutions. As you heard me discuss with Seagate, optical simulation is becoming increasingly important for our customer base. In fact, in Q3, about 5% of our agreements included an optical simulation product in the order. Given that as well as our recent closing of the ZMAX acquisition, I would like to spend some time today discussing our offerings for optical simulation. 
3 years ago, ANSYS did not have any optical simulation products in our portfolio. Today, though, companies can rely on ANSYS for an end-to-end solution, spanning the gamut from photons to electrons based on 3 product lines. The first, ANSYS Lumerical, empowers users to design and analyze integrated photonic components and systems and model challenging product problems, including interacting optical, electrical and thermal effects. The second product line, ANSYSPIoS, simulates the system's optical performance and evaluates the final illumination effect by enabling high-fidelity visualization based on human vision and camera-sensing capabilities. Third is our recent acquisition of ZMAX, which enables customers to accurately model the behavior of light through complex optical lens systems. Instead of working independently as a siloed offering, our optical simulation suite operates as part of a complete multiphysics workflow. Taken together, the ANSYS optical solution is used for a diverse set of applications ranging from camera and LiDAR arrays found in autonomous vehicles to telecommunications and mobile phone cameras to medical equipment and other visual aids. 
For example, in Q3, Sandia National Labs signed an agreement leading to expanded use of Lumerical technologies. Sandia develops leading-edge integrated photonic and nanophotonic solutions for quantum computing, imaging and sensing. The lab uses Lumerical tools to design, model and simulate custom photonic components and their behavior in a circuit environment. 
In the automotive sector, industry leader Ford uses ANSYS products, including SPEOS and the ANSYS vehicle headlight solution in the styling and design of its predictive smart headlamps and to optimize and validate headline performance. Our headlight solution features real-time physics-based optical simulation and driver-in-the-loop functionality to replicate the physical world with a high degree of predictive accuracy. Automotive giant Mazda is also increasing its use of Speos for internal and exterior lighting, head-up displays and cameras, thanks to a sales agreement in Q3. 
In Aerospace and Defense, an ANSYS customer is using all 3 of our optical product lines across multiple applications. The customer relies on Lumerical for creating photonics integrated circuits. It uses PEOs for detecting radiation leaks from aircraft enclosures and this customer is also using ZMAX to study lens deformation. While still new to our portfolio and a relatively small contributor to our overall financial results, these optical solutions fit squarely into our go-to-market motion, and our sales team understands how to market these products. 
Based on the ANSYS strategy of pervasive simulation, our optical customers can easily access products across our portfolio to perform true multiphysics analysis. We saw an excellent example of that with another aerospace and defense customer that was challenged with a wing camera that was capturing blurry images. By using a combination of ANSYS optical and ANSYS fluids products, the customer was able to correct the problem and deliver crisp images even at extreme speeds in bad weather. 
Moving to our partners. I'm excited that we are expanding our relationship with Autodesk by embedding ANSYS' electromagnetic simulation capabilities to explore and validate printed circuit board designs within the Fusion 360 workflow. This first-of-a-kind Autodesk Fusion 360 extension will enable CAD users to perform near real-time PCB analyses and to retrieve real-time insights into their electromagnetic performance to accelerate the development of next-generation products. 
We have also expanded connectivity of ANSYS Twin Builder to industrial control systems through Rockwell Automation's enhanced Studio 5000 simulation interface. Users can connect digital twins to emulated controllers to optimize production at the design stage or physical controllers to enhance equipment performance in real time, for example, in predictive maintenance. 
I am pleased that we have expanded our partnership with TSMC to create a comprehensive thermal analysis solution for multi-die semiconductor designs. Using ANSYS RedHawk-SC electrothermal and ANSYS ice back along with TSMC's silicon stacking and advanced packaging technologies, users can analyze complete chip and package systems with high-fidelity results. 
We are also collaborating with Fujitsu to enable more sustainable product development for our customers. ANSYS is Dina now supports Fujitsu's energy-efficient prime HPC supercomputers which will help customers reduce energy consumption and costs by offloading simulation workloads to a more energy-efficient machine. 
Keeping with our environmental, social and governance initiatives for a moment, we recently published our simulation product handprint for autonomous vehicles. This report illustrates the role that simulation plays in the development of autonomous vehicles, including in sensors, automated driving software and safety testing. Using simulation to develop autonomous vehicles will lead to significant societal and environmental benefits, ranging from a drop in traffic fatalities to a reduction in emissions. 
We have also submitted our initial report with the Climate Disclosure Project and expect results by the end of the year. Similarly, we have begun working on our reports to the task force on climate-related financial disclosures, which focuses on governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets. 
In summary, Q3 was another remarkable quarter for ANSYS. We beat guidance across all key financial metrics and have met our goal of delivering double-digit growth year-to-date. We are also expanding our product leadership in our core solutions as well as an important emerging areas such as optical simulation. These factors, combined with a strong Q4 sales pipeline and outstanding execution, give me further confidence in our ability to meet our newly increased outlook for 2021.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole?"

Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our third quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q4 and 2021. The third quarter demonstrated the strength of our business as we delivered robust growth during the quarter. 
ACV was strong and in line with our expectations, while revenue, operating margin and EPS exceeded the high end of our Q3 guidance, driven by the mix of license types sold in the quarter. both our large enterprise customers and SMB customers performed well. And our growth during the quarter was broad-based. 
Now let me discuss some of our Q3 financial highlights. Q3 ACV was $365.4 million and grew year-over-year 20% or 19% in constant currency. We saw strong performance across customer types, geographies and industries. ACV from recurring sources represented 76% of the total. 
Q3 total revenue was $445.4 million and grew 21% or 20% in constant currency, which, as I mentioned, exceeded the high end of our guidance driven by license mix. Q3 revenue growth was also wide ranging across customer types and industries. For the first 3 quarters of 2021, we had strong top line performance with ACV and revenue both growing double digits at 17% and 19%, respectively. As Ajei mentioned, for both Q3 and Q3 year-to-date, we are executing against our business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $ 899.5 million. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline. This yielded a solid third quarter gross margin of 89.9% and an operating margin of 39.7%, which was better than our Q3 guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by revenue performance from license mix as well as the timing of investments. The result was third quarter EPS of $1.59, which was also above the high end of our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results from license mix and the timing of investments. 
Our effective tax rate in Q3 was 19%, the tax rate we expect for the fourth quarter of 2021. Our cash flow from operations in Q3 totaled $157.8 million, which benefited from strong collections, primarily driven by robust Q2 growth, favorable timing of intra-quarter sales and a reduction in the percent of receivables past due. We ended the quarter with $1.814 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. 
In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 97,000 shares during the quarter for around $36 million. We have 2.7 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized share repurchase program. Additionally, on October 1, we acquired ZMAX for a purchase price of $399.1 million net of cash acquired. 
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We continue to build confidence in our outlook for the year, given the improved deals pipeline we see in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are initiating guidance for Q4 and increasing our ACV revenue, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. 
This raise reflects the strong financial performance in the third quarter and the increased momentum of our sales pipeline going into the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $614.9 million to $654.9 million, operating margin in the range of 44.5% to 47% and EPS in the range of $2.48 to $2.81. 
As I mentioned, for the full year, we are raising our ACV revenue, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow outlook. We are increasing our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $1.825 billion to $1.860 billion. This represents growth of 12.9% to 15.1% or 12.6% to 14.7% in constant currency. 
Our Q4 and full year 2021 guidance is based on continued momentum in the business and a Q4 pipeline that has accelerated since our August guidance. It does not include a repeat of the outside spending behavior we saw in December 2020 after vaccines were announced. 
The raise also incorporates approximately $6 million to $8 million of contribution from ZMAX in Q4, and which is offset by approximately $6 million to $8 million of currency headwind. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by $20 million, which translates to an increase of 1.5 points of constant currency growth compared to our August guidance. 
We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.885 billion to $1.925 billion which is growth of 11.2% to 13.5% or 10.6% to 12.9% in constant currency. This raise reflects our strong Q3 revenue performance driven by license mix as well as the incremental organic revenue from the momentum of our Q4 pipeline. Like ACV, our increased revenue incorporates approximately $6 million to $8 million contribution from ZMAX, which is offset by approximately $6 million to $8 million of currency headwinds. 
As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $40 million, which translates to constant currency growth of 3 points higher than the midpoint of our August guidance. 
As you know, ASC 606 introduces revenue growth volatility within the quarters. However, on a full year basis, revenue growth is less volatile. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect the revenue growth rate to be impacted by the year-over-year compare and mix of license types sold in the fourth quarter 2020 versus our current 2021 fourth quarter pipeline. We are increasing our full year operating margin and now expect operating margin to be in the range of 40.5% to 41.5%. 
Additionally, we are increasing our full year EPS and now expect EPS to be in the range of $7.05 to $7.38. This increase incorporates our Q3 performance and is offset by approximately $0.05 of currency headwinds. It is worth noting that some of our strong Q3 EPS performance was driven by the timing of investments that moved from Q3 to the fourth quarter of the year. 
Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. We are increasing our 2021 outlook to a range of $505 million to $535 million. This increase is driven by stronger collections expected during the year and is partially offset by approximately $3 million to $5 million of currency headwind. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our Q4 and 2021 guidance are contained in the prepared remarks document. 
Consistent with our standard practice, we will provide detailed 2022 guidance once we finalize our 2022 planning process and close out 2021. I would like to thank the ANSYS team for their outstanding execution during the quarter, which drove our robust Q3 financial performance and continued momentum going into our last quarter of the year. 
We once again delivered a strong quarter, which coupled with our recurring business model and growing sales pipeline demonstrated the strength of the ANSYS business. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2021 outlook as well as our longer-term financial objectives.

And in particular, we did talk about optical as an area that we are that we were investing in, in particular, to support things like autonomous vehicles as well as to support things like 5G for the purposes of interconnects and so forth. And so we've essentially been executing against the strategy that we laid out. 
I also want to correct a point that you made in your question, you said 5% of the bookings came from optical. That's not what I said in my script. What I said is that 5% of the deals had some optical component within the agreement with the customer. So there was some aspect of optical within that. Optical, of course, is a relatively small piece of our business today."

So as you point out, over the last 12 months, Americas has continued to be a consistent strong performer and lead the company in creating value for our customers. a couple of deals with the 1 that Ajei mentio",439,"Yes. Thanks so much for your question, Andrew. So as you point out, over the last 12 months, Americas has continued to be a consistent strong performer and lead the company in creating value for our customers. a couple of deals with the 1 that Ajei mentioned in his remarks, the $58 million agreement with the leading North American technology company, is an example of -- I think the model that we  have exported around the world and leads to some of the strength in our other regions like APAC, where the customer has already been using solutions from across the ANSYS multiphysics portfolio, but is now expanding the number of simulation users. And so that we've done a very good job at building deep relationships with customers understanding their short and their long-term development road maps and enabling them to be able to propagate the use of simulation to broader use cases to connect the physics and to also connect other users in the process to leverage that simulation. 
And so that model that Americas executes quite well is the model that we're executing around the world. And just as an example, our Asia Pacific region has executed exceptionally. They had another quarter of very strong growth with 21% constant currency growth I'm sorry, 21% growth in the region at a constant currency basis. And the strength in that region was broad-based across industry, customer types, geographies we had several 7-figure contracts in Asia Pacific that added growth to the high-tech sector, where customers are really showing enthusiasm for not just the core portfolio, but the adjacencies as well. So there's a common theme here where we're broadening and deepening the relationships within the customer with our core technology having strong footholds and solid growth, but also leveraging the organic and the inorganic investments that we've been making over the past 5 years to accelerate the footprint globally. 
And so I would say the core strength of the portfolio and the investments that we have been making during the course of the pandemic with our customers and in our portfolio are really the drivers of the acceleration and the performance of growth. To some degree, there is some -- there is a little bit of recovery at the Asia Pacific probably had was a little bit ahead in the recovery versus Americas. There's still unevenness in terms of how customers are preferring to meet in-person. So I wouldn't characterize things as a return to normal quite yet. But certainly, the business model is resilient, it is showing through regardless of the challenges that we've seen in the pandemic."

And just to amplify one of the points Nicole made, the large customer dynamic is somewhat different from the SMB. For the most part, the large customer dynamic is driven by the long-term relationships that we've maintained with our direct sales force with these customers. Many of these are long-term customers of ours. They've built their processes around ANSYS. And when it comes to a new project or a new activity that they start to continue to evolve their R&D efforts, they turn to us as a vendor. And so there's an opportunity within those customers to expand the footprint based on long-term relationships. 
In the case of SMBs, in many cases, the SMBs are relationships that we have through channel partners and some of these customers may be relatively new customers. They may be relatively early in their life as an organization. And so I wouldn't necessarily say SMB is a leading indicator, which was the point that you made. I wouldn't necessarily say it's a leading indicator. These are 2 different -- there's slightly different dynamics across both the SMB and enterprise, and each one of them has their own go-to-market motion and supporting activity."

One is you think about the short term. So in the short term, supply chain disruptions may be affecting many businesses, but we're really not one of the businesses that's affected by the supply chain. And the reason is, as I mentioned earlier, the use of our software is tied to the design of products. It's tied to the R&D phase for the most part and not -- it's not denominated by manufacturing. 
So whether if a customer has challenges with the supply chain, and they can't produce as many units of a particular product that's been designed with our technology. That doesn't affect our relationship with the customer. They're already designing what that next product looks like, and they're working with our engineers, or they're working with our technology to figure out what the future looks like. 
So our customers continue to make investments during -- in R&D. And it's really not affected by the supply chain in the short term, so we have no real short-term issues there. When you think about it from a long-term perspective, and I think you're also alluding to this in your question, when you think about the long-term perspective, companies, I think, around the globe are questioning exactly how they need to think about their supply chains going forward. So will there be a change in the way they've been thinking about the supply chains? And in some cases, you're seeing customers thinking about moving manufacturing closer to where the final product is actually going to be used. This isn't necessarily building factories in a more traditional way. In many cases, customers are thinking about building next-generation factories where they have much more automation, robotics, next-generation manufacturing techniques. All of these things are relevant for simulation. We're in a position -- we at ANSYS are in a position to help our customers as they go through this rethinking process as they go through the design of these next-generation capabilities as they start to think about advanced manufacturing techniques, materials as they work through the simulation that goes with that, we're in a position to help them.

Thin",578,"Sure, Jay. So let me try to unpack your question, and let me start with the longer-term direction comment that you asked -- And I think, look, you'll hear a lot more about strategic direction for -- and where we're going over the next year and so on. Think of some of the comments that you heard as adembrating some of the super exciting times that are ahead for ANSYS and our customers. You talked a little bit about cloud. We've got ANSYS Cloud out there, which manages access to high-performance computing resources. Just remember that many of our customers then cloud is about being able to access high-performance computing at scale and enabling some of these larger, high-fidelity simulations to run at scale. And so last quarter on this call, I talked about the scalability of some of our products that was enabled by a customer for us with the technical university of Eindhoven where they had solved an aerodynamic problem with something like 3 billion computational cells with 20 billion unknowns. And that scalability is possible, of course, because of core technical advancements that we've done. So for example, we sped up mesh generation by 20x, which is obviously a bottleneck in the creation of detailed simulation of transient phenomena. But also, we were in a position to give access to cloud computing resources. And in fact, just this week, Satya Nadella and his keynote at Microsoft Ignite, used the same example to show what is possible on the ANSYS cloud platform, which is essentially ANSYS products running on Azure on the world's most powerful AI supercomputer. 
So that was one example, I think, of cloud that I'm excited about. We support flexible licensing models. We support an elastic pay-as-you-go model. We support a hybrid model, which mixes and matches elastic as well as lease licenses. And this year, we've continued to expand the number of products that we've added into our cloud capabilities. For example, we've added in Edina, we've added in our Lumerical products. We've added in SO2 certification. We've continued to improve our overall customer experience. And we've also seen significant increases in cloud usage. So 1 of the ways that we monitor that, of course, is by looking at core hours. And this year, year-to-date, we're seeing almost 4x as many core hours as compared to this time last year. And we still haven't hit that inflection point. 
So we believe that there is still much greater demand within our customer base. And we're watching our customers. We're seeing where they're going, we're anticipating where they're going, and we're giving them the opportunity to be able to drive some of the scale-out compute. So I'm really excited about where we are with cloud and some of that capability. There was a number of other things, I'm sure that were also mentioned in that conversation. Some of the things that we're excited about are the new capabilities we have in our product. We've talked about AIML and how AIML supports our technology and simulation. All of those are interrelated because the advances that we make in one area can be delivered to our customers in other ways. And that allows us to be a more responsive vendor to our customers or partner to our customers. It allows us to continue to drive leadership in the marketplace. 
So that was the first question. What was the second question, Jay, with -- it was around..."

And so they did recover quite a bit in the fourth quarter of last year, which is one of the reasons why that compares a little more challenging in Q4. But customers continue to prefer time-based licensing models because it really enables them to be more flexible as their needs evolve. And so over the past several years, the business model has really been shifting away from perpetual licenses. If you look over longer periods of time, it's been pretty flat, and the growth has been primarily through the acceleration of leases. And so that's really built a very strong annuity business for us over the past 5 years and has been a very successful evolution of the business. And so while we did see -- we are seeing kind of some of the of the compare effects in the first 3 quarters of this year, we believe, over the long term, that the shift that customer -- we're seeing from customers is going to continue towards that lease based licensing."

And that certainly drove some cloud usage. I mean, the fact remains that we can give our customers who want to take advantage of our technology, we can give our customers an experience where they have elastic compute driven from the cloud. It's a SaaS-like experience. We can give them that using our elastic licensing capabilities. So that feels to them like a SaaS experience. And similarly, we can give our access -- we can give our customers access to on-premises technology in a lease model, which they've used for a while. So we give our customers a choice of what they want to be in a position to do. ANSYS Cloud gives them that ability to support support the need for cloud compute, both from the solver perspective as well as scale up for HPC. 
So it really is up to the customers and many of our customers have made investments that are that are within their own building out data centers, so they take advantage -- they prefer to take advantage of their own data centers. Some customers will look at the amount of data that they have to manage. I mean when you think about a simulation, a complex multivariate simulation that's running across multiple or multivarioptimization could result in terabytes of information. And so, so then there's a question of where do you store that information and how do you keep it? Do you move it from one cloud to another. What is their standard model. 
So it's not simply a matter of moving parts into the cloud. It's really thinking holistically from the part of the customers on where and how they want to make this transition because it's an entire workflow that's across multiple vendors that needs to be managed. And I think we're very well positioned. Our technology is ready for the cloud. We're very well positioned. We're excited about our capabilities.

Q3 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. With strong ACV growth in the quarter, I'm delighted that year-to-date, we're on a stated goal of double-digit ACV growth with tuck-in acquisitions. Our accomplishments thus far in 2021 are further evidence of the success of our strategy of making simulation pervasive across the product life cycle, our multiphysics product leadership and our strong customer relationships. Those factors, combined with customers' continued investment in R&D initiatives are driving demand for ANSYS' multiphysics solutions. 
With a robust deal pipeline and momentum in the business bolstering our confidence, we are raising our full year financial guidance above and beyond the impact of our strong Q3 top line performance. Nicole will have the details in a few minutes. 
From vertical and geographical perspective, our Q3 results came in as expected. The high-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation sectors were again our largest contributors. 
Looking at our major geographies, the Americas again led the way, followed by Asia Pacific. We expect each region to have its largest quarter in Q4 with this quarterly skew to be more pronounced in Q4 for Europe. 
One of Q3's highlights was a 3-year $58 million agreement with a North American high-tech customer. From an ACV perspective, this deal was the second largest multiyear contract in our history. This customer was already using solutions from across the ANSYS multiphysics portfolio and is now expanding its number of simulation users. It is using ANSYS for diverse applications, ranging from ensuring the reliability of radio frequency systems to meeting sustainability goals across this product line and to chip package system analysis for power and signal integrity. 
Another key deal in Q3 was a multiyear agreement with Seagate Technology, a leader in mass data storage solutions. Seagate is a long-time ANSYS customer, and this new contract broadens the company's use of multiphysics simulation to address next-generation product challenges faced by its global customer base. For example, Seagate is using ANSYS multiphysics products to assess thermal effects and acoustics to create a seamless workflow to enable higher capacity hard drives and to streamline process integration for heat-assisted magnetic recording. The company also now has access to our optical suite of products to drive further innovation. 
As we have discussed, our small- and medium-sized customers, or SMBs, were disproportionately affected by the pandemic. However, during the last few quarters, we are seeing a recovery, and SMB customers have increased their investment in ANSYS simulation. Our ongoing increase in sales from our SMB customers give me further confidence as we plan for Q4 and beyond. 
During these calls, I typically give you some insights into various aspects of the ANSYS business. In the past, I discussed our best-in-class electromagnetic solutions, our unparalleled product scalability and the extreme accuracy of our structural solutions. As you heard me discuss with Seagate, optical simulation is becoming increasingly important for our customer base. In fact, in Q3, about 5% of our agreements included an optical simulation product in the order. Given that as well as our recent closing of the ZMAX acquisition, I would like to spend some time today discussing our offerings for optical simulation. 
3 years ago, ANSYS did not have any optical simulation products in our portfolio. Today, though, companies can rely on ANSYS for an end-to-end solution, spanning the gamut from photons to electrons based on 3 product lines. The first, ANSYS Lumerical, empowers users to design and analyze integrated photonic components and systems and model challenging product problems, including interacting optical, electrical and thermal effects. The second product line, ANSYSPIoS, simulates the system's optical performance and evaluates the final illumination effect by enabling high-fidelity visualization based on human vision and camera-sensing capabilities. Third is our recent acquisition of ZMAX, which enables customers to accurately model the behavior of light through complex optical lens systems. Instead of working independently as a siloed offering, our optical simulation suite operates as part of a complete multiphysics workflow. Taken together, the ANSYS optical solution is used for a diverse set of applications ranging from camera and LiDAR arrays found in autonomous vehicles to telecommunications and mobile phone cameras to medical equipment and other visual aids. 
For example, in Q3, Sandia National Labs signed an agreement leading to expanded use of Lumerical technologies. Sandia develops leading-edge integrated photonic and nanophotonic solutions for quantum computing, imaging and sensing. The lab uses Lumerical tools to design, model and simulate custom photonic components and their behavior in a circuit environment. 
In the automotive sector, industry leader Ford uses ANSYS products, including SPEOS and the ANSYS vehicle headlight solution in the styling and design of its predictive smart headlamps and to optimize and validate headline performance. Our headlight solution features real-time physics-based optical simulation and driver-in-the-loop functionality to replicate the physical world with a high degree of predictive accuracy. Automotive giant Mazda is also increasing its use of SPEOS for internal and exterior lighting, head-up displays and cameras, thanks to a sales agreement in Q3. 
In Aerospace and Defense, an ANSYS customer is using all 3 of our optical product lines across multiple applications. The customer relies on Lumerical for creating photonics integrated circuits. It uses SPEOs for detecting radiation leaks from aircraft enclosures and this customer is also using ZMAX to study lens deformation. While still new to our portfolio and a relatively small contributor to our overall financial results, these optical solutions fit squarely into our go-to-market motion, and our sales team understands how to market these products. 
Based on the ANSYS strategy of pervasive simulation, our optical customers can easily access products across our portfolio to perform true multiphysics analysis. We saw an excellent example of that with another aerospace and defense customer that was challenged with a wing camera that was capturing blurry images. By using a combination of ANSYS optical and ANSYS fluids products, the customer was able to correct the problem and deliver crisp images even at extreme speeds in bad weather. 
Moving to our partners. I'm excited that we are expanding our relationship with Autodesk by embedding ANSYS' electromagnetic simulation capabilities to explore and validate printed circuit board designs within the Fusion 360 workflow. This first-of-a-kind Autodesk Fusion 360 extension will enable CAD users to perform near real-time PCB analyses and to retrieve real-time insights into their electromagnetic performance to accelerate the development of next-generation products. 
We have also expanded connectivity of ANSYS Twin Builder to industrial control systems through Rockwell Automation's enhanced Studio 5000 simulation interface. Users can connect digital twins to emulated controllers to optimize production at the design stage or physical controllers to enhance equipment performance in real time, for example, in predictive maintenance. 
I am pleased that we have expanded our partnership with TSMC to create a comprehensive thermal analysis solution for multi-die semiconductor designs. Using ANSYS RedHawk-SC electrothermal and ANSYS ice back along with TSMC's silicon stacking and advanced packaging technologies, users can analyze complete chip and package systems with high-fidelity results. 
We are also collaborating with Fujitsu to enable more sustainable product development for our customers. ANSYS Dyna now supports Fujitsu's energy-efficient prime HPC supercomputers which will help customers reduce energy consumption and costs by offloading simulation workloads to a more energy-efficient machine. 
Keeping with our environmental, social and governance initiatives for a moment, we recently published our simulation product handprint for autonomous vehicles. This report illustrates the role that simulation plays in the development of autonomous vehicles, including in sensors, automated driving software and safety testing. Using simulation to develop autonomous vehicles will lead to significant societal and environmental benefits, ranging from a drop in traffic fatalities to a reduction in emissions. 
We have also submitted our initial report with the Climate Disclosure Project and expect results by the end of the year. Similarly, we have begun working on our reports to the task force on climate-related financial disclosures, which focuses on governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets. 
In summary, Q3 was another remarkable quarter for ANSYS. We beat guidance across all key financial metrics and have met our goal of delivering double-digit growth year-to-date. We are also expanding our product leadership in our core solutions as well as an important emerging areas such as optical simulation. These factors, combined with a strong Q4 sales pipeline and outstanding execution, give me further confidence in our ability to meet our newly increased outlook for 2021.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole?"

ACV was strong and in line with our expectations, while revenue, operating margin and EPS exceeded the high end of our Q3 guidance, driven by the mix of license types sold in the quarter. both our large enterprise customers and SMB customers performed well. And our growth during the quarter was broad-based. 
Now let me discuss some of our Q3 financial highlights. Q3 ACV was $365.4 million and grew year-over-year 20% or 19% in constant currency. We saw strong performance across customer types, geographies and industries. ACV from recurring sources represented 76% of the total. 
Q3 total revenue was $445.4 million and grew 21% or 20% in constant currency, which, as I mentioned, exceeded the high end of our guidance driven by license mix. Q3 revenue growth was also wide ranging across customer types and industries. For the first 3 quarters of 2021, we had strong top line performance with ACV and revenue both growing double digits at 17% and 19%, respectively. As Ajei mentioned, for both Q3 and Q3 year-to-date, we are executing against our business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $ 899.5 million. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline. This yielded a solid third quarter gross margin of 89.9% and an operating margin of 39.7%, which was better than our Q3 guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by revenue performance from license mix as well as the timing of investments. The result was third quarter EPS of $1.59, which was also above the high end of our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results from license mix and the timing of investments. 
Our effective tax rate in Q3 was 19%, the tax rate we expect for the fourth quarter of 2021. Our cash flow from operations in Q3 totaled $157.8 million, which benefited from strong collections, primarily driven by robust Q2 growth, favorable timing of intra-quarter sales and a reduction in the percent of receivables past due. We ended the quarter with $1.814 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. 
In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 97,000 shares during the quarter for around $36 million. We have 2.7 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized share repurchase program. Additionally, on October 1, we acquired ZMAX for a purchase price of $399.1 million net of cash acquired. 
Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We continue to build confidence in our outlook for the year, given the improved deals pipeline we see in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are initiating guidance for Q4 and increasing our ACV revenue, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. 
This raise reflects the strong financial performance in the third quarter and the increased momentum of our sales pipeline going into the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $614.9 million to $654.9 million, operating margin in the range of 44.5% to 47% and EPS in the range of $2.48 to $2.81. 
As I mentioned, for the full year, we are raising our ACV revenue, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow outlook. We are increasing our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $1.825 billion to $1.860 billion. This represents growth of 12.9% to 15.1% or 12.6% to 14.7% in constant currency. 
Our Q4 and full year 2021 guidance is based on continued momentum in the business and a Q4 pipeline that has accelerated since our August guidance. It does not include a repeat of the outside spending behavior we saw in December 2020 after vaccines were announced. 
The raise also incorporates approximately $6 million to $8 million of contribution from ZMAX in Q4, and which is offset by approximately $6 million to $8 million of currency headwind. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by $20 million, which translates to an increase of 1.5 points of constant currency growth compared to our August guidance. 
We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.885 billion to $1.925 billion which is growth of 11.2% to 13.5% or 10.6% to 12.9% in constant currency. This raise reflects our strong Q3 revenue performance driven by license mix as well as the incremental organic revenue from the momentum of our Q4 pipeline. Like ACV, our increased revenue incorporates approximately $6 million to $8 million contribution from ZMAX, which is offset by approximately $6 million to $8 million of currency headwinds. 
As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $40 million, which translates to constant currency growth of 3 points higher than the midpoint of our August guidance. 
As you know, ASC 606 introduces revenue growth volatility within the quarters. However, on a full year basis, revenue growth is less volatile. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect the revenue growth rate to be impacted by the year-over-year compare and mix of license types sold in the fourth quarter 2020 versus our current 2021 fourth quarter pipeline. We are increasing our full year operating margin and now expect operating margin to be in the range of 40.5% to 41.5%. 
Additionally, we are increasing our full year EPS and now expect EPS to be in the range of $7.05 to $7.38. This increase incorporates our Q3 performance and is offset by approximately $0.05 of currency headwinds. It is worth noting that some of our strong Q3 EPS performance was driven by the timing of investments that moved from Q3 to the fourth quarter of the year. 
Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. We are increasing our 2021 outlook to a range of $505 million to $535 million. This increase is driven by stronger collections expected during the year and is partially offset by approximately $3 million to $5 million of currency headwind. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our Q4 and 2021 guidance are contained in the prepared remarks document. 
Consistent with our standard practice, we will provide detailed 2022 guidance once we finalize our 2022 planning process and close out 2021. I would like to thank the ANSYS team for their outstanding execution during the quarter, which drove our robust Q3 financial performance and continued momentum going into our last quarter of the year. 
We once again delivered a strong quarter, which coupled with our recurring business model and growing sales pipeline demonstrated the strength of the ANSYS business. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2021 outlook as well as our longer-term financial objectives. 
Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions."

And in particular, we did talk about optical as an area that we are that we were investing in, in particular, to support things like autonomous vehicles as well as to support things like 5G for the purposes of interconnects and so forth. And so we've essentially been executing against the strategy that we laid out. 
I also want to correct a point that you made in your question, you said 5% of the bookings came from optical. That's not what I said in my script. What I said is that 5% of the deals had some optical component within the agreement with the customer. So there was some aspect of optical within that. Optical, of course, is a relatively small piece of our business today."

So as you point out, over the last 12 months, Americas has continued to be a consistent strong performer and lead the company in creating value for our customers. a couple of deals with the 1 that Ajei mentio",439,"Yes. Thanks so much for your question, Andrew. So as you point out, over the last 12 months, Americas has continued to be a consistent strong performer and lead the company in creating value for our customers. a couple of deals with the 1 that Ajei mentioned in his remarks, the $58 million agreement with the leading North American technology company, is an example of -- I think the model that we  have exported around the world and leads to some of the strength in our other regions like APAC, where the customer has already been using solutions from across the ANSYS multiphysics portfolio, but is now expanding the number of simulation users. And so that we've done a very good job at building deep relationships with customers understanding their short and their long-term development road maps and enabling them to be able to propagate the use of simulation to broader use cases to connect the physics and to also connect other users in the process to leverage that simulation. 
And so that model that Americas executes quite well is the model that we're executing around the world. And just as an example, our Asia Pacific region has executed exceptionally. They had another quarter of very strong growth with 21% constant currency growth I'm sorry, 21% growth in the region at a constant currency basis. And the strength in that region was broad-based across industry, customer types, geographies we had several 7-figure contracts in Asia Pacific that added growth to the high-tech sector, where customers are really showing enthusiasm for not just the core portfolio, but the adjacencies as well. So there's a common theme here where we're broadening and deepening the relationships within the customer with our core technology having strong footholds and solid growth, but also leveraging the organic and the inorganic investments that we've been making over the past 5 years to accelerate the footprint globally. 
And so I would say the core strength of the portfolio and the investments that we have been making during the course of the pandemic with our customers and in our portfolio are really the drivers of the acceleration and the performance of growth. To some degree, there is some -- there is a little bit of recovery at the Asia Pacific probably had was a little bit ahead in the recovery versus Americas. There's still unevenness in terms of how customers are preferring to meet in-person. So I wouldn't characterize things as a return to normal quite yet. But certainly, the business model is resilient, it is showing through regardless of the challenges that we've seen in the pandemic."

And just to amplify one of the points Nicole made, the large customer dynamic is somewhat different from the SMB. For the most part, the large customer dynamic is driven by the long-term relationships that we've maintained with our direct sales force with these customers. Many of these are long-term customers of ours. They've built their processes around ANSYS. And when it comes to a new project or a new activity that they start to continue to evolve their R&D efforts, they turn to us as a vendor. And so there's an opportunity within those customers to expand the footprint based on long-term relationships. 
In the case of SMBs, in many cases, the SMBs are relationships that we have through channel partners and some of these customers may be relatively new customers. They may be relatively early in their life as an organization. And so I wouldn't necessarily say SMB is a leading indicator, which was the point that you made. I wouldn't necessarily say it's a leading indicator. These are 2 different -- there's slightly different dynamics across both the SMB and enterprise, and each one of them has their own go-to-market motion and supporting activity."

One is you think about the short term. So in the short term, supply chain disruptions may be affecting many businesses, but we're really not one of the businesses that's affected by the supply chain. And the reason is, as I mentioned earlier, the use of our software is tied to the design of products. It's tied to the R&D phase for the most part and not -- it's not denominated by manufacturing. 
So whether if a customer has challenges with the supply chain, and they can't produce as many units of a particular product that's been designed with our technology. That doesn't affect our relationship with the customer. They're already designing what that next product looks like, and they're working with our engineers, or they're working with our technology to figure out what the future looks like. 
So our customers continue to make investments during -- in R&D. And it's really not affected by the supply chain in the short term, so we have no real short-term issues there. When you think about it from a long-term perspective, and I think you're also alluding to this in your question, when you think about the long-term perspective, companies, I think, around the globe are questioning exactly how they need to think about their supply chains going forward. So will there be a change in the way they've been thinking about the supply chains? And in some cases, you're seeing customers thinking about moving manufacturing closer to where the final product is actually going to be used. This isn't necessarily building factories in a more traditional way. In many cases, customers are thinking about building next-generation factories where they have much more automation, robotics, next-generation manufacturing techniques. All of these things are relevant for simulation. We're in a position -- we at ANSYS are in a position to help our customers as they go through this rethinking process as they go through the design of these next-generation capabilities as they start to think about advanced manufacturing techniques, materials as they work through the simulation that goes with that, we're in a position to help them. And so we see this as a long-term tailwind where we can help customers as they try to figure out what this next generation looks like in their own evolution."

At the company's Ideas Conference last month hosted by our semiconductor business unit, there were -- Two very interesting comments from management regarding the strategic vision that ANSYS has. There was a reference to your becoming a ""cloud first digital platform"" as a foundation for your future growth. That's from the presentation. Similarly, that you foresee a time of simulation platforms and insights as a service. Again, that's a direct quote. So in thinking about your cloud future, was the commentary at your conference meant to suggest that cloud is not just an adjunct or complement to what you're doing today in terms of delivering technology but ultimately becomes the nexus of how you deliver technology, perhaps not unlike what PTC discussed for itself on their call last night? And then as a follow-up question, in light of the improving visibility in terms of pipeline and the like. Can you talk about the investments you're making or planning to make in technical support and consulting that's typically your -- or certainly lately, your second-highest number of open positions after R&D, and you look like you're ramping up in that area. So maybe talk about those investments and the availability of the necessary personnel for that function."
24893,1685222767,2425538,"ANSYS, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","ANSYS, Inc.","Executives","Sure, Jay. So let me try to unpack your question, and let me start with the longer-term direction comment that you asked -- And I think, look, you'll hear a lot more about strategic direction for -- and where we're going over the next year and so on. Thin",578,"Sure, Jay. So let me try to unpack your question, and let me start with the longer-term direction comment that you asked -- And I think, look, you'll hear a lot more about strategic direction for -- and where we're going over the next year and so on. Think of some of the comments that you heard as adembrating some of the super exciting times that are ahead for ANSYS and our customers. You talked a little bit about cloud. We've got ANSYS Cloud out there, which manages access to high-performance computing resources. Just remember that many of our customers then cloud is about being able to access high-performance computing at scale and enabling some of these larger, high-fidelity simulations to run at scale. And so last quarter on this call, I talked about the scalability of some of our products that was enabled by a customer for us with the technical university of Eindhoven where they had solved an aerodynamic problem with something like 3 billion computational cells with 20 billion unknowns. And that scalability is possible, of course, because of core technical advancements that we've done. So for example, we sped up mesh generation by 20x, which is obviously a bottleneck in the creation of detailed simulation of transient phenomena. But also, we were in a position to give access to cloud computing resources. And in fact, just this week, Satya Nadella and his keynote at Microsoft Ignite, used the same example to show what is possible on the ANSYS cloud platform, which is essentially ANSYS products running on Azure on the world's most powerful AI supercomputer. 
So that was one example, I think, of cloud that I'm excited about. We support flexible licensing models. We support an elastic pay-as-you-go model. We support a hybrid model, which mixes and matches elastic as well as lease licenses. And this year, we've continued to expand the number of products that we've added into our cloud capabilities. For example, we've added in Edina, we've added in our Lumerical products. We've added in SO2 certification. We've continued to improve our overall customer experience. And we've also seen significant increases in cloud usage. So 1 of the ways that we monitor that, of course, is by looking at core hours. And this year, year-to-date, we're seeing almost 4x as many core hours as compared to this time last year. And we still haven't hit that inflection point. 
So we believe that there is still much greater demand within our customer base. And we're watching our customers. We're seeing where they're going, we're anticipating where they're going, and we're giving them the opportunity to be able to drive some of the scale-out compute. So I'm really excited about where we are with cloud and some of that capability. There was a number of other things, I'm sure that were also mentioned in that conversation. Some of the things that we're excited about are the new capabilities we have in our product. We've talked about AIML and how AIML supports our technology and simulation. All of those are interrelated because the advances that we make in one area can be delivered to our customers in other ways. And that allows us to be a more responsive vendor to our customers or partner to our customers. It allows us to continue to drive leadership in the marketplace. 
So that was the first question. What was the second question, Jay, with -- it was around..."

But what I can tell you is that we're really excited that we can make our technology available to customers who are not necessarily experts in using simulation. Our strategy for simulation is to take simulation and make it more pervasive across the product life cycle. And part of that is creating applications that are easier for non-engineers to use. And so as part of our strategy, we're creating applications that include various elements of our technology that can be integrated together to deliver a SaaS experience for our end users, wherein they can simply invoke our technology under the covers, if you will, to solve specific problems.

And so they did recover quite a bit in the fourth quarter of last year, which is one of the reasons why that compares a little more challenging in Q4. But customers continue to prefer time-based licensing models because it really enables them to be more flexible as their needs evolve. And so over the past several years, the business model has really been shifting away from perpetual licenses. If you look over longer periods of time, it's been pretty flat, and the growth has been primarily through the acceleration of leases. And so that's really built a very strong annuity business for us over the past 5 years and has been a very successful evolution of the business. And so while we did see -- we are seeing kind of some of the of the compare effects in the first 3 quarters of this year, we believe, over the long term, that the shift that customer -- we're seeing from customers is going to continue towards that lease based licensing."

And that certainly drove some cloud usage. I mean, the fact remains that we can give our customers who want to take advantage of our technology, we can give our customers an experience where they have elastic compute driven from the cloud. It's a SaaS-like experience. We can give them that using our elastic licensing capabilities. So that feels to them like a SaaS experience. And similarly, we can give our access -- we can give our customers access to on-premises technology in a lease model, which they've used for a while. So we give our customers a choice of what they want to be in a position to do. ANSYS Cloud gives them that ability to support the need for cloud compute, both from the solver perspective as well as scale up for HPC. 
So it really is up to the customers and many of our customers have made investments that are that are within their own building out data centers, so they take advantage -- they prefer to take advantage of their own data centers. Some customers will look at the amount of data that they have to manage. I mean when you think about a simulation, a complex multivariate simulation that's running across multiple or multivarioptimization could result in terabytes of information. And so, so then there's a question of where do you store that information and how do you keep it? Do you move it from one cloud to another. What is their standard model. 
So it's not simply a matter of moving parts into the cloud. It's really thinking holistically from the part of the customers on where and how they want to make this transition because it's an entire workflow that's across multiple vendors that needs to be managed. And I think we're very well positioned. Our technology is ready for the cloud. We're very well positioned. We're excited about our capabilities.
