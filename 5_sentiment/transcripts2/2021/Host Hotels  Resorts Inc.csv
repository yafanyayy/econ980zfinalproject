I'd like to start by expressing my heartfelt condolences to Ernie's family and to all our friends at Marriott. I have known Ernie for 25 years and found him to be one of the most authentic, engaging and caring leaders in the lodging space. A visionary leader, a loving husband and father and a respected colleague and friend, Ernie will be deeply missed and is leaving a lasting legacy within our industry and all the lives he has touched. 
Host has emerged from the most challenging year in lodging history as a stronger company with robust long-term growth prospects. Our hotels have streamlined their operating models and minimized operating expense growth from second quarter lows, while accelerating RevPAR from $9 in April to approximately $42 in January. 
As a result, we have cut our hotel-level operating loss by more than half from $163 million in the second quarter to $75 million in the fourth. We have also achieved breakeven or positive hotel-level operating profit at 20 hotels, representing 24% of our rooms in the fourth quarter, a sharp increase from 14 hotels and 13% of our rooms in the third quarter. 
Additionally, we've invested in our long-term growth and enhanced our ability to gain and retain market share by continuing to upgrade several significant hotels and delivering the new AC Hotel Scottsdale North. 
Moreover, we've entered 2021 with $2.5 billion of total available liquidity. Our investment-grade balance sheet has been further strengthened by opportunistic asset and land sales at pre-COVID-19 valuations and debt refinancing that has pushed our earliest maturity to late 2023. 
Last week, we announced a best-in-class second amendment to our credit agreement, which provides us greater flexibility to acquire hotels early in this new lodging cycle. With the highest quality portfolio in the company's history and a balance sheet that allows us to capitalize on external growth opportunities, we are very well positioned to elevate our EBITDA growth profile through the vaccine-driven recovery. 
My comments today will focus on top line trends, ROI projects and our latest views on transaction markets and acquisition opportunities. Sourav will detail our hotel's operating expense control and the improvement in an outlook for cash burn and hotel EBITDA. He will also walk through the additional flexibility and optionality created by the second amendment to our credit agreement. 
Starting with group booking trends. We saw a marked increase in group booking activity for our Marriott-managed hotels in January. Our hotels booked approximately 101,000 group room nights for 2021, a 32% increase over January of 2019, with January typically being a slow month for group booking activity. 
In addition, our hotels had an impressive lead to booking conversion rate of 22% compared to approximately 16% in January 2019. While there are several types of groups being booked, we are pleased to see bookings for incentive meetings, which have returned after our Hyatt in 2020. 
We also saw improved future group booking activity in January, with approximately 73,000 future group room nights booked for beyond 2021, representing a 42% increase to January of 2019. Through this January, we had approximately 1.6 million definite room nights on the books for full year 2021. Approximately 1 million of these occur in the second half of the year and are fairly evenly split between the third and fourth quarters, where bookings are largely continuing to hold. 
Should the groups materialize, our second half 2021 group business will have recovered to almost 50% of second half 2019 levels based on definite group room nights on the books. 
While group pace is less meaningful today, as most meeting planners remain on the sidelines, we are encouraged by our total group revenue pace for the latter half of 2021. Pace in the second half of 2021 is down only about 25% compared to the same time last year versus the first half being 84% lower than last year. This could improve with additional in-the-year for-the-year group booking activity, assuming state and local restrictions are relaxed and attendees become more comfortable with travel. 
Staying with group, we believe that the location and quality of our hotels as well as our long-standing sales relationships with key travel managers, favorably positions them to gain market share when group demand returns to urban markets. 
For example, the demand from government agency groups surged around inauguration, our D.C. Hotels ran occupancies of 81% and 78% on the day prior and the day of inauguration, respectively. And we temporarily reopened a higher agency capital hill to capitalize on this demand. 
For those days, our hotels of occupancies were 13 and 11 percentage points higher than other luxury and upper upscale hotels in the D.C. Metro region. Moreover, we achieved an ADR that, on average, was $26 higher each day for the 3 days of January 19, 20th and 21st. 
Our hotels significantly outperformed other luxury and upper upscale hotels due to their coveted downtown locations, ability to accommodate large groups and their 30-year relationships with key government agencies. 
At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 118,000 definite room nights on the books for the fourth quarter, which would have represented a 7% sequential decline. However, our hotels were able to drive 38,000 in-the-quarter for-the-quarter bookings for a total of 156,000 group room nights in the fourth quarter, representing a 23% sequential increase over the third quarter. 
Additionally, fourth quarter group bookings delivered a 12.3% higher average rate than third quarter 2020, helped by this short-term group demand that was driven by small- to mid-sized corporate accounts and SMERF groups. 
Rebookings as a percentage of cancellations continue to increase, with approximately 24% of cancellations at our Marriott-managed properties now rebooked and a funnel of tenanted bookings that would take the total rebook to almost 37%. 
In the fourth quarter and full year 2020, we collected approximately $11.5 million and $52 million of group attrition and cancellation fees, respectively, and expect to collect an additional $12 million to $14 million in full year 2021. 
Moving on to leisure trends. Leisure demand remains concentrated in Sunbelt market 
[Technical Difficulty] 
we find that the location and quality of our resorts has enabled them to significantly gain market share. 
In the fourth quarter, our 16 resorts gained 17.8% RevPAR index share relative to their comp sets. This was driven by 8.1% better occupancy and 9% better rate compared to the RevPAR index scores in the fourth quarter of 2019. Moreover, we have gained 30% RevPAR index share in Phoenix, nearly 26% in the Florida Gulf Coast, 14.4% in Miami and nearly 12% in Maui Oahu, as our hotels outperform their peers in capturing leisure demand. 
Our most recent acquisition, the 1 Hotel South Beach, continues to be an outstanding performer despite the pandemic. The hotel achieved 90% occupancy at a nearly $2,000 rate on New Year's eve and has just finished President's Day weekend with occupancy averaging nearly 90% from Friday through Sunday with a blended ADR of approximately $1,430, which represents a nearly 4% year-over-year increase. 
Encouragingly, leisure RevPAR performance continues to improve over holiday weekends. For example, at our Marriott-managed hotels, RevPAR improved by 60%, 3 weeks out from President's Day, compared to where those hotels were 3 weeks away from Columbus Day. In addition, we have observed the lengthening of the booking window in the Florida Gulf Coast, Miami and in Hawaii, where travelers are getting more comfortable with the testing requirements and process. 
With upcoming leisure holidays over spring break and Easter, we expect leisure occupancy to continue to improve, driven by our Sunbelt markets and Hawaii. For the second half of the year, transient revenues at our 3 Maui hotels are pacing 11% higher compared to 2019, while total revenues are pacing almost 20% higher. 
In the fourth quarter, we grew leisure room nights by 62,000 or by 13.6% over the third quarter. Our Sunbelt markets ran 31.6% occupancy in the first week of the quarter and progressed to 33.5% throughout the quarter, with growth driven by Miami, the Florida Gulf Coast, Phoenix and San Antonio. 
Moreover, our loyalty redemption in the fourth quarter was 25% higher than the third quarter and represented the highest rewards demand since the start of the pandemic. Resort properties accounted for 65% of the growth in loyalty redemption room nights, driven by Phoenix, the Florida Gulf Coast, Hawaii and Orlando. 
Moving on to business transient. Demand remains low but has improved by 13% sequentially in the fourth quarter, which was the strongest quarter since the pandemic-impacted travels. Cities that drove most of the increase over the third quarter were San Antonio, Houston and Philadelphia. As with group, business transient demand continues to be driven by smaller organizations rather than by large corporate accounts. This decision to remain on the sidelines is partly due to liability risk that we expect will fade as vaccine deployment accelerates. 
Shifting to portfolio reinvestments, let me begin by saying that our ability to continue to invest in our portfolio is a competitive advantage that we expect will favorably position hosts to gain market share and deliver superior revenue and EBITDA growth through this lodging recovery. 
3 to 5 points of weighted index growth at our renovated hotels in 2019, would have translated into roughly $38 million to $63 million of incremental revenues and $21 million to $34 million of incremental EBITDA on a stabilized annualized basis. In addition to this, we expect our ROI projects to materially enhance the underlying value of our real estate. 
Last year, we completed extensive resort renovations and repositionings at the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and the Don Cesar in St. Pete's Beech. Within the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, we plan on completing The Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island in March this year, following several notable completions such as The JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead among others in 2020 and The San Francisco Marriott Marquis, Santa Clara Marriott, New York Marriott Downtown and Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa in 2019. 
We continue to invest in the Marriott Transformational Capital Program as well as in other ROI projects, which, on a combined basis, represent nearly 71% of our 2021 capital spend. Moreover, nearly 85% of our investment in the Marriott Program is expected to be complete by year-end 2021, and the entire program should be substantially completed by year-end 2022. 
Having completed 7 of the Marriott Program renovations through year-end 2020, we expect to complete an additional 4 hotels in 2021, thereby transforming 11 of the 16 hotels that make up the program. We expect to benefit from $16 million of operating profit guarantees from Marriott in 2021 without experiencing commensurate revenue disruption, given the current low RevPAR environment. 
In addition, we expect to deliver 19 new 2-bedroom luxury villas at the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort in April this year. The 11 existing villas achieved a RevPAR of approximately $1,700 in 2019. And while they exhibit strong demand throughout the year in normal years, recent demand for villas has more than tripled from pre-pandemic levels. 
ADRs for these villas ran at almost $3,700 a night in December and at $2,400 a night in January. We already have 300 room nights on the books for the new villas with a transient rate of $1,990 a night, and the hotel has only just begun marketing them. 
Although the villa expansion wasn't part of our original underwriting when we acquired the hotel in 2018, we are currently exceeding our project underwriting assumptions for 2021 on both rate and occupancy. 
We are excited to announce the repositioning and expansion at one of our top-performing hotels, The Ritz-Carlton in Naples, where we see an opportunity to create meaningful value while also transforming the resort to meet today's luxury standards. A new tower and reconfiguration within the existing hotel will increase the suite count at the Ritz from less than 8% of total inventory to almost 20% or 92 keys, while adding 24 keys overall. 
In 2019, the resort's 35 suites achieved RevPAR of approximately $800, almost double the overall RevPAR of the resort and are highly sought after by the hotel's loyal customer base. Additionally, an expanded club lounge will eliminate the size constraints on upsells, which generated an annualized ADR premium in excess of $220 in 2019. 
Business interruption estimates continue to be low due to the impact of COVID-19 on occupancy, which also makes this an opportune time to renovate the guestrooms and to make ROI-generating upgrades to the resorts pools, pool bar and restaurants. The project will commence in May 2021, and is expected to be complete in December 2022. As stabilization in 2023, we expect this project to generate nearly $10.5 million of incremental annualized EBITDA, which represents a 12% cash-on-cash return on the incremental investment based on our underwriting. 
Finally, on acquisitions, in the first weeks of 2021, we have seen a marked increase in the number of attractive hotels coming to market. From looking at just a handful of deals in the fourth quarter of 2020, we now have a solid pipeline of interesting and actionable opportunities to evaluate. In many instances, the hotels we are looking at are owned by private owners, who have been contemplating liquidity events for some time. 
While we expect to face strong competition for acquisitions, we are very well positioned due to our deep relationships and our ability to move quickly, fund large equity investments with cash and provide tax-advantaged alternatives to sellers. This management team has a strong capital allocation track record, having acquired $1.6 billion of assets and sold $3.3 billion of assets at favorable multiples in 2018 and 2019. 
The biggest shift in our acquisition strategy is our consideration of markets beyond the top 25. IBM Watson, our recently developed predictive analytics model, mines over 1 million discrete structured variables and leverages natural language processing insights from over 3 million unstructured data sources to forecast RevPAR growth by market. 
We use this proprietary topline predictive model in our research-based expectations for hotel operating expense growth by market to narrow down the markets that are likely to outperform the revenue and EBITDA growth profile of our existing footprint. 
While we believe this is an opportune time to deploy capital as we are at the beginning of the lodging cycle and appear to be heading into a period of strong economic recovery, let me emphasize that we are not looking to acquire for acquisition sake. We are optimistic about finding opportunities that will truly elevate the EBITDA growth profile of our existing portfolio. 
To conclude, we are very encouraged that vaccine deployment in the United States has gained momentum with over 55 million doses administered already and 1.7 million new doses being administered each day, according to CDC data. 
As the Washington Post recently reported, the United States has purchased enough supplies to vaccinate all American adults, making the vaccine-driven recovery more certain today than it has been since the pandemic began. 
MacKenzie estimates that the U.S. may achieve herd immunity by the third or fourth quarter and that a transition to normalcy is possible as early as the second quarter of 2021, aided by the spring weather and the vaccination of the highest risk population. 
Should this scenario materialize, we expect to be able to achieve positive hotel EBITDA at some point in the second half of the year and to continue to benefit from a rebound in travel as the pandemic recedes.
With that, I will turn the call over to Sourav."
29574,701201149,2216890,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2021",2021-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Following the revenue-related green shoots, Jim detailed on group bookings and transient demand, I would like to give you a better sense of how we expect property-level expenses to trend relative to revenue this yea",1267,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Following the revenue-related green shoots, Jim detailed on group bookings and transient demand, I would like to give you a better sense of how we expect property-level expenses to trend relative to revenue this year. 
Since the start of the pandemic, we have worked closely with the property managers to aggressively limit cost and evolve the operating model to adjust for the business environment. In the fourth quarter, excluding severance, property-level expenses were approximately 65% lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Including wage and benefit costs, variable expenses were roughly 82% lower year-over-year, broadly in line with RevPAR declines of 79.7%, while fixed expenses were approximately 47% lower. Variable expense reductions have consistently been in line with overall revenue declines through the down term. 
Fixed expenses that are somewhat associated with business volumes, such as maintenance, marketing and utility costs, saw a dramatic reduction in the second quarter and have slowly increased as business improved through the back half of the year. 
Brand programs and services, such as above property sales offices and IT, have seen material reductions as our operators have restructured their shared services organization. Finally, costs below the gross operating profit line, which include passive and insurance and a traditionally completely fixed, saw modest reductions in the fourth quarter due to onetime credits such as operating profit guarantees associated with the Marriott Transformation Capital Program. 
As a result of our property and brand management team's efforts to ensure that cost growth remains in line with slowly improving revenues, our quarterly expense reduction ratio, which measures the year-over-year decline in property-level expenses divided by the year-over-year decline in total revenues, was fairly stable at approximately 0.8% in the second, third and fourth quarters. This means that for every 1% decline in year-over-year total revenue, our hotels reduced year-over-year expenses by 0.8%. 
The question now is, what does this ratio look like as revenues return in 2021? We have always expected to reach a plateau where the ratio deteriorates as services and standards return to the middle of the revenue recovery. Although we still expect this to be the case, because 2021 is a transition year, our hotels are striving to achieve an expense reduction ratio of between 0.65% and 0.7% throughout the year, as measured by property-level expense and total revenue declines relative to 2019. 
Moving on to hotel-level operating losses. We improved our quarter-over-quarter results by 23%, mainly by increasing revenues while keeping hotel expenses relatively stable. Most of the increase in expenses was associated with the 5 hotels that we reopened in the fourth quarter as well as greater business volumes overall. 
Our hotel-level operating loss averaged $25 million per month in the fourth quarter, down from approximately $32 million in the third quarter, including the $15 million and $23 million of employee retention credits our managers received in 2020 under the CARES Act and passed on to us in the fourth and third quarters, respectively. 
Excluding these onetime credits, our monthly hotel-level operating losses in the fourth quarter averaged approximately $30 million and were better than the $40 million of hotel-level operating losses we outlined on our third quarter call, primarily due to revenues being approximately 35% higher on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. 
We expect first quarter hotel operations to be broadly commensurate with the fourth quarter of 2020, as further improvement in fundamentals may be offset by leisure demand being seasonally weaker in the first quarter than the fourth quarter, which benefited from strong ADRs and occupancies in the days leading up to and including New Year's eve. We, therefore, expect an average hotel level operating loss of approximately $30 million to $35 million a month, not including any onetime credits a hotel may receive in the first quarter. 
Adjusting for interest payments and corporate G&A, we expect monthly cash flowing from operations to range between approximately $49 million to $54 million. 
With regards to our outlook, it remains challenging to forecast precisely when we will achieve hotel-level EBITDA breakeven and profitability in the second half of 2021, as much of it depends on the success of vaccine administration and the continued easing of state and local restrictions. 
Following the first quarter, we expect a gradual sequential improvement in RevPAR. We anticipate this to be occupancy-driven in the second and third quarters when ADR may sequentially decline as suspended luxury and upper upscale hotels reopen. 
Our research indicates that operations at approximately 13.5% of luxury and upper upscale hotels in our top 25 markets are currently suspended and likely to reopen at low occupancies during the second and third quarters of this year. 
Turning to the 20 hotels that have achieved breakeven or positive hotel EBITDA in the fourth quarter, breakeven generally has been achieved in the 35% to 45% occupancy range with ADRs down in the approximately 15% to 30% range compared to 2019, which is in line with the estimates we first provided in April. Assuming the inclusion of corporate-level expenses for interest and corporate G&A, we would breakeven at occupancy levels of approximately 45% and 60% at the same ADR decline levels of 15% to 30%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. The second amendment to our credit agreement has increased our acquisition capacity to $2 billion using existing liquidity with a minimum liquidity requirement of $600 million. The capacity may include $500 million of proceeds from asset sales that would otherwise have been required to repay debt, as long as we use the proceeds to acquire assets that are unencumbered by debt. 
In addition, we have retained our ability to redeploy $750 million of asset sale proceeds into acquisition via the 1031 exchange process, while extending our leverage covenant relief period through the second quarter of 2022 and our leverage covenant easing period for the third quarter of '23. In doing so, we have created cushion for our internal recovery as well as capacity to accommodate external growth opportunities. 
There are a couple of additional items I would like to bring to your attention. First, we recorded an income tax benefit of $220 million in 2020, due to the net operating loss incurred by our TRS. As a result of legislation enacted by the CARES Act, this net operating loss may be carried back up to 5 years in order to procure a refund of previously paid federal corporate income taxes. We anticipate that our TRS will incur a net operating loss in 2021, and that we will continue to report a corresponding tax benefit in the first quarter of 2021. 
Second, we have included schedules with historical pro forma hotel metrics in our fourth quarter 2020 supplemental. The metrics include quarterly RevPAR, occupancy, ADR, revenues, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAre, going back 8 quarters to the first quarter of 2019, and we plan on updating this schedule quarterly. 
To conclude, our focus and 3 strategic objectives continue to be to redefine the operating model, gain market share and strategically allocate capital. Overtime, we expect to recover to 2019 levels of RevPAR with costs that may be $100 million to $150 million lower than they were in 2019 on a nominal basis with a portfolio that's gaining market share and outperforming its comp tax. We are positioned to have robust revenue and EBITDA growth that we expect will be further augmented by external growth opportunities. 
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question."

Smedes, happy to address your question. I think what has changed is the simple fact that a lot of owners of hotels, who were holding off bringing their properties to market, have now started as we have messaged today to see light at the end of the tunnel here. 
I think that you can tell from our commentary and from our release that we feel confident that assuming the vaccine continues to be rolled out and there isn't any disruption due to new variants being found, which it doesn't appear to be today anyway, it's the beginning of a new cycle. And there are a lot of buyers who have sat on the sidelines to wait for the time when there might be more buyer interest, and we're starting to see that now. And the pipeline has truly meaningfully expanded between the fourth quarter and the early part of this year. 
So when I say there are actionable opportunities, these, in many instances, are private owners, who have wanted to monetize their investment for one reason or another, modestly along the lines of distress, there's not that much distress out there. But we are seeing owners who say, ""This is the time."" And this is the time to take these assets to market. I don't think that there is a lot of just price analysis occurring based on the conversations we're having, these are people who really want to sell their hotels. 
Now we are in a really unique position, given the fact that we have $2.5 billion of cash, and we have the ability to acquire up to $2 billion of assets out of existing liquidity subject to maintaining $600 million of liquidity inside the company. And that gives us the ability to go out and buy hotels on an all-cash basis without the need to obtain debt financing, which is a distinguishing factor for us.  And we have very strong deep relationships, having been in this industry for over 30 years and a very solid reputation, the ability to move quickly and to get deals done. 
The other thing, I think, that is bringing people to market today is the fact that the debt markets are opening up. So we expect that there's going to be competition from private equity firms. There's no question about it, but we're happy to have that competition. I think that the print for the fourth quarter on what we've been able to accomplish on margins in a very challenging environment gives us a high degree of confidence that between our enterprise analytics group and our asset managers that we can find ways to create value even in the environment that we're in today. 
So we're confident. I don't know how many deals we're going to get done, but we do believe that we're at the beginning of the cycle. We came in 2020 in the best shape that the company has ever been in because, in large part, we believe going into '19 that we were heading into the end of the lodging cycle and we were prudent in our capital allocation strategy. And I think it's going to pay off for us because it's giving us the opportunity to acquire hotels as the economy reopens and as the lodging cycle will begin to note."

I mean, we have always looked at structured data, and we continue to do that. IBM Watson looks at unstructured data. And yes, the world has changed, but I think that the unstructured data is out there, and we're very fortunate to have a tool like IBM Watson to capture that data. 
Additionally, as we think about markets, we are looking at markets where we believe that we can acquire hotels that will allow us to grow EBITDA at a higher level than our existing portfolio of assets. So in addition to looking at top line, we will be studying in detail the expense profile of each hotel because it's critical that, yes, you have strong revenue management and you have the ability to sell your property, but it doesn't do a lot of good if you don't have the flow through. 
So controlling expenses is absolutely critical to how we look at properties going forward. I will tell you that one of the reasons we're looking at markets outside the top 25 today is because we think that expense growth, at least, for the near term is likely to be higher in major urban markets as we come out of this, just given cost pressures that the urban markets are facing today. 
So further to answer your question, resorts, I think our resort story is incredible. If you look at the statistics, the RevPAR index shares we've been able to achieve on the 16 resort properties we have and if you look at specific resort markets like Miami, The Gulf Coast of Florida and Phoenician, we couldn't be more pleased with how our resorts have performed. So yes, they'll be at the top of the list. 
But I would tell you, more importantly, it's going to be assets where there are multiple demand drivers. So we are going to continue to look for properties where there's a mix of business transient, leisure transient and group. We are strong believers in having diversity of demand and giving us the ability to pivot from one type of demand to the other, depending on market conditions."

My question for you is on Hawaii. It's a big part of your portfolio. Maybe I think it's either 1 or 2 largest market. I think that was actually one of the saving graces or at least relative to our expectations, ADR was very high. Even though occupancy was around sort of portfolio average, can you just give an update on sort of how you see Hawaii playing out in terms of demand -- sort of pent-up demand and then like maybe what the Asian travel kind of story or timeline looks like to that market as well?"

The visitation to Maui is driven by domestic U.S. travel. It's really not driven by Asian travel. Asian travel is heads to Oahu and the big island in Hawaii predominantly, not on Maui. 
So the ability that we have had on Maui to hold rate and to see rate pacing -- total revenue pace up 11% in the back half of 2021, I think, speaks loudly to the desirability of Maui and our resorts, in particular. So we actually figured out how to navigate the testing requirements and the other requirements at the State of Hawaii, had put in place and took a family vacation to Maui over Christmas. And even though occupancies were very low, ADRs were very high. 
So I think that we are going to continue to see Maui in Hawaii travel increase, particularly as the vaccine gets rolled out. What's apparent to us is that there is incredible pent-up demand out there, particularly on the leisure side. And the amount of money that has been saved as a result of the various restrictions and lockdowns and the fact that people aren't going to the office and they're not commuting, they're not going out to lunch, people aren't going out to dinner is pretty incredible. 
So we will continue to see Hawaii grow over time. And the other data point that is just very, very encouraging is what we're seeing with respect to villa bookings at the end the fact that we had a $3,700 ADR during the month of December for the villas and how we're getting incredible demand on our 19 new villas that aren't even complete. So we're bullish on Hawaii, and we think that leisure is going to really continue to carry today as we see business transient and group evolve."

But in LA County, indoor dining is still closed. So you have the you have the ability to eat outside of a restaurant. Gyms are closed. Other amenities like hair salons, nail salons are open, but with 25% capacity. 
New York has an equal closed. They've opened up indoor dining. So until we see services return to normal and we're hearing that Broadway could open up soon, but until we see services return to normal, I don't think you're going to see a lot of demand in the coastal markets. 
Sourav, do you want to touch a little bit on BT trends?"

We are seeing some demand as it relates to consultants the Deloitte PwC to the world as well as some project teams that are certainly going to these markets as well, obviously, some government and government contract business as well.
So at the end of the day, when you think about it, the offices really need to open up and the company need to get comfortable with their folks traveling on business. And when that does happen, that's when travel -- BT travel will really come back in a meaningful way. 
And as Jim mentioned, just given the cadence of the recovery that we are seeing with the vaccine administration across the U.S., that poses really well. And we are optimistic that recovery is going to occur sooner rather than later. 
I would mention just one thing on the group front is we did do future bookings of about 73,000 room nights from 2022 and beyond. And the encouraging sign there is, 30% of that 73,000 room night was made up of Boston, New York and Seattle. So those are, again, obviously, urban markets, and that's an encouraging sign for the future."

But in particular, when we're talking about BT, we are of the opinion that we might see 50% to 60% of corporate travel returning by quarter 4 of this year. So that's an encouraging sign for us. 
The other encouraging sign is that most special corporate accounts have held rates flat in 2021 versus 2020. And if you recall, 2020 was flat to 2019. So that's a very encouraging sign that corporate accounts aren't pushing back on rate when they're negotiating. So there are a lot of green shoots out there. 
And again, not to keep talking about the vaccine, but it's all dependent on the country getting vaccinated and us achieving herd immunity and offices opening up and people getting back on the road."

And Sourav, I appreciate you kind of trying to put that into terms that I think we'll understand as Analyst. I just want to sort of reframe it a little bit. I think what you said was you could expect for this year, something like $0.65 to $0.70 on the dollar of, like call it, revenue flowing through to the bottom line. So 1 is just to clarify, am I thinking about that correctly? 
And then two, if I am -- if we go back and look, I believe the flows or rates, let's go back to like 2009, 2010, at least as an industry, they were decently lower than that. And I believe what happened was occupancy hasn't fully recovered yet. And so it took a little longer to hit those really high flow-throughs because, first, you're filling up. There's more variable expense attached to that. And then it's really the rate portion of the equation that drives the higher flow throughs. But is that going to be -- is that equation going to be a little different this go around and/or could you see higher flow through as rate actually starts to come back as well? So just maybe help us break that down a little bit."

If you just take the Smith Travel numbers for 2021, they're estimating RevPAR down 56%. What we are saying with this expense ratio, and let's take the midpoint of what we're saying between the 0.65 and the 0.7, that's 0.675. If you take that 0.675 and multiply that by the 56%, all we are saying is that expenses would reduce by 37.8%. That's what we're saying is to the midpoint in 2021. 
We have not seen this in the last downturn, where we went -- had a ratio of as high as 0.8. It got as high as 0.69 back in 2009 relative to the peak. And that would every subsequent year, obviously, that ratio starts going down as expenses start coming back. 
So this time around, definitely more incremental expenses are being taken out. So you would expect better flow through, to your point, as ADR starts coming back in a meaningful way. And the quicker the revenues come back, the better the flow-through will be because you would also be having the benefit of expenses not growing at inflation over multiple years. So the sooner revenues come back, the better flow to is going to be, the quicker you would have margin expansion. Hope that makes sense."

I'd like to start by expressing my heartfelt condolences to Arne's family and to our friends at Marriott. I have known Arne for 25 years and found him to be one of the most authentic, engaging and caring leaders in the lodging space. A visionary leader, a loving husband and father and a respected colleague and friend, Arne will be deeply missed and is leaving a lasting legacy within our industry and all the lives he has touched. 
Host has emerged from the most challenging year in lodging history as a stronger company with robust long-term growth prospects. Our hotels have streamlined their operating models and minimized operating expense growth from second quarter lows, while accelerating RevPAR from $9 in April to approximately $42 in January. As a result, we have cut our hotel-level operating loss by more than half from $163 million in the second quarter to $75 million in the fourth. We have also achieved breakeven or positive hotel-level operating profit at 20 hotels, representing 24% of our rooms in the fourth quarter, a sharp increase from 14 hotels and 13% of our rooms in the third quarter.
Additionally, we've invested in our long-term growth and enhanced our ability to gain and retain market share by continuing to upgrade several significant hotels and delivering the new AC Hotel Scottsdale North.
Moreover, we've entered 2021 with $2.5 billion of total available liquidity. Our investment-grade balance sheet has been further strengthened by opportunistic asset and land sales at pre-COVID-19 valuations and debt refinancing that has pushed our earliest maturity to late 2023. Last week, we announced a best-in-class second amendment to our credit agreement, which provides us greater flexibility to acquire hotels early in this new lodging cycle. With the highest quality portfolio in the company's history and a balance sheet that allows us to capitalize on external growth opportunities, we are very well positioned to elevate our EBITDA growth profile through the vaccine-driven recovery.
My comments today will focus on top line trends, ROI projects and our latest views on transaction markets and acquisition opportunities. Sourav will detail our hotel's operating expense control and the improvement in an outlook for cash burn and hotel EBITDA. He will also walk through the additional flexibility and optionality created by the second amendment to our credit agreement.
Starting with group booking trends. We saw a marked increase in group booking activity for our Marriott-managed hotels in January. Our hotels booked approximately 101,000 group room nights for 2021, a 32% increase over January of 2019, with January typically being a slow month for group booking activity.
In addition, our hotels had an impressive lead to booking conversion rate of 22% compared to approximately 16% in January 2019. While there are several types of groups being booked, we are pleased to see bookings for incentive meetings, which have returned after our hiatus in 2020.
We also saw improved future group booking activity in January, with approximately 73,000 future group room nights booked for beyond 2021, representing a 42% increase to January of 2019. Through this January, we had approximately 1.6 million definite room nights on the books for full year 2021. Approximately 1 million of these occur in the second half of the year and are fairly evenly split between the third and fourth quarters, where bookings are largely continuing to hold.
Should the groups materialize, our second half 2021 group business will have recovered to almost 50% of second half 2019 levels based on definite group room nights on the books. While group pace is less meaningful today, as most meeting planners remain on the sidelines, we are encouraged by our total group revenue pace for the latter half of 2021. Pace in the second half of 2021 is down only about 25% compared to the same time last year versus the first half being 84% lower than last year. This could improve with additional in-the-year for-the-year group booking activity, assuming state and local restrictions are relaxed and attendees become more comfortable with travel.
Staying with group, we believe that the location and quality of our hotels as well as our long-standing sales relationships with key travel managers, favorably positions them to gain market share when group demand returns to urban markets. For example, the demand from government agency groups surged around inauguration, our D.C. hotels ran occupancies of 81% and 78% on the day prior and the day of inauguration, respectively. And we temporarily reopened the Hyatt Regency Capitol Hill to capitalize on this demand. For those days, our hotels of occupancies were 13 and 11 percentage points higher than other luxury and upper upscale hotels in the D.C. metro region. Moreover, we achieved an ADR that on average was $26 higher each day for the 3 days of January 19, 20th and 21st. 
Our hotels significantly outperformed other luxury and upper upscale hotels due to their coveted downtown locations, ability to accommodate large groups and their 30-year relationships with key government agencies.
At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 118,000 definite room nights on the books for the fourth quarter, which would have represented a 7% sequential decline. However, our hotels were able to drive $38,000 in-the-quarter for-the-quarter bookings for a total of 156,000 group room nights in the fourth quarter, representing a 23% sequential increase over the third quarter.
Additionally, fourth quarter group bookings delivered a 12.3% higher average rate than third quarter 2020, helped by this short-term group demand that was driven by small- to mid-sized corporate accounts and SMERF groups. 
Rebookings as a percentage of cancellations continue to increase, with approximately 24% of cancellations at our Marriott-managed properties now rebooked and a funnel of tenanted bookings that would take the total rebook to almost 37%. In the fourth quarter and full year 2020, we collected approximately $11.5 million and $52 million of group attrition and cancellation fees, respectively, and expect to collect an additional $12 million to $14 million in full year 2021.
Moving on to leisure trends. Leisure demand remains concentrated in Sunbelt markets in key leisure destinations such as Hawaii as most city and metro destination remain in various stages of restrictions. As with group over the inauguration in D.C., we find that the location and quality of our resorts has enabled them to significantly gain market share. 
In the fourth quarter, our 16 resorts gained 17.8% RevPAR index share relative to their comp sets. This was driven by 8.1% better occupancy and 9% better rate compared to the RevPAR index scores in the fourth quarter of 2019. Moreover, we have gained 30% RevPAR index share in Phoenix, nearly 26% in the Florida Gulf Coast, 14.4% in Miami and nearly 12% in Maui, Oahu, as our hotels outperform their peers in capturing leisure demand.
Our most recent acquisition, the 1 Hotel South Beach, continues to be an outstanding performer despite the pandemic. The hotel achieved 90% occupancy at a nearly $2,000 rate on New Year's eve and has just finished President's Day weekend with occupancy averaging nearly 90% from Friday through Sunday with a blended ADR of approximately $1,430, which represents a nearly 4% year-over-year increase.
Encouragingly, leisure RevPAR performance continues to improve over holiday weekends. For example, at our Marriott-managed hotels, RevPAR improved by 60%, 3 weeks out from President's Day, compared to where those hotels were 3 weeks away from Columbus Day. In addition, we have observed the lengthening of the booking window in the Florida Gulf Coast, Miami and in Hawaii, where travelers are getting more comfortable with the testing requirements and process.
With upcoming leisure holidays over spring break and Easter, we expect leisure occupancy to continue to improve, driven by our Sunbelt markets and Hawaii. For the second half of the year, transient revenues at our 3 Maui hotels are pacing 11% higher compared to 2019, while total revenues are pacing almost 20% higher.
In the fourth quarter, we grew leisure room nights by 62,000 or by 13.6% over the third quarter. Our Sunbelt markets ran 31.6% occupancy in the first week of the quarter and progressed to 33.5% throughout the quarter, with growth driven by Miami, the Florida Gulf Coast, Phoenix and San Antonio.
Moreover, our loyalty redemption in the fourth quarter was 25% higher than the third quarter and represented the highest rewards demand since the start of the pandemic. Resort properties accounted for 65% of the growth in loyalty redemption room nights, driven by Phoenix, the Florida Gulf Coast, Hawaii and Orlando.
Moving on to business transient. Demand remains low but has improved by 13% sequentially in the fourth quarter, which was the strongest quarter since the pandemic-impacted travels. Cities that drove most of the increase over the third quarter were San Antonio, Houston and Philadelphia. As with group, business transient demand continues to be driven by smaller organizations rather than by large corporate accounts. This decision to remain on the sidelines is partly due to liability risk that we expect will fade as vaccine deployment accelerates.
Shifting to portfolio reinvestments, let me begin by saying that our ability to continue to invest in our portfolio is a competitive advantage that we expect will favorably position hosts to gain market share and deliver superior revenue and EBITDA growth through this lodging recovery. 3 to 5 points of weighted index growth at our renovated hotels in 2019 would have translated into roughly $38 million to $63 million of incremental revenues and $21 million to $34 million of incremental EBITDA on a stabilized annualized basis. In addition to this, we expect our ROI projects to materially enhance the underlying value of our real estate.
Last year, we completed extensive resort renovations and repositionings at the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and the Don CeSar in St. Pete Beach. Within the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, we plan on completing The Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island in March this year, following several notable completions such as The JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead among others in 2020 and The San Francisco Marriott Marquis, Santa Clara Marriott, New York Marriott Downtown and Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa in 2019.
We continue to invest in the Marriott Transformational Capital Program as well as in other ROI projects, which, on a combined basis, represent nearly 71% of our 2021 capital spend. Moreover, nearly 85% of our investment in the Marriott Program is expected to be complete by year-end 2021, and the entire program should be substantially completed by year-end 2022.
Having completed 7 of the Marriott Program renovations through year-end 2020, we expect to complete an additional 4 hotels in 2021, thereby transforming 11 of the 16 hotels that make up the program. We expect to benefit from $16 million of operating profit guarantees from Marriott in 2021 without experiencing commensurate revenue disruption, given the current low RevPAR environment.  
In addition, we expect to deliver 19 new 2-bedroom luxury villas at the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort in April this year. The 11 existing villas achieved a RevPAR of approximately $1,700 in 2019. And while they exhibit strong demand throughout the year in normal years, recent demand for villas has more than tripled from pre-pandemic levels. 
ADRs for these villas ran at almost $3,700 a night in December and at $2,400 a night in January. We already have 300 room nights on the books for the new villas with a transient rate of $1,990 a night, and the hotel has only just begun marketing them. Although the villa expansion wasn't part of our original underwriting when we acquired the hotel in 2018, we are currently exceeding our project underwriting assumptions for 2021 on both rate and occupancy.
We are excited to announce the repositioning and expansion at one of our top-performing hotels, The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, where we see an opportunity to create meaningful value while also transforming the resort to meet today's luxury standards. A new tower and reconfiguration within the existing hotel will increase the suite count at the Ritz from less than 8% of total inventory to almost 20% or 92 keys, while adding 24 keys overall. In 2019, the resort's 35 suites achieved RevPAR of approximately $800, almost double the overall RevPAR of the resort and are highly sought after by the hotel's loyal customer base. 
Additionally, an expanded club lounge will eliminate the size constraints on upsells, which generated an annualized ADR premium in excess of $220 in 2019. Business interruption estimates continue to be low due to the impact of COVID-19 on our occupancy, which also makes this an opportune time to renovate the guestrooms and to make ROI generating upgrades to the resorts pools, pool bar and restaurants. The project will commence in May 2021, and is expected to be complete in December 2022.
As stabilization in 2023, we expect this project to generate nearly $10.5 million of incremental annualized EBITDA, which represents a 12% cash-on-cash return on the incremental investment based on our underwriting.
Finally, on acquisitions, in the first weeks of 2021, we have seen a marked increase in the number of attractive hotels coming to market. From looking at just a handful of deals in the fourth quarter of 2020, we now have a solid pipeline of interesting and actionable opportunities to evaluate. In many instances, the hotels we are looking at are owned by private owners, who have been contemplating liquidity events for some time.
While we expect to face strong competition for acquisitions, we are very well positioned due to our deep relationships and our ability to move quickly, fund large equity investments with cash and provide tax advantage alternatives to sellers. This management team has a strong capital allocation track record, having acquired $1.6 billion of assets and sold $3.3 billion of assets at favorable multiples in 2018 and 2019.
The biggest shift in our acquisition strategy is our consideration of markets beyond the top 25. IBM Watson, our recently developed predictive analytics model, mines over 1 million discrete structured variables and leverages natural language processing insights from over 3 million unstructured data sources to forecast RevPAR growth by market. We use this proprietary top line predictive model in our research-based expectations for hotel operating expense growth by market to narrow down the markets that are likely to outperform the revenue and EBITDA growth profile of our existing footprint.
While we believe this is an opportune time to deploy capital as we are at the beginning of the lodging cycle and appear to be heading into a period of strong economic recovery, let me emphasize that we are not looking to acquire for acquisition sake. We are optimistic about finding opportunities that will truly elevate the EBITDA growth profile of our existing portfolio.
To conclude, we are very encouraged that vaccine deployment in the United States has gained momentum with over 55 million doses administered already and 1.7 million new doses being administered each day, according to CDC data. As The Washington Post recently reported, the United States has purchased enough supplies to vaccinate all American adults, making the vaccine-driven recovery more certain today than it has been since the pandemic began. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. may achieve herd immunity by the third or fourth quarter and that a transition to normalcy is possible as early as the second quarter of 2021, aided by the spring weather and the vaccination of the highest risk population. Should this scenario materialize, we expect to be able to achieve positive hotel EBITDA at some point in the second half of the year and to continue to benefit from a rebound in travel as the pandemic recedes.
With that, I will turn the call over to Sourav."
29574,701201149,2216967,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2021",2021-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Following the revenue-related green shoots Jim detailed on group bookings and transient demand, I would like to give you a better sense of how we expect property level expenses to trend relative to revenue this year",1265,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Following the revenue-related green shoots Jim detailed on group bookings and transient demand, I would like to give you a better sense of how we expect property level expenses to trend relative to revenue this year. 
Since the start of the pandemic, we have worked closely with our property managers to aggressively limit cost and evolve the operating model to adjust for the business environment. In the fourth quarter, excluding severance, property-level expenses were approximately 65% lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Including wage and benefit costs, variable expenses were roughly 82% lower year-over-year, broadly in line with RevPAR declines of 79.7%, while fixed expenses were approximately 47% lower. 
Variable expense reductions have consistently been in line with overall revenue declines through the down term. Fixed expenses that are somewhat associated with business volumes, such as maintenance, marketing and utility costs, saw a dramatic reduction in the second quarter and have slowly increased as business improved through the back half of the year. Brand programs and services, such as above-property sales offices and IT, have seen material reductions as our operators have restructured their shared services organization. 
Finally, costs below the gross operating profit line, which include passive and insurance and are traditionally completely fixed, saw modest reductions in the fourth quarter due to onetime credits such as operating profit guarantees associated with the Marriott Transformational Capital Program.
As a result of our property and brand management team's efforts to ensure that cost growth remains in line with slowly improving revenues, our quarterly expense reduction ratio, which measures the year-over-year decline in property-level expenses divided by the year-over-year decline in total revenues, was fairly stable at approximately 0.8 in the second, third and fourth quarters. This means that for every 1% decline in year-over-year total revenue, our hotels reduced year-over-year expenses by 0.8%.
The question now is, what does this ratio look like as revenues return in 2021? We have always expected to reach a plateau where the ratio deteriorates as services and standards returned to the middle of the revenue recovery. Although we still expect this to be the case because 2021 is a transition year, our hotels are striving to achieve an expense reduction ratio of between 0.65% and 0.7% throughout the year, as measured by property-level expense and total revenue declines relative to 2019.  
Moving on to hotel-level operating losses, we improved our quarter-over-quarter results by 23%, mainly by increasing revenues while keeping hotel expenses relatively stable. Most of the increase in expenses was associated with the 5 hotels that we reopened in the fourth quarter as well as greater business volumes overall. Our hotel-level operating loss averaged $25 million per month in the fourth quarter, down from approximately $32 million in the third quarter, including the $15 million and $23 million of employee retention credits our managers received in 2020 under the CARES Act and passed on to us in the fourth and third quarters, respectively.
Excluding these onetime credits, our monthly hotel-level operating losses in the fourth quarter averaged approximately $30 million and were better than the $40 million of hotel-level operating losses we outlined on our third quarter call, primarily due to revenues being approximately 35% higher on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter.
We expect first quarter hotel operations to be broadly commensurate with the fourth quarter of 2020, as further improvement in fundamentals may be offset by leisure demand being seasonally weaker in the first quarter than the fourth quarter, which benefited from strong ADRs and occupancies in the days leading up to and including New Year's eve. We, therefore, expect an average hotel level operating loss of approximately $30 million to $35 million a month, not including any onetime credits our hotel may receive in the first quarter. Adjusting for interest payments and corporate G&A, we expect monthly cash burn from operations to range between approximately $49 million to $54 million.
With regards to our outlook, it remains challenging to forecast precisely when we will achieve hotel-level EBITDA breakeven and profitability in the second half of 2021, as much depends on the success of vaccine administration and the continued easing of state and local restrictions. Following the first quarter, we expect a gradual sequential improvement in RevPAR. We anticipate this to be occupancy-driven in the second and third quarters when ADR may sequentially decline as suspended luxury and upper upscale hotels reopen.
Our research indicates that operations at approximately 13.5% of luxury and upper upscale hotels in our top 25 markets are currently suspended and likely to reopen at low occupancies during the second and third quarters of this year.
Turning to the 20 hotels that have achieved breakeven or positive hotel EBITDA in the fourth quarter, breakeven generally has been achieved in the 35% to 45% occupancy range with ADRs down in the approximately 15% to 30% range compared to 2019, which is in line with the estimates we first provided in April. Assuming the inclusion of corporate-level expenses for interest and corporate G&A, we would breakeven at occupancy levels of approximately 45% and 60% at the same ADR decline levels of 15% to 30%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. The second amendment to our credit agreement has increased our acquisition capacity to $2 billion using existing liquidity with a minimum liquidity requirement of $600 million. The capacity may include $500 million of proceeds from asset sales that would otherwise have been required to repay debt, as long as we use the proceeds to acquire assets that are unencumbered by debt. 
In addition, we have retained our ability to redeploy $750 million of asset sale proceeds into acquisition via the 1031 exchange process, while extending our leverage covenant relief period through the second quarter of 2022 and our leverage covenant easing period for the third quarter of '23. In doing so, we have created cushion for our internal recovery as well as capacity to accommodate external growth opportunities.
There are a couple of additional items I would like to bring to your attention. First, we recorded an income tax benefit of $220 million in 2020, due to the net operating incurred by our TRS. As a result of legislation enacted by the CARES Act, this net operating loss may be carried back up to 5 years in order to procure a refund of previously paid federal corporate income taxes. We anticipate that our TRS will incur a net operating loss in 2021, and that we will continue to report a corresponding tax benefit in the first quarter of 2021.
Second, we have included schedules with historical pro forma hotel metrics in our fourth quarter 2020 supplemental. The metrics include quarterly RevPAR, occupancy, ADR, revenues, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAre, going back 8 quarters to the first quarter of 2019, and we plan on updating this schedule quarterly.
To conclude, our focus and 3 strategic objectives continue to be to redefine the operating model, gain market share and strategically allocate capital. Over time, we expect to recover to 2019 levels of RevPAR with costs that may be $100 million to $150 million lower than they were in 2019 on a nominal basis with a portfolio that's gaining market share and outperforming its comp set. We are positioned to have robust revenue and EBITDA growth that we expect will be further augmented by external growth opportunities.
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question."

Smedes, happy to address your question. I think what has changed is the simple fact that a lot of owners of hotels, who were holding off bringing their properties to market, have now started as we have messaged today to see light at the end of the tunnel here.
I think that you can tell from our commentary and from our release that we feel confident that assuming the vaccine continues to be rolled out and there isn't any disruption due to new variants being found, which it doesn't appear to be today anyway, it's the beginning of a new cycle. And there are a lot of buyers who have sat on the sidelines to wait for the time when there might be more buyer interest, and we're starting to see that now. And the pipeline has truly meaningfully expanded between the fourth quarter and the early part of this year. 
So when I say there are actionable opportunities, these, in many instances, are private owners, who have wanted to monetize their investment for one reason or another, modestly along the lines of distress, there's not that much distress out there. But we are seeing owners who say, ""This is the time."" And this is the time to take these assets to market. I don't think that there is a lot of just price analysis occurring based on the conversations we're having, these are people who really want to sell their hotels. 
Now we are in a really unique position, given the fact that we have $2.5 billion of cash, and we have the ability to acquire up to $2 billion of assets out of existing liquidity subject to maintaining $600 million of liquidity inside the company. And that gives us the ability to go out and buy hotels on an all-cash basis without the need to obtain debt financing, which is a distinguishing factor for us. And we have very strong deep relationships, having been in this industry for over 30 years and a very solid reputation, the ability to move quickly and to get deals done. 
The other thing, I think, that is bringing people to market today is the fact that the debt markets are opening up. So we expect that there's going to be competition from private equity firms. There's no question about it, but we're happy to have that competition. I think that the print for the fourth quarter on what we've been able to accomplish on margins in a very challenging environment gives us a high degree of confidence that between our enterprise analytics group and our asset managers that we can find ways to create value even in the environment that we're in today. 
So we're confident, I don't know how many deals we're going to get done, but we do believe that we're at the beginning of the cycle. We came in 2020 in the best shape that the company has ever been in because, in large part, we believed going into '19 that we were heading into the end of the lodging cycle, and we were prudent in our capital allocation strategy. And I think it's going to pay off for us because it's giving us the opportunity to acquire hotels as the economy reopens and as the lodging cycle will begins new."

It does give us an opportunity to evaluate markets through predictive analytics, as I mentioned. I will say that it's one tool that we use. We are still substituting -- we would never substitute IBM Watson for our judgment on what we see happening in markets. And so it takes into account a lot of data. I mean we have always looked at structured data, and we continue to do that. IBM Watson looks at unstructured data. And yes, the world has changed, but I think that the unstructured data is out there, and we're very fortunate to have a tool like IBM Watson to capture that data.
Additionally, as we think about markets, we are looking at markets where we believe that we can acquire hotels that will allow us to grow EBITDA at a higher level than our existing portfolio of assets. So in addition to looking at top line, we will be studying in detail the expense profile of each hotel because it's critical that, yes, you have strong revenue management and you have the ability to sell your property, but it doesn't do you a lot of good if you don't have the flow through. 
So controlling expenses is absolutely critical to how we look at properties going forward. I will tell you that one of the reasons we're looking at markets outside the top 25 today is because we think that expense growth, at least for the near term, is likely to be higher in major urban markets as we come out of this, just given cost pressures that the urban markets are facing today. 
So further to answer your question, resorts, I think our resort story is incredible. If you look at the statistics, the RevPAR index shares we've been able to achieve on the 16 resort properties we have and if you look at specific resort markets like Miami, The Gulf Coast of Florida and Phoenician, we couldn't be more pleased with how our resorts have performed. So yes, they'll be at the top of the list.
But I would tell you, more importantly, it's going to be assets where there are multiple demand drivers. So we are going to continue to look for properties where there's a mix of business transient, leisure transient and group. We are strong believers in having diversity of demand and giving us the ability to pivot from one type of demand to the other, depending on market conditions."

The visitation to Maui is driven by domestic U.S. travel. It's really not driven by Asian travel. Asian travel is -- heads to Oahu and the big island, Hawaii predominantly, not on Maui.
So the ability that we have had on Maui to hold rate and to see rate pacing -- total revenue pace up 11% in the back half of 2021, I think, speaks loudly to the desirability of Maui and our resorts, in particular. So we actually figured out how to navigate the testing requirements and the other requirements that the State of Hawaii, had put in place and took a family vacation to Maui over Christmas. And even though occupancies were very low, ADRs were very high.
So I think that we are going to continue to see Maui and Hawaii travel increase, particularly as the vaccine gets rolled out. What's apparent to us is that there is incredible pent-up demand out there, particularly on the leisure side. And the amount of money that has been saved as a result of the various restrictions and lockdowns and the fact that people aren't going to the office and they're not commuting, they're not going out to lunch, people aren't going out to dinner is pretty incredible.
So we will continue to see Hawaii grow over time. And the other data point that is just very, very encouraging is what we're seeing with respect to villa bookings at the Andaz, the fact that we had a $3,700 ADR during the month of December for the villas and how we're getting incredible demand on our 19 new villas that aren't even complete. So we're bullish on Hawaii, and we think that leisure is going to really continue to carry today as we see business transient and group evolve."

So not surprisingly, the urban markets are still in various stages of restrictions. As an example, in California, you still have -- certainly in Los Angeles County, I don't know about San Francisco. But in LA County, indoor dining is still closed. So you have the ability to eat outside of a restaurant. Gyms are closed. Other amenities like hair salons, nail salons are open, but with 25% capacity.
New York, as an example, Broadway is closed. They've opened up indoor dining. So until we see services return to normal and we're hearing that Broadway could open up soon, but until we see services return to normal, I don't think you're going to see a lot of demand in the coastal markets.
Sourav, do you want to touch a little bit on BP trends?"

On the BP front, not as much demand as you would expect right now in the coastal urban markets. We are seeing some demand as it relates to consultants, so the Deloittes, PwCs of the world as well as some project teams that are certainly going to these markets as well, obviously, some government and government contract business as well. So at the end of the day, when you think about it, the offices really need to open up and the company need to get comfortable with their folks traveling on business. And when that does happen, that's when travel -- BP travel will really come back in a meaningful way. 
And as Jim mentioned, just given the cadence of the recovery that we are seeing with the vaccine administration across the U.S., that poses really well. And we are optimistic that recovery is going to occur sooner rather than later.
I would mention just one thing on the group front is we did do future bookings of about 73,000 room nights from 2022 and beyond. And the encouraging sign there is, 30% of that 73,000 room night was made up of Boston, New York and Seattle. So those are, again, obviously, urban markets, and that's an encouraging sign for the future."

But in particular, when we're talking about BT, we are of the opinion that we might see 50% to 60% of corporate travel returning by quarter 4 of this year. So that's an encouraging sign for us. 
The other encouraging sign is that most special corporate accounts have held rates flat in 2021 versus 2020. And if you recall, 2020 was flat to 2019. So that's a very encouraging sign that corporate accounts aren't pushing back on rate when they're negotiating. So there are a lot of green shoots out there. 
And again, not to keep talking about the vaccine, but it's all dependent on the country getting vaccinated and us achieving herd immunity and offices opening up and people getting back on the road."

And Sourav, I appreciate you kind of trying to put that into terms that I think we'll understand as analysts. I just want to sort of reframe it a little bit. I think what you said was you could expect for this year, something like $0.65 to $0.70 on the dollar of, like let's call it, revenue flowing through to the bottom line. So wanted just to clarify, am I thinking about that correctly? 
And then two, if I am, if we go back and look, I believe the flow-through rates, let's go back to like 2009, 2010, at least as an industry, they were decently lower than that. And I believe what happened was occupancy hasn't fully recovered yet. And so it took a little longer to hit those really high flow-throughs because, first, you're filling up. There's more variable expense attached to that. And then it's really the rate portion of the equation that drives the higher flow throughs. 
But is that going to be -- is that equation going to be a little different this go around and/or could you see higher flow-through as rate actually starts to come back as well? So just maybe help us break that down a little bit."

If you just take the Smith Travel numbers for 2021, they're estimating RevPAR down 56%. What we are saying with this expense ratio, and let's take the midpoint of what we're saying between the 0.65 and the 0.7, that's 0.675. If you take that 0.675 and multiply that by the 56%, all we are saying is that expenses would reduce by 37.8%. That's what we're saying is to the midpoint in 2021.
We have not seen this in the last downturn, where we went -- had a ratio of as high as 0.8. It got as high as 0.69 back in 2009 relative to the peak. And that would every subsequent year, obviously, that ratio starts going down as expenses start coming back. 
So this time around, definitely more incremental expenses are being taken out. So you would expect better flow through, to your point, as ADR starts coming back in a meaningful way. And the quicker the revenues come back, the better the flow-through will be because you would also be having the benefit of expenses not growing at inflation over multiple years. So the sooner revenues come back, the better flow to is going to be, the quicker you would have margin expansion. Hope that makes sense."

And we are very thoughtful about having conversations with respect to value to enhancements until our projects are permitted and are designed and are underwritten, and that is one of the reasons why we were really happy to share with you today in my comments what we're doing at our Ritz-Carlton, Naples. 
So the ability to truly create what we believe based on our underwriting is a 12% cash-on-cash return on that value enhancement opportunity in addition to really truly increasing the underlying value of that hotel through the repositioning of it, the addition of suites and the refresh of the guest rooms and the bathrooms in a luxury resort is very attractive to us. And we are working on a number of additional opportunities to either add rooms at properties where we think it makes sense to take excess parcel of land, where it makes sense and develop a select service hotel on it.
So the short answer is you'll be hearing a lot more from us over the course of time as we move through the entitlement process and as we complete our design, costing and underwriting. And it's -- we have a whole team in design and construction, who is on this. We're in a unique position as a company because we have an integrated workforce with design and construction, asset management, enterprise analytics, investments and the like within the company to do this sort of work.
So we're excited about it. It's a key focus for us. We think that many times, it's -- you're at a better place to invest in your own assets than you are to make acquisitions. That's not saying that now is not the time to make acquisitions. It is, but we're going to continue to invest in our properties as well."

And it's just -- it's all over the board today. So we're seeing certain assets that are going to trade at a discount to pre-COVID pricing, we're seeing assets that are going to trade at pre-COVID pricing. 
So cap rate is one metric that we're looking at, but we're also looking at how quickly we think we can stabilize the asset, what the EBITDA growth will be, what that EBITDA multiple is going to look like, what the discount to replacement cost is, supply demand factors in any given market. It's just a number of different things today. I mean there's not one way that you're going to underwrite a hotel in this environment.

Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieve key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. To begi",2399,"Thank you, Tejal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieve key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. To begin with, we significantly outperformed expectations for the first quarter, which recorded a GAAP net loss but delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre and hotel-level profitability for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. We grew first quarter total pro forma revenues by 50% sequentially. While holding hotel level operating expense growth to only 15% quarter-over-quarter as our operators successfully leveraged the existing resources to meet a stronger-than-expected demand surge in March. 
As a result, we delivered $21 million of positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter, a significant improvement from the negative $62 million recorded in the fourth quarter on a pro forma basis. In addition, we acquired the Hyatt Regency Austin, The Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort and nearly 300 acres of irreplaceable land adjacent to our Hyatt Regency in Maui, strategically investing approximately $800 million of capital at prices that are meaningfully below 2019 levels. Following these transactions, we have a substantial $1.5 billion of total available liquidity, including $131 million of FF&E reserves. Operations continued to improve, with April RevPAR expected to exceed March as the vaccine driven margin recovery gains momentum. Finally, in addition to executing substantial strategic investments, we continue to focus on redefining our hotel operating model and positioning our renovated properties to gain market share, key long-term strategic objectives that we believe will position us to achieve best-in-class EBITDA growth through the lodging cycle. Beginning with our latest acquisition, the iconic in irreplaceable Four Seasons Resort, Orlando and Walt Disney World Resort. We completed this off-market acquisition on April 30 for approximately $610 million, $40 million less than the price quoted by real estate alert. 
The 444 room resort is located on 289 acres within Disney World, which is one of the world's most visited destination resorts. For context, the Magic Kingdom at Disney World alone attracted nearly 21 million visitors in 2019 according to AECOM and Themed Entertainment Association data. The draw of this 1 theme park at Disney World is on par with the approximately 23 million visitors that Boston attracted in 2019 and close to the 24.2 million visitors Miami drew that year. The Four Seasons Resort Orlando is the only fee simple luxury resort within Disney world that's not owned by Disney. It provides complementary transport to Disney World's theme parks and is the only AAA 5 diamond rated hotel in Central Florida. Newly developed in 2014 and this iconic resort is a market leader with a 2019 RevPAR index of over 215. It is now hosts highest ranked property based on its 2019 RevPAR of $561 and total RevPAR of $923. 
Moreover, it ranks fifth highest in our portfolio based on its 2019 EBITDA per key of $81,500. As with all our strategic objectives, our capital allocation decisions are designed to grow our long-term EBITDA, and we expect this acquisition to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the existing portfolio. The Four Seasons Resort Orlando achieved 90% EBITDA growth from 2016 to 2019. The hotel was profitable in March and the first quarter, and we expect it to be profitable this year, with the latest property forecast indicating that the resort is likely to outperform our underwriting expectations for 2021. 
In general, the resort is well positioned to benefit from a surge in travel and leisure demand as the pandemic subsides and the 18-month celebration of Disney World's 50th anniversary begins in October. We believe these demand catalysts will help the Four Seasons Resort Orlando, surpassed its 2019 EBITDA performance sooner than the rest of our portfolio. 
Shifting to the Hyatt Regency [Austin], we opportunistically acquired this 448 room Sunbelt Market hotel on March 15 for $161 million. Acquired off-market at a 10% cap rate and an 8.8x multiple on 2019 EBITDA, the Hyatt Regency [ Austin's ] purchase price represents a 20% to 25% discount to estimated pre-COVID pricing and a 40% discount to replacement cost. The hotel was profitable in the first quarter of 2021 and is expected to outperform our underwriting expectations into the second quarter. Longer term, we expect the Hyatt Regency [ Austin ] to exceed its 2019 EBITDA on a stabilized basis. With profitability to be enhanced by complexion synergies, incremental expense reductions, productivity improvements and ROI investment opportunities. 
Turning to our strategic acquisition of nearly 300 acres of land adjacent to the Hyatt Regency Maui. We acquired the Royal Canapoly and Canapoly Kai Golf Courses for $28 million or approximately $95,000 an acre, which represented a discount to pre-COVID values. We are evaluating numerous long-term value-enhancing opportunities for this land, which also provides the near-term potential to generate synergies with the Hyatt Regency Maui. To conclude on acquisitions, we have successfully invested $800 million in the first 4 months of 2021 and at meaningful discounts to 2019 pricing levels. This is despite a highly competitive investments landscape with an abundance of capital seeking hotel deals. Our success is a testament to the depth of our industry relationships and the strength of our reputation, which is based on decades of best-in-class execution. 
We believe this is an opportune time to strategically grow our portfolio's exposure to markets with high expected growth into superior quality hotels. These early cycle investments have historically provided years of elevated EBITDA growth when time with a period of strong economic recovery. 
Turning to operations. Business volumes grew in each month of the first quarter with March achieving a RevPAR of $84.10, which was 115% higher than our December RevPAR of $39. Moreover, we outperformed the industry's luxury and upper upscale hotel RevPAR performance in our markets by over 2 points in March. Our leisure markets, such as Miami, Phoenix and Hawaii, as well as some urban markets, including Washington D.C., Northern Virginia, Atlanta and Philadelphia, outperformed the industry over the first quarter. Our hotel EBITDA turned positive in March. Allowing us to achieve $21 million of positive pro forma hotel EBITDA for the first quarter. First quarter revenues were primarily driven by strong leisure demand for our resorts and hotels in the Sunbelt markets and Hawaii as well as by special group business at several of our urban hotels. 
As vaccine deployment accelerated through the first quarter, occupancy in our Sunbelt markets and Hawaii rose from an average of 20% in the first week of January, to 57.4% in the last week of March. Compared to 2019, rate declines improved from negative 12.4% for the month of January, a negative 6.5% for March on a portfolio-wide basis. Strong leisure demand over spring break resulted in the portfolio achieving a 12.2% increase in transient rate over spring break 2019. 8 resorts located in Miami, the Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville, Phoenix and Maui, delivered almost 24% ADR growth over 2019 for the first quarter, with average occupancies of approximately 50%. 
Overall, our luxury hotels have increased their RevPAR index by 23.1% over 2019, with the increase in market share driven by occupancy gains. The 1 hotel South Beach and the Ritz-Carlton Naples were notable outperformers in the quarter, with occupancies ranging between 60% and 70% and transient ADR above $1,000. As mentioned last quarter, our hotels in Washington D.C. benefited from government agency group demand around inauguration, making D.C.  one of our highest-performing markets based on sequential RevPAR growth, other urban hotels also benefited from special group business, which included film production crews and sports groups, that collectively drove urban weekday occupancy 8.5 percentage points higher quarter-over-quarter. 
In addition, an uptick in leisure transient, business transient and contract demand, supported sequential RevPAR growth in multiple urban markets, including Chicago, Seattle, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. In terms of business mix, leisure drove 90% of our first quarter transient room nights. Our operators drove most of our leisure business through direct bookings with loyalty redemptions increasing 33% sequentially driven by our resort portfolio. The much talked about pent-up leisure demand is evidenced in current holiday travel trends, which reflect lengthening booking windows and progressively higher levels of demand. 
For instance, at our Marriott managed leisure market hotels, occupancy on the books improved by 8 percentage points, 9 weeks out from Memorial Day, compared to where those hotels were 9 weeks out from President's Day. Similarly, holiday travel trends for July 4 weekend are expected to progressively strengthen relative to Memorial Day. After which many of our hotels are likely to revert to pre pandemic cancellation policies for leisure bookings. We expect some of our Sunbelt markets, particularly in Florida and Phoenix, to hold occupancy while rates weaken over the summer. In Hawaii, our Maui resorts are demonstrating continued strength, with occupancy on the books ranging from the mid-80s to the low 90s for June and low to high 70s for July. Remarkably, June ADRs on the books in Maui are nearly 28% higher compared to June 2019, while July ADRs are approximately 50% higher than July 2019. 
Moreover, we have now completed the development of 19 new luxury 2-bedroom villas at the Andaz Maui. The villas already have 45% occupancy on the books at an ADR of $1,700 for the remainder of the year, and bookings continue to grow. 
Moving on to group. We achieved 264,000 group room nights in the first quarter, with 1 highlight being a corporate group of over 4,500 room nights at the Orlando World Center Marriott. The lead for this group came from last October's Connect 2020 conference held at that hotel, which demonstrated how a group event of over 1,000 in person attendees could be held safely. We currently have 1.5 million definite room nights on the books for full year 2021, with approximately 1 million of those in the second half of the year. Cancellations remain above 2019 trends, but continue to decline week over week. Encouragingly, our Marriott managed properties booked a total of approximately 144,000 new rooms across the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, with strong lead conversion rates compared to 2019. 
Group room nights currently on the books represent approximately 11% of total available rooms in the third quarter and 13% in the fourth quarter. Booking momentum was strong in the first quarter with nearly 165,000 and 154,000 new group room nights booked for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Importantly, our operators have continued to hold future group rates. Compared to 2019, ADR for definite rooms on the books is flat in 2022 and 1.5% higher in 2023. 
Turning to business transient. Demand continues to make steady progress, and first quarter bookings were 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by a steady month-over-month progression. Our hotels in San Francisco, San Jose accounted for approximately 30% of the sequential increase in room nights, while ADR rose 17% or $26 over last quarter due to increases from high-rated markets such as Miami, or the Gulf Coast and Phoenix. Most of the special corporate business in the quarter was driven by consulting, project business and government accounts. 
To conclude on operations, there were 76 hotels opened for the first quarter. We reopened Hyatt Regency Capital Hill on May 1 and expect to reopen the Westin Chicago River North and the ibis Rio De Janeiro later this month. By the end of May, we expect only the Sheraton Boston to remain under suspended operations. 
Reflecting on the last 12 months, which have been the most difficult in host history, I am proud of all that we have accomplished and excited by the clarity of our mission, which is to position the company to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth through the new lodging cycle. To achieve that goal, our 3 strategic objectives remain. To redefine our operating model with our managers to position our renovated hotels to gain market share and to allocate our capital strategically through acquisitions as well as through development projects. We have quantified the potential returns expected from these investments in the past. And I am going to put all the numbers together for you now. 
From redefining our operating model with our managers, we expect to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term cost savings based on 2019 revenues. From our goal of gaining 3 to 5 points of weighted index growth as the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels as well as 5 other hotels where major renovations have been recently completed or are underway. We expect to generate $21 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis. And finally, from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA on a stabilized annual basis. 
It typically takes renovation and development projects 2 to 3 years to stabilize. As these projects are at different stages of renovation and development, stabilization will occur over several years. As a reminder, our recently completed and ongoing development projects include: the ground-up development of the 165 key AC hotel Scottsdale North, 19 new luxury villas at the Andaz Maui, repositioning and expanding the Ritz-Carlton Naples and 60,000 square feet of additional meeting space as well as in Aquatics Park at the Orlando World Center Marriott, our acquisitions of the Four Seasons Resort Orlando and the Hyatt Regency Austin provide us a pro forma 2019 hotel EBITDA base of $1.547 billion. While it makes sense to think of 2019 as the base year, the timing of a return to 2019 levels of hotel EBITDA remains highly uncertain, particularly given the unprecedented pandemic driven nature of the downturn. The recovery is may span several years, and our portfolio is likely to continue to evolve over that time. However, our goal is for the initiatives and projects underlying our strategic objectives to add a potential $145 million to $220 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized basis. 
With the lodging industry's supply-demand fundamentals continuing to improve, we remain focused on long-term growth and on building a business that is stronger than it was in 2019. We are pleased with our execution to date and feel optimistic about our future as the pandemic receipts and travel continues to rebound. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav."

Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year. We achieved positive h",1254,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year. We achieved positive hotel EBITDA and positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter due to 3 main drivers: a stronger-than-expected increase in demand throughout the quarter, particularly in March, our manager's ability to sequentially increase average room rates by 18% and continued expense control at the property level. As Jim covered the first 2 drivers in his remarks, I will focus on the third. 
First quarter hotel level operating costs rose by only 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, despite an approximately 50% increase in total revenues over the same period. As demand suddenly surged in March, our operators didn't have the time to adjust staffing and other controllable costs from contingency levels implemented since the onset of the pandemic. As a result, March variable expenses declined by 70% on total revenue declines of only 62% compared to March 2019. Most of the resulting savings were due to cross utilizing hotel employees across various job functions. For the first quarter, variable expenses declined by 74% on total revenue declines of 70% compared to the first quarter of 2019. In future quarters, we expect staffing and other controllable costs to adjust to more normalized levels as demand continues to grow. 
Fixed expenses were 41% lower than the first quarter of 2019. This is a remarkable achievement considering that nearly 20% of the remaining fixed costs are below GOP and consists mainly of expenses such as property taxes and insurance, which don't change with business volumes. As part of our goal to redefine the operating model, both Hyatt and Marriott have restructured a number of above property shared service and allocated costs, which were historically completely fixed. 
Additionally, we have worked with the brands to achieve greater flexibility to opt-in to shared services on an as-needed basis, further reducing our fixed costs. Last quarter, we introduced the expense reduction ratio to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue over a comparable pro forma time period in 2019. The expense reduction ratio in the second through fourth quarters of 2020 was fairly stable at 0.8. That is, for every 10% decline in hotel revenue, hotel expenses declined 8%. In the first quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.84, much higher than the 0.65 to 0.7 that we expected on our last call for full year 2021. And the highest achieved at any point during the recovery. 
The outsized expense reduction ratio, combined with ADR being down only 9% to the first quarter of 2019, enabled our portfolio to achieve positive hotel level EBITDA at 26.6% occupancy, much better than our previously estimated breakeven range of 35% to 45% with ADRs down 15% to 30% compared to 2019. Positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter resulted in positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. 30 hotels representing 30% of total rooms within our portfolio, achieved breakeven or positive hotel EBITDA for the full first quarter. 38 hotels representing 42% of rooms, achieved positive hotel EBITDA in March. March saw additional hotels achieved positive EBITDA in Atlanta, our Texas markets San Diego and L.A. as well as Philadelphia and Hawaii. In fact, all 4 of our Hawaii hotels achieved breakeven of positive hotel EBITDA in March. As I just mentioned in the first quarter, revenue came back quicker than expenses, which did grow commensurately, particularly in March. Going forward, our operators are expected to increase staffing and controllable spending more in line with higher levels of demand. 
In addition, other departmental and support expenses, such as sales and marketing as well as maintenance and other support costs will lead to ramp up relative to the first quarter, while remaining well below 2019 levels. Therefore, on a full year basis, we continue to expect the expense reduction ratio to be closer to 0.7. 
Shifting to our top line outlook. While we are not providing guidance at this time, I would like to share how we are thinking about our top line trajectory for the rest of the year. We expect RevPAR to continue increasing sequentially throughout the year, but we expect growth to be driven by occupancy in the second and third quarters. We think rates could sequentially decline as we move out of peak season in some of our higher-rated leisure markets. Seasonality in tandem with a normal demand shift toward lower-rated markets could also lead to lower rates in the second and third quarters as we have seen historically. Additionally, rates could come under pressure as suspended hotels reopen in urban markets. 
Moving to business mix. We think business transient will continue to make slow and steady progress during the year. With the anticipated return to office late in the third quarter, driving a ramp-up in business transient demand after Labor Day. While we have benefited from nontraditional group demand during the pandemic, we expect traditional groups, corporate and associations to begin ramping up meaningfully in the fourth quarter following the expected return to office after Labor Day. 
Finally, we believe leisure will continue driving total RevPAR at our properties particularly through the summer. We expect our urban hotels to increasingly benefit from leisure demand growth as restrictions in those markets continue to lift and key demand drivers we open. As it relates to cash  burn for the quarter, our cash burn, excluding capital expenditures, which deducts corporate level expenses and interest payments decreased to $45 million or $138 million, including CapEx. These amounts are down meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by the strong first quarter operating performance. We maintained a strong liquidity position with $1.5 billion of cash, including $131 million of FF&E reserves after adjusting for the Four Seasons Disney Acquisition announced today. And we have no debt maturities until 2023. 
There is 1 accounting item I would like to bring to your attention. Neither we nor our operators expect any furlough accruals, employee retention credits or timing adjustments for these items moving forward as [ COBRA ] benefits provided in accordance with the American Rescue plan from April 1st to September 30, of 3 to the furlough associates of our operators and are fully reimbursable for our operators via a credit against their quarterly payroll tax liability. Therefore, there is ultimately no cost to the company for providing [ COBRA ] benefits and it will not have any P&L impact through the third quarter of this year. 
To conclude, we are very encouraged by the momentum of the lodging recovery, which has driven better-than-expected sequential revenue growth and resulted in positive first quarter hotel EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAre. We are seeing increased demand across all parts of our business, alongside strong rate integrity. We view an expected increase in expenses favorably, too, as that indicates business volumes are ramping back up to normal levels. Combining that with a strong balance sheet and a focus on our 3 strategic objectives: redefining the operating model, gaining market share at our renovated hotels and strategically allocating capital. We believe we are well positioned to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth that we expect will continue to be further augmented by external growth opportunities throughout this lodging cycle. 
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions. [Operator Instructions]"

We really like the trajectory that we're on at this point in time. So I will take the congratulations in a tough environment. 
With respect to acquisitions, I think we all agreed that, let's call it a year ago, we believe that there was going to be a lot of distress in the marketplace. And I would point to our Hyatt Regency Austin acquisition as an asset that was under distress. The ownership, the borrower in that deal was staring down a UCC foreclosure action that was going to occur at the beginning of April, as you know, we bought the hotel in mid-March or thereabouts. And saved that borrower and paid off all of the debt associated with the hotel and acquired a really good asset at a significant discount to pre-COVID evaluations. I think that a couple of things are happening now. There is a lot of equity in the marketplace, chasing deals. Good deals are going to price at close to where they would have priced in 2019. There's no question about it. Solid resorts like the Four Seasons Disney, which are truly iconic and irreplaceable assets. Are going to be fully fairly priced. 
I am not seeing generally a lot of distress in the marketplace today, particularly for the better quality assets. And we are not really seeing a lot of distress across the system right now. So I do think that there is a lot of capital out there. I think as you compete more in auction processes, pricing is going to going to be aggressive. However, we're coming out of the worst downturn that we've ever experienced in the lodging industry and the pandemic induced recession in the United States as well, we're turning the corner, and we are firm believers that for the right assets at this stage of the cycle, it's the time to acquire. It's a time to continue to shape the quality of the portfolio that we have. We were fortunate that coming into 2020 on a number of different metrics, the company had never been in better shape. We talk a lot about the balance sheet and the firepower that, that's given us to deploy $800 million of capital today. What we don't talk about a lot, but I think it's really important that investors understand it is our RevPAR metrics as of January 1, 2020, and our EBITDA per key performance as well as the fact that over the last several years, over the last 5 years, we have consistently tightened up margins year-over-year. 
We had margin improvement going forward. So we are just delighted with where we are. And we hope that we're going to have the opportunity to acquire additional assets early in this cycle so that we can ride the economic wave."

Does that change your expectation about whether you would use? I think you said you have $1.5 billion still remaining for acquisitions, whether you would actually be able to use that budget here in the next 12 months? And then just a little sort of side question. I'm curious with the Four Seasons Orlando, you talked about a lot of the acreage there. Is there opportunity to add anything there given it's special location, kind of the only thing not Disney owned, where you can kind of monetize that acreage? Or are there limits on what else you might be able to add to that acreage?"

With respect to deploying the remaining capital that we have, the cash that's on the balance sheet obviously, we have some restrictions in connection with our bank waiver agreement today. We're looking forward to the time whenever we're going to come out of that the waiver amendment as operations improve, we're hoping that's going to be sooner rather than later. It's very difficult to hypothetically answer the question of whether or not we're going to be investing additional capital because it's really transaction specific, and we are evaluating a number of opportunities now, we've evaluated a number of opportunities over the course of this year that we've let out because we didn't think they were the right fit for host for 1 reason or another. So we have teams that are back on the road. I'm back on the road looking at assets. We have people on the road today as we speak, looking at assets, and we're hopeful that we're going to be able to get some additional capital smartly deployed. 
With respect to the Four Seasons Orlando, the resort sits on roughly 289 acres. And the short answer is that on the acreage that we have today, we do not see a current opportunity to redevelop any of that property. It includes it's -- if you haven't seen this property, I encourage you to look on the website or better yet, go visit it because it is really a fantastic, truly iconic in every [placeable ] asset it has an 18 hole golf course, it has 444 rooms, 55,000 square feet of meeting space, a 13,000 square foot spa. It has a 5-acre water park and tennis courts and 6 food and beverage outlets. So while the 289-acre sounds like a lot of acreage, it is being fully utilized today in a very, very efficient and a very useful manner."

Just, Jim, if you could -- sorry, if you could put some color or maybe what you're underwriting for this year, in terms of group, I think in the first quarter, you were at about, I don't know, 20% or 25% of '19 levels for group. How do you see that shaping up maybe over the -- through '22? And more specifically, what are you underwriting for the fourth quarter of this year?

I'll start, and maybe I can pass Sourav chime in as well. For the second half of 2021 we have 1 million room nights on the books.

For the second half of 2021 we have 1 million room nights on the books. And we have, at our Marriott [ Lantage ] properties, we booked 144,000 new room nights this year for 2Q for the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year. Of those 144,000 new room nights, about 70% of those were for the second half of the year. So that 1 million room nights that we have on the books for the second half of 2021 equates to 50% of the room nights we had in 2019, same time in 2019. So the split between the bookings is really leaning fourth quarter a little bit, not a lot, call it, 54% in the fourth quarter. 
And the other thing I'd like to add is that we have a high degree of confidence that those groups are going to show up because our managers have just scrubbed all the bookings and to make certain that people aren't just hanging in there are going to cancel at some point in time. So it's not great, but it's good. The fact that 1 million room nights are still there and holding up is encouraging. As we look out to 2022, it is -- we have what about 2 million room nights on the books in 2022 Sourav, I think, something like that? And it is very dependent at this point in time on when restrictions are going to be lifted in key markets. To just put some back around it, some of the markets in Chicago, I think, just announced yesterday, when they're going to reopen. California is expecting to fully reopen on June 15, Boston, August 1, New York, July 1. And I think that as markets reopen, that's the first thing that has to happen. But more importantly, what has to happen for the business transient traveler to return. And the -- in groups to start booking into next year in a more meaningful way is we have to continue to get the pace of vaccines out there, get to herd immunity in the country and very importantly, get our children back-to-school. And I think that we're hopeful that, that's all going to happen comes to September. I don't know, Sourav, do you have anything you want to add on this point?"

Let me start by saying that this is the type of hotel that we have a lot of experience with and that we have in the past, delivered a lot of value to our shareholders through our asset management and enterprise analytics capabilities. As we look at this property out of the box is profitable as we speak. And we're optimistic that the performance of the asset is going to exceed our underwriting expectations for 2021, for sure, the way it's going. There are a lot of things Sourav and I will kind of tag team this a little bit in a moment. But as we look at what's happening in Disney and in the country, we're very optimistic that we're going to see strong performance of this hotel going forward. We believe that this property is in a position to perform better from an EBITDA growth profile than the rest of our portfolio and to recover to 2019 levels of EBITDA and beyond sooner than the rest of our portfolio does. Additionally, and I'll let Sourav put some color on this, we feel that the asset has multiple asset management opportunities to advance margin and operational improvement. 
One other point I'd like to make is that October 1 this year is the 50th anniversary of Disney World of the Magic Kingdom and Disney is planning an 18-month celebration, starting October 1. So we expect that we're going to see incredible demand flowing to this hotel. One of the things that we looked at is the performance of ultra luxury assets. And if you look at ultra luxury assets over the last 20 years from 1990 to 2019. And those are defined as hotels with a RevPAR of $500 or greater. The CAGR was 6.2%. And if you look at the top 25 markets over that time frame, the CAGR was 3.2%. So we think that there is incredible demand out there for this. The resort is becoming a destination onto itself, not only a destination for people who want to stay at Disney, but a vacation destination given the amenities that are on property. I've heard from some people that they take their family to stay at the Four Seasons and the kids only want to go to Magic Kingdom. So all good stuff as we see it going forward. 
And I'll let Sourav talk a little bit about some of the things we're looking at."

So a lot will be -- a lot of focus on total RevPAR and driving ancillary income. We will also work -- and the Four Seasons actually has a very experienced management team, work with them to identify any operating model opportunities as we have successfully again done across our luxury resorts and implement them as soon as possible.

So it was completed in November of last year as opposed to a year later, plus or minus. 
We see opportunities going forward, subject to zoning and doing a additional development in Maui takes time. There's a long process, but that we have experience with that, given what we were able to do at the [ ANDAs ] with the addition of our Villa units. And there are opportunities on that land to add rooms to the existing hotel to build another hotel to build a select serve hotel. As we think about it, and use the petition as the Blue -- Play bulk and Blueprint, where we took 27 holes of golf and shrunk it to 18 holes those are things that we're going to think about going forward in Maui."

It is 3 to 5 points of yield index growth relative to where the asset was performing pre renovation. And the assets that we're talking about are not only the 16 Marriott transformational capital program assets but other assets where we invested ROI money such as the doses are and what we're going to be doing at the Ritz and Naples and other hotels across the portfolio. 
Where does it come from? It's tough to say, Chris. We think that in the middle of the pandemic, the 1 asset that we can point to that has really captured a lot of incremental market share is the Coronado Island, Resort & Spa in San Diego. I think the yield index gain for well over 9 points at that hotel. So it's going to be case by case, and I don't want to promise anything, but as we are putting money in our hotels and renovating our properties and repositioning them, we're going to have a distinct advantage as business gets back to normal. And I personally believe that we should be able to achieved more than 3 to 5 points of yield index growth because we're going to be competing with hotels that haven't been renovated that are going to have to be renovated going forward. And there's going to be incremental disruption associated with those renovations. When they do occur, and it's going to have to happen or we're just going to be competing with a tired property. So we are very fortunate to have had the ability to continue to invest in our assets over the course of 2020, and we're doing the same thing this year going forward."

We never thought that we would be profitable in the first quarter. We had 30 hotels that were profitable for the entire quarter. And I don't know that we talked about this before, but we had 38 hotels 42% of our rooms that were profitable for the month of March. So do we think that we're going to continue to see this outsized performance? I think for a -- for the near term, the answer is yes. And when I say near term, we're talking about another year or so because there's so much pent-up demand out there is so much money in savings. There is $6 trillion that individuals have in their bank accounts today, they want to spend it. For sure, they want experiences. They're happy to get on the airplane and go. One of the other interesting data points that we look at is air capacity. 
And surprisingly, for Maui, our 3 resorts, I gave you some numbers on how they're trending for June and July, which I don't think anybody would have believed that sitting here a year ago, that we'd be seeing 80% to 90% occupancy at an ADR up 28% and our 3 resorts on Maui. It's the only market in the country the only air mark in the country being Maui, that has more capacity right now than it did in 2019. Air capacity from Maui is up 4%. So for the near term, I think you're going to see incredible pent-up demand, [indiscernible] travel, we are seeing it. That's going to continue. But is it sustainable over the next 3 to 5 years. It's hard to say, but I doubt it. At that point in time, we are really going to be able to compress rates as we have group business and business transient business back in the hotels."

Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieve key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. To be",2395,"Thank you, Tejal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieve key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. 
To begin with, we significantly outperformed expectations for the first quarter, which recorded a GAAP net loss but delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre and hotel-level profitability for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. We grew first quarter total pro forma revenues by 50% sequentially. 
While holding hotel level operating expense growth to only 15% quarter-over-quarter as our operators successfully leveraged the existing resources to meet a stronger-than-expected demand surge in March. 
As a result, we delivered $21 million of positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter, a significant improvement from the negative $62 million recorded in the fourth quarter on a pro forma basis. In addition, we acquired the Hyatt Regency Austin, The Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort and nearly 300 acres of irreplaceable land adjacent to our Hyatt Regency in Maui, strategically investing approximately $800 million of capital at prices that are meaningfully below 2019 levels. Following these transactions, we have a substantial $1.5 billion of total available liquidity, including $131 million of FF&E reserves. 
Operations continued to improve, with April RevPAR expected to exceed March as the vaccine driven margin recovery gains momentum. Finally, in addition to executing substantial strategic investments, we continue to focus on redefining our hotel operating model and positioning our renovated properties to gain market share, key long-term strategic objectives that we believe will position us to achieve best-in-class EBITDA growth through the lodging cycle. 
Beginning with our latest acquisition, the iconic in irreplaceable Four Seasons Resort, Orlando and Walt Disney World Resort. We completed this off-market acquisition on April 30 for approximately $610 million, $40 million less than the price quoted by real estate alert. 
The 444 room resort is located on 289 acres within Disney World, which is one of the world's most visited destination resorts. For context, the Magic Kingdom at Disney World alone attracted nearly 21 million visitors in 2019 according to AECOM and Themed Entertainment Association data. 
The draw of this 1 theme park at Disney World is on par with the approximately 23 million visitors that Boston attracted in 2019 and close to the 24.2 million visitors Miami drew that year. 
The Four Seasons Resort Orlando is the only fee simple luxury resort within Disney world that's not owned by Disney. It provides complementary transport to Disney World's theme parks and is the only AAA 5 diamond rated hotel in Central Florida. 
Newly developed in 2014 and this iconic resort is a market leader with a 2019 RevPAR index of over 215. It is now hosts highest ranked property based on its 2019 RevPAR of $561 and total RevPAR of $923. Moreover, it ranks fifth highest in our portfolio based on its 2019 EBITDA per key of $81,500. 
As with all our strategic objectives, our capital allocation decisions are designed to grow our long-term EBITDA, and we expect this acquisition to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the existing portfolio. The Four Seasons Resort Orlando achieved 90% EBITDA growth from 2016 to 2019. The hotel was profitable in March and the first quarter, and we expect it to be profitable this year, with the latest property forecast indicating that the resort is likely to outperform our underwriting expectations for 2021. 
In general, the resort is well positioned to benefit from a surge in travel and leisure demand as the pandemic subsides and the 18-month celebration of Disney World's 50th anniversary begins in October. We believe these demand catalysts will help the Four Seasons Resort Orlando, surpassed its 2019 EBITDA performance sooner than the rest of our portfolio. 
Shifting to the Hyatt Regency Austin, we opportunistically acquired this 448 room Sunbelt Market hotel on March 15 for $161 million. Acquired off-market at a 10% cap rate and an 8.8x multiple on 2019 EBITDA, the Hyatt Regency Austin's purchase price represents a 20% to 25% discount to estimated pre-COVID pricing and a 40% discount to replacement cost. The hotel was profitable in the first quarter of 2021 and is expected to outperform our underwriting expectations into the second quarter. 
Longer term, we expect the Hyatt Regency Austin to exceed its 2019 EBITDA on a stabilized basis. With profitability to be enhanced by complexion synergies, incremental expense reductions, productivity improvements and ROI investment opportunities. 
Turning to our strategic acquisition of nearly 300 acres of land adjacent to the Hyatt Regency Maui. We acquired the Royal Canapoly and Canapoly Kai Golf Courses for $28 million or approximately $95,000 an acre, which represented a discount to pre-COVID values. 
We are evaluating numerous long-term value-enhancing opportunities for this land, which also provides the near-term potential to generate synergies with the Hyatt Regency Maui. 
To conclude on acquisitions, we have successfully invested $800 million in the first 4 months of 2021 and at meaningful discounts to 2019 pricing levels. This is despite a highly competitive investments landscape with an abundance of capital seeking hotel deals. 
Our success is a testament to the depth of our industry relationships and the strength of our reputation, which is based on decades of best-in-class execution. 
We believe this is an opportune time to strategically grow our portfolio's exposure to markets with high expected growth into superior quality hotels. These early cycle investments have historically provided years of elevated EBITDA growth when time with a period of strong economic recovery. 
Turning to operations. Business volumes grew in each month of the first quarter with March achieving a RevPAR of $84.10, which was 115% higher than our December RevPAR of $39. Moreover, we outperformed the industry's luxury and upper upscale hotel RevPAR performance in our markets by over 2 points in March. 
Our leisure markets, such as Miami, Phoenix and Hawaii, as well as some urban markets, including Washington D.C., Northern Virginia, Atlanta and Philadelphia, outperformed the industry over the first quarter. Our hotel EBITDA turned positive in March. Allowing us to achieve $21 million of positive pro forma hotel EBITDA for the first quarter. 
First quarter revenues were primarily driven by strong leisure demand for our resorts and hotels in the Sunbelt markets and Hawaii as well as by special group business at several of our urban hotels. 
As vaccine deployment accelerated through the first quarter, occupancy in our Sunbelt markets and Hawaii rose from an average of 20% in the first week of January, to 57.4% in the last week of March. Compared to 2019, rate declines improved from negative 12.4% for the month of January, a negative 6.5% for March on a portfolio-wide basis. Strong leisure demand over spring break resulted in the portfolio achieving a 12.2% increase in transient rate over spring break 2019. 8 resorts located in Miami, the Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville, Phoenix and Maui, delivered almost 24% ADR growth over 2019 for the first quarter, with average occupancies of approximately 50%. 
Overall, our luxury hotels have increased their RevPAR index by 23.1% over 2019, with the increase in market share driven by occupancy gains. The 1 hotel South Beach and the Ritz-Carlton Naples were notable outperformers in the quarter, with occupancies ranging between 60% and 70% and transient ADR above $1,000. 
As mentioned last quarter, our hotels in Washington D.C. benefited from government agency group demand around inauguration, making D.C. one of our highest-performing markets based on sequential RevPAR growth, other urban hotels also benefited from special group business, which included film production crews and sports groups, that collectively drove urban weekday occupancy 8.5 percentage points higher quarter-over-quarter. 
In addition, an uptick in leisure transient, business transient and contract demand, supported sequential RevPAR growth in multiple urban markets, including Chicago, Seattle, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. In terms of business mix, leisure drove 90% of our first quarter transient room nights. 
Our operators drove most of our leisure business through direct bookings with loyalty redemptions increasing 33% sequentially driven by our resort portfolio. The much talked about pent-up leisure demand is evidenced in current holiday travel trends, which reflect lengthening booking windows and progressively higher levels of demand. 
For instance, at our Marriott managed leisure market hotels, occupancy on the books improved by 8 percentage points, 9 weeks out from Memorial Day, compared to where those hotels were 9 weeks out from President's Day. 
Similarly, holiday travel trends for July 4 weekend are expected to progressively strengthen relative to Memorial Day. After which many of our hotels are likely to revert to pre pandemic cancellation policies for leisure bookings. 
We expect some of our Sunbelt markets, particularly in Florida and Phoenix, to hold occupancy while rates weaken over the summer. In Hawaii, our Maui resorts are demonstrating continued strength, with occupancy on the books ranging from the mid-80s to the low 90s for June and low to high 70s for July. Remarkably, June ADRs on the books in Maui are nearly 28% higher compared to June 2019, while July ADRs are approximately 50% higher than July 2019. 
Moreover, we have now completed the development of 19 new luxury 2-bedroom villas at the Andaz Maui. The villas already have 45% occupancy on the books at an ADR of $1,700 for the remainder of the year, and bookings continue to grow. 
Moving on to group. We achieved 264,000 group room nights in the first quarter, with 1 highlight being a corporate group of over 4,500 room nights at the Orlando World Center Marriott. The lead for this group came from last October's Connect 2020 conference held at that hotel, which demonstrated how a group event of over 1,000 in person attendees could be held safely. 
We currently have 1.5 million definite room nights on the books for full year 2021, with approximately 1 million of those in the second half of the year. Cancellations remain above 2019 trends, but continue to decline week over week. 
Encouragingly, our Marriott managed properties booked a total of approximately 144,000 new rooms across the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, with strong lead conversion rates compared to 2019. 
Group room nights currently on the books represent approximately 11% of total available rooms in the third quarter and 13% in the fourth quarter. Booking momentum was strong in the first quarter with nearly 165,000 and 154,000 new group room nights booked for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Importantly, our operators have continued to hold future group rates. Compared to 2019, ADR for definite rooms on the books is flat in 2022 and 1.5% higher in 2023. 
Turning to business transient. Demand continues to make steady progress, and first quarter bookings were 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by a steady month-over-month progression. 
Our hotels in San Francisco, San Jose accounted for approximately 30% of the sequential increase in room nights, while ADR rose 17% or $26 over last quarter due to increases from high-rated markets such as Miami, or the Gulf Coast and Phoenix. Most of the special corporate business in the quarter was driven by consulting, project business and government accounts. 
To conclude on operations, there were 76 hotels opened for the first quarter. We reopened Hyatt Regency Capital Hill on May 1 and expect to reopen the Westin Chicago River North and the ibis Rio De Janeiro later this month. By the end of May, we expect only the Sheraton Boston to remain under suspended operations. 
Reflecting on the last 12 months, which have been the most difficult in host history, I am proud of all that we have accomplished and excited by the clarity of our mission, which is to position the company to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth through the new lodging cycle. To achieve that goal, our 3 strategic objectives remain. 
To redefine our operating model with our managers to position our renovated hotels to gain market share and to allocate our capital strategically through acquisitions as well as through development projects. We have quantified the potential returns expected from these investments in the past. And I am going to put all the numbers together for you now. 
From redefining our operating model with our managers, we expect to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term cost savings based on 2019 revenues. From our goal of gaining 3 to 5 points of weighted index growth as the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels as well as 5 other hotels where major renovations have been recently completed or are underway. We expect to generate $21 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis. And finally, from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA on a stabilized annual basis. 
It typically takes renovation and development projects 2 to 3 years to stabilize. As these projects are at different stages of renovation and development, stabilization will occur over several years. 
As a reminder, our recently completed and ongoing development projects include: the ground-up development of the 165 key AC hotel Scottsdale North, 19 new luxury villas at the Andaz Maui, repositioning and expanding the Ritz-Carlton Naples and 60,000 square feet of additional meeting space as well as in Aquatics Park at the Orlando World Center Marriott, our acquisitions of the Four Seasons Resort Orlando and the Hyatt Regency Austin provide us a pro forma 2019 hotel EBITDA base of $1.547 billion. 
While it makes sense to think of 2019 as the base year, the timing of a return to 2019 levels of hotel EBITDA remains highly uncertain, particularly given the unprecedented pandemic driven nature of the downturn. The recovery is may span several years, and our portfolio is likely to continue to evolve over that time. 
However, our goal is for the initiatives and projects underlying our strategic objectives to add a potential $145 million to $220 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized basis. 
With the lodging industry's supply-demand fundamentals continuing to improve, we remain focused on long-term growth and on building a business that is stronger than it was in 2019. We are pleased with our execution to date and feel optimistic about our future as the pandemic receipts and travel continues to rebound. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav."

Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year.We achieved positive",1269,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year.
We achieved positive hotel EBITDA and positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter due to 3 main drivers: a stronger-than-expected increase in demand throughout the quarter, particularly in March, our manager's ability to sequentially increase average room rates by 18% and continued expense control at the property level. As Jim covered the first 2 drivers in his remarks, I will focus on the third. 
First quarter hotel level operating costs rose by only 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, despite an approximately 50% increase in total revenues over the same period. As demand suddenly surged in March, our operators didn't have the time to adjust staffing and other controllable costs from contingency levels implemented since the onset of the pandemic. 
As a result, March variable expenses declined by 70% on total revenue declines of only 62% compared to March 2019. Most of the resulting savings were due to cross utilizing hotel employees across various job functions. 
For the first quarter, variable expenses declined by 74% on total revenue declines of 70% compared to the first quarter of 2019. In future quarters, we expect staffing and other controllable costs to adjust to more normalized levels as demand continues to grow. 
Fixed expenses were 41% lower than the first quarter of 2019. This is a remarkable achievement considering that nearly 20% of the remaining fixed costs are below GOP and consists mainly of expenses such as property taxes and insurance, which don't change with business volumes. 
As part of our goal to redefine the operating model, both Hyatt and Marriott have restructured a number of above property shared service and allocated costs, which were historically completely fixed. 
Additionally, we have worked with the brands to achieve greater flexibility to opt-in to shared services on an as-needed basis, further reducing our fixed costs. Last quarter, we introduced the expense reduction ratio to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue over a comparable pro forma time period in 2019. 
The expense reduction ratio in the second through fourth quarters of 2020 was fairly stable at 0.8. That is, for every 10% decline in hotel revenue, hotel expenses declined 8%. In the first quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.84, much higher than the 0.65 to 0.7 that we expected on our last call for full year 2021. And the highest achieved at any point during the recovery. 
The outsized expense reduction ratio, combined with ADR being down only 9% to the first quarter of 2019, enabled our portfolio to achieve positive hotel level EBITDA at 26.6% occupancy, much better than our previously estimated breakeven range of 35% to 45% with ADRs down 15% to 30% compared to 2019. 
Positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter resulted in positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. 30 hotels representing 30% of total rooms within our portfolio, achieved breakeven or positive hotel EBITDA for the full first quarter. 38 hotels representing 42% of rooms, achieved positive hotel EBITDA in March. March saw additional hotels achieved positive EBITDA in Atlanta, our Texas markets San Diego and L.A. as well as Philadelphia and Hawaii. 
In fact, all 4 of our Hawaii hotels achieved breakeven of positive hotel EBITDA in March. As I just mentioned in the first quarter, revenue came back quicker than expenses, which did grow commensurately, particularly in March. Going forward, our operators are expected to increase staffing and controllable spending more in line with higher levels of demand. 
In addition, other departmental and support expenses, such as sales and marketing as well as maintenance and other support costs will lead to ramp up relative to the first quarter, while remaining well below 2019 levels. Therefore, on a full year basis, we continue to expect the expense reduction ratio to be closer to 0.7. 
Shifting to our top line outlook. While we are not providing guidance at this time, I would like to share how we are thinking about our top line trajectory for the rest of the year. We expect RevPAR to continue increasing sequentially throughout the year, but we expect growth to be driven by occupancy in the second and third quarters. 
We think rates could sequentially decline as we move out of peak season in some of our higher-rated leisure markets. Seasonality in tandem with a normal demand shift toward lower-rated markets could also lead to lower rates in the second and third quarters as we have seen historically. Additionally, rates could come under pressure as suspended hotels reopen in urban markets. 
Moving to business mix. We think business transient will continue to make slow and steady progress during the year. With the anticipated return to office late in the third quarter, driving a ramp-up in business transient demand after Labor Day. 
While we have benefited from nontraditional group demand during the pandemic, we expect traditional groups, corporate and associations to begin ramping up meaningfully in the fourth quarter following the expected return to office after Labor Day. 
Finally, we believe leisure will continue driving total RevPAR at our properties particularly through the summer. We expect our urban hotels to increasingly benefit from leisure demand growth as restrictions in those markets continue to lift and key demand drivers we open. 
As it relates to cash burn for the quarter, our cash burn, excluding capital expenditures, which deducts corporate level expenses and interest payments decreased to $45 million or $138 million, including CapEx. These amounts are down meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by the strong first quarter operating performance. We maintained a strong liquidity position with $1.5 billion of cash, including $131 million of FF&E reserves after adjusting for the Four Seasons Disney Acquisition announced today. And we have no debt maturities until 2023. 
There is 1 accounting item I would like to bring to your attention. Neither we nor our operators expect any furlough accruals, employee retention credits or timing adjustments for these items moving forward as COBRA benefits provided in accordance with the American Rescue plan from April 1st to September 30, of 3 to the furlough associates of our operators and are fully reimbursable for our operators via a credit against their quarterly payroll tax liability. 
Therefore, there is ultimately no cost to the company for providing COBRA benefits and it will not have any P&L impact through the third quarter of this year. 
To conclude, we are very encouraged by the momentum of the lodging recovery, which has driven better-than-expected sequential revenue growth and resulted in positive first quarter hotel EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAre. We are seeing increased demand across all parts of our business, alongside strong rate integrity. We view an expected increase in expenses favorably, too, as that indicates business volumes are ramping back up to normal levels. Combining that with a strong balance sheet and a focus on our 3 strategic objectives: redefining the operating model, gaining market share at our renovated hotels and strategically allocating capital. 
We believe we are well positioned to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth that we expect will continue to be further augmented by external growth opportunities throughout this lodging cycle. 
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question."

And it seems like that bid-ask spread has narrowed dramatically. And it's not the seller that's moving down. Is that the right way to think about what's going on with the transaction market? Is it -- the buyers have gotten much more aggressive, maybe much more confident in the outlook?"

We really like the trajectory that we're on at this point in time. So I will take the congratulations in a tough environment. 
With respect to acquisitions, I think we all agreed that, let's call it a year ago, we believe that there was going to be a lot of distress in the marketplace. And I would point to our Hyatt Regency Austin acquisition as an asset that was under distress. 
The ownership, the borrower in that deal was staring down a UCC foreclosure action that was going to occur at the beginning of April, as you know, we bought the hotel in mid-March or thereabouts. And saved that borrower and paid off all of the debt associated with the hotel and acquired a really good asset at a significant discount to pre-COVID evaluations. 
I think that a couple of things are happening now. There is a lot of equity in the marketplace, chasing deals. Good deals are going to price at close to where they would have priced in 2019. There's no question about it. Solid resorts like the Four Seasons Disney, which are truly iconic and irreplaceable assets. Are going to be fully fairly priced. 
I am not seeing generally a lot of distress in the marketplace today, particularly for the better quality assets. And we are not really seeing a lot of distress across the system right now. So I do think that there is a lot of capital out there. 
I think as you compete more in auction processes, pricing is going to going to be aggressive. However, we're coming out of the worst downturn that we've ever experienced in the lodging industry and the pandemic induced recession in the United States as well, we're turning the corner, and we are firm believers that for the right assets at this stage of the cycle, it's the time to acquire. It's a time to continue to shape the quality of the portfolio that we have. 
We were fortunate that coming into 2020 on a number of different metrics, the company had never been in better shape. We talk a lot about the balance sheet and the firepower that, that's given us to deploy $800 million of capital today. 
What we don't talk about a lot, but I think it's really important that investors understand it is our RevPAR metrics as of January 1, 2020, and our EBITDA per key performance as well as the fact that over the last several years, over the last 5 years, we have consistently tightened up margins year-over-year. 
We had margin improvement going forward. So we are just delighted with where we are. And we hope that we're going to have the opportunity to acquire additional assets early in this cycle so that we can ride the economic wave."

Does that change your expectation about whether you would use? I think you said you have $1.5 billion still remaining for acquisitions, whether you would actually be able to use that budget here in the next 12 months? And then just a little sort of side question. 
I'm curious with the Four Seasons Orlando, you talked about a lot of the acreage there. Is there opportunity to add anything there given it's special location, kind of the only thing not Disney owned, where you can kind of monetize that acreage? Or are there limits on what else you might be able to add to that acreage?"

With respect to deploying the remaining capital that we have, the cash that's on the balance sheet obviously, we have some restrictions in connection with our bank waiver agreement today. 
We're looking forward to the time whenever we're going to come out of that the waiver amendment as operations improve, we're hoping that's going to be sooner rather than later. It's very difficult to hypothetically answer the question of whether or not we're going to be investing additional capital because it's really transaction specific, and we are evaluating a number of opportunities now, we've evaluated a number of opportunities over the course of this year that we've let out because we didn't think they were the right fit for host for 1 reason or another. 
So we have teams that are back on the road. I'm back on the road looking at assets. We have people on the road today as we speak, looking at assets, and we're hopeful that we're going to be able to get some additional capital smartly deployed. 
With respect to the Four Seasons Orlando, the resort sits on roughly 289 acres. And the short answer is that on the acreage that we have today, we do not see a current opportunity to redevelop any of that property. It includes it's -- if you haven't seen this property, I encourage you to look on the website or better yet, go visit it because it is really a fantastic, truly iconic and irreplaceable asset. It has an 18 hole golf course, it has 444 rooms, 55,000 square feet of meeting space, a 13,000 square foot spa, it has a 5-acre water park and tennis courts and 6 food and beverage outlets. 
So while the 289-acre sounds like a lot of acreage, it is being fully utilized today in a very, very efficient and a very useful manner."

Just, Jim, if you could -- sorry, if you could put some color or maybe what you're underwriting for this year, in terms of group, I think in the first quarter, you were at about, I don't know, 20% or 25% of '19 levels for group. 
How do you see that shaping up maybe over the -- through '22? And more specifically, what are you underwriting for the fourth quarter of this year?

And we have, at our Marriott managed properties, we booked 144,000 new room nights this year for 2Q for the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year. 
Of those 144,000 new room nights, about 70% of those were for the second half of the year. So that 1 million room nights that we have on the books for the second half of 2021 equates to 50% of the room nights we had in 2019, same time in 2019. So the split between the bookings is really leaning fourth quarter a little bit, not a lot, call it, 54% in the fourth quarter. 
And the other thing I'd like to add is that we have a high degree of confidence that those groups are going to show up because our managers have just scrubbed all the bookings and to make certain that people aren't just hanging in there are going to cancel at some point in time. So it's not great, but it's good. 
The fact that 1 million room nights are still there and holding up is encouraging. As we look out to 2022, it is -- we have what about 2 million room nights on the books in 2022 Sourav, I think, something like that? And it is very dependent at this point in time on when restrictions are going to be lifted in key markets. 
To just put some back around it, some of the markets in Chicago, I think, just announced yesterday, when they're going to reopen. California is expecting to fully reopen on June 15, Boston, August 1, New York, July 1. 
And I think that as markets reopen, that's the first thing that has to happen. But more importantly, what has to happen for the business transient traveler to return. And the -- in groups to start booking into next year in a more meaningful way is we have to continue to get the pace of vaccines out there, get to herd immunity in the country and very importantly, get our children back-to-school.
And I think that we're hopeful that, that's all going to happen comes to September. I don't know, Sourav, do you have anything you want to add on this point?"

Let me start by saying that this is the type of hotel that we have a lot of experience with and that we have in the past, delivered a lot of value to our shareholders through our asset management and enterprise analytics capabilities. 
As we look at this property out of the box is profitable as we speak. And we're optimistic that the performance of the asset is going to exceed our underwriting expectations for 2021, for sure, the way it's going. There are a lot of things Sourav and I will kind of tag team this a little bit in a moment. But as we look at what's happening in Disney and in the country, we're very optimistic that we're going to see strong performance of this hotel going forward. 
We believe that this property is in a position to perform better from an EBITDA growth profile than the rest of our portfolio and to recover to 2019 levels of EBITDA and beyond sooner than the rest of our portfolio does. 
Additionally, and I'll let Sourav put some color on this, we feel that the asset has multiple asset management opportunities to advance margin and operational improvement. 
One other point I'd like to make is that October 1 this year is the 50th anniversary of Disney World of the Magic Kingdom and Disney is planning an 18-month celebration, starting October 1. So we expect that we're going to see incredible demand flowing to this hotel. 
One of the things that we looked at is the performance of ultra luxury assets. And if you look at ultra luxury assets over the last 20 years from 1990 to 2019. And those are defined as hotels with a RevPAR of $500 or greater. The CAGR was 6.2%. And if you look at the top 25 markets over that time frame, the CAGR was 3.2%. 
So we think that there is incredible demand out there for this. The resort is becoming a destination onto itself, not only a destination for people who want to stay at Disney, but a vacation destination given the amenities that are on property. I've heard from some people that they take their family to stay at the Four Seasons and the kids only want to go to Magic Kingdom. So all good stuff as we see it going forward. 
And I'll let Sourav talk a little bit about some of the things we're looking at."

We've obviously done a lot with our existing luxury resorts in Florida as well as across our portfolio. Additionally, given that this is a resort and it has a ton of ancillary income as well, it's going to be all about maximizing total RevPAR, which we have again successfully done in implementing it, whether it's the 1 South Beach one of our recent acquisitions or it's Naples in Florida as well. 
So a lot will be -- a lot of focus on total RevPAR and driving ancillary income. We will also work -- and the Four Seasons actually has a very experienced management team, work with them to identify any operating model opportunities as we have successfully again done across our luxury resorts and implement them as soon as possible. 
So we look forward to working with the team. The other piece is, obviously, we're evaluating multiple ROI opportunities, particularly as it relates to food and beverage. Which we are excited to move forward on as well."

So it was completed in November of last year as opposed to a year later, plus or minus. 
We see opportunities going forward, subject to zoning and doing a additional development in Maui takes time. There's a long process, but that we have experience with that, given what we were able to do at the Andaz with the addition of our Villa units. 
And there are opportunities on that land to add rooms to the existing hotel to build another hotel to build a select serve hotel. As we think about it, and use the petition as the Blue -- Play bulk and Blueprint, where we took 27 holes of golf and shrunk it to 18 holes those are things that we're going to think about going forward in Maui."

It is 3 to 5 points of yield index growth relative to where the asset was performing pre renovation. And the assets that we're talking about are not only the 16 Marriott transformational capital program assets but other assets where we invested ROI money such as the doses are and what we're going to be doing at the Ritz and Naples and other hotels across the portfolio. 
Where does it come from? It's tough to say, Chris. We think that in the middle of the pandemic, the 1 asset that we can point to that has really captured a lot of incremental market share is the Coronado Island, Resort & Spa in San Diego. 
I think the yield index gain for well over 9 points at that hotel. So it's going to be case by case, and I don't want to promise anything, but as we are putting money in our hotels and renovating our properties and repositioning them, we're going to have a distinct advantage as business gets back to normal. 
And I personally believe that we should be able to achieved more than 3 to 5 points of yield index growth because we're going to be competing with hotels that haven't been renovated that are going to have to be renovated going forward. And there's going to be incremental disruption associated with those renovations. 
When they do occur, and it's going to have to happen or we're just going to be competing with a tired property. So we are very fortunate to have had the ability to continue to invest in our assets over the course of 2020, and we're doing the same thing this year going forward."

I don't know that it's going to be sustainable, Aryeh. I think that this year, was a unique point in time with businesses closed and people working from home and people being in a position where they can work from anywhere as children get back into schools and as offices open, I think we're going to see a return of business transient traveler and return of group business, and we are just very fortunate that our resort portfolio and our assets in the Sunbelt have carried us through in a material way. 
We never thought that we would be profitable in the first quarter. We had 30 hotels that were profitable for the entire quarter. And I don't know that we talked about this before, but we had 38 hotels 42% of our rooms that were profitable for the month of March. 
So do we think that we're going to continue to see this outsized performance? I think for a -- for the near term, the answer is yes. And when I say near term, we're talking about another year or so because there's so much pent-up demand out there is so much money in savings. 
There is $6 trillion that individuals have in their bank accounts today, they want to spend it. For sure, they want experiences. They're happy to get on the airplane and go. One of the other interesting data points that we look at is air capacity. 
And surprisingly, for Maui, our 3 resorts, I gave you some numbers on how they're trending for June and July, which I don't think anybody would have believed that sitting here a year ago, that we'd be seeing 80% to 90% occupancy at an ADR up 28% and our 3 resorts on Maui. 
It's the only market in the country the only air mark in the country being Maui, that has more capacity right now than it did in 2019. Air capacity from Maui is up 4%. So for the near term, I think you're going to see incredible pent-up demand, replenished travel, we are seeing it. That's going to continue. 
But is it sustainable over the next 3 to 5 years? It's hard to say, but I doubt it. At that point in time, we are really going to be able to compress rates as we have group business and business transient business back in the hotels."

Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieve key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. To be",2395,"Thank you, Tejal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieve key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. 
To begin with, we significantly outperformed expectations for the first quarter, which recorded a GAAP net loss but delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre and hotel-level profitability for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. We grew first quarter total pro forma revenues by 50% sequentially. 
While holding hotel level operating expense growth to only 15% quarter-over-quarter as our operators successfully leveraged the existing resources to meet a stronger-than-expected demand surge in March. 
As a result, we delivered $21 million of positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter, a significant improvement from the negative $62 million recorded in the fourth quarter on a pro forma basis. In addition, we acquired the Hyatt Regency Austin, The Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort and nearly 300 acres of irreplaceable land adjacent to our Hyatt Regency in Maui, strategically investing approximately $800 million of capital at prices that are meaningfully below 2019 levels. Following these transactions, we have a substantial $1.5 billion of total available liquidity, including $131 million of FF&E reserves. 
Operations continued to improve, with April RevPAR expected to exceed March as the vaccine driven margin recovery gains momentum. Finally, in addition to executing substantial strategic investments, we continue to focus on redefining our hotel operating model and positioning our renovated properties to gain market share, key long-term strategic objectives that we believe will position us to achieve best-in-class EBITDA growth through the lodging cycle. 
Beginning with our latest acquisition, the iconic in irreplaceable Four Seasons Resort, Orlando and Walt Disney World Resort. We completed this off-market acquisition on April 30 for approximately $610 million, $40 million less than the price quoted by real estate alert. 
The 444 room resort is located on 289 acres within Disney World, which is one of the world's most visited destination resorts. For context, the Magic Kingdom at Disney World alone attracted nearly 21 million visitors in 2019 according to AECOM and Themed Entertainment Association data. 
The draw of this 1 theme park at Disney World is on par with the approximately 23 million visitors that Boston attracted in 2019 and close to the 24.2 million visitors Miami drew that year. 
The Four Seasons Resort Orlando is the only fee simple luxury resort within Disney world that's not owned by Disney. It provides complementary transport to Disney World's theme parks and is the only AAA 5 diamond rated hotel in Central Florida. 
Newly developed in 2014 and this iconic resort is a market leader with a 2019 RevPAR index of over 215. It is now hosts highest ranked property based on its 2019 RevPAR of $561 and total RevPAR of $923. Moreover, it ranks fifth highest in our portfolio based on its 2019 EBITDA per key of $81,500. 
As with all our strategic objectives, our capital allocation decisions are designed to grow our long-term EBITDA, and we expect this acquisition to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the existing portfolio. The Four Seasons Resort Orlando achieved 90% EBITDA growth from 2016 to 2019. The hotel was profitable in March and the first quarter, and we expect it to be profitable this year, with the latest property forecast indicating that the resort is likely to outperform our underwriting expectations for 2021. 
In general, the resort is well positioned to benefit from a surge in travel and leisure demand as the pandemic subsides and the 18-month celebration of Disney World's 50th anniversary begins in October. We believe these demand catalysts will help the Four Seasons Resort Orlando, surpassed its 2019 EBITDA performance sooner than the rest of our portfolio. 
Shifting to the Hyatt Regency Austin, we opportunistically acquired this 448 room Sunbelt Market hotel on March 15 for $161 million. Acquired off-market at a 10% cap rate and an 8.8x multiple on 2019 EBITDA, the Hyatt Regency Austin's purchase price represents a 20% to 25% discount to estimated pre-COVID pricing and a 40% discount to replacement cost. The hotel was profitable in the first quarter of 2021 and is expected to outperform our underwriting expectations into the second quarter. 
Longer term, we expect the Hyatt Regency Austin to exceed its 2019 EBITDA on a stabilized basis. With profitability to be enhanced by complexion synergies, incremental expense reductions, productivity improvements and ROI investment opportunities. 
Turning to our strategic acquisition of nearly 300 acres of land adjacent to the Hyatt Regency Maui. We acquired the Royal Canapoly and Canapoly Kai Golf Courses for $28 million or approximately $95,000 an acre, which represented a discount to pre-COVID values. 
We are evaluating numerous long-term value-enhancing opportunities for this land, which also provides the near-term potential to generate synergies with the Hyatt Regency Maui. 
To conclude on acquisitions, we have successfully invested $800 million in the first 4 months of 2021 and at meaningful discounts to 2019 pricing levels. This is despite a highly competitive investments landscape with an abundance of capital seeking hotel deals. 
Our success is a testament to the depth of our industry relationships and the strength of our reputation, which is based on decades of best-in-class execution. 
We believe this is an opportune time to strategically grow our portfolio's exposure to markets with high expected growth into superior quality hotels. These early cycle investments have historically provided years of elevated EBITDA growth when time with a period of strong economic recovery. 
Turning to operations. Business volumes grew in each month of the first quarter with March achieving a RevPAR of $84.10, which was 115% higher than our December RevPAR of $39. Moreover, we outperformed the industry's luxury and upper upscale hotel RevPAR performance in our markets by over 2 points in March. 
Our leisure markets, such as Miami, Phoenix and Hawaii, as well as some urban markets, including Washington D.C., Northern Virginia, Atlanta and Philadelphia, outperformed the industry over the first quarter. Our hotel EBITDA turned positive in March. Allowing us to achieve $21 million of positive pro forma hotel EBITDA for the first quarter. 
First quarter revenues were primarily driven by strong leisure demand for our resorts and hotels in the Sunbelt markets and Hawaii as well as by special group business at several of our urban hotels. 
As vaccine deployment accelerated through the first quarter, occupancy in our Sunbelt markets and Hawaii rose from an average of 20% in the first week of January, to 57.4% in the last week of March. Compared to 2019, rate declines improved from negative 12.4% for the month of January, a negative 6.5% for March on a portfolio-wide basis. Strong leisure demand over spring break resulted in the portfolio achieving a 12.2% increase in transient rate over spring break 2019. 8 resorts located in Miami, the Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville, Phoenix and Maui, delivered almost 24% ADR growth over 2019 for the first quarter, with average occupancies of approximately 50%. 
Overall, our luxury hotels have increased their RevPAR index by 23.1% over 2019, with the increase in market share driven by occupancy gains. The 1 hotel South Beach and the Ritz-Carlton Naples were notable outperformers in the quarter, with occupancies ranging between 60% and 70% and transient ADR above $1,000. 
As mentioned last quarter, our hotels in Washington D.C. benefited from government agency group demand around inauguration, making D.C. one of our highest-performing markets based on sequential RevPAR growth, other urban hotels also benefited from special group business, which included film production crews and sports groups, that collectively drove urban weekday occupancy 8.5 percentage points higher quarter-over-quarter. 
In addition, an uptick in leisure transient, business transient and contract demand, supported sequential RevPAR growth in multiple urban markets, including Chicago, Seattle, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. In terms of business mix, leisure drove 90% of our first quarter transient room nights. 
Our operators drove most of our leisure business through direct bookings with loyalty redemptions increasing 33% sequentially driven by our resort portfolio. The much talked about pent-up leisure demand is evidenced in current holiday travel trends, which reflect lengthening booking windows and progressively higher levels of demand. 
For instance, at our Marriott managed leisure market hotels, occupancy on the books improved by 8 percentage points, 9 weeks out from Memorial Day, compared to where those hotels were 9 weeks out from President's Day. 
Similarly, holiday travel trends for July 4 weekend are expected to progressively strengthen relative to Memorial Day. After which many of our hotels are likely to revert to pre pandemic cancellation policies for leisure bookings. 
We expect some of our Sunbelt markets, particularly in Florida and Phoenix, to hold occupancy while rates weaken over the summer. In Hawaii, our Maui resorts are demonstrating continued strength, with occupancy on the books ranging from the mid-80s to the low 90s for June and low to high 70s for July. Remarkably, June ADRs on the books in Maui are nearly 28% higher compared to June 2019, while July ADRs are approximately 50% higher than July 2019. 
Moreover, we have now completed the development of 19 new luxury 2-bedroom villas at the Andaz Maui. The villas already have 45% occupancy on the books at an ADR of $1,700 for the remainder of the year, and bookings continue to grow. 
Moving on to group. We achieved 264,000 group room nights in the first quarter, with 1 highlight being a corporate group of over 4,500 room nights at the Orlando World Center Marriott. The lead for this group came from last October's Connect 2020 conference held at that hotel, which demonstrated how a group event of over 1,000 in person attendees could be held safely. 
We currently have 1.5 million definite room nights on the books for full year 2021, with approximately 1 million of those in the second half of the year. Cancellations remain above 2019 trends, but continue to decline week over week. 
Encouragingly, our Marriott managed properties booked a total of approximately 144,000 new rooms across the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, with strong lead conversion rates compared to 2019. 
Group room nights currently on the books represent approximately 11% of total available rooms in the third quarter and 13% in the fourth quarter. Booking momentum was strong in the first quarter with nearly 165,000 and 154,000 new group room nights booked for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Importantly, our operators have continued to hold future group rates. Compared to 2019, ADR for definite rooms on the books is flat in 2022 and 1.5% higher in 2023. 
Turning to business transient. Demand continues to make steady progress, and first quarter bookings were 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by a steady month-over-month progression. 
Our hotels in San Francisco, San Jose accounted for approximately 30% of the sequential increase in room nights, while ADR rose 17% or $26 over last quarter due to increases from high-rated markets such as Miami, or the Gulf Coast and Phoenix. Most of the special corporate business in the quarter was driven by consulting, project business and government accounts. 
To conclude on operations, there were 76 hotels opened for the first quarter. We reopened Hyatt Regency Capital Hill on May 1 and expect to reopen the Westin Chicago River North and the ibis Rio De Janeiro later this month. By the end of May, we expect only the Sheraton Boston to remain under suspended operations. 
Reflecting on the last 12 months, which have been the most difficult in host history, I am proud of all that we have accomplished and excited by the clarity of our mission, which is to position the company to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth through the new lodging cycle. To achieve that goal, our 3 strategic objectives remain. 
To redefine our operating model with our managers to position our renovated hotels to gain market share and to allocate our capital strategically through acquisitions as well as through development projects. We have quantified the potential returns expected from these investments in the past. And I am going to put all the numbers together for you now. 
From redefining our operating model with our managers, we expect to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term cost savings based on 2019 revenues. From our goal of gaining 3 to 5 points of weighted index growth as the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels as well as 5 other hotels where major renovations have been recently completed or are underway. We expect to generate $21 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis. And finally, from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA on a stabilized annual basis. 
It typically takes renovation and development projects 2 to 3 years to stabilize. As these projects are at different stages of renovation and development, stabilization will occur over several years. 
As a reminder, our recently completed and ongoing development projects include: the ground-up development of the 165 key AC hotel Scottsdale North, 19 new luxury villas at the Andaz Maui, repositioning and expanding the Ritz-Carlton Naples and 60,000 square feet of additional meeting space as well as in Aquatics Park at the Orlando World Center Marriott, our acquisitions of the Four Seasons Resort Orlando and the Hyatt Regency Austin provide us a pro forma 2019 hotel EBITDA base of $1.547 billion. 
While it makes sense to think of 2019 as the base year, the timing of a return to 2019 levels of hotel EBITDA remains highly uncertain, particularly given the unprecedented pandemic driven nature of the downturn. The recovery is may span several years, and our portfolio is likely to continue to evolve over that time. 
However, our goal is for the initiatives and projects underlying our strategic objectives to add a potential $145 million to $220 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized basis. 
With the lodging industry's supply-demand fundamentals continuing to improve, we remain focused on long-term growth and on building a business that is stronger than it was in 2019. We are pleased with our execution to date and feel optimistic about our future as the pandemic receipts and travel continues to rebound. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav."

Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year.We achieved positive",1269,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year.
We achieved positive hotel EBITDA and positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter due to 3 main drivers: a stronger-than-expected increase in demand throughout the quarter, particularly in March, our manager's ability to sequentially increase average room rates by 18% and continued expense control at the property level. As Jim covered the first 2 drivers in his remarks, I will focus on the third. 
First quarter hotel level operating costs rose by only 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, despite an approximately 50% increase in total revenues over the same period. As demand suddenly surged in March, our operators didn't have the time to adjust staffing and other controllable costs from contingency levels implemented since the onset of the pandemic. 
As a result, March variable expenses declined by 70% on total revenue declines of only 62% compared to March 2019. Most of the resulting savings were due to cross utilizing hotel employees across various job functions. 
For the first quarter, variable expenses declined by 74% on total revenue declines of 70% compared to the first quarter of 2019. In future quarters, we expect staffing and other controllable costs to adjust to more normalized levels as demand continues to grow. 
Fixed expenses were 41% lower than the first quarter of 2019. This is a remarkable achievement considering that nearly 20% of the remaining fixed costs are below GOP and consists mainly of expenses such as property taxes and insurance, which don't change with business volumes. 
As part of our goal to redefine the operating model, both Hyatt and Marriott have restructured a number of above property shared service and allocated costs, which were historically completely fixed. 
Additionally, we have worked with the brands to achieve greater flexibility to opt-in to shared services on an as-needed basis, further reducing our fixed costs. Last quarter, we introduced the expense reduction ratio to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue over a comparable pro forma time period in 2019. 
The expense reduction ratio in the second through fourth quarters of 2020 was fairly stable at 0.8. That is, for every 10% decline in hotel revenue, hotel expenses declined 8%. In the first quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.84, much higher than the 0.65 to 0.7 that we expected on our last call for full year 2021. And the highest achieved at any point during the recovery. 
The outsized expense reduction ratio, combined with ADR being down only 9% to the first quarter of 2019, enabled our portfolio to achieve positive hotel level EBITDA at 26.6% occupancy, much better than our previously estimated breakeven range of 35% to 45% with ADRs down 15% to 30% compared to 2019. 
Positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter resulted in positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. 30 hotels representing 30% of total rooms within our portfolio, achieved breakeven or positive hotel EBITDA for the full first quarter. 38 hotels representing 42% of rooms, achieved positive hotel EBITDA in March. March saw additional hotels achieved positive EBITDA in Atlanta, our Texas markets San Diego and L.A. as well as Philadelphia and Hawaii. 
In fact, all 4 of our Hawaii hotels achieved breakeven of positive hotel EBITDA in March. As I just mentioned in the first quarter, revenue came back quicker than expenses, which did grow commensurately, particularly in March. Going forward, our operators are expected to increase staffing and controllable spending more in line with higher levels of demand. 
In addition, other departmental and support expenses, such as sales and marketing as well as maintenance and other support costs will lead to ramp up relative to the first quarter, while remaining well below 2019 levels. Therefore, on a full year basis, we continue to expect the expense reduction ratio to be closer to 0.7. 
Shifting to our top line outlook. While we are not providing guidance at this time, I would like to share how we are thinking about our top line trajectory for the rest of the year. We expect RevPAR to continue increasing sequentially throughout the year, but we expect growth to be driven by occupancy in the second and third quarters. 
We think rates could sequentially decline as we move out of peak season in some of our higher-rated leisure markets. Seasonality in tandem with a normal demand shift toward lower-rated markets could also lead to lower rates in the second and third quarters as we have seen historically. Additionally, rates could come under pressure as suspended hotels reopen in urban markets. 
Moving to business mix. We think business transient will continue to make slow and steady progress during the year. With the anticipated return to office late in the third quarter, driving a ramp-up in business transient demand after Labor Day. 
While we have benefited from nontraditional group demand during the pandemic, we expect traditional groups, corporate and associations to begin ramping up meaningfully in the fourth quarter following the expected return to office after Labor Day. 
Finally, we believe leisure will continue driving total RevPAR at our properties particularly through the summer. We expect our urban hotels to increasingly benefit from leisure demand growth as restrictions in those markets continue to lift and key demand drivers we open. 
As it relates to cash burn for the quarter, our cash burn, excluding capital expenditures, which deducts corporate level expenses and interest payments decreased to $45 million or $138 million, including CapEx. These amounts are down meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by the strong first quarter operating performance. We maintained a strong liquidity position with $1.5 billion of cash, including $131 million of FF&E reserves after adjusting for the Four Seasons Disney Acquisition announced today. And we have no debt maturities until 2023. 
There is 1 accounting item I would like to bring to your attention. Neither we nor our operators expect any furlough accruals, employee retention credits or timing adjustments for these items moving forward as COBRA benefits provided in accordance with the American Rescue plan from April 1st to September 30, of 3 to the furlough associates of our operators and are fully reimbursable for our operators via a credit against their quarterly payroll tax liability. 
Therefore, there is ultimately no cost to the company for providing COBRA benefits and it will not have any P&L impact through the third quarter of this year. 
To conclude, we are very encouraged by the momentum of the lodging recovery, which has driven better-than-expected sequential revenue growth and resulted in positive first quarter hotel EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAre. We are seeing increased demand across all parts of our business, alongside strong rate integrity. We view an expected increase in expenses favorably, too, as that indicates business volumes are ramping back up to normal levels. Combining that with a strong balance sheet and a focus on our 3 strategic objectives: redefining the operating model, gaining market share at our renovated hotels and strategically allocating capital. 
We believe we are well positioned to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth that we expect will continue to be further augmented by external growth opportunities throughout this lodging cycle. 
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question."

And it seems like that bid-ask spread has narrowed dramatically. And it's not the seller that's moving down. Is that the right way to think about what's going on with the transaction market? Is it -- the buyers have gotten much more aggressive, maybe much more confident in the outlook?"

We really like the trajectory that we're on at this point in time. So I will take the congratulations in a tough environment. 
With respect to acquisitions, I think we all agreed that, let's call it a year ago, we believe that there was going to be a lot of distress in the marketplace. And I would point to our Hyatt Regency Austin acquisition as an asset that was under distress. 
The ownership, the borrower in that deal was staring down a UCC foreclosure action that was going to occur at the beginning of April, as you know, we bought the hotel in mid-March or thereabouts. And saved that borrower and paid off all of the debt associated with the hotel and acquired a really good asset at a significant discount to pre-COVID evaluations. 
I think that a couple of things are happening now. There is a lot of equity in the marketplace, chasing deals. Good deals are going to price at close to where they would have priced in 2019. There's no question about it. Solid resorts like the Four Seasons Disney, which are truly iconic and irreplaceable assets. Are going to be fully fairly priced. 
I am not seeing generally a lot of distress in the marketplace today, particularly for the better quality assets. And we are not really seeing a lot of distress across the system right now. So I do think that there is a lot of capital out there. 
I think as you compete more in auction processes, pricing is going to going to be aggressive. However, we're coming out of the worst downturn that we've ever experienced in the lodging industry and the pandemic induced recession in the United States as well, we're turning the corner, and we are firm believers that for the right assets at this stage of the cycle, it's the time to acquire. It's a time to continue to shape the quality of the portfolio that we have. 
We were fortunate that coming into 2020 on a number of different metrics, the company had never been in better shape. We talk a lot about the balance sheet and the firepower that, that's given us to deploy $800 million of capital today. 
What we don't talk about a lot, but I think it's really important that investors understand it is our RevPAR metrics as of January 1, 2020, and our EBITDA per key performance as well as the fact that over the last several years, over the last 5 years, we have consistently tightened up margins year-over-year. 
We had margin improvement going forward. So we are just delighted with where we are. And we hope that we're going to have the opportunity to acquire additional assets early in this cycle so that we can ride the economic wave."

Does that change your expectation about whether you would use? I think you said you have $1.5 billion still remaining for acquisitions, whether you would actually be able to use that budget here in the next 12 months? And then just a little sort of side question. 
I'm curious with the Four Seasons Orlando, you talked about a lot of the acreage there. Is there opportunity to add anything there given it's special location, kind of the only thing not Disney owned, where you can kind of monetize that acreage? Or are there limits on what else you might be able to add to that acreage?"

With respect to deploying the remaining capital that we have, the cash that's on the balance sheet obviously, we have some restrictions in connection with our bank waiver agreement today. 
We're looking forward to the time whenever we're going to come out of that the waiver amendment as operations improve, we're hoping that's going to be sooner rather than later. It's very difficult to hypothetically answer the question of whether or not we're going to be investing additional capital because it's really transaction specific, and we are evaluating a number of opportunities now, we've evaluated a number of opportunities over the course of this year that we've let out because we didn't think they were the right fit for host for 1 reason or another. 
So we have teams that are back on the road. I'm back on the road looking at assets. We have people on the road today as we speak, looking at assets, and we're hopeful that we're going to be able to get some additional capital smartly deployed. 
With respect to the Four Seasons Orlando, the resort sits on roughly 289 acres. And the short answer is that on the acreage that we have today, we do not see a current opportunity to redevelop any of that property. It includes it's -- if you haven't seen this property, I encourage you to look on the website or better yet, go visit it because it is really a fantastic, truly iconic and irreplaceable asset. It has an 18 hole golf course, it has 444 rooms, 55,000 square feet of meeting space, a 13,000 square foot spa, it has a 5-acre water park and tennis courts and 6 food and beverage outlets. 
So while the 289-acre sounds like a lot of acreage, it is being fully utilized today in a very, very efficient and a very useful manner."

Just, Jim, if you could -- sorry, if you could put some color or maybe what you're underwriting for this year, in terms of group, I think in the first quarter, you were at about, I don't know, 20% or 25% of '19 levels for group. 
How do you see that shaping up maybe over the -- through '22? And more specifically, what are you underwriting for the fourth quarter of this year?

And we have, at our Marriott managed properties, we booked 144,000 new room nights this year for 2Q for the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year. 
Of those 144,000 new room nights, about 70% of those were for the second half of the year. So that 1 million room nights that we have on the books for the second half of 2021 equates to 50% of the room nights we had in 2019, same time in 2019. So the split between the bookings is really leaning fourth quarter a little bit, not a lot, call it, 54% in the fourth quarter. 
And the other thing I'd like to add is that we have a high degree of confidence that those groups are going to show up because our managers have just scrubbed all the bookings and to make certain that people aren't just hanging in there are going to cancel at some point in time. So it's not great, but it's good. 
The fact that 1 million room nights are still there and holding up is encouraging. As we look out to 2022, it is -- we have what about 2 million room nights on the books in 2022 Sourav, I think, something like that? And it is very dependent at this point in time on when restrictions are going to be lifted in key markets. 
To just put some back around it, some of the markets in Chicago, I think, just announced yesterday, when they're going to reopen. California is expecting to fully reopen on June 15, Boston, August 1, New York, July 1. 
And I think that as markets reopen, that's the first thing that has to happen. But more importantly, what has to happen for the business transient traveler to return. And the -- in groups to start booking into next year in a more meaningful way is we have to continue to get the pace of vaccines out there, get to herd immunity in the country and very importantly, get our children back-to-school.
And I think that we're hopeful that, that's all going to happen comes to September. I don't know, Sourav, do you have anything you want to add on this point?"

Let me start by saying that this is the type of hotel that we have a lot of experience with and that we have in the past, delivered a lot of value to our shareholders through our asset management and enterprise analytics capabilities. 
As we look at this property out of the box is profitable as we speak. And we're optimistic that the performance of the asset is going to exceed our underwriting expectations for 2021, for sure, the way it's going. There are a lot of things Sourav and I will kind of tag team this a little bit in a moment. But as we look at what's happening in Disney and in the country, we're very optimistic that we're going to see strong performance of this hotel going forward. 
We believe that this property is in a position to perform better from an EBITDA growth profile than the rest of our portfolio and to recover to 2019 levels of EBITDA and beyond sooner than the rest of our portfolio does. 
Additionally, and I'll let Sourav put some color on this, we feel that the asset has multiple asset management opportunities to advance margin and operational improvement. 
One other point I'd like to make is that October 1 this year is the 50th anniversary of Disney World of the Magic Kingdom and Disney is planning an 18-month celebration, starting October 1. So we expect that we're going to see incredible demand flowing to this hotel. 
One of the things that we looked at is the performance of ultra luxury assets. And if you look at ultra luxury assets over the last 20 years from 1990 to 2019. And those are defined as hotels with a RevPAR of $500 or greater. The CAGR was 6.2%. And if you look at the top 25 markets over that time frame, the CAGR was 3.2%. 
So we think that there is incredible demand out there for this. The resort is becoming a destination onto itself, not only a destination for people who want to stay at Disney, but a vacation destination given the amenities that are on property. I've heard from some people that they take their family to stay at the Four Seasons and the kids only want to go to Magic Kingdom. So all good stuff as we see it going forward. 
And I'll let Sourav talk a little bit about some of the things we're looking at."

Additionally, given that this is a resort and it has a ton of ancillary income as well, it's going to be all about maximizing total RevPAR, which we have again successfully done in implementing it, whether it's the 1 South Beach one of our recent acquisitions or it's Naples in Florida as well. 
So a lot will be -- a lot of focus on total RevPAR and driving ancillary income. We will also work -- and the Four Seasons actually has a very experienced management team, work with them to identify any operating model opportunities as we have successfully again done across our luxury resorts and implement them as soon as possible. 
So we look forward to working with the team. The other piece is, obviously, we're evaluating multiple ROI opportunities, particularly as it relates to food and beverage. Which we are excited to move forward on as well."

So it was completed in November of last year as opposed to a year later, plus or minus. 
We see opportunities going forward, subject to zoning and doing a additional development in Maui takes time. There's a long process, but that we have experience with that, given what we were able to do at the Andaz with the addition of our Villa units. 
And there are opportunities on that land to add rooms to the existing hotel to build another hotel to build a select serve hotel. As we think about it, and use the petition as the Blue -- Play bulk and Blueprint, where we took 27 holes of golf and shrunk it to 18 holes those are things that we're going to think about going forward in Maui."

It is 3 to 5 points of yield index growth relative to where the asset was performing pre renovation. And the assets that we're talking about are not only the 16 Marriott transformational capital program assets but other assets where we invested ROI money such as the doses are and what we're going to be doing at the Ritz and Naples and other hotels across the portfolio. 
Where does it come from? It's tough to say, Chris. We think that in the middle of the pandemic, the 1 asset that we can point to that has really captured a lot of incremental market share is the Coronado Island, Resort & Spa in San Diego. 
I think the yield index gain for well over 9 points at that hotel. So it's going to be case by case, and I don't want to promise anything, but as we are putting money in our hotels and renovating our properties and repositioning them, we're going to have a distinct advantage as business gets back to normal. 
And I personally believe that we should be able to achieved more than 3 to 5 points of yield index growth because we're going to be competing with hotels that haven't been renovated that are going to have to be renovated going forward. And there's going to be incremental disruption associated with those renovations. 
When they do occur, and it's going to have to happen or we're just going to be competing with a tired property. So we are very fortunate to have had the ability to continue to invest in our assets over the course of 2020, and we're doing the same thing this year going forward."

I don't know that it's going to be sustainable, Aryeh. I think that this year, was a unique point in time with businesses closed and people working from home and people being in a position where they can work from anywhere as children get back into schools and as offices open, I think we're going to see a return of business transient traveler and return of group business, and we are just very fortunate that our resort portfolio and our assets in the Sunbelt have carried us through in a material way. 
We never thought that we would be profitable in the first quarter. We had 30 hotels that were profitable for the entire quarter. And I don't know that we talked about this before, but we had 38 hotels 42% of our rooms that were profitable for the month of March. 
So do we think that we're going to continue to see this outsized performance? I think for a -- for the near term, the answer is yes. And when I say near term, we're talking about another year or so because there's so much pent-up demand out there is so much money in savings. 
There is $6 trillion that individuals have in their bank accounts today, they want to spend it. For sure, they want experiences. They're happy to get on the airplane and go. One of the other interesting data points that we look at is air capacity. 
And surprisingly, for Maui, our 3 resorts, I gave you some numbers on how they're trending for June and July, which I don't think anybody would have believed that sitting here a year ago, that we'd be seeing 80% to 90% occupancy at an ADR up 28% and our 3 resorts on Maui. 
It's the only market in the country the only air mark in the country being Maui, that has more capacity right now than it did in 2019. Air capacity from Maui is up 4%. So for the near term, I think you're going to see incredible pent-up demand, replenished travel, we are seeing it. That's going to continue. 
But is it sustainable over the next 3 to 5 years? It's hard to say, but I doubt it. At that point in time, we are really going to be able to compress rates as we have group business and business transient business back in the hotels."

Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieve key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. To be",2395,"Thank you, Tejal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieve key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. 
To begin with, we significantly outperformed expectations for the first quarter, which recorded a GAAP net loss but delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre and hotel-level profitability for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. We grew first quarter total pro forma revenues by 50% sequentially. 
While holding hotel level operating expense growth to only 15% quarter-over-quarter as our operators successfully leveraged the existing resources to meet a stronger-than-expected demand surge in March. 
As a result, we delivered $21 million of positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter, a significant improvement from the negative $62 million recorded in the fourth quarter on a pro forma basis. In addition, we acquired the Hyatt Regency Austin, The Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort and nearly 300 acres of irreplaceable land adjacent to our Hyatt Regency in Maui, strategically investing approximately $800 million of capital at prices that are meaningfully below 2019 levels. Following these transactions, we have a substantial $1.5 billion of total available liquidity, including $131 million of FF&E reserves. 
Operations continued to improve, with April RevPAR expected to exceed March as the vaccine driven margin recovery gains momentum. Finally, in addition to executing substantial strategic investments, we continue to focus on redefining our hotel operating model and positioning our renovated properties to gain market share, key long-term strategic objectives that we believe will position us to achieve best-in-class EBITDA growth through the lodging cycle. 
Beginning with our latest acquisition, the iconic in irreplaceable Four Seasons Resort, Orlando and Walt Disney World Resort. We completed this off-market acquisition on April 30 for approximately $610 million, $40 million less than the price quoted by real estate alert. 
The 444 room resort is located on 289 acres within Disney World, which is one of the world's most visited destination resorts. For context, the Magic Kingdom at Disney World alone attracted nearly 21 million visitors in 2019 according to AECOM and Themed Entertainment Association data. 
The draw of this 1 theme park at Disney World is on par with the approximately 23 million visitors that Boston attracted in 2019 and close to the 24.2 million visitors Miami drew that year. 
The Four Seasons Resort Orlando is the only fee simple luxury resort within Disney world that's not owned by Disney. It provides complementary transport to Disney World's theme parks and is the only AAA 5 diamond rated hotel in Central Florida. 
Newly developed in 2014 and this iconic resort is a market leader with a 2019 RevPAR index of over 215. It is now hosts highest ranked property based on its 2019 RevPAR of $561 and total RevPAR of $923. Moreover, it ranks fifth highest in our portfolio based on its 2019 EBITDA per key of $81,500. 
As with all our strategic objectives, our capital allocation decisions are designed to grow our long-term EBITDA, and we expect this acquisition to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the existing portfolio. The Four Seasons Resort Orlando achieved 90% EBITDA growth from 2016 to 2019. The hotel was profitable in March and the first quarter, and we expect it to be profitable this year, with the latest property forecast indicating that the resort is likely to outperform our underwriting expectations for 2021. 
In general, the resort is well positioned to benefit from a surge in travel and leisure demand as the pandemic subsides and the 18-month celebration of Disney World's 50th anniversary begins in October. We believe these demand catalysts will help the Four Seasons Resort Orlando, surpassed its 2019 EBITDA performance sooner than the rest of our portfolio. 
Shifting to the Hyatt Regency Austin, we opportunistically acquired this 448 room Sunbelt Market hotel on March 15 for $161 million. Acquired off-market at a 10% cap rate and an 8.8x multiple on 2019 EBITDA, the Hyatt Regency Austin's purchase price represents a 20% to 25% discount to estimated pre-COVID pricing and a 40% discount to replacement cost. The hotel was profitable in the first quarter of 2021 and is expected to outperform our underwriting expectations into the second quarter. 
Longer term, we expect the Hyatt Regency Austin to exceed its 2019 EBITDA on a stabilized basis. With profitability to be enhanced by complexion synergies, incremental expense reductions, productivity improvements and ROI investment opportunities. 
Turning to our strategic acquisition of nearly 300 acres of land adjacent to the Hyatt Regency Maui. We acquired the Royal Canapoly and Canapoly Kai Golf Courses for $28 million or approximately $95,000 an acre, which represented a discount to pre-COVID values. 
We are evaluating numerous long-term value-enhancing opportunities for this land, which also provides the near-term potential to generate synergies with the Hyatt Regency Maui. 
To conclude on acquisitions, we have successfully invested $800 million in the first 4 months of 2021 and at meaningful discounts to 2019 pricing levels. This is despite a highly competitive investments landscape with an abundance of capital seeking hotel deals. 
Our success is a testament to the depth of our industry relationships and the strength of our reputation, which is based on decades of best-in-class execution. 
We believe this is an opportune time to strategically grow our portfolio's exposure to markets with high expected growth into superior quality hotels. These early cycle investments have historically provided years of elevated EBITDA growth when time with a period of strong economic recovery. 
Turning to operations. Business volumes grew in each month of the first quarter with March achieving a RevPAR of $84.10, which was 115% higher than our December RevPAR of $39. Moreover, we outperformed the industry's luxury and upper upscale hotel RevPAR performance in our markets by over 2 points in March. 
Our leisure markets, such as Miami, Phoenix and Hawaii, as well as some urban markets, including Washington D.C., Northern Virginia, Atlanta and Philadelphia, outperformed the industry over the first quarter. Our hotel EBITDA turned positive in March. Allowing us to achieve $21 million of positive pro forma hotel EBITDA for the first quarter. 
First quarter revenues were primarily driven by strong leisure demand for our resorts and hotels in the Sunbelt markets and Hawaii as well as by special group business at several of our urban hotels. 
As vaccine deployment accelerated through the first quarter, occupancy in our Sunbelt markets and Hawaii rose from an average of 20% in the first week of January, to 57.4% in the last week of March. Compared to 2019, rate declines improved from negative 12.4% for the month of January, a negative 6.5% for March on a portfolio-wide basis. Strong leisure demand over spring break resulted in the portfolio achieving a 12.2% increase in transient rate over spring break 2019. 8 resorts located in Miami, the Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville, Phoenix and Maui, delivered almost 24% ADR growth over 2019 for the first quarter, with average occupancies of approximately 50%. 
Overall, our luxury hotels have increased their RevPAR index by 23.1% over 2019, with the increase in market share driven by occupancy gains. The 1 hotel South Beach and the Ritz-Carlton Naples were notable outperformers in the quarter, with occupancies ranging between 60% and 70% and transient ADR above $1,000. 
As mentioned last quarter, our hotels in Washington D.C. benefited from government agency group demand around inauguration, making D.C. one of our highest-performing markets based on sequential RevPAR growth, other urban hotels also benefited from special group business, which included film production crews and sports groups, that collectively drove urban weekday occupancy 8.5 percentage points higher quarter-over-quarter. 
In addition, an uptick in leisure transient, business transient and contract demand, supported sequential RevPAR growth in multiple urban markets, including Chicago, Seattle, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. In terms of business mix, leisure drove 90% of our first quarter transient room nights. 
Our operators drove most of our leisure business through direct bookings with loyalty redemptions increasing 33% sequentially driven by our resort portfolio. The much talked about pent-up leisure demand is evidenced in current holiday travel trends, which reflect lengthening booking windows and progressively higher levels of demand. 
For instance, at our Marriott managed leisure market hotels, occupancy on the books improved by 8 percentage points, 9 weeks out from Memorial Day, compared to where those hotels were 9 weeks out from President's Day. 
Similarly, holiday travel trends for July 4 weekend are expected to progressively strengthen relative to Memorial Day. After which many of our hotels are likely to revert to pre pandemic cancellation policies for leisure bookings. 
We expect some of our Sunbelt markets, particularly in Florida and Phoenix, to hold occupancy while rates weaken over the summer. In Hawaii, our Maui resorts are demonstrating continued strength, with occupancy on the books ranging from the mid-80s to the low 90s for June and low to high 70s for July. Remarkably, June ADRs on the books in Maui are nearly 28% higher compared to June 2019, while July ADRs are approximately 50% higher than July 2019. 
Moreover, we have now completed the development of 19 new luxury 2-bedroom villas at the Andaz Maui. The villas already have 45% occupancy on the books at an ADR of $1,700 for the remainder of the year, and bookings continue to grow. 
Moving on to group. We achieved 264,000 group room nights in the first quarter, with 1 highlight being a corporate group of over 4,500 room nights at the Orlando World Center Marriott. The lead for this group came from last October's Connect 2020 conference held at that hotel, which demonstrated how a group event of over 1,000 in person attendees could be held safely. 
We currently have 1.5 million definite room nights on the books for full year 2021, with approximately 1 million of those in the second half of the year. Cancellations remain above 2019 trends, but continue to decline week over week. 
Encouragingly, our Marriott managed properties booked a total of approximately 144,000 new rooms across the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, with strong lead conversion rates compared to 2019. 
Group room nights currently on the books represent approximately 11% of total available rooms in the third quarter and 13% in the fourth quarter. Booking momentum was strong in the first quarter with nearly 165,000 and 154,000 new group room nights booked for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Importantly, our operators have continued to hold future group rates. Compared to 2019, ADR for definite rooms on the books is flat in 2022 and 1.5% higher in 2023. 
Turning to business transient. Demand continues to make steady progress, and first quarter bookings were 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by a steady month-over-month progression. 
Our hotels in San Francisco, San Jose accounted for approximately 30% of the sequential increase in room nights, while ADR rose 17% or $26 over last quarter due to increases from high-rated markets such as Miami, or the Gulf Coast and Phoenix. Most of the special corporate business in the quarter was driven by consulting, project business and government accounts. 
To conclude on operations, there were 76 hotels opened for the first quarter. We reopened Hyatt Regency Capital Hill on May 1 and expect to reopen the Westin Chicago River North and the ibis Rio De Janeiro later this month. By the end of May, we expect only the Sheraton Boston to remain under suspended operations. 
Reflecting on the last 12 months, which have been the most difficult in host history, I am proud of all that we have accomplished and excited by the clarity of our mission, which is to position the company to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth through the new lodging cycle. To achieve that goal, our 3 strategic objectives remain. 
To redefine our operating model with our managers to position our renovated hotels to gain market share and to allocate our capital strategically through acquisitions as well as through development projects. We have quantified the potential returns expected from these investments in the past. And I am going to put all the numbers together for you now. 
From redefining our operating model with our managers, we expect to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term cost savings based on 2019 revenues. From our goal of gaining 3 to 5 points of weighted index growth as the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels as well as 5 other hotels where major renovations have been recently completed or are underway. We expect to generate $21 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis. And finally, from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA on a stabilized annual basis. 
It typically takes renovation and development projects 2 to 3 years to stabilize. As these projects are at different stages of renovation and development, stabilization will occur over several years. 
As a reminder, our recently completed and ongoing development projects include: the ground-up development of the 165 key AC hotel Scottsdale North, 19 new luxury villas at the Andaz Maui, repositioning and expanding the Ritz-Carlton Naples and 60,000 square feet of additional meeting space as well as in Aquatics Park at the Orlando World Center Marriott, our acquisitions of the Four Seasons Resort Orlando and the Hyatt Regency Austin provide us a pro forma 2019 hotel EBITDA base of $1.547 billion. 
While it makes sense to think of 2019 as the base year, the timing of a return to 2019 levels of hotel EBITDA remains highly uncertain, particularly given the unprecedented pandemic driven nature of the downturn. The recovery is may span several years, and our portfolio is likely to continue to evolve over that time. 
However, our goal is for the initiatives and projects underlying our strategic objectives to add a potential $145 million to $220 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized basis. 
With the lodging industry's supply-demand fundamentals continuing to improve, we remain focused on long-term growth and on building a business that is stronger than it was in 2019. We are pleased with our execution to date and feel optimistic about our future as the pandemic receipts and travel continues to rebound. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav."

Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year.We achieved positive",1269,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year.
We achieved positive hotel EBITDA and positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter due to 3 main drivers: a stronger-than-expected increase in demand throughout the quarter, particularly in March, our manager's ability to sequentially increase average room rates by 18% and continued expense control at the property level. As Jim covered the first 2 drivers in his remarks, I will focus on the third. 
First quarter hotel level operating costs rose by only 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, despite an approximately 50% increase in total revenues over the same period. As demand suddenly surged in March, our operators didn't have the time to adjust staffing and other controllable costs from contingency levels implemented since the onset of the pandemic. 
As a result, March variable expenses declined by 70% on total revenue declines of only 62% compared to March 2019. Most of the resulting savings were due to cross utilizing hotel employees across various job functions. 
For the first quarter, variable expenses declined by 74% on total revenue declines of 70% compared to the first quarter of 2019. In future quarters, we expect staffing and other controllable costs to adjust to more normalized levels as demand continues to grow. 
Fixed expenses were 41% lower than the first quarter of 2019. This is a remarkable achievement considering that nearly 20% of the remaining fixed costs are below GOP and consists mainly of expenses such as property taxes and insurance, which don't change with business volumes. 
As part of our goal to redefine the operating model, both Hyatt and Marriott have restructured a number of above property shared service and allocated costs, which were historically completely fixed. 
Additionally, we have worked with the brands to achieve greater flexibility to opt-in to shared services on an as-needed basis, further reducing our fixed costs. Last quarter, we introduced the expense reduction ratio to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue over a comparable pro forma time period in 2019. 
The expense reduction ratio in the second through fourth quarters of 2020 was fairly stable at 0.8. That is, for every 10% decline in hotel revenue, hotel expenses declined 8%. In the first quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.84, much higher than the 0.65 to 0.7 that we expected on our last call for full year 2021. And the highest achieved at any point during the recovery. 
The outsized expense reduction ratio, combined with ADR being down only 9% to the first quarter of 2019, enabled our portfolio to achieve positive hotel level EBITDA at 26.6% occupancy, much better than our previously estimated breakeven range of 35% to 45% with ADRs down 15% to 30% compared to 2019. 
Positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter resulted in positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. 30 hotels representing 30% of total rooms within our portfolio, achieved breakeven or positive hotel EBITDA for the full first quarter. 38 hotels representing 42% of rooms, achieved positive hotel EBITDA in March. March saw additional hotels achieved positive EBITDA in Atlanta, our Texas markets San Diego and L.A. as well as Philadelphia and Hawaii. 
In fact, all 4 of our Hawaii hotels achieved breakeven of positive hotel EBITDA in March. As I just mentioned in the first quarter, revenue came back quicker than expenses, which did grow commensurately, particularly in March. Going forward, our operators are expected to increase staffing and controllable spending more in line with higher levels of demand. 
In addition, other departmental and support expenses, such as sales and marketing as well as maintenance and other support costs will lead to ramp up relative to the first quarter, while remaining well below 2019 levels. Therefore, on a full year basis, we continue to expect the expense reduction ratio to be closer to 0.7. 
Shifting to our top line outlook. While we are not providing guidance at this time, I would like to share how we are thinking about our top line trajectory for the rest of the year. We expect RevPAR to continue increasing sequentially throughout the year, but we expect growth to be driven by occupancy in the second and third quarters. 
We think rates could sequentially decline as we move out of peak season in some of our higher-rated leisure markets. Seasonality in tandem with a normal demand shift toward lower-rated markets could also lead to lower rates in the second and third quarters as we have seen historically. Additionally, rates could come under pressure as suspended hotels reopen in urban markets. 
Moving to business mix. We think business transient will continue to make slow and steady progress during the year. With the anticipated return to office late in the third quarter, driving a ramp-up in business transient demand after Labor Day. 
While we have benefited from nontraditional group demand during the pandemic, we expect traditional groups, corporate and associations to begin ramping up meaningfully in the fourth quarter following the expected return to office after Labor Day. 
Finally, we believe leisure will continue driving total RevPAR at our properties particularly through the summer. We expect our urban hotels to increasingly benefit from leisure demand growth as restrictions in those markets continue to lift and key demand drivers we open. 
As it relates to cash burn for the quarter, our cash burn, excluding capital expenditures, which deducts corporate level expenses and interest payments decreased to $45 million or $138 million, including CapEx. These amounts are down meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by the strong first quarter operating performance. We maintained a strong liquidity position with $1.5 billion of cash, including $131 million of FF&E reserves after adjusting for the Four Seasons Disney Acquisition announced today. And we have no debt maturities until 2023. 
There is 1 accounting item I would like to bring to your attention. Neither we nor our operators expect any furlough accruals, employee retention credits or timing adjustments for these items moving forward as COBRA benefits provided in accordance with the American Rescue plan from April 1st to September 30, of 3 to the furlough associates of our operators and are fully reimbursable for our operators via a credit against their quarterly payroll tax liability. 
Therefore, there is ultimately no cost to the company for providing COBRA benefits and it will not have any P&L impact through the third quarter of this year. 
To conclude, we are very encouraged by the momentum of the lodging recovery, which has driven better-than-expected sequential revenue growth and resulted in positive first quarter hotel EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAre. We are seeing increased demand across all parts of our business, alongside strong rate integrity. We view an expected increase in expenses favorably, too, as that indicates business volumes are ramping back up to normal levels. Combining that with a strong balance sheet and a focus on our 3 strategic objectives: redefining the operating model, gaining market share at our renovated hotels and strategically allocating capital. 
We believe we are well positioned to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth that we expect will continue to be further augmented by external growth opportunities throughout this lodging cycle. 
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question."

And it seems like that bid-ask spread has narrowed dramatically. And it's not the seller that's moving down. Is that the right way to think about what's going on with the transaction market? Is it -- the buyers have gotten much more aggressive, maybe much more confident in the outlook?"

We really like the trajectory that we're on at this point in time. So I will take the congratulations in a tough environment. 
With respect to acquisitions, I think we all agreed that, let's call it a year ago, we believe that there was going to be a lot of distress in the marketplace. And I would point to our Hyatt Regency Austin acquisition as an asset that was under distress. 
The ownership, the borrower in that deal was staring down a UCC foreclosure action that was going to occur at the beginning of April, as you know, we bought the hotel in mid-March or thereabouts. And saved that borrower and paid off all of the debt associated with the hotel and acquired a really good asset at a significant discount to pre-COVID evaluations. 
I think that a couple of things are happening now. There is a lot of equity in the marketplace, chasing deals. Good deals are going to price at close to where they would have priced in 2019. There's no question about it. Solid resorts like the Four Seasons Disney, which are truly iconic and irreplaceable assets. Are going to be fully fairly priced. 
I am not seeing generally a lot of distress in the marketplace today, particularly for the better quality assets. And we are not really seeing a lot of distress across the system right now. So I do think that there is a lot of capital out there. 
I think as you compete more in auction processes, pricing is going to going to be aggressive. However, we're coming out of the worst downturn that we've ever experienced in the lodging industry and the pandemic induced recession in the United States as well, we're turning the corner, and we are firm believers that for the right assets at this stage of the cycle, it's the time to acquire. It's a time to continue to shape the quality of the portfolio that we have. 
We were fortunate that coming into 2020 on a number of different metrics, the company had never been in better shape. We talk a lot about the balance sheet and the firepower that, that's given us to deploy $800 million of capital today. 
What we don't talk about a lot, but I think it's really important that investors understand it is our RevPAR metrics as of January 1, 2020, and our EBITDA per key performance as well as the fact that over the last several years, over the last 5 years, we have consistently tightened up margins year-over-year. 
We had margin improvement going forward. So we are just delighted with where we are. And we hope that we're going to have the opportunity to acquire additional assets early in this cycle so that we can ride the economic wave."

Does that change your expectation about whether you would use? I think you said you have $1.5 billion still remaining for acquisitions, whether you would actually be able to use that budget here in the next 12 months? And then just a little sort of side question. 
I'm curious with the Four Seasons Orlando, you talked about a lot of the acreage there. Is there opportunity to add anything there given it's special location, kind of the only thing not Disney owned, where you can kind of monetize that acreage? Or are there limits on what else you might be able to add to that acreage?"

With respect to deploying the remaining capital that we have, the cash that's on the balance sheet obviously, we have some restrictions in connection with our bank waiver agreement today. 
We're looking forward to the time whenever we're going to come out of that the waiver amendment as operations improve, we're hoping that's going to be sooner rather than later. It's very difficult to hypothetically answer the question of whether or not we're going to be investing additional capital because it's really transaction specific, and we are evaluating a number of opportunities now, we've evaluated a number of opportunities over the course of this year that we've let out because we didn't think they were the right fit for host for 1 reason or another. 
So we have teams that are back on the road. I'm back on the road looking at assets. We have people on the road today as we speak, looking at assets, and we're hopeful that we're going to be able to get some additional capital smartly deployed. 
With respect to the Four Seasons Orlando, the resort sits on roughly 289 acres. And the short answer is that on the acreage that we have today, we do not see a current opportunity to redevelop any of that property. It includes it's -- if you haven't seen this property, I encourage you to look on the website or better yet, go visit it because it is really a fantastic, truly iconic and irreplaceable asset. It has an 18 hole golf course, it has 444 rooms, 55,000 square feet of meeting space, a 13,000 square foot spa, it has a 5-acre water park and tennis courts and 6 food and beverage outlets. 
So while the 289-acre sounds like a lot of acreage, it is being fully utilized today in a very, very efficient and a very useful manner."

Just, Jim, if you could -- sorry, if you could put some color or maybe what you're underwriting for this year, in terms of group, I think in the first quarter, you were at about, I don't know, 20% or 25% of '19 levels for group. 
How do you see that shaping up maybe over the -- through '22? And more specifically, what are you underwriting for the fourth quarter of this year?

And we have, at our Marriott managed properties, we booked 144,000 new room nights this year for 2Q for the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year. 
Of those 144,000 new room nights, about 70% of those were for the second half of the year. So that 1 million room nights that we have on the books for the second half of 2021 equates to 50% of the room nights we had in 2019, same time in 2019. So the split between the bookings is really leaning fourth quarter a little bit, not a lot, call it, 54% in the fourth quarter. 
And the other thing I'd like to add is that we have a high degree of confidence that those groups are going to show up because our managers have just scrubbed all the bookings and to make certain that people aren't just hanging in there are going to cancel at some point in time. So it's not great, but it's good. 
The fact that 1 million room nights are still there and holding up is encouraging. As we look out to 2022, it is -- we have what about 2 million room nights on the books in 2022 Sourav, I think, something like that? And it is very dependent at this point in time on when restrictions are going to be lifted in key markets. 
To just put some back around it, some of the markets in Chicago, I think, just announced yesterday, when they're going to reopen. California is expecting to fully reopen on June 15, Boston, August 1, New York, July 1. 
And I think that as markets reopen, that's the first thing that has to happen. But more importantly, what has to happen for the business transient traveler to return. And the -- in groups to start booking into next year in a more meaningful way is we have to continue to get the pace of vaccines out there, get to herd immunity in the country and very importantly, get our children back-to-school.
And I think that we're hopeful that, that's all going to happen comes to September. I don't know, Sourav, do you have anything you want to add on this point?"

We put a lot of thought into it as we do in every acquisition. Let me start by saying that this is the type of hotel that we have a lot of experience with and that we have in the past, delivered a lot of value to our shareholders through our asset management and enterprise analytics capabilities. 
As we look at this property out of the box is profitable as we speak. And we're optimistic that the performance of the asset is going to exceed our underwriting expectations for 2021, for sure, the way it's going. There are a lot of things Sourav and I will kind of tag team this a little bit in a moment. But as we look at what's happening in Disney and in the country, we're very optimistic that we're going to see strong performance of this hotel going forward. 
We believe that this property is in a position to perform better from an EBITDA growth profile than the rest of our portfolio and to recover to 2019 levels of EBITDA and beyond sooner than the rest of our portfolio does. 
Additionally, and I'll let Sourav put some color on this, we feel that the asset has multiple asset management opportunities to advance margin and operational improvement. 
One other point I'd like to make is that October 1 this year is the 50th anniversary of Disney World of the Magic Kingdom and Disney is planning an 18-month celebration, starting October 1. So we expect that we're going to see incredible demand flowing to this hotel. 
One of the things that we looked at is the performance of ultra luxury assets. And if you look at ultra luxury assets over the last 20 years from 1990 to 2019. And those are defined as hotels with a RevPAR of $500 or greater. The CAGR was 6.2%. And if you look at the top 25 markets over that time frame, the CAGR was 3.2%. 
So we think that there is incredible demand out there for this. The resort is becoming a destination onto itself, not only a destination for people who want to stay at Disney, but a vacation destination given the amenities that are on property. I've heard from some people that they take their family to stay at the Four Seasons and the kids only want to go to Magic Kingdom. So all good stuff as we see it going forward. 
And I'll let Sourav talk a little bit about some of the things we're looking at."

So we -- like with any acquisition, we have the best practice to pay book that we will share with the property and then work collaboratively with the management team to implement those best practices. 
For example, we have a best-in-class functional space management strategy to maximize revenue per available space. The meeting space that exists on property. 
We've obviously done a lot with our existing luxury resorts in Florida as well as across our portfolio. Additionally, given that this is a resort and it has a ton of ancillary income as well, it's going to be all about maximizing total RevPAR, which we have again successfully done in implementing it, whether it's the 1 South Beach one of our recent acquisitions or it's Naples in Florida as well. 
So a lot will be -- a lot of focus on total RevPAR and driving ancillary income. We will also work -- and the Four Seasons actually has a very experienced management team, work with them to identify any operating model opportunities as we have successfully again done across our luxury resorts and implement them as soon as possible. 
So we look forward to working with the team. The other piece is, obviously, we're evaluating multiple ROI opportunities, particularly as it relates to food and beverage. Which we are excited to move forward on as well."

So it was completed in November of last year as opposed to a year later, plus or minus. 
We see opportunities going forward, subject to zoning and doing a additional development in Maui takes time. There's a long process, but that we have experience with that, given what we were able to do at the Andaz with the addition of our Villa units. 
And there are opportunities on that land to add rooms to the existing hotel to build another hotel to build a select serve hotel.

It is 3 to 5 points of yield index growth relative to where the asset was performing pre renovation. And the assets that we're talking about are not only the 16 Marriott transformational capital program assets but other assets where we invested ROI money such as the doses are and what we're going to be doing at the Ritz and Naples and other hotels across the portfolio. 
Where does it come from? It's tough to say, Chris. We think that in the middle of the pandemic, the 1 asset that we can point to that has really captured a lot of incremental market share is the Coronado Island, Resort & Spa in San Diego. 
I think the yield index gain for well over 9 points at that hotel. So it's going to be case by case, and I don't want to promise anything, but as we are putting money in our hotels and renovating our properties and repositioning them, we're going to have a distinct advantage as business gets back to normal. 
And I personally believe that we should be able to achieved more than 3 to 5 points of yield index growth because we're going to be competing with hotels that haven't been renovated that are going to have to be renovated going forward. And there's going to be incremental disruption associated with those renovations. 
When they do occur, and it's going to have to happen or we're just going to be competing with a tired property. So we are very fortunate to have had the ability to continue to invest in our assets over the course of 2020, and we're doing the same thing this year going forward."

I don't know that it's going to be sustainable, Aryeh. I think that this year, was a unique point in time with businesses closed and people working from home and people being in a position where they can work from anywhere as children get back into schools and as offices open, I think we're going to see a return of business transient traveler and return of group business, and we are just very fortunate that our resort portfolio and our assets in the Sunbelt have carried us through in a material way. 
We never thought that we would be profitable in the first quarter. We had 30 hotels that were profitable for the entire quarter. And I don't know that we talked about this before, but we had 38 hotels 42% of our rooms that were profitable for the month of March. 
So do we think that we're going to continue to see this outsized performance? I think for a -- for the near term, the answer is yes. And when I say near term, we're talking about another year or so because there's so much pent-up demand out there is so much money in savings. 
There is $6 trillion that individuals have in their bank accounts today, they want to spend it. For sure, they want experiences. They're happy to get on the airplane and go. One of the other interesting data points that we look at is air capacity. 
And surprisingly, for Maui, our 3 resorts, I gave you some numbers on how they're trending for June and July, which I don't think anybody would have believed that sitting here a year ago, that we'd be seeing 80% to 90% occupancy at an ADR up 28% and our 3 resorts on Maui. 
It's the only market in the country the only air mark in the country being Maui, that has more capacity right now than it did in 2019. Air capacity from Maui is up 4%. So for the near term, I think you're going to see incredible pent-up demand, replenished travel, we are seeing it. That's going to continue. 
But is it sustainable over the next 3 to 5 years? It's hard to say, but I doubt it. At that point in time, we are really going to be able to compress rates as we have group business and business transient business back in the hotels."

Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieve key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. To be",2395,"Thank you, Tejal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieve key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. 
To begin with, we significantly outperformed expectations for the first quarter, which recorded a GAAP net loss but delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre and hotel-level profitability for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. We grew first quarter total pro forma revenues by 50% sequentially. 
While holding hotel level operating expense growth to only 15% quarter-over-quarter as our operators successfully leveraged the existing resources to meet a stronger-than-expected demand surge in March. 
As a result, we delivered $21 million of positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter, a significant improvement from the negative $62 million recorded in the fourth quarter on a pro forma basis. In addition, we acquired the Hyatt Regency Austin, The Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort and nearly 300 acres of irreplaceable land adjacent to our Hyatt Regency in Maui, strategically investing approximately $800 million of capital at prices that are meaningfully below 2019 levels. Following these transactions, we have a substantial $1.5 billion of total available liquidity, including $131 million of FF&E reserves. 
Operations continued to improve, with April RevPAR expected to exceed March as the vaccine driven margin recovery gains momentum. Finally, in addition to executing substantial strategic investments, we continue to focus on redefining our hotel operating model and positioning our renovated properties to gain market share, key long-term strategic objectives that we believe will position us to achieve best-in-class EBITDA growth through the lodging cycle. 
Beginning with our latest acquisition, the iconic in irreplaceable Four Seasons Resort, Orlando and Walt Disney World Resort. We completed this off-market acquisition on April 30 for approximately $610 million, $40 million less than the price quoted by real estate alert. 
The 444 room resort is located on 289 acres within Disney World, which is one of the world's most visited destination resorts. For context, the Magic Kingdom at Disney World alone attracted nearly 21 million visitors in 2019 according to AECOM and Themed Entertainment Association data. 
The draw of this 1 theme park at Disney World is on par with the approximately 23 million visitors that Boston attracted in 2019 and close to the 24.2 million visitors Miami drew that year. 
The Four Seasons Resort Orlando is the only fee simple luxury resort within Disney world that's not owned by Disney. It provides complementary transport to Disney World's theme parks and is the only AAA 5 diamond rated hotel in Central Florida. 
Newly developed in 2014 and this iconic resort is a market leader with a 2019 RevPAR index of over 215. It is now hosts highest ranked property based on its 2019 RevPAR of $561 and total RevPAR of $923. Moreover, it ranks fifth highest in our portfolio based on its 2019 EBITDA per key of $81,500. 
As with all our strategic objectives, our capital allocation decisions are designed to grow our long-term EBITDA, and we expect this acquisition to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the existing portfolio. The Four Seasons Resort Orlando achieved 90% EBITDA growth from 2016 to 2019. The hotel was profitable in March and the first quarter, and we expect it to be profitable this year, with the latest property forecast indicating that the resort is likely to outperform our underwriting expectations for 2021. 
In general, the resort is well positioned to benefit from a surge in travel and leisure demand as the pandemic subsides and the 18-month celebration of Disney World's 50th anniversary begins in October. We believe these demand catalysts will help the Four Seasons Resort Orlando, surpassed its 2019 EBITDA performance sooner than the rest of our portfolio. 
Shifting to the Hyatt Regency Austin, we opportunistically acquired this 448 room Sunbelt Market hotel on March 15 for $161 million. Acquired off-market at a 10% cap rate and an 8.8x multiple on 2019 EBITDA, the Hyatt Regency Austin's purchase price represents a 20% to 25% discount to estimated pre-COVID pricing and a 40% discount to replacement cost. The hotel was profitable in the first quarter of 2021 and is expected to outperform our underwriting expectations into the second quarter. 
Longer term, we expect the Hyatt Regency Austin to exceed its 2019 EBITDA on a stabilized basis. With profitability to be enhanced by complexion synergies, incremental expense reductions, productivity improvements and ROI investment opportunities. 
Turning to our strategic acquisition of nearly 300 acres of land adjacent to the Hyatt Regency Maui. We acquired the Royal Canapoly and Canapoly Kai Golf Courses for $28 million or approximately $95,000 an acre, which represented a discount to pre-COVID values. 
We are evaluating numerous long-term value-enhancing opportunities for this land, which also provides the near-term potential to generate synergies with the Hyatt Regency Maui. 
To conclude on acquisitions, we have successfully invested $800 million in the first 4 months of 2021 and at meaningful discounts to 2019 pricing levels. This is despite a highly competitive investments landscape with an abundance of capital seeking hotel deals. 
Our success is a testament to the depth of our industry relationships and the strength of our reputation, which is based on decades of best-in-class execution. 
We believe this is an opportune time to strategically grow our portfolio's exposure to markets with high expected growth into superior quality hotels. These early cycle investments have historically provided years of elevated EBITDA growth when time with a period of strong economic recovery. 
Turning to operations. Business volumes grew in each month of the first quarter with March achieving a RevPAR of $84.10, which was 115% higher than our December RevPAR of $39. Moreover, we outperformed the industry's luxury and upper upscale hotel RevPAR performance in our markets by over 2 points in March. 
Our leisure markets, such as Miami, Phoenix and Hawaii, as well as some urban markets, including Washington D.C., Northern Virginia, Atlanta and Philadelphia, outperformed the industry over the first quarter. Our hotel EBITDA turned positive in March. Allowing us to achieve $21 million of positive pro forma hotel EBITDA for the first quarter. 
First quarter revenues were primarily driven by strong leisure demand for our resorts and hotels in the Sunbelt markets and Hawaii as well as by special group business at several of our urban hotels. 
As vaccine deployment accelerated through the first quarter, occupancy in our Sunbelt markets and Hawaii rose from an average of 20% in the first week of January, to 57.4% in the last week of March. Compared to 2019, rate declines improved from negative 12.4% for the month of January, a negative 6.5% for March on a portfolio-wide basis. Strong leisure demand over spring break resulted in the portfolio achieving a 12.2% increase in transient rate over spring break 2019. 8 resorts located in Miami, the Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville, Phoenix and Maui, delivered almost 24% ADR growth over 2019 for the first quarter, with average occupancies of approximately 50%. 
Overall, our luxury hotels have increased their RevPAR index by 23.1% over 2019, with the increase in market share driven by occupancy gains. The 1 hotel South Beach and the Ritz-Carlton Naples were notable outperformers in the quarter, with occupancies ranging between 60% and 70% and transient ADR above $1,000. 
As mentioned last quarter, our hotels in Washington D.C. benefited from government agency group demand around inauguration, making D.C. one of our highest-performing markets based on sequential RevPAR growth, other urban hotels also benefited from special group business, which included film production crews and sports groups, that collectively drove urban weekday occupancy 8.5 percentage points higher quarter-over-quarter. 
In addition, an uptick in leisure transient, business transient and contract demand, supported sequential RevPAR growth in multiple urban markets, including Chicago, Seattle, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. In terms of business mix, leisure drove 90% of our first quarter transient room nights. 
Our operators drove most of our leisure business through direct bookings with loyalty redemptions increasing 33% sequentially driven by our resort portfolio. The much talked about pent-up leisure demand is evidenced in current holiday travel trends, which reflect lengthening booking windows and progressively higher levels of demand. 
For instance, at our Marriott managed leisure market hotels, occupancy on the books improved by 8 percentage points, 9 weeks out from Memorial Day, compared to where those hotels were 9 weeks out from President's Day. 
Similarly, holiday travel trends for July 4 weekend are expected to progressively strengthen relative to Memorial Day. After which many of our hotels are likely to revert to pre pandemic cancellation policies for leisure bookings. 
We expect some of our Sunbelt markets, particularly in Florida and Phoenix, to hold occupancy while rates weaken over the summer. In Hawaii, our Maui resorts are demonstrating continued strength, with occupancy on the books ranging from the mid-80s to the low 90s for June and low to high 70s for July. Remarkably, June ADRs on the books in Maui are nearly 28% higher compared to June 2019, while July ADRs are approximately 50% higher than July 2019. 
Moreover, we have now completed the development of 19 new luxury 2-bedroom villas at the Andaz Maui. The villas already have 45% occupancy on the books at an ADR of $1,700 for the remainder of the year, and bookings continue to grow. 
Moving on to group. We achieved 264,000 group room nights in the first quarter, with 1 highlight being a corporate group of over 4,500 room nights at the Orlando World Center Marriott. The lead for this group came from last October's Connect 2020 conference held at that hotel, which demonstrated how a group event of over 1,000 in person attendees could be held safely. 
We currently have 1.5 million definite room nights on the books for full year 2021, with approximately 1 million of those in the second half of the year. Cancellations remain above 2019 trends, but continue to decline week over week. 
Encouragingly, our Marriott managed properties booked a total of approximately 144,000 new rooms across the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, with strong lead conversion rates compared to 2019. 
Group room nights currently on the books represent approximately 11% of total available rooms in the third quarter and 13% in the fourth quarter. Booking momentum was strong in the first quarter with nearly 165,000 and 154,000 new group room nights booked for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Importantly, our operators have continued to hold future group rates. Compared to 2019, ADR for definite rooms on the books is flat in 2022 and 1.5% higher in 2023. 
Turning to business transient. Demand continues to make steady progress, and first quarter bookings were 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by a steady month-over-month progression. 
Our hotels in San Francisco, San Jose accounted for approximately 30% of the sequential increase in room nights, while ADR rose 17% or $26 over last quarter due to increases from high-rated markets such as Miami, or the Gulf Coast and Phoenix. Most of the special corporate business in the quarter was driven by consulting, project business and government accounts. 
To conclude on operations, there were 76 hotels opened for the first quarter. We reopened Hyatt Regency Capital Hill on May 1 and expect to reopen the Westin Chicago River North and the ibis Rio De Janeiro later this month. By the end of May, we expect only the Sheraton Boston to remain under suspended operations. 
Reflecting on the last 12 months, which have been the most difficult in host history, I am proud of all that we have accomplished and excited by the clarity of our mission, which is to position the company to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth through the new lodging cycle. To achieve that goal, our 3 strategic objectives remain. 
To redefine our operating model with our managers to position our renovated hotels to gain market share and to allocate our capital strategically through acquisitions as well as through development projects. We have quantified the potential returns expected from these investments in the past. And I am going to put all the numbers together for you now. 
From redefining our operating model with our managers, we expect to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term cost savings based on 2019 revenues. From our goal of gaining 3 to 5 points of weighted index growth as the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels as well as 5 other hotels where major renovations have been recently completed or are underway. We expect to generate $21 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis. And finally, from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA on a stabilized annual basis. 
It typically takes renovation and development projects 2 to 3 years to stabilize. As these projects are at different stages of renovation and development, stabilization will occur over several years. 
As a reminder, our recently completed and ongoing development projects include: the ground-up development of the 165 key AC hotel Scottsdale North, 19 new luxury villas at the Andaz Maui, repositioning and expanding the Ritz-Carlton Naples and 60,000 square feet of additional meeting space as well as in Aquatics Park at the Orlando World Center Marriott, our acquisitions of the Four Seasons Resort Orlando and the Hyatt Regency Austin provide us a pro forma 2019 hotel EBITDA base of $1.547 billion. 
While it makes sense to think of 2019 as the base year, the timing of a return to 2019 levels of hotel EBITDA remains highly uncertain, particularly given the unprecedented pandemic driven nature of the downturn. The recovery is may span several years, and our portfolio is likely to continue to evolve over that time. 
However, our goal is for the initiatives and projects underlying our strategic objectives to add a potential $145 million to $220 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized basis. 
With the lodging industry's supply-demand fundamentals continuing to improve, we remain focused on long-term growth and on building a business that is stronger than it was in 2019. We are pleased with our execution to date and feel optimistic about our future as the pandemic receipts and travel continues to rebound. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav."

Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year.We achieved positive",1269,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year.
We achieved positive hotel EBITDA and positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter due to 3 main drivers: a stronger-than-expected increase in demand throughout the quarter, particularly in March, our manager's ability to sequentially increase average room rates by 18% and continued expense control at the property level. As Jim covered the first 2 drivers in his remarks, I will focus on the third. 
First quarter hotel level operating costs rose by only 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, despite an approximately 50% increase in total revenues over the same period. As demand suddenly surged in March, our operators didn't have the time to adjust staffing and other controllable costs from contingency levels implemented since the onset of the pandemic. 
As a result, March variable expenses declined by 70% on total revenue declines of only 62% compared to March 2019. Most of the resulting savings were due to cross utilizing hotel employees across various job functions. 
For the first quarter, variable expenses declined by 74% on total revenue declines of 70% compared to the first quarter of 2019. In future quarters, we expect staffing and other controllable costs to adjust to more normalized levels as demand continues to grow. 
Fixed expenses were 41% lower than the first quarter of 2019. This is a remarkable achievement considering that nearly 20% of the remaining fixed costs are below GOP and consists mainly of expenses such as property taxes and insurance, which don't change with business volumes. 
As part of our goal to redefine the operating model, both Hyatt and Marriott have restructured a number of above property shared service and allocated costs, which were historically completely fixed. 
Additionally, we have worked with the brands to achieve greater flexibility to opt-in to shared services on an as-needed basis, further reducing our fixed costs. Last quarter, we introduced the expense reduction ratio to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue over a comparable pro forma time period in 2019. 
The expense reduction ratio in the second through fourth quarters of 2020 was fairly stable at 0.8. That is, for every 10% decline in hotel revenue, hotel expenses declined 8%. In the first quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.84, much higher than the 0.65 to 0.7 that we expected on our last call for full year 2021. And the highest achieved at any point during the recovery. 
The outsized expense reduction ratio, combined with ADR being down only 9% to the first quarter of 2019, enabled our portfolio to achieve positive hotel level EBITDA at 26.6% occupancy, much better than our previously estimated breakeven range of 35% to 45% with ADRs down 15% to 30% compared to 2019. 
Positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter resulted in positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. 30 hotels representing 30% of total rooms within our portfolio, achieved breakeven or positive hotel EBITDA for the full first quarter. 38 hotels representing 42% of rooms, achieved positive hotel EBITDA in March. March saw additional hotels achieved positive EBITDA in Atlanta, our Texas markets San Diego and L.A. as well as Philadelphia and Hawaii. 
In fact, all 4 of our Hawaii hotels achieved breakeven of positive hotel EBITDA in March. As I just mentioned in the first quarter, revenue came back quicker than expenses, which did grow commensurately, particularly in March. Going forward, our operators are expected to increase staffing and controllable spending more in line with higher levels of demand. 
In addition, other departmental and support expenses, such as sales and marketing as well as maintenance and other support costs will lead to ramp up relative to the first quarter, while remaining well below 2019 levels. Therefore, on a full year basis, we continue to expect the expense reduction ratio to be closer to 0.7. 
Shifting to our top line outlook. While we are not providing guidance at this time, I would like to share how we are thinking about our top line trajectory for the rest of the year. We expect RevPAR to continue increasing sequentially throughout the year, but we expect growth to be driven by occupancy in the second and third quarters. 
We think rates could sequentially decline as we move out of peak season in some of our higher-rated leisure markets. Seasonality in tandem with a normal demand shift toward lower-rated markets could also lead to lower rates in the second and third quarters as we have seen historically. Additionally, rates could come under pressure as suspended hotels reopen in urban markets. 
Moving to business mix. We think business transient will continue to make slow and steady progress during the year. With the anticipated return to office late in the third quarter, driving a ramp-up in business transient demand after Labor Day. 
While we have benefited from nontraditional group demand during the pandemic, we expect traditional groups, corporate and associations to begin ramping up meaningfully in the fourth quarter following the expected return to office after Labor Day. 
Finally, we believe leisure will continue driving total RevPAR at our properties particularly through the summer. We expect our urban hotels to increasingly benefit from leisure demand growth as restrictions in those markets continue to lift and key demand drivers we open. 
As it relates to cash burn for the quarter, our cash burn, excluding capital expenditures, which deducts corporate level expenses and interest payments decreased to $45 million or $138 million, including CapEx. These amounts are down meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by the strong first quarter operating performance. We maintained a strong liquidity position with $1.5 billion of cash, including $131 million of FF&E reserves after adjusting for the Four Seasons Disney Acquisition announced today. And we have no debt maturities until 2023. 
There is 1 accounting item I would like to bring to your attention. Neither we nor our operators expect any furlough accruals, employee retention credits or timing adjustments for these items moving forward as COBRA benefits provided in accordance with the American Rescue plan from April 1st to September 30, of 3 to the furlough associates of our operators and are fully reimbursable for our operators via a credit against their quarterly payroll tax liability. 
Therefore, there is ultimately no cost to the company for providing COBRA benefits and it will not have any P&L impact through the third quarter of this year. 
To conclude, we are very encouraged by the momentum of the lodging recovery, which has driven better-than-expected sequential revenue growth and resulted in positive first quarter hotel EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAre. We are seeing increased demand across all parts of our business, alongside strong rate integrity. We view an expected increase in expenses favorably, too, as that indicates business volumes are ramping back up to normal levels. Combining that with a strong balance sheet and a focus on our 3 strategic objectives: redefining the operating model, gaining market share at our renovated hotels and strategically allocating capital. 
We believe we are well positioned to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth that we expect will continue to be further augmented by external growth opportunities throughout this lodging cycle. 
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question."

And it seems like that bid-ask spread has narrowed dramatically. And it's not the seller that's moving down. Is that the right way to think about what's going on with the transaction market? Is it -- the buyers have gotten much more aggressive, maybe much more confident in the outlook?"

We really like the trajectory that we're on at this point in time. So I will take the congratulations in a tough environment. 
With respect to acquisitions, I think we all agreed that, let's call it a year ago, we believe that there was going to be a lot of distress in the marketplace. And I would point to our Hyatt Regency Austin acquisition as an asset that was under distress. 
The ownership, the borrower in that deal was staring down a UCC foreclosure action that was going to occur at the beginning of April, as you know, we bought the hotel in mid-March or thereabouts. And saved that borrower and paid off all of the debt associated with the hotel and acquired a really good asset at a significant discount to pre-COVID evaluations. 
I think that a couple of things are happening now. There is a lot of equity in the marketplace, chasing deals. Good deals are going to price at close to where they would have priced in 2019. There's no question about it. Solid resorts like the Four Seasons Disney, which are truly iconic and irreplaceable assets. Are going to be fully fairly priced. 
I am not seeing generally a lot of distress in the marketplace today, particularly for the better quality assets. And we are not really seeing a lot of distress across the system right now. So I do think that there is a lot of capital out there. 
I think as you compete more in auction processes, pricing is going to going to be aggressive. However, we're coming out of the worst downturn that we've ever experienced in the lodging industry and the pandemic induced recession in the United States as well, we're turning the corner, and we are firm believers that for the right assets at this stage of the cycle, it's the time to acquire. It's a time to continue to shape the quality of the portfolio that we have. 
We were fortunate that coming into 2020 on a number of different metrics, the company had never been in better shape. We talk a lot about the balance sheet and the firepower that, that's given us to deploy $800 million of capital today. 
What we don't talk about a lot, but I think it's really important that investors understand it is our RevPAR metrics as of January 1, 2020, and our EBITDA per key performance as well as the fact that over the last several years, over the last 5 years, we have consistently tightened up margins year-over-year. 
We had margin improvement going forward. So we are just delighted with where we are. And we hope that we're going to have the opportunity to acquire additional assets early in this cycle so that we can ride the economic wave."

Does that change your expectation about whether you would use? I think you said you have $1.5 billion still remaining for acquisitions, whether you would actually be able to use that budget here in the next 12 months? And then just a little sort of side question. 
I'm curious with the Four Seasons Orlando, you talked about a lot of the acreage there. Is there opportunity to add anything there given it's special location, kind of the only thing not Disney owned, where you can kind of monetize that acreage? Or are there limits on what else you might be able to add to that acreage?"

With respect to deploying the remaining capital that we have, the cash that's on the balance sheet obviously, we have some restrictions in connection with our bank waiver agreement today. 
We're looking forward to the time whenever we're going to come out of that the waiver amendment as operations improve, we're hoping that's going to be sooner rather than later. It's very difficult to hypothetically answer the question of whether or not we're going to be investing additional capital because it's really transaction specific, and we are evaluating a number of opportunities now, we've evaluated a number of opportunities over the course of this year that we've let out because we didn't think they were the right fit for host for 1 reason or another. 
So we have teams that are back on the road. I'm back on the road looking at assets. We have people on the road today as we speak, looking at assets, and we're hopeful that we're going to be able to get some additional capital smartly deployed. 
With respect to the Four Seasons Orlando, the resort sits on roughly 289 acres. And the short answer is that on the acreage that we have today, we do not see a current opportunity to redevelop any of that property. It includes it's -- if you haven't seen this property, I encourage you to look on the website or better yet, go visit it because it is really a fantastic, truly iconic and irreplaceable asset. It has an 18 hole golf course, it has 444 rooms, 55,000 square feet of meeting space, a 13,000 square foot spa, it has a 5-acre water park and tennis courts and 6 food and beverage outlets. 
So while the 289-acre sounds like a lot of acreage, it is being fully utilized today in a very, very efficient and a very useful manner."

Just, Jim, if you could -- sorry, if you could put some color or maybe what you're underwriting for this year, in terms of group, I think in the first quarter, you were at about, I don't know, 20% or 25% of '19 levels for group. 
How do you see that shaping up maybe over the -- through '22? And more specifically, what are you underwriting for the fourth quarter of this year?

And we have, at our Marriott managed properties, we booked 144,000 new room nights this year for 2Q for the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year. 
Of those 144,000 new room nights, about 70% of those were for the second half of the year. So that 1 million room nights that we have on the books for the second half of 2021 equates to 50% of the room nights we had in 2019, same time in 2019. So the split between the bookings is really leaning fourth quarter a little bit, not a lot, call it, 54% in the fourth quarter. 
And the other thing I'd like to add is that we have a high degree of confidence that those groups are going to show up because our managers have just scrubbed all the bookings and to make certain that people aren't just hanging in there are going to cancel at some point in time. So it's not great, but it's good. 
The fact that 1 million room nights are still there and holding up is encouraging. As we look out to 2022, it is -- we have what about 2 million room nights on the books in 2022 Sourav, I think, something like that? And it is very dependent at this point in time on when restrictions are going to be lifted in key markets. 
To just put some back around it, some of the markets in Chicago, I think, just announced yesterday, when they're going to reopen. California is expecting to fully reopen on June 15, Boston, August 1, New York, July 1. 
And I think that as markets reopen, that's the first thing that has to happen. But more importantly, what has to happen for the business transient traveler to return. And the -- in groups to start booking into next year in a more meaningful way is we have to continue to get the pace of vaccines out there, get to herd immunity in the country and very importantly, get our children back-to-school.
And I think that we're hopeful that, that's all going to happen comes to September. I don't know, Sourav, do you have anything you want to add on this point?"

One other point I'd like to make is that October 1 this year is the 50th anniversary of Disney World of the Magic Kingdom and Disney is planning an 18-month celebration, starting October 1. So we expect that we're going to see incredible demand flowing to this hotel. 
One of the things that we looked at is the performance of ultra luxury assets. And if you look at ultra luxury assets over the last 20 years from 1990 to 2019. And those are defined as hotels with a RevPAR of $500 or greater. The CAGR was 6.2%. And if you look at the top 25 markets over that time frame, the CAGR was 3.2%. 
So we think that there is incredible demand out there for this. The resort is becoming a destination onto itself, not only a destination for people who want to stay at Disney, but a vacation destination given the amenities that are on property. I've heard from some people that they take their family to stay at the Four Seasons and the kids only want to go to Magic Kingdom. So all good stuff as we see it going forward. 
And I'll let Sourav talk a little bit about some of the things we're looking at."

So we -- like with any acquisition, we have the best practice to pay book that we will share with the property and then work collaboratively with the management team to implement those best practices. 
For example, we have a best-in-class functional space management strategy to maximize revenue per available space. The meeting space that exists on property. 
We've obviously done a lot with our existing luxury resorts in Florida as well as across our portfolio. Additionally, given that this is a resort and it has a ton of ancillary income as well, it's going to be all about maximizing total RevPAR, which we have again successfully done in implementing it, whether it's the 1 South Beach one of our recent acquisitions or it's Naples in Florida as well. 
So a lot will be -- a lot of focus on total RevPAR and driving ancillary income. We will also work -- and the Four Seasons actually has a very experienced management team, work with them to identify any operating model opportunities as we have successfully again done across our luxury resorts and implement them as soon as possible. 
So we look forward to working with the team. The other piece is, obviously, we're evaluating multiple ROI opportunities, particularly as it relates to food and beverage. Which we are excited to move forward on as well."

So it was completed in November of last year as opposed to a year later, plus or minus. 
We see opportunities going forward, subject to zoning and doing a additional development in Maui takes time. There's a long process, but that we have experience with that, given what we were able to do at the Andaz with the addition of our Villa units. 
And there are opportunities on that land to add rooms to the existing hotel to build another hotel to build a select serve hotel. As we think about it, and use the petition as the Blue -- Play bulk and Blueprint, where we took 27 holes of golf and shrunk it to 18 holes those are things that we're going to think about going forward in Maui."

It is 3 to 5 points of yield index growth relative to where the asset was performing pre renovation. And the assets that we're talking about are not only the 16 Marriott transformational capital program assets but other assets where we invested ROI money such as the doses are and what we're going to be doing at the Ritz and Naples and other hotels across the portfolio. 
Where does it come from? It's tough to say, Chris. We think that in the middle of the pandemic, the 1 asset that we can point to that has really captured a lot of incremental market share is the Coronado Island, Resort & Spa in San Diego. 
I think the yield index gain for well over 9 points at that hotel. So it's going to be case by case, and I don't want to promise anything, but as we are putting money in our hotels and renovating our properties and repositioning them, we're going to have a distinct advantage as business gets back to normal. 
And I personally believe that we should be able to achieved more than 3 to 5 points of yield index growth because we're going to be competing with hotels that haven't been renovated that are going to have to be renovated going forward. And there's going to be incremental disruption associated with those renovations. 
When they do occur, and it's going to have to happen or we're just going to be competing with a tired property. So we are very fortunate to have had the ability to continue to invest in our assets over the course of 2020, and we're doing the same thing this year going forward."

I don't know that it's going to be sustainable, Aryeh. I think that this year, was a unique point in time with businesses closed and people working from home and people being in a position where they can work from anywhere as children get back into schools and as offices open, I think we're going to see a return of business transient traveler and return of group business, and we are just very fortunate that our resort portfolio and our assets in the Sunbelt have carried us through in a material way. 
We never thought that we would be profitable in the first quarter. We had 30 hotels that were profitable for the entire quarter. And I don't know that we talked about this before, but we had 38 hotels 42% of our rooms that were profitable for the month of March. 
So do we think that we're going to continue to see this outsized performance? I think for a -- for the near term, the answer is yes. And when I say near term, we're talking about another year or so because there's so much pent-up demand out there is so much money in savings. 
There is $6 trillion that individuals have in their bank accounts today, they want to spend it. For sure, they want experiences. They're happy to get on the airplane and go. One of the other interesting data points that we look at is air capacity. 
And surprisingly, for Maui, our 3 resorts, I gave you some numbers on how they're trending for June and July, which I don't think anybody would have believed that sitting here a year ago, that we'd be seeing 80% to 90% occupancy at an ADR up 28% and our 3 resorts on Maui. 
It's the only market in the country the only air mark in the country being Maui, that has more capacity right now than it did in 2019. Air capacity from Maui is up 4%. So for the near term, I think you're going to see incredible pent-up demand, replenished travel, we are seeing it. That's going to continue. 
But is it sustainable over the next 3 to 5 years? It's hard to say, but I doubt it. At that point in time, we are really going to be able to compress rates as we have group business and business transient business back in the hotels."

Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieve key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. To be",2395,"Thank you, Tejal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieve key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. 
To begin with, we significantly outperformed expectations for the first quarter, which recorded a GAAP net loss but delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre and hotel-level profitability for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. We grew first quarter total pro forma revenues by 50% sequentially. 
While holding hotel level operating expense growth to only 15% quarter-over-quarter as our operators successfully leveraged the existing resources to meet a stronger-than-expected demand surge in March. 
As a result, we delivered $21 million of positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter, a significant improvement from the negative $62 million recorded in the fourth quarter on a pro forma basis. In addition, we acquired the Hyatt Regency Austin, The Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort and nearly 300 acres of irreplaceable land adjacent to our Hyatt Regency in Maui, strategically investing approximately $800 million of capital at prices that are meaningfully below 2019 levels. Following these transactions, we have a substantial $1.5 billion of total available liquidity, including $131 million of FF&E reserves. 
Operations continued to improve, with April RevPAR expected to exceed March as the vaccine driven margin recovery gains momentum. Finally, in addition to executing substantial strategic investments, we continue to focus on redefining our hotel operating model and positioning our renovated properties to gain market share, key long-term strategic objectives that we believe will position us to achieve best-in-class EBITDA growth through the lodging cycle. 
Beginning with our latest acquisition, the iconic in irreplaceable Four Seasons Resort, Orlando and Walt Disney World Resort. We completed this off-market acquisition on April 30 for approximately $610 million, $40 million less than the price quoted by real estate alert. 
The 444 room resort is located on 289 acres within Disney World, which is one of the world's most visited destination resorts. For context, the Magic Kingdom at Disney World alone attracted nearly 21 million visitors in 2019 according to AECOM and Themed Entertainment Association data. 
The draw of this 1 theme park at Disney World is on par with the approximately 23 million visitors that Boston attracted in 2019 and close to the 24.2 million visitors Miami drew that year. 
The Four Seasons Resort Orlando is the only fee simple luxury resort within Disney world that's not owned by Disney. It provides complementary transport to Disney World's theme parks and is the only AAA 5 diamond rated hotel in Central Florida. 
Newly developed in 2014 and this iconic resort is a market leader with a 2019 RevPAR index of over 215. It is now hosts highest ranked property based on its 2019 RevPAR of $561 and total RevPAR of $923. Moreover, it ranks fifth highest in our portfolio based on its 2019 EBITDA per key of $81,500. 
As with all our strategic objectives, our capital allocation decisions are designed to grow our long-term EBITDA, and we expect this acquisition to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the existing portfolio. The Four Seasons Resort Orlando achieved 90% EBITDA growth from 2016 to 2019. The hotel was profitable in March and the first quarter, and we expect it to be profitable this year, with the latest property forecast indicating that the resort is likely to outperform our underwriting expectations for 2021. 
In general, the resort is well positioned to benefit from a surge in travel and leisure demand as the pandemic subsides and the 18-month celebration of Disney World's 50th anniversary begins in October. We believe these demand catalysts will help the Four Seasons Resort Orlando, surpassed its 2019 EBITDA performance sooner than the rest of our portfolio. 
Shifting to the Hyatt Regency Austin, we opportunistically acquired this 448 room Sunbelt Market hotel on March 15 for $161 million. Acquired off-market at a 10% cap rate and an 8.8x multiple on 2019 EBITDA, the Hyatt Regency Austin's purchase price represents a 20% to 25% discount to estimated pre-COVID pricing and a 40% discount to replacement cost. The hotel was profitable in the first quarter of 2021 and is expected to outperform our underwriting expectations into the second quarter. 
Longer term, we expect the Hyatt Regency Austin to exceed its 2019 EBITDA on a stabilized basis. With profitability to be enhanced by complexion synergies, incremental expense reductions, productivity improvements and ROI investment opportunities. 
Turning to our strategic acquisition of nearly 300 acres of land adjacent to the Hyatt Regency Maui. We acquired the Royal Canapoly and Canapoly Kai Golf Courses for $28 million or approximately $95,000 an acre, which represented a discount to pre-COVID values. 
We are evaluating numerous long-term value-enhancing opportunities for this land, which also provides the near-term potential to generate synergies with the Hyatt Regency Maui. 
To conclude on acquisitions, we have successfully invested $800 million in the first 4 months of 2021 and at meaningful discounts to 2019 pricing levels. This is despite a highly competitive investments landscape with an abundance of capital seeking hotel deals. 
Our success is a testament to the depth of our industry relationships and the strength of our reputation, which is based on decades of best-in-class execution. 
We believe this is an opportune time to strategically grow our portfolio's exposure to markets with high expected growth into superior quality hotels. These early cycle investments have historically provided years of elevated EBITDA growth when time with a period of strong economic recovery. 
Turning to operations. Business volumes grew in each month of the first quarter with March achieving a RevPAR of $84.10, which was 115% higher than our December RevPAR of $39. Moreover, we outperformed the industry's luxury and upper upscale hotel RevPAR performance in our markets by over 2 points in March. 
Our leisure markets, such as Miami, Phoenix and Hawaii, as well as some urban markets, including Washington D.C., Northern Virginia, Atlanta and Philadelphia, outperformed the industry over the first quarter. Our hotel EBITDA turned positive in March. Allowing us to achieve $21 million of positive pro forma hotel EBITDA for the first quarter. 
First quarter revenues were primarily driven by strong leisure demand for our resorts and hotels in the Sunbelt markets and Hawaii as well as by special group business at several of our urban hotels. 
As vaccine deployment accelerated through the first quarter, occupancy in our Sunbelt markets and Hawaii rose from an average of 20% in the first week of January, to 57.4% in the last week of March. Compared to 2019, rate declines improved from negative 12.4% for the month of January, a negative 6.5% for March on a portfolio-wide basis. Strong leisure demand over spring break resulted in the portfolio achieving a 12.2% increase in transient rate over spring break 2019. 8 resorts located in Miami, the Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville, Phoenix and Maui, delivered almost 24% ADR growth over 2019 for the first quarter, with average occupancies of approximately 50%. 
Overall, our luxury hotels have increased their RevPAR index by 23.1% over 2019, with the increase in market share driven by occupancy gains. The 1 hotel South Beach and the Ritz-Carlton Naples were notable outperformers in the quarter, with occupancies ranging between 60% and 70% and transient ADR above $1,000. 
As mentioned last quarter, our hotels in Washington D.C. benefited from government agency group demand around inauguration, making D.C. one of our highest-performing markets based on sequential RevPAR growth, other urban hotels also benefited from special group business, which included film production crews and sports groups, that collectively drove urban weekday occupancy 8.5 percentage points higher quarter-over-quarter. 
In addition, an uptick in leisure transient, business transient and contract demand, supported sequential RevPAR growth in multiple urban markets, including Chicago, Seattle, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. In terms of business mix, leisure drove 90% of our first quarter transient room nights. 
Our operators drove most of our leisure business through direct bookings with loyalty redemptions increasing 33% sequentially driven by our resort portfolio. The much talked about pent-up leisure demand is evidenced in current holiday travel trends, which reflect lengthening booking windows and progressively higher levels of demand. 
For instance, at our Marriott managed leisure market hotels, occupancy on the books improved by 8 percentage points, 9 weeks out from Memorial Day, compared to where those hotels were 9 weeks out from President's Day. 
Similarly, holiday travel trends for July 4 weekend are expected to progressively strengthen relative to Memorial Day. After which many of our hotels are likely to revert to pre pandemic cancellation policies for leisure bookings. 
We expect some of our Sunbelt markets, particularly in Florida and Phoenix, to hold occupancy while rates weaken over the summer. In Hawaii, our Maui resorts are demonstrating continued strength, with occupancy on the books ranging from the mid-80s to the low 90s for June and low to high 70s for July. Remarkably, June ADRs on the books in Maui are nearly 28% higher compared to June 2019, while July ADRs are approximately 50% higher than July 2019. 
Moreover, we have now completed the development of 19 new luxury 2-bedroom villas at the Andaz Maui. The villas already have 45% occupancy on the books at an ADR of $1,700 for the remainder of the year, and bookings continue to grow. 
Moving on to group. We achieved 264,000 group room nights in the first quarter, with 1 highlight being a corporate group of over 4,500 room nights at the Orlando World Center Marriott. The lead for this group came from last October's Connect 2020 conference held at that hotel, which demonstrated how a group event of over 1,000 in person attendees could be held safely. 
We currently have 1.5 million definite room nights on the books for full year 2021, with approximately 1 million of those in the second half of the year. Cancellations remain above 2019 trends, but continue to decline week over week. 
Encouragingly, our Marriott managed properties booked a total of approximately 144,000 new rooms across the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, with strong lead conversion rates compared to 2019. 
Group room nights currently on the books represent approximately 11% of total available rooms in the third quarter and 13% in the fourth quarter. Booking momentum was strong in the first quarter with nearly 165,000 and 154,000 new group room nights booked for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Importantly, our operators have continued to hold future group rates. Compared to 2019, ADR for definite rooms on the books is flat in 2022 and 1.5% higher in 2023. 
Turning to business transient. Demand continues to make steady progress, and first quarter bookings were 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by a steady month-over-month progression. 
Our hotels in San Francisco, San Jose accounted for approximately 30% of the sequential increase in room nights, while ADR rose 17% or $26 over last quarter due to increases from high-rated markets such as Miami, or the Gulf Coast and Phoenix. Most of the special corporate business in the quarter was driven by consulting, project business and government accounts. 
To conclude on operations, there were 76 hotels opened for the first quarter. We reopened Hyatt Regency Capital Hill on May 1 and expect to reopen the Westin Chicago River North and the ibis Rio De Janeiro later this month. By the end of May, we expect only the Sheraton Boston to remain under suspended operations. 
Reflecting on the last 12 months, which have been the most difficult in host history, I am proud of all that we have accomplished and excited by the clarity of our mission, which is to position the company to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth through the new lodging cycle. To achieve that goal, our 3 strategic objectives remain. 
To redefine our operating model with our managers to position our renovated hotels to gain market share and to allocate our capital strategically through acquisitions as well as through development projects. We have quantified the potential returns expected from these investments in the past. And I am going to put all the numbers together for you now. 
From redefining our operating model with our managers, we expect to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term cost savings based on 2019 revenues. From our goal of gaining 3 to 5 points of weighted index growth as the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels as well as 5 other hotels where major renovations have been recently completed or are underway. We expect to generate $21 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis. And finally, from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA on a stabilized annual basis. 
It typically takes renovation and development projects 2 to 3 years to stabilize. As these projects are at different stages of renovation and development, stabilization will occur over several years. 
As a reminder, our recently completed and ongoing development projects include: the ground-up development of the 165 key AC hotel Scottsdale North, 19 new luxury villas at the Andaz Maui, repositioning and expanding the Ritz-Carlton Naples and 60,000 square feet of additional meeting space as well as in Aquatics Park at the Orlando World Center Marriott, our acquisitions of the Four Seasons Resort Orlando and the Hyatt Regency Austin provide us a pro forma 2019 hotel EBITDA base of $1.547 billion. 
While it makes sense to think of 2019 as the base year, the timing of a return to 2019 levels of hotel EBITDA remains highly uncertain, particularly given the unprecedented pandemic driven nature of the downturn. The recovery is may span several years, and our portfolio is likely to continue to evolve over that time. 
However, our goal is for the initiatives and projects underlying our strategic objectives to add a potential $145 million to $220 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized basis. 
With the lodging industry's supply-demand fundamentals continuing to improve, we remain focused on long-term growth and on building a business that is stronger than it was in 2019. We are pleased with our execution to date and feel optimistic about our future as the pandemic receipts and travel continues to rebound. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav."

Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year.We achieved positive",1269,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year.
We achieved positive hotel EBITDA and positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter due to 3 main drivers: a stronger-than-expected increase in demand throughout the quarter, particularly in March, our manager's ability to sequentially increase average room rates by 18% and continued expense control at the property level. As Jim covered the first 2 drivers in his remarks, I will focus on the third. 
First quarter hotel level operating costs rose by only 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, despite an approximately 50% increase in total revenues over the same period. As demand suddenly surged in March, our operators didn't have the time to adjust staffing and other controllable costs from contingency levels implemented since the onset of the pandemic. 
As a result, March variable expenses declined by 70% on total revenue declines of only 62% compared to March 2019. Most of the resulting savings were due to cross utilizing hotel employees across various job functions. 
For the first quarter, variable expenses declined by 74% on total revenue declines of 70% compared to the first quarter of 2019. In future quarters, we expect staffing and other controllable costs to adjust to more normalized levels as demand continues to grow. 
Fixed expenses were 41% lower than the first quarter of 2019. This is a remarkable achievement considering that nearly 20% of the remaining fixed costs are below GOP and consists mainly of expenses such as property taxes and insurance, which don't change with business volumes. 
As part of our goal to redefine the operating model, both Hyatt and Marriott have restructured a number of above property shared service and allocated costs, which were historically completely fixed. 
Additionally, we have worked with the brands to achieve greater flexibility to opt-in to shared services on an as-needed basis, further reducing our fixed costs. Last quarter, we introduced the expense reduction ratio to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue over a comparable pro forma time period in 2019. 
The expense reduction ratio in the second through fourth quarters of 2020 was fairly stable at 0.8. That is, for every 10% decline in hotel revenue, hotel expenses declined 8%. In the first quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.84, much higher than the 0.65 to 0.7 that we expected on our last call for full year 2021. And the highest achieved at any point during the recovery. 
The outsized expense reduction ratio, combined with ADR being down only 9% to the first quarter of 2019, enabled our portfolio to achieve positive hotel level EBITDA at 26.6% occupancy, much better than our previously estimated breakeven range of 35% to 45% with ADRs down 15% to 30% compared to 2019. 
Positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter resulted in positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. 30 hotels representing 30% of total rooms within our portfolio, achieved breakeven or positive hotel EBITDA for the full first quarter. 38 hotels representing 42% of rooms, achieved positive hotel EBITDA in March. March saw additional hotels achieved positive EBITDA in Atlanta, our Texas markets San Diego and L.A. as well as Philadelphia and Hawaii. 
In fact, all 4 of our Hawaii hotels achieved breakeven of positive hotel EBITDA in March. As I just mentioned in the first quarter, revenue came back quicker than expenses, which did grow commensurately, particularly in March. Going forward, our operators are expected to increase staffing and controllable spending more in line with higher levels of demand. 
In addition, other departmental and support expenses, such as sales and marketing as well as maintenance and other support costs will lead to ramp up relative to the first quarter, while remaining well below 2019 levels. Therefore, on a full year basis, we continue to expect the expense reduction ratio to be closer to 0.7. 
Shifting to our top line outlook. While we are not providing guidance at this time, I would like to share how we are thinking about our top line trajectory for the rest of the year. We expect RevPAR to continue increasing sequentially throughout the year, but we expect growth to be driven by occupancy in the second and third quarters. 
We think rates could sequentially decline as we move out of peak season in some of our higher-rated leisure markets. Seasonality in tandem with a normal demand shift toward lower-rated markets could also lead to lower rates in the second and third quarters as we have seen historically. Additionally, rates could come under pressure as suspended hotels reopen in urban markets. 
Moving to business mix. We think business transient will continue to make slow and steady progress during the year. With the anticipated return to office late in the third quarter, driving a ramp-up in business transient demand after Labor Day. 
While we have benefited from nontraditional group demand during the pandemic, we expect traditional groups, corporate and associations to begin ramping up meaningfully in the fourth quarter following the expected return to office after Labor Day. 
Finally, we believe leisure will continue driving total RevPAR at our properties particularly through the summer. We expect our urban hotels to increasingly benefit from leisure demand growth as restrictions in those markets continue to lift and key demand drivers we open. 
As it relates to cash burn for the quarter, our cash burn, excluding capital expenditures, which deducts corporate level expenses and interest payments decreased to $45 million or $138 million, including CapEx. These amounts are down meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by the strong first quarter operating performance. We maintained a strong liquidity position with $1.5 billion of cash, including $131 million of FF&E reserves after adjusting for the Four Seasons Disney Acquisition announced today. And we have no debt maturities until 2023. 
There is 1 accounting item I would like to bring to your attention. Neither we nor our operators expect any furlough accruals, employee retention credits or timing adjustments for these items moving forward as COBRA benefits provided in accordance with the American Rescue plan from April 1st to September 30, of 3 to the furlough associates of our operators and are fully reimbursable for our operators via a credit against their quarterly payroll tax liability. 
Therefore, there is ultimately no cost to the company for providing COBRA benefits and it will not have any P&L impact through the third quarter of this year. 
To conclude, we are very encouraged by the momentum of the lodging recovery, which has driven better-than-expected sequential revenue growth and resulted in positive first quarter hotel EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAre. We are seeing increased demand across all parts of our business, alongside strong rate integrity. We view an expected increase in expenses favorably, too, as that indicates business volumes are ramping back up to normal levels. Combining that with a strong balance sheet and a focus on our 3 strategic objectives: redefining the operating model, gaining market share at our renovated hotels and strategically allocating capital. 
We believe we are well positioned to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth that we expect will continue to be further augmented by external growth opportunities throughout this lodging cycle. 
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question."

And it seems like that bid-ask spread has narrowed dramatically. And it's not the seller that's moving down. Is that the right way to think about what's going on with the transaction market? Is it -- the buyers have gotten much more aggressive, maybe much more confident in the outlook?"

We really like the trajectory that we're on at this point in time. So I will take the congratulations in a tough environment. 
With respect to acquisitions, I think we all agreed that, let's call it a year ago, we believe that there was going to be a lot of distress in the marketplace. And I would point to our Hyatt Regency Austin acquisition as an asset that was under distress. 
The ownership, the borrower in that deal was staring down a UCC foreclosure action that was going to occur at the beginning of April, as you know, we bought the hotel in mid-March or thereabouts. And saved that borrower and paid off all of the debt associated with the hotel and acquired a really good asset at a significant discount to pre-COVID evaluations. 
I think that a couple of things are happening now. There is a lot of equity in the marketplace, chasing deals. Good deals are going to price at close to where they would have priced in 2019. There's no question about it. Solid resorts like the Four Seasons Disney, which are truly iconic and irreplaceable assets. Are going to be fully fairly priced. 
I am not seeing generally a lot of distress in the marketplace today, particularly for the better quality assets. And we are not really seeing a lot of distress across the system right now. So I do think that there is a lot of capital out there. 
I think as you compete more in auction processes, pricing is going to going to be aggressive. However, we're coming out of the worst downturn that we've ever experienced in the lodging industry and the pandemic induced recession in the United States as well, we're turning the corner, and we are firm believers that for the right assets at this stage of the cycle, it's the time to acquire. It's a time to continue to shape the quality of the portfolio that we have. 
We were fortunate that coming into 2020 on a number of different metrics, the company had never been in better shape. We talk a lot about the balance sheet and the firepower that, that's given us to deploy $800 million of capital today. 
What we don't talk about a lot, but I think it's really important that investors understand it is our RevPAR metrics as of January 1, 2020, and our EBITDA per key performance as well as the fact that over the last several years, over the last 5 years, we have consistently tightened up margins year-over-year. 
We had margin improvement going forward. So we are just delighted with where we are. And we hope that we're going to have the opportunity to acquire additional assets early in this cycle so that we can ride the economic wave."

I think you said you have $1.5 billion still remaining for acquisitions, whether you would actually be able to use that budget here in the next 12 months? And then just a little sort of side question. 
I'm curious with the Four Seasons Orlando, you talked about a lot of the acreage there. Is there opportunity to add anything there given it's special location, kind of the only thing not Disney owned, where you can kind of monetize that acreage? Or are there limits on what else you might be able to add to that acreage?"

With respect to deploying the remaining capital that we have, the cash that's on the balance sheet obviously, we have some restrictions in connection with our bank waiver agreement today. 
We're looking forward to the time whenever we're going to come out of that the waiver amendment as operations improve, we're hoping that's going to be sooner rather than later. It's very difficult to hypothetically answer the question of whether or not we're going to be investing additional capital because it's really transaction specific, and we are evaluating a number of opportunities now, we've evaluated a number of opportunities over the course of this year that we've let out because we didn't think they were the right fit for host for 1 reason or another. 
So we have teams that are back on the road. I'm back on the road looking at assets. We have people on the road today as we speak, looking at assets, and we're hopeful that we're going to be able to get some additional capital smartly deployed. 
With respect to the Four Seasons Orlando, the resort sits on roughly 289 acres. And the short answer is that on the acreage that we have today, we do not see a current opportunity to redevelop any of that property. It includes it's -- if you haven't seen this property, I encourage you to look on the website or better yet, go visit it because it is really a fantastic, truly iconic and irreplaceable asset. It has an 18 hole golf course, it has 444 rooms, 55,000 square feet of meeting space, a 13,000 square foot spa, it has a 5-acre water park and tennis courts and 6 food and beverage outlets. 
So while the 289-acre sounds like a lot of acreage, it is being fully utilized today in a very, very efficient and a very useful manner."

Just, Jim, if you could -- sorry, if you could put some color or maybe what you're underwriting for this year, in terms of group, I think in the first quarter, you were at about, I don't know, 20% or 25% of '19 levels for group. 
How do you see that shaping up maybe over the -- through '22? And more specifically, what are you underwriting for the fourth quarter of this year?

And we have, at our Marriott managed properties, we booked 144,000 new room nights this year for 2Q for the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year. 
Of those 144,000 new room nights, about 70% of those were for the second half of the year. So that 1 million room nights that we have on the books for the second half of 2021 equates to 50% of the room nights we had in 2019, same time in 2019. So the split between the bookings is really leaning fourth quarter a little bit, not a lot, call it, 54% in the fourth quarter. 
And the other thing I'd like to add is that we have a high degree of confidence that those groups are going to show up because our managers have just scrubbed all the bookings and to make certain that people aren't just hanging in there are going to cancel at some point in time. So it's not great, but it's good. 
The fact that 1 million room nights are still there and holding up is encouraging. As we look out to 2022, it is -- we have what about 2 million room nights on the books in 2022 Sourav, I think, something like that? And it is very dependent at this point in time on when restrictions are going to be lifted in key markets. 
To just put some back around it, some of the markets in Chicago, I think, just announced yesterday, when they're going to reopen. California is expecting to fully reopen on June 15, Boston, August 1, New York, July 1. 
And I think that as markets reopen, that's the first thing that has to happen. But more importantly, what has to happen for the business transient traveler to return. And the -- in groups to start booking into next year in a more meaningful way is we have to continue to get the pace of vaccines out there, get to herd immunity in the country and very importantly, get our children back-to-school.
And I think that we're hopeful that, that's all going to happen comes to September. I don't know, Sourav, do you have anything you want to add on this point?"

Let me start by saying that this is the type of hotel that we have a lot of experience with and that we have in the past, delivered a lot of value to our shareholders through our asset management and enterprise analytics capabilities. 
As we look at this property out of the box is profitable as we speak. And we're optimistic that the performance of the asset is going to exceed our underwriting expectations for 2021, for sure, the way it's going. There are a lot of things Sourav and I will kind of tag team this a little bit in a moment. But as we look at what's happening in Disney and in the country, we're very optimistic that we're going to see strong performance of this hotel going forward. 
We believe that this property is in a position to perform better from an EBITDA growth profile than the rest of our portfolio and to recover to 2019 levels of EBITDA and beyond sooner than the rest of our portfolio does. 
Additionally, and I'll let Sourav put some color on this, we feel that the asset has multiple asset management opportunities to advance margin and operational improvement. 
One other point I'd like to make is that October 1 this year is the 50th anniversary of Disney World of the Magic Kingdom and Disney is planning an 18-month celebration, starting October 1. So we expect that we're going to see incredible demand flowing to this hotel. 
One of the things that we looked at is the performance of ultra luxury assets. And if you look at ultra luxury assets over the last 20 years from 1990 to 2019. And those are defined as hotels with a RevPAR of $500 or greater. The CAGR was 6.2%. And if you look at the top 25 markets over that time frame, the CAGR was 3.2%. 
So we think that there is incredible demand out there for this. The resort is becoming a destination onto itself, not only a destination for people who want to stay at Disney, but a vacation destination given the amenities that are on property. I've heard from some people that they take their family to stay at the Four Seasons and the kids only want to go to Magic Kingdom. So all good stuff as we see it going forward. 
And I'll let Sourav talk a little bit about some of the things we're looking at."

So we -- like with any acquisition, we have the best practice to pay book that we will share with the property and then work collaboratively with the management team to implement those best practices. 
For example, we have a best-in-class functional space management strategy to maximize revenue per available space. The meeting space that exists on property. 
We've obviously done a lot with our existing luxury resorts in Florida as well as across our portfolio. Additionally, given that this is a resort and it has a ton of ancillary income as well, it's going to be all about maximizing total RevPAR, which we have again successfully done in implementing it, whether it's the 1 South Beach one of our recent acquisitions or it's Naples in Florida as well. 
So a lot will be -- a lot of focus on total RevPAR and driving ancillary income. We will also work -- and the Four Seasons actually has a very experienced management team, work with them to identify any operating model opportunities as we have successfully again done across our luxury resorts and implement them as soon as possible. 
So we look forward to working with the team. The other piece is, obviously, we're evaluating multiple ROI opportunities, particularly as it relates to food and beverage. Which we are excited to move forward on as well."

So it was completed in November of last year as opposed to a year later, plus or minus. 
We see opportunities going forward, subject to zoning and doing a additional development in Maui takes time. There's a long process, but that we have experience with that, given what we were able to do at the Andaz with the addition of our Villa units. 
And there are opportunities on that land to add rooms to the existing hotel to build another hotel to build a select serve hotel. As we think about it, and use the petition as the Blue -- Play bulk and Blueprint, where we took 27 holes of golf and shrunk it to 18 holes those are things that we're going to think about going forward in Maui."

It is 3 to 5 points of yield index growth relative to where the asset was performing pre renovation. And the assets that we're talking about are not only the 16 Marriott transformational capital program assets but other assets where we invested ROI money such as the doses are and what we're going to be doing at the Ritz and Naples and other hotels across the portfolio. 
Where does it come from? It's tough to say, Chris. We think that in the middle of the pandemic, the 1 asset that we can point to that has really captured a lot of incremental market share is the Coronado Island, Resort & Spa in San Diego. 
I think the yield index gain for well over 9 points at that hotel. So it's going to be case by case, and I don't want to promise anything, but as we are putting money in our hotels and renovating our properties and repositioning them, we're going to have a distinct advantage as business gets back to normal. 
And I personally believe that we should be able to achieved more than 3 to 5 points of yield index growth because we're going to be competing with hotels that haven't been renovated that are going to have to be renovated going forward. And there's going to be incremental disruption associated with those renovations. 
When they do occur, and it's going to have to happen or we're just going to be competing with a tired property. So we are very fortunate to have had the ability to continue to invest in our assets over the course of 2020, and we're doing the same thing this year going forward."

I don't know that it's going to be sustainable, Aryeh. I think that this year, was a unique point in time with businesses closed and people working from home and people being in a position where they can work from anywhere as children get back into schools and as offices open, I think we're going to see a return of business transient traveler and return of group business, and we are just very fortunate that our resort portfolio and our assets in the Sunbelt have carried us through in a material way. 
We never thought that we would be profitable in the first quarter. We had 30 hotels that were profitable for the entire quarter. And I don't know that we talked about this before, but we had 38 hotels 42% of our rooms that were profitable for the month of March. 
So do we think that we're going to continue to see this outsized performance? I think for a -- for the near term, the answer is yes. And when I say near term, we're talking about another year or so because there's so much pent-up demand out there is so much money in savings. 
There is $6 trillion that individuals have in their bank accounts today, they want to spend it. For sure, they want experiences. They're happy to get on the airplane and go. One of the other interesting data points that we look at is air capacity. 
And surprisingly, for Maui, our 3 resorts, I gave you some numbers on how they're trending for June and July, which I don't think anybody would have believed that sitting here a year ago, that we'd be seeing 80% to 90% occupancy at an ADR up 28% and our 3 resorts on Maui. 
It's the only market in the country the only air mark in the country being Maui, that has more capacity right now than it did in 2019. Air capacity from Maui is up 4%. So for the near term, I think you're going to see incredible pent-up demand, replenished travel, we are seeing it. That's going to continue. 
But is it sustainable over the next 3 to 5 years? It's hard to say, but I doubt it. At that point in time, we are really going to be able to compress rates as we have group business and business transient business back in the hotels."

Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieved key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. To b",2382,"Thank you, Tejal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Since our earnings call in February, we have made excellent progress on operations and investments and achieved key milestones that we believe will accelerate our EBITDA recovery. 
To begin with, we significantly outperformed expectations for the first quarter, which recorded a GAAP net loss but delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre and hotel-level profitability for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. We grew first quarter total pro forma revenues by 50% sequentially, while holding hotel-level operating expense growth to only 15% quarter-over-quarter as our operators successfully leveraged the existing resources to meet a stronger-than-expected demand surge in March. 
As a result, we delivered $21 million of positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter, a significant improvement from the negative $62 million recorded in the fourth quarter on a pro forma basis. 
In addition, we acquired the Hyatt Regency Austin, the Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort and nearly 300 acres of irreplaceable land adjacent to our Hyatt Regency in Maui, strategically investing approximately $800 million of capital at prices that are meaningfully below 2019 levels. Following these transactions, we have a substantial $1.5 billion of total available liquidity, including $131 million of FF&E reserves. 
Operations continue to improve, with April RevPAR expected to exceed March as the vaccine-driven margin recovery gains momentum. 
Finally, in addition to executing substantial strategic investments, we continue to focus on redefining our hotel operating model and positioning our renovated properties to gain market share, key long-term strategic objectives that we believe will position us to achieve best-in-class EBITDA growth through the lodging cycle. 
Beginning with our latest acquisition, the iconic and irreplaceable Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort. We completed this off-market acquisition on April 30 for approximately $610 million, $40 million less than the price quoted by Real Estate Alert. 
The 444-room resort is located on 289 acres within Disney World, which is one of the world's most visited destination resorts. For context, the Magic Kingdom at Disney World alone attracted nearly 21 million visitors in 2019 according to AECOM and Themed Entertainment Association data. 
The draw of this 1 theme park at Disney World is on par with the approximately 23 million visitors that Boston attracted in 2019 and close to the 24.2 million visitors Miami drew that year. 
The Four Seasons Resort Orlando is the only fee simple luxury resort within Disney world that's not owned by Disney. It provides complementary transport to Disney World's theme parks and is the only AAA 5 diamond rated hotel in Central Florida. 
Newly developed in 2014, this iconic resort is a market leader with a 2019 RevPAR index of over 215. It is now Host's highest ranked property based on its 2019 RevPAR of $561 and total RevPAR of $923. Moreover, it ranks fifth highest in our portfolio based on its 2019 EBITDA per key of $81,500. 
As with all our strategic objectives, our capital allocation decisions are designed to grow our long-term EBITDA, and we expect this acquisition to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the existing portfolio. 
The Four Seasons Resort Orlando achieved 90% EBITDA growth from 2016 to 2019. The hotel was profitable in March and the first quarter, and we expect it to be profitable this year, with the latest property forecast indicating that the resort is likely to outperform our underwriting expectations for 2021. 
In general, the resort is well positioned to benefit from a surge in travel and leisure demand as the pandemic subsides and the 18-month celebration of Disney World's 50th anniversary begins in October. We believe these demand catalysts will help the Four Seasons Resort Orlando surpass its 2019 EBITDA performance sooner than the rest of our portfolio. 
Shifting to the Hyatt Regency Austin, we opportunistically acquired this 448-room Sunbelt Market hotel on March 15 for $161 million. Acquired off-market at a 10% cap rate and an 8.8x multiple on 2019 EBITDA, the Hyatt Regency Austin's purchase price represents a 20% to 25% discount to estimated pre-COVID pricing and a 40% discount to replacement cost. The hotel was profitable in the first quarter of 2021 and is expected to outperform our underwriting expectations into the second quarter. 
Longer term, we expect the Hyatt Regency Austin to exceed its 2019 EBITDA on a stabilized basis, with profitability to be enhanced by complexion synergies, incremental expense reductions, productivity improvements and ROI investment opportunities. 
Turning to our strategic acquisition of nearly 300 acres of land adjacent to the Hyatt Regency Maui. We acquired the Royal Kaanapali and Kaanapali Kai golf courses for $28 million or approximately $95,000 an acre, which represented a discount to pre-COVID values. 
We are evaluating numerous long-term value-enhancing opportunities for this land, which also provides the near-term potential to generate synergies with the Hyatt Regency Maui. 
To conclude on acquisitions, we have successfully invested $800 million in the first 4 months of 2021 at meaningful discounts to 2019 pricing levels. This is despite a highly competitive investments landscape with an abundance of capital seeking hotel deals. Our success is a testament to the depth of our industry relationships and the strength of our reputation, which is based on decades of best-in-class execution. 
We believe this is an opportune time to strategically grow our portfolio's exposure to markets with high expected growth into superior quality hotels. These early cycle investments have historically provided years of elevated EBITDA growth when timed with a period of strong economic recovery. 
Turning to operations. Business volumes grew in each month of the first quarter with March achieving a RevPAR of $84.10, which was 115% higher than our December RevPAR of $39. Moreover, we outperformed the industry's luxury and upper upscale hotel RevPAR performance in our markets by over 2 points in March. 
Our leisure markets, such as Miami, Phoenix and Hawaii, as well as some urban markets, including Washington D.C., Northern Virginia, Atlanta and Philadelphia, outperformed the industry over the first quarter. Our hotel EBITDA turned positive in March, allowing us to achieve $21 million of positive pro forma hotel EBITDA for the first quarter. 
First quarter revenues were primarily driven by strong leisure demand for our resorts and hotels in the Sunbelt markets and Hawaii as well as by special group business at several of our urban hotels. 
As vaccine deployment accelerated through the first quarter, occupancy in our Sunbelt markets and Hawaii rose from an average of 20% in the first week of January, to 57.4% in the last week of March. Compared to 2019, rate declines improved from negative 12.4% for the month of January, to negative 6.5% for March on a portfolio-wide basis. Strong leisure demand over spring break resulted in the portfolio achieving a 12.2% increase in transient rate over spring break 2019. 8 resorts located in Miami, the Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville, Phoenix and Maui, delivered almost 24% ADR growth over 2019 for the first quarter, with average occupancies of approximately 50%. 
Overall, our luxury hotels have increased their RevPAR index by 23.1% over 2019, with the increase in market share driven by occupancy gains. The 1 Hotel South Beach and the Ritz-Carlton Naples were notable outperformers in the quarter, with occupancies ranging between 60% and 70% and transient ADR above $1,000. 
As mentioned last quarter, our hotels in Washington D.C. benefited from government agency group demand around inauguration, making D.C. one of our highest-performing markets based on sequential RevPAR growth. Other urban hotels also benefited from special group business, which included film production crews and sports groups that collectively drove urban weekday occupancy 8.5 percentage points higher quarter-over-quarter. 
In addition, an uptick in leisure transient, business transient and contract demand supported sequential RevPAR growth in multiple urban markets, including Chicago, Seattle, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. 
In terms of business mix, leisure drove 90% of our first quarter transient room nights. Our operators drove most of our leisure business through direct bookings, with loyalty redemptions increasing 33% sequentially driven by our resort portfolio. 
The much talked about pent-up leisure demand is evidenced in current holiday travel trends, which reflect lengthening booking windows and progressively higher levels of demand. For instance, at our Marriott-managed leisure market hotels, occupancy on the books improved by 8 percentage points 9 weeks out from Memorial Day, compared to where those hotels were 9 weeks out from President's Day. 
Similarly, holiday travel trends for July 4 weekend are expected to progressively strengthen relative to Memorial Day, after which many of our hotels are likely to revert to pre-pandemic cancellation policies for leisure bookings. 
We expect some of our Sunbelt markets, particularly in Florida and Phoenix, to hold occupancy while rates weaken over the summer. In Hawaii, our Maui resorts are demonstrating continued strength, with occupancy on the books ranging from the mid-80s to the low-90s for June and low to high 70s for July. Remarkably, June ADRs on the books in Maui are nearly 28% higher compared to June 2019, while July ADRs are approximately 50% higher than July 2019. 
Moreover, we have now completed the development of 19 new luxury 2-bedroom villas at the Andaz Maui. The villas already have 45% occupancy on the books at an ADR of $1,700 for the remainder of the year, and bookings continue to grow. 
Moving on to group. We achieved 264,000 group room nights in the first quarter, with 1 highlight being a corporate group of over 4,500 room nights at the Orlando World Center Marriott. The lead for this group came from last October's Connect 2020 conference held at that hotel, which demonstrated how a group event of over 1,000 in-person attendees could be held safely. 
We currently have 1.5 million definite room nights on the books for full year 2021, with approximately 1 million of those in the second half of the year. Cancellations remain above 2019 trends, but continue to decline week over week. 
Encouragingly, our Marriott managed properties booked a total of approximately 144,000 new rooms across the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, with strong lead conversion rates compared to 2019. Group room nights currently on the books represent approximately 11% of total available rooms in the third quarter and 13% in the fourth quarter. 
Booking momentum was strong in the first quarter with nearly 165,000 and 154,000 new group room nights booked for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Importantly, our operators have continued to hold future group rates. Compared to 2019, ADR for definite rooms on the books is flat in 2022 and 1.5% higher in 2023. 
Turning to business transient. Demand continues to make steady progress, and first quarter bookings were 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by a steady month-over-month progression. 
Our hotels in San Francisco/San Jose accounted for approximately 30% of the sequential increase in room nights, while ADR rose 17% or $26 over last quarter due to increases from high-rated markets such as Miami, or the Gulf Coast and Phoenix. Most of the special corporate business in the quarter was driven by consulting, project business and government accounts. 
To conclude on operations, there were 76 hotels opened for the first quarter. We reopened Hyatt Regency Capitol Hill on May 1 and expect to reopen the Westin Chicago River North and the ibis Rio De Janeiro later this month. By the end of May, we expect only the Sheraton Boston to remain under suspended operations. 
Reflecting on the last 12 months, which have been the most difficult in Host's history, I am proud of all that we have accomplished and excited by the clarity of our mission, which is to position the company to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth through the new lodging cycle. 
To achieve that goal, our 3 strategic objectives remain: to redefine our operating model with our managers; to position our renovated hotels to gain market share; and to allocate our capital strategically through acquisitions as well as through development projects. 
We have quantified the potential returns expected from these investments in the past. And I am going to put all the numbers together for you now. From redefining our operating model with our managers, we expect to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term cost savings based on 2019 revenues. 
From our goal of gaining 3 to 5 points of weighted index growth at the 16 Marriott Transformational Capital Program hotels as well as 5 other hotels where major renovations have been recently completed or are underway, we expect to generate $21 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis. 
And finally, from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA on a stabilized annual basis. 
It typically takes renovation and development projects 2 to 3 years to stabilize. As these projects are at different stages of renovation and development, stabilization will occur over several years. 
As a reminder, our recently completed and ongoing development projects include: the ground-up development of the 165 key AC Hotel Scottsdale North; 19 new luxury villas at the Andaz Maui; repositioning and expanding the Ritz-Carlton Naples; and 60,000 square feet of additional meeting space as well as an aquatics park at the Orlando World Center Marriott.
Our acquisitions of the Four Seasons Resort Orlando and the Hyatt Regency Austin provide us a pro forma 2019 hotel EBITDA base of $1.547 billion. While it makes sense to think of 2019 as the base year, the timing of a return to 2019 levels of hotel EBITDA remains highly uncertain, particularly given the unprecedented pandemic-driven nature of the downturn. 
The recovery may span several years, and our portfolio is likely to continue to evolve over that time. However, our goal is for the initiatives and projects underlying our strategic objectives to add a potential $145 million to $220 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized basis. 
With the lodging industry's supply-demand fundamentals continuing to improve, we remain focused on long-term growth and on building a business that is stronger than it was in 2019. We are pleased with our execution to date and feel optimistic about our future as the pandemic recedes and travel continues to rebound. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav."

Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year.We achieved positive",1246,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I'll provide more color on how we achieved breakeven in the first quarter and how we expect the revenue expense trends to evolve through the course of the year.
We achieved positive hotel EBITDA and positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter due to 3 main drivers: a stronger-than-expected increase in demand throughout the quarter, particularly in March; our managers' ability to sequentially increase average room rates by 18%; and continued expense control at the property level. 
As Jim covered the first 2 drivers in his remarks, I will focus on the third. First quarter hotel-level operating costs rose by only 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, despite an approximately 50% increase in total revenues over the same period. As demand suddenly surged in March, our operators didn't have the time to adjust staffing and other controllable costs from contingency levels implemented since the onset of the pandemic. 
As a result, March variable expenses declined by 70% on total revenue declines of only 62% compared to March 2019. Most of the resulting savings were due to cross utilizing hotel employees across various job functions. 
For the first quarter, variable expenses declined by 74% on total revenue declines of 70% compared to the first quarter of 2019. In future quarters, we expect staffing and other controllable costs to adjust to more normalized levels as demand continues to grow. 
Fixed expenses were 41% lower than the first quarter of 2019. This is a remarkable achievement considering that nearly 20% of the remaining fixed costs are below GOP and consists mainly of expenses such as property taxes and insurance, which don't change with business volumes. 
As part of our goal to redefine the operating model, both Hyatt and Marriott have restructured a number of above-property shared service and allocated costs, which were historically completely fixed. Additionally, we have worked with the brands to achieve greater flexibility to opt-in to shared services on an as-needed basis, further reducing our fixed costs. 
Last quarter, we introduced the expense reduction ratio to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue over a comparable pro forma time period in 2019. The expense reduction ratio in the second through fourth quarters of 2020 was fairly stable at 0.8. That is, for every 10% decline in hotel revenue, hotel expenses declined 8%. 
In the first quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.84, much higher than the 0.65 to 0.7 that we expected on our last call for full year 2021, and the highest achieved at any point during the recovery. 
The outsized expense reduction ratio, combined with ADR being down only 9% to the first quarter of 2019, enabled our portfolio to achieve positive hotel-level EBITDA at 26.6% occupancy, much better than our previously estimated break-even range of 35% to 45% with ADRs down 15% to 30% compared to 2019. 
Positive hotel EBITDA for the quarter resulted in positive adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. 30 hotels representing 30% of total rooms within our portfolio, achieved breakeven or positive hotel EBITDA for the full first quarter. 38 hotels representing 42% of rooms, achieved positive hotel EBITDA in March. March saw additional hotels achieve positive EBITDA in Atlanta, our Texas markets San Diego and L.A. as well as Philadelphia and Hawaii. In fact, all 4 of our Hawaii hotels achieved breakeven of positive hotel EBITDA in March. 
As I just mentioned, in the first quarter, revenue came back quicker than expenses, which didn't grow commensurately, particularly in March. Going forward, our operators are expected to increase staffing and controllable spending more in line with higher levels of demand. 
In addition, other departmental and support expenses, such as sales and marketing as well as maintenance and other support costs, will need to ramp up relative to the first quarter, while remaining well below 2019 levels. Therefore, on a full year basis, we continue to expect the expense reduction ratio to be closer to 0.7. 
Shifting to our top line outlook. While we are not providing guidance at this time, I would like to share how we are thinking about our top line trajectory for the rest of the year. 
We expect RevPAR to continue increasing sequentially throughout the year, but we expect growth to be driven by occupancy in the second and third quarters. We think rates could sequentially decline as we move out of peak season in some of our higher-rated leisure markets. Seasonality in tandem with a normal demand shift toward lower-rated markets could also lead to lower rates in the second and third quarters as we have seen historically. Additionally, rates could come under pressure as suspended hotels reopen in urban markets. 
Moving to business mix. We think business transient will continue to make slow and steady progress during the year, with the anticipated return to office late in the third quarter, driving a ramp-up in business transient demand after Labor Day. 
While we have benefited from nontraditional group demand during the pandemic, we expect traditional groups, corporate and associations, to begin ramping up meaningfully in the fourth quarter following the expected return to office after Labor Day. 
Finally, we believe leisure will continue driving total RevPAR at our properties particularly through the summer. We expect our urban hotels to increasingly benefit from leisure demand growth as restrictions in those markets continue to lift and key demand drivers reopen. 
As it relates to cash  burn for the quarter, our cash burn, excluding capital expenditures, which deducts corporate level expenses and interest payments, decreased to $45 million or $138 million including CapEx. These amounts are down meaningfully from the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by the strong first quarter operating performance. 
We maintain a strong liquidity position with $1.5 billion of cash, including $131 million of FF&E reserves after adjusting for the Four Seasons Disney acquisition announced today. And we have no debt maturities until 2023. 
There is 1 accounting item I would like to bring to your attention. Neither we nor our operators expect any furlough accruals, employee retention credits or timing adjustments for these items moving forward as COBRA benefits provided in accordance with the American Rescue Plan from April 1 to September 30, are free to the furloughed associates of our operators and are fully reimbursable to our operators via a credit against their quarterly payroll tax liability. 
Therefore, there is ultimately no cost to the company for providing COBRA benefits and it will not have any P&L impact through the third quarter of this year. 
To conclude, we are very encouraged by the momentum of the lodging recovery, which has driven better-than-expected sequential revenue growth and resulted in positive first quarter hotel EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAre. 
We are seeing increased demand across all parts of our business, alongside strong rate integrity. We view an expected increase in expenses favorably, too, as that indicates business volumes are ramping back up to normal levels. Combining that with a strong balance sheet and a focus on our 3 strategic objectives: redefining the operating model; gaining market share at our renovated hotels; and strategically allocating capital, we believe we are well positioned to deliver best-in-class EBITDA growth that we expect will continue to be further augmented by external growth opportunities throughout this lodging cycle. 
And with that, we will be happy to take any questions. [Operator Instructions]"

It was much better-than-expected quarter. I wanted to ask you a question about acquisitions.

And it seems like that bid-ask spread has narrowed dramatically. And it's not the seller that's moving down. Is that the right way to think about what's going on with the transaction market? Is it the buyers have gotten much more aggressive and maybe much more confident in the outlook?"

We really like the trajectory that we're on at this point in time. So I will take the congratulations in a tough environment. 
With respect to acquisitions, I think we all agreed that, let's call it a year ago, we believed that there was going to be a lot of distress in the marketplace. And I would point to our Hyatt Regency Austin acquisition as an asset that was under distress. The ownership, the borrower in that deal was staring down a UCC foreclosure action that was going to occur at the beginning of April. As you know, we bought the hotel in mid-March or thereabouts and saved that borrower and paid off all of the debt associated with the hotel and acquired a really good asset at a significant discount to pre-COVID valuations. 
I think that a couple of things are happening now. There is a lot of equity in the marketplace, chasing deals. Good deals are going to price at close to where they would have priced in 2019. There's no question about it. Solid resorts like the Four Seasons Disney, which are truly iconic and irreplaceable assets, are going to be fully fairly priced. 
I am not seeing generally a lot of distress in the marketplace today, particularly for the better quality assets. And we are not really seeing a lot of distress across the system right now. So I do think that there is a lot of capital out there. 
I think as you compete more in auction processes, pricing is going to be aggressive. However, we're coming out of the worst downturn that we've ever experienced in the lodging industry and the pandemic-induced recession in the United States as well. We're turning the corner, and we are firm believers that for the right assets, at this stage of the cycle, it's the time to acquire. It's a time to continue to shape the quality of the portfolio that we have. 
We were fortunate that coming into 2020 on a number of different metrics, the company had never been in better shape. We talk a lot about the balance sheet and the firepower that that's given us to deploy $800 million of capital today. What we don't talk about a lot, but I think it's really important that investors understand it is our RevPAR metrics as of January 1, 2020, and our EBITDA per key performance as well as the fact that over the last several years, over the last 5 years, we have consistently tightened up margins year-over-year. We had margin improvement going forward. 
So we are just delighted with where we are. And we hope that we're going to have the opportunity to acquire additional assets early in this cycle so that we can ride the economic wave."

And then just a little sort of side question. I'm curious with the Four Seasons Orlando, you talked about a lot of the acreage there. Is there opportunity to add anything there given its special location, kind of the only thing not Disney owned, where you could kind of monetize that acreage? Or are there limits on what else you might be able to add to that acreage?"

With respect to deploying the remaining capital that we have, the cash that's on the balance sheet, obviously, we have some restrictions in connection with our bank waiver agreement today. We're looking forward to the time whenever we're going to come out of that, the waiver amendment. As operations improve, we're hoping that's going to be sooner rather than later. 
It's very difficult to hypothetically answer the question of whether or not we're going to be investing additional capital because it's really transaction specific, and we are evaluating a number of opportunities now. We've evaluated a number of opportunities over the course of this year that we've let out because we didn't think they were the right fit for Host for 1 reason or another. 
So we have teams that are back on the road. I'm back on the road looking at assets. We have people on the road today as we speak, looking at assets, and we're hopeful that we're going to be able to get some additional capital smartly deployed. 
With respect to the Four Seasons Orlando, the resort sits on roughly 289 acres. And the short answer is that on the acreage that we have today, we do not see a current opportunity to redevelop any of that property. It includes it's -- if you haven't seen this property, I encourage you to look on the website or better yet, go visit it because it is really a fantastic, truly iconic and irreplaceable asset. It has an 18-hole golf course. It has 444 rooms, 55,000 square feet of meeting space, a 13,000 square foot spa. It has a 5-acre water park and tennis courts and 6 food and beverage outlets. 
So while the 289 acres sounds like a lot of acreage, it is being fully utilized today in a very, very efficient and a very useful manner."

Just, Jim, if you could, or, Sourav, if you could put some color or maybe what you're underwriting for this year in terms of group, I think in the first quarter, you were at about, I don't know, 20% or 25% of '19 levels for group. How do you see that shaping up maybe over the -- through '22? And more specifically, what are you underwriting for the fourth quarter of this year?

I'll start, and maybe I can have Sourav chime in as well. For the second half of 2021, we had 1 million group room nights on the books.

For the second half of 2021, we had 1 million group room nights on the books. And we have -- at our Marriott managed properties, we booked 144,000 new room nights this year for 2Q, for the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year. Of those 144,000 new room nights, about 70% of those were for the second half of the year. 
So that 1 million room nights that we have on the books for the second half of 2021 equates to 50% of the room nights we had in 2019, same time in 2019. So the split between the bookings is really leaning fourth quarter a little bit, not a lot, call it, 54% in the fourth quarter. 
And the other thing I'd like to add is that we have a high degree of confidence that those books are going -- those groups are going to show up because our managers have just scrubbed all the bookings and to make certain that people aren't just hanging in there are going to cancel at some point in time. 
So it's not great, but it's good. The fact that 1 million room nights are still there and holding up is encouraging. 
As we look out to 2022, it is -- we have, what, about 2 million room nights on the books in 2022, Sourav? I think something like that? And it is very dependent at this point in time on when restrictions are going to be lifted in key markets. 
To just put some fact around it, some of the markets in Chicago, I think just announced yesterday, when they're going to reopen. California is expecting to fully reopen on June 15; Boston, August 1; New York, July 1. And I think that as markets reopen, that's the first thing that has to happen. But more importantly, what has to happen for the business transient traveler to return. And the -- and groups to start booking into next year in a more meaningful way is we have to continue to get the pace of vaccines out there, get to herd immunity in the country and very importantly, get our children back to school. And I think that we're hopeful that that's all going to happen come September. I don't know, Sourav, do you have anything you want to add on this point?"

We put a lot of thought into it as we do in every acquisition. Let me start by saying that this is the type of hotel that we have a lot of experience with and that we have, in the past, delivered a lot of value to our shareholders through our asset management and enterprise analytics capabilities. 
As we look at this property out of the box, it's profitable as we speak. And we're optimistic that the performance of the asset is going to exceed our underwriting expectations for 2021, for sure, the way it's going. There are a lot of things that Sourav and I will kind of tag team this a little bit in a moment. But as we look at what's happening in Disney and in the country, we're very optimistic that we're going to see strong performance at this hotel going forward. 
We believe that this property is in a position to perform better from an EBITDA growth profile than the rest of our portfolio and to recover to 2019 levels of EBITDA and beyond sooner than the rest of our portfolio does. 
Additionally, and I'll let Sourav put some color on this, we feel that the asset has multiple asset management opportunities to advance margin and operational improvement. 
One other point I'd like to make is that October 1 this year is the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World, of the Magic Kingdom and Disney is planning an 18-month celebration starting October 1. So we expect that we're going to see incredible demand flowing to this hotel. 
One of the things that we looked at is the performance of ultra-luxury assets. And if you look at ultra-luxury assets over the last 20 years, from 1990 to 2019, those are defined as hotels with a RevPAR of $500 or greater. The CAGR was 6.2%. If you look at the top 25 markets over that time frame, the CAGR was 3.2%. 
So we think that there is incredible demand out there for this. The resort is becoming a destination unto itself, not only a destination for people who want to stay at Disney, but a vacation destination given the amenities that are on property. I've heard from some people that they take their family to stay at the Four Seasons and the kids only want to go to Magic Kingdom. So all good stuff as we see it going forward. 
And I'll let Sourav talk a little bit about some of the things we're looking at."

So we -- like with any acquisition, we have the best practice playbook that we will share with the property and then work collaboratively with the management team to implement those best practices. 
For example, we have a best-in-class functional space management strategy to maximize revenue per available space. The meeting space that exists on property, we've obviously done a lot with our existing luxury resorts in Florida as well as across our portfolio. 
Additionally, given that this is a resort and it has a ton of ancillary income as well, it's going to be all about maximizing total RevPAR, which we have again successfully done in implementing at whether it's the 1 South Beach, our most -- one of our recent acquisitions or it's The Ritz, Naples in Florida as well. So a lot will be -- a lot of focus on total RevPAR and driving ancillary income. 
We will also work -- and the Four Seasons actually has a very experienced management team, work with them to identify any operating model opportunities as we have successfully again done across our luxury resorts and implement them as soon as possible. So we look forward to working with the team. 
The other piece is, obviously, we're evaluating multiple ROI opportunities, particularly as it relates to food and beverage, which we are excited to move forward on as well."

So it was completed in November of last year as opposed to a year later, plus or minus. 
We see opportunities going forward, subject to zoning and doing a additional development in Maui takes time. There's a long process, but we have experience with that, given what we were able to do at the Andaz with the addition of our villa units. And there are opportunities on that land to add rooms to the existing hotel, to build another hotel, to build a select serve hotel.

It is 3 to 5 points of yield index growth relative to where the asset was performing pre-renovation. And the assets that we're talking about are not only the 16 Marriott Transformational Capital Program assets but other assets where we invested ROI money such as the Don CeSar and what we're going to be doing at The Ritz in Naples and other hotels across the portfolio. 
Where does it come from? It's tough to say, Chris. We think that in the middle of the pandemic, the 1 asset that we can point to that has really captured a lot of incremental market share is the Coronado Island Resort & Spa in San Diego. I think the yield index came to well over 9 points at that hotel. 
So it's going to be case by case, and I don't want to promise anything, but as we are putting money in our hotels and renovating our properties and repositioning them, we're going to have a distinct advantage as business gets back to normal. 
And I personally believe that we should be able to achieve more than 3 to 5 points of yield index growth because we're going to be competing with hotels that haven't been renovated that are going to have to be renovated going forward. And there's going to be incremental disruption associated with those renovations when they do occur, and it's going to have to happen or we're just going to be competing with a tired property.

As children get back into schools and as offices open, I think we're going to see a return of business transient traveler and return of group business, and we are just very fortunate that our resort portfolio and our assets in the Sunbelt have carried us through in a material way. 
We never thought that we would be profitable in the first quarter. We had 30 hotels that were profitable for the entire quarter. And I don't know that we talked about this before, but we had 38 hotels, 42% of our rooms, that were profitable for the month of March. 
So do we think that we're going to continue to see this outsized performance? I think for a -- for the near term, the answer is yes. And when I say near term, we're talking about another year or so because there's so much pent-up demand out, there is so much money in savings. There is $6 trillion that individuals have in their bank accounts today. They want to spend it. For sure, they want experiences. They're happy to get on an airplane and go. 
One of the other interesting data points that we look at is air capacity. And surprisingly, for Maui, our 3 resorts, I gave you some numbers on how they're trending for June and July, which I don't think anybody would have believed that sitting here a year ago, that we'd be seeing 80s to 90% occupancy at an ADR of 28% at our 3 resorts on Maui. 
It's the only market in the country, the only air market in the country being Maui, that has more capacity right now than it did in 2019. Air capacity for Maui is up 4%. So for the near term, I think you're going to see incredible pent-up demand. Revenge travel, we are seeing it. That's going to continue. 
But is it sustainable over the next 3 to 5 years? It's hard to say, but I doubt it. At that point in time, we are really going to be able to compress rates as we have group business and business transient business back in the hotels."

As the saying goes, the trend is your friend, and that has certainly been the case for a Host in the broader lodging sector since the first quarter. 
While we are paying close attention to the delta variant, and the potential impacts to our business, we are very pleased with the performance of our portfolio. We are seeing increased demand across all business segments as market restrictions lift and the lodging recovery gains momentum. [ TSA ] passenger throughput trends have accelerated since Memorial Day and are currently about 80% of 2019 levels compared to 60% in April. 
Leisure demand remains resilient and group and business transient volumes continue to trend in the right direction. We significantly outperformed expectations and meaningfully beat consensus estimates on all metrics in the second quarter. Our RevPAR increased 55% over the first quarter. We delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre of $110 million, pro forma hotel EBITDA of $126 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.12. Each of these metrics saw a meaningful sequential increases over the first quarter. For the second quarter, pro forma revenues increased 54% over the first quarter while hotel level operating expenses grew by only 32%. The increase in revenues was driven by stronger-than-anticipated demand continued expense savings from redefining the operating model and slower-than-expected hiring in Sunbelt market. 
These factors led to a 400% increase in pro forma hotel EBITDA in the second quarter versus the first quarter. We are continuing to see green shoots across all aspects of our business as the lodging recovery gains momentum. As a result, we are pleased to announce that as of August 1, all of our properties are open and operating with the exception of our latest acquisition, the former Hotel Alessandra, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. 
In tandem with the operational recovery, we are continuing to increase the expected EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio and improve the quality of our assets by executing on our 3 strategic objectives, which are to redefine the hotel operating model, gain market share at renovated hotels and strategically allocate capital. As it relates to our capital allocation strategy, we closed on 2 more off-market acquisitions since our last call in May. The Baker’s Cay Resort in Key Largo and a former Hotel Alessandra, a luxury downtown hotel in Houston Central Business District. Along with our previously announced acquisitions, these 2 hotels bring our 2021 year-to-date acquisitions to $1.1 billion at a 13.8x EBITDA multiple, which is based on 2019 EBITDA or projected normalized operations in the case of Baker’s Cay and the former Hotel Alessandra. After taking into account these 2 acquisitions, we have $1.3 billion of total available liquidity, including $139 million of FF&E reserves. As a reminder, we discussed the acquisition of 2 hotels and 2 bulk courses on Maui on our first quarter earnings call. We purchased the 448-room Hyatt Regency Austin for $161 million or $359,000 [ per key ] at a 10% cap rate and 8.8x multiple on 2019 NOI and EBITDA, respectively. 
We also purchased the 444 key Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort for $610 million or $1.4 million per key at a 4.7% cap rate and 16.8x EBITDA multiple on 2019 NOI and EBITDA, respectively. We expect this iconic adn irreplaceable resort to stabilize between 12 and 14x EBITDA in the 2023 and 2025 time frame. We also acquired the Royal Ka’anapali and Ka’anapali Kai Golf Courses in Maui for $28 million. All 3 of these acquisitions are performing meaningfully ahead of our underwriting expectations. 
As of June, the Hyatt Regency Austin is $4.1 million higher than our full year 2021 EBITDA forecast and the Four Seasons Resort Orlando is $11.7 million higher. Additionally, the golf courses have an expected cash-on-cash return of approximately 11% for the calendar year 2021. 
Turning to our most recent acquisitions. First, the Baker’s Cay Resort Key Largo, a beach front property and our first asset in the Florida Keys. We closed on this off-market acquisition on July 1 for $200 million through a long-standing relationship with the seller. The resort was attractively priced at an estimated 6.2% cap rate and 14.5x EBITDA multiple on 2021 forecast. While the property was closed for much of 2019 as it went through an extended renovation, this 2021 forecast performance would rank 8th in our 2019 pro forma portfolio on both RevPAR and EBITDA per key. 
Through opportunities we have identified to organically grow EBITDA at a property, we expect it to stabilize at approximately 13x EBITDA between 2023 and 2025. The 200-room resort in Hilton's Curio Collection is located on 13 acres of irreplaceable beachfront land on Key Largo Gulf Coast. The resort is in excellent condition after reopening in 2019 following a complete renovation totaling $63 million or [ $315,000 ] per room. We are thrilled to have a presence in Key Largo as it benefits from the favorable supply demand dynamics of the keys while still being close to Mainland Florida. The resort is about an hour drive from the Miami Airport and it is within a 5-hour drive for over 22 million Florida residents. 
This proximity to the mainland also allows for greater access labor relative to keys that are further south. The Florida Keys are highly desirable from an owner's perspective given the unique supply and demand dynamics in the market. A rate of growth ordinance ensures that new hotel rooms can only be added if they replace existing entitled dwelling units, which has led to a 4% supply increase in the keys from 2000 to 2019 versus 25% for the U.S. according to STR. 
That, in turn, has led the keys consistently having leading upper upscale RevPAR and RevPAR growth as detailed in the Baker’s Cay presentation on our website. Moving on to our most recent acquisition, the former Hotel Alessandra, a luxury downtown hotel in Houston Central business district. We opportunistically acquired this 223-room hotel for $65 million or $291,000 per room on July 2 prior to a scheduled foreclosure action. Our ability to source and close on this distressed, off-market acquisition is truly a testament to Host's deep industry relationships, strong balance sheet, and ability to close reliably and quickly. 
Having recently opened in October 2017, This hotel is in excellent condition, and we expect little to no capital to be invested in the near term. At $65 million, we purchased the hotel for an approximate 30% discount to its $90 million development cost. The hotel is currently closed and is fully unencumbered by brand and management. We have engaged HEI to operate this hotel with a nationally recognized brand reservation system and loyalty program, thereby maximizing its attractiveness to business transient and leisure guests. 
While this hotel had not reached stabilization in 2019, based on our forecast for normalized operations, which assumes a new manager, brand and operations in line with the 2019 operations of comparable Houston properties, the price would represent a 9.6% cap rate and 9.2x EBITDA multiple. Additionally, we have identified a number of opportunities to explore with our new operator, which we believe will increase the EBITDA growth profile of this hotel. We have deep knowledge of the Houston market, given our existing ownership of 4 hotels in the city. The former Hotel Alessandra is part of the green stream mixed-use development in the center of downtown Houston, which has the second largest concentration of public companies in the U.S., including 24 Fortune 500 companies. 
In addition, Houston is the #2 U.S. metropolitan area by job growth according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the [ CBD ] grew RevPAR by 10% from 2016 to 2019. In total, we have invested $1.1 billion in early cycle acquisitions thus far in 2021 at a 13.8x EBITDA multiple. This compares favorably to the $3.5 billion of assets we disposed of at a blended 17x EBITDA multiple between 2018 and 2020. 
We continue to believe this is an opportune time to improve the quality of our portfolio by investing in markets with high expected growth. Our early cycle investments have historically provided years of elevated EBITDA growth alongside periods of strong economic recovery. Moving on to operations. We are excited to announce that we have reopened the 3 remaining hotels that have previously suspended operations. The Ibis Rio De Janeiro opened on May 10 and the Western River North opened on May 19. The Sheraton Boston reopened on August 1, well ahead of our expectations due to an increase in group business demand  With the exception of our newly acquired hotel in Houston, which we expect to open later this year, our portfolio is now fully open and ready to take advantage of the next lodging cycle. 
Looking at second quarter operations, the recovery momentum continued to play out, driven once again by robust rates in our resort market as leisure demand was stronger than anticipated after the spring holidays. Portfolio-wide pro forma RevPAR sequentially improved each month, and we ended the second quarter with RevPAR just shy of $100. June RevPAR came in at over $111 representing a 25% increase over March and preliminary July RevPAR is expected to be in the mid-$130 range. 
Portfolio hotel level EBITDA has remained positive each month since March, with 52 hotels delivering positive EBITDA in the second quarter, representing 56% of rooms an increase from 31 hotels, representing 31% of rooms achieved in the first quarter of '21. We were particularly encouraged that June was the first month that our nonresort portfolio also realized positive hotel EBITDA driven by our properties in San Diego, San Antonio and New Orleans. 
As markets have lifted restrictions, demand has also improved at our urban hotels. Transient room nights in New York, New Orleans, San Francisco and Chicago grew significantly from the first quarter to the second quarter with New York up over 200%. 
Importantly, both room nights and rates have increased steadily each month since March. Leisure market weekly occupancy ended at 62% the last week in June, a 3 percentage point increase over the end of the first quarter. Urban and downtown market weekly occupancy recovery continues to be promising, finishing the quarter at 43%, up 15 percentage points from the beginning of the quarter with ADR up over 10% quarter-over-quarter. 
Turning to business mix. Pent-up leisure demand at our resorts has spilled over into the summer months and continues to lead the operational recovery. In the second quarter, both rate and revenue at all of our resorts not only exceeded our first quarter results but also surpassed 2019 levels. Resort revenue increased approximately $50 million over 2019 driven by 35,000 more room nights sold with a remarkable $95 increase in rates. 
This is particularly noteworthy as substantial room night increases have historically resulted in rate erosion. In the second quarter, 11 of our resorts had rates more than 25% above the second quarter of 2019. 
Transitioning to group demand. Our hotel sold nearly 344,000 group room nights in the second quarter, up 29% to first quarter. As a result, group revenue was up 39% over the first quarter, which includes an 8% rate improvement. Group demand in the second quarter was mostly concentrated in Sunblet markets, although Boston in Denver were also contributors. 
We were encouraged to see meaningful month-over-month growth in both corporate and association group business. Looking forward, we currently have 1.2 million group rooms booked in the second half of the year, which is up approximately 20% since our last earnings call. 
Of the roughly 200,000 net group room nights booked in the second quarter for the second half of 2021, we are encouraged that over 2/3 of them were booked in Houston, Boston, New York and Denver. Net booking activity for 2022 also improved each month in the second quarter, resulting in 213,000 room nights [indiscernible]. Our managers remain focused on holding future group rates thus ADR in the books is slightly higher than the same period in 2019. 
We now have 2.4 million definite group room nights on the books, which represents 50% of 2019 actual group room nights. For comparison, in the second quarter of 2019, definite group room nights on the books for 2020 were [ 60% ] of 2019 actuals. Our group bookings for 2023 are echoing a very similar story. As of the second quarter, our net booking activity for 2023 totals 109,000 rooms, which sequentially increased each month in the quarter. 
In addition, our average rate on the books is slightly above levels for the same time in 2019. Finishing with business transient, we remain encouraged by the sequential growth we are seeing in this segment. Special corporate rooms sold in the second quarter were up over 100% compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in Denver, Texas, California, New York and Atlanta. 
We are also seeing booking activity come back from traditional top accounts, which include a mix of financial, government and consulting companies. We continue to believe that business transient demand will evolve post Labor Day with [indiscernible] in session and the return to office for many companies. 
We are pleased to have shown a monthly average growth rate of nearly 30% in business transient room nights and revenue since January of this year. As I wrap up my comments, I would like to reiterate the incremental EBITDA we expect to achieve as we emerge from the pandemic into a new lodging cycle. Our acquisitions year-to-date provide us an estimated pro forma 2019 hotel EBITDA base of [ $1.570 billion ]. While it makes sense to think of 2019 as the base year, the timing of a return to 2019 levels of the hotel EBITDA remains highly uncertain, particularly given the unprecedented pandemic-driven nature of the downturn. The recovery may span several years, and our portfolio is likely to continue to evolve over that time. 
In addition, we expect $145 million to $220 million of annual incremental EBITDA on a stabilized basis over time coming from 3 strategic directives. First, redefining the operating model with our managers, which is expected to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term expense savings based on 2019 revenues. We have taken initial steps towards 50% to 60% of these savings to date. Second, gaining an expected 3 to 5 points of weighted RevPAR index growth at the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels as well as 5 other hotels where major renovations have recently been completed or are underway. As part of the Marriott program, during the second quarter, we completed the Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island and we will complete the multiyear transformation of the New York Marriott Marquis in 2 weeks. We expect to complete approximately 85% of the Marriott transformational capital program by year-end. The 5 other major renovations have expected completion dates through 2023. 
We expect these repositionings to generate $21 million to $35 million of annual incremental EBITDA on a stabilized basis over time. And finally, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of annual incremental EBITDA on a stabilized basis from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects with expected completion dates by the end of 2022. Renovation and development projects typically take 2 to 3 years to stabilize after completion. And as these projects are at different stages of the process, stabilization will occur over several years. 
During the quarter, we completed the development of a new waterpark at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort Naples and additional villas at the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort. The [ 19 2-bedroom ] luxury villas achieved occupancy of 73% in the first full month of operation at an average rate of over $1,600 an -- This compares favorably to our underwriting assumptions of mid-30% occupancy at an average rate of over $1,400 for the full year 2021. To conclude my remarks, we are very encouraged by the operational recovery we are seeing in our hotels and across the lodging industry as demand accelerates. While we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the delta variant, we remain optimistic and well positioned to execute on our long-term goal of increasing the EBITDA growth profile and improving the quality of our portfolio. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav."
29574,1673840747,2362602,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on second quarter cash flow, operating expenses and our view on revenue and expense trends for the back half of 2021. During the second quarter, we generated positiv",1073,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on second quarter cash flow, operating expenses and our view on revenue and expense trends for the back half of 2021. During the second quarter, we generated positive cash flow from operations for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. Starting with pro forma hotel EBITDA of $126 million and backing out $65 million, the majority of which is made up of interest and corporate overhead, we generated [ $61 million ] of cash during the quarter. 
If you take into account our ongoing capital expenditure program, which totaled $87 million for the second quarter and includes ROI projects, maintenance CapEx and the Marriott transformational capital program, our net cash outflow was only $26 million. In addition, we maintained a strong liquidity position with $1.3 billion of cash, including $139 million of FF&E reserves after adjusting for our 2 hotel acquisitions in July. And we have no debt maturities until October 2023. 
Moving on to expenses. Total operating costs in the second quarter rose by only 32% compared to the first quarter despite a 54% increase in total revenues. Beginning in March, we proactively increased rate in our leisure markets given a demand surge and benefited from outsized out-of-room spend. That said, the slow pace of hiring by our operators caused operating expenses to remain unsustainably low, which we do not expect to continue. Variable expenses were down 59% relative to a total revenue decline of 54% when compared to the second quarter of 2019. These figures had kept pace with each other through February. But since March, revenues have come back faster than variable expenses. We expect this gap to narrow as we progress through 2021 and hiring increases to levels more in line with demand. 
Fixed expenses, including wages and benefits, were 32% lower than the second quarter of 2019 and 18% higher than last quarter. Hotel operating costs such as contract services, maintenance and utility costs were a driver of this modest quarter-over-quarter increase and some traditionally fixed expenses came back with increased business volumes. As it relates to above-property shared service expenses, both Marriott and Hyatt continue to provide cost relief and flexibility for services. 
Areas of savings in the second quarter include above-property sales and marketing, revenue management and IT costs. As a reminder, we introduced the expense reduction ratio several quarters ago to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue over a comparable pro forma time period in 2019. During the second quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.84 which means that for every 10% decline in hotel revenue compared to pro forma second quarter 2019, there was an 8.4% reduction in expenses. For reference, in the second quarter of 2021, total operating expenses were down 46% versus 2019 on revenues down 54%. 
This is the second quarter in a row that our expense reduction ratio came in much higher than our anticipated range of 0.65 to 0.70. While this is positive for profitability, this level of expense reduction is not sustainable in the long run, and it reflects the hiring challenges our operators are facing in certain markets. Our ratio in the second quarter also reflects better-than-expected ADR as well as tight expense control by our operators. 
Had our rate been closer to our forecast and hiring ramped up as expected, we estimate that our second quarter expense reduction ratio would have been 0.72. As we think about the second half of 2021, we are anticipating an expense reduction ratio in the 0.75 to 0.80 range. This partly reflects a rate decline in the third quarter driven by a shift in the mix of business as properties ramp up operations. In addition, expense levels are anticipated to be more normalized as hiring continues ramping up in the labor challenged markets. Moving to our top line outlook. We are still unable to provide guidance at this time. That said, similar to the second quarter, we expect strong momentum in our top line growth trajectory in the second half of the year as business transient and group volumes increase. We continue to expect occupancy gains to drive RevPAR increases over the second half of the year. As a reminder, we expect that rate will decline in the third quarter before picking back up in the fourth quarter as the extended peak season [indiscernible] benefited from and our high-rated leisure market shifts towards lower rated markets. We are still expecting steady increases in business transient and group demand with more pronounced increases beginning after Labor Day in conjunction with the return to office for many companies. 
We expect this to primarily benefit corporate and association group business. Based on a global business travel association survey in July, 63% of companies plan to resume domestic business travel in the next 1 to 3 months, which is up 35 points from the March survey. We continue to expect leisure travel to drive total RevPAR at our properties, particularly as key demand drivers return to normal operations in urban markets. Finally, during the quarter, we opportunistically issued 7.8 million shares of common stock through our at-the-market program at approximately $18 per share resulting in total net proceeds of $138 million. 
We have $460 million of remaining issuance capacity under our ATM program but we want to emphasize that our $1.3 billion cash balance is sizable, and the trajectory of cash from operations is expected to continue to increase. With that in mind, we will continue to be opportunistic with respect to our future issuances. To conclude, we are very pleased with the progression of the lodging recovery and the milestones we have achieved over the past few quarters. We continue to see increasing demand across all parts of our business at a faster pace than we expected, and we remain optimistic that this lodging recovery will continue to gain momentum through the course of 2021. 
Given our strong balance sheet, we remain very well positioned to execute on our goal of increasing the EBITDA growth profile and improving the quality of our portfolio, particularly given the strong recovery that is underway. We continue to make significant progress on redefining the operating model with our managers, increasing market share at renovated assets and strategically allocating capital. With that, we would be happy to take any questions. [Operator Instructions]"

As we think about valuation in NAV, which we don't talk about, we've never published it, and we won't talk about it today, our NAV changes at a point in time. 
It moves based on facts and circumstances and conditions, and we're in a very volatile environment. We thought it was an opportune time to raise some cash, not a lot, given the acquisition pipeline that's out there. We were looking at Baker’s Cay at the time and some other deals at the time. So we just felt it was prudent to raise some equity around those acquisitions. And as Sourav made clear, it wasn't a lot of money and we do have ample liquidity on the balance sheet today, and we'll see where the future takes us."

Deals come into the pipeline, we evaluate them and make a decision whether or not to pursue something. And it's hard to say really where we were 30, 60 days ago today. Going forward, it can change in a matter of a day. As we think about the types of acquisitions that we're interested in, I think if you look at what we've acquired to date in 2021, $1.1 billion. Two of the assets were -- would really fall into the opportunistic category. As we talked about in February on the call, with an objective of moving beyond the typical markets that we're prepared to invest in, we were really casting a wider net. And wider net allowed us to do 2 really great opportunistic distressed deals, 1 being the Hyatt Regency in Austin that we bought it roughly a 25% discount to prepandemic values and then the Hotel Alessandra, which we just recently closed on [ at a ] 30% discount to true development costs. The hotel was just completed construction and opened in 2017. 
So of course, we will continue to look for more opportunities along those lines. I think that 1 of the big stories of the pandemic that has played out is that there hasn't been as much distress out there as everyone thought that was going to be. As you know, there were a lot of funds raised to go buy distressed hospitality assets. And there just hasn't been that much trading in the distressed market. 
The other piece of it is, we'll continue to look at resorts. Complex assets that we feel we can add a lot of value to. I mean if you look at the past performance of some of the properties that we have purchased like the 1 Hotel South Beach, performance of that asset has been off the charts. From a supply perspective, resorts and big box hotels have the lower supply growth of any asset class in hospitality. So we'll continue to look at those deals as well. 
Lastly, I haven't seen it yet, but I expect that we may be seeing assets come to market in some of the urban markets as things continue to open up, and we get back to a sense of more visibility with respect to underwriting. I think you'll see some of those assets straight. And by no means are we writing off the major urban markets. So I would tell you that generally, we don't have a red line through any market today in the domestic United States, that is. 
I mean we're not interested in going offshore at this point in time. And it's a wide [ swathe ]. We still continue to believe that we are at the beginning of a lodging cycle. We feel that we're at the beginning of an economic cycle. We have some bumps in the road here. Today, in particular, with some of the earnings reports that were out there and the hiring report, the jobs report that was published this morning, but we feel we have a good run ahead of us. So we're interested in deploying capital smartly and accretively to benefit our shareholders."

Over 2/3 of the group room nights that were booked in the second quarter were split out among several markets. So there wasn't any 1 market concentration. Just to give you a little color, Houston, we picked up 53,000 room nights; Boston, 23,000; Phoenix, 19,000; New York; and Denver also had picked up in the quarter. So that gives us a lot of encouragement that the groups definitely want to get back out and they want to meet. There is no question about it. Convention centers are reopening in our key markets. And I think the trend on group is very healthy. Sourav -- I'll let Sourav chat a little bit about what we're seeing on the business transient front because that's another segment that obviously -- this is playing out exactly as we all thought it would when we entered the pandemic leisure first, robust leisure travel, robust leisure demand followed by BT and then group. So we can talk a little bit about BT as well."

And that's actually through the third week of July. It's effectively a 30% increase in BT room nights every month. So when you look at Q2 versus Q1, it was effectively over a 100% increase in BT. And what's actually encouraging on the BT that's on the total portfolio, 1/3 of that increase is being driven by urban markets. So when we see sort of our Q2 numbers, I'll put some numbers around this, our total portfolio we did about 150,000 room nights. And of that, 43,000 room nights is from our urban hotels. As we think about how we progress to from Q3 to Q4, second half of the year, obviously, it's still lower than 2019 levels, but we would expect by the time we get to the fourth quarter to get to about 50% to 55% of BT levels relative to '19. When I'm saying this is specifically special corporate, just to clarify. But to the point on rate, I do want to say that we have -- as we did say earlier that we would see sequential decline in rate, even though you would see sequential improvement in RevPAR and that holds true. I mean you saw that happen in the second quarter. We were down quarter-over-quarter in rates. We would expect that to continue into Q3. 
And then Q4, we would expect that rate to be more similar to Q2 based on the information we have available today. So while we will see RevPAR improvement sequentially, we will see a rate decline and we expect a rate decline in the third quarter."

We have seen the greatest level of staffing challenges in the markets where demand quickly returned such as South Florida, Atlanta, Texas and Phoenix.

We're seeing a slight increase in applicant flow over the last 4 weeks or so, 4 or 5 weeks. And we pinpoint that to we believe that, that is due to the fact that the supplemental unemployment benefits are -- have run out or will be running out in about 25 states. And come September 6, the supplemental unemployment benefit expires across the nation. So early labor is tougher to find in the Sunbelt. 
But the management labor is the challenge in the more northern markets right now. So -- as we think about it, we're not really overly concerned about wage inflation.

While we are paying close attention t",2705,"Thank you, Jaime, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. As the saying goes, the trend is your friend, and that has certainly been the case for Host and the broader lodging sector since the first quarter. While we are paying close attention to the Delta variant and the potential impacts to our business, we are very pleased with the performance of our portfolio. We are seeing increased demand across all business segments as market restrictions lift and the lodging recovery gains momentum. TSA passenger throughput trends have accelerated since Memorial Day and are currently about 80% of 2019 levels compared to 60% in April.  
Leisure demand remains resilient and group and business transient volumes continue to trend in the right direction. We significantly outperformed expectations and meaningfully beat consensus estimates on all metrics in the second quarter. Our RevPAR increased 55% over the first quarter. We delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre of $110 million, pro forma hotel EBITDA of $126 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.12. Each of these metrics saw meaningful sequential increases over the first quarter. For the second quarter, pro forma revenues increased 54% over the first quarter, while hotel-level operating expenses grew by only 32%. 
The increase in revenues was driven by stronger-than-anticipated demand, continued expense savings from redefining the operating model and slower-than-expected hiring in Sunbelt market. These factors led to a 400% increase in pro forma hotel EBITDA in the second quarter versus the first quarter. We are continuing to see green shoots across all aspects of our business as the lodging recovery gains momentum. As a result, we are pleased to announce that as of August 1, all of our properties are open and operating with the exception of our latest acquisition, the former Hotel Alessandra, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly.  
In tandem with the operational recovery, we are continuing to increase the expected EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio and improve the quality of our assets by executing on our 3 strategic objectives, which are to: redefine the hotel operating model; gain market share of renovated hotels; and strategically allocate capital. As it relates to our capital allocation strategy, we closed on 2 more off-market acquisitions since our last call in May. The Baker's Cay Resort in Key Largo and a former Hotel Alessandra, a luxury downtown hotel in Houston Central Business District. 
Along with our previously announced acquisitions, these 2 hotels bring our 2021 year-to-date acquisitions to $1.1 billion at a 13.8x EBITDA multiple, which is based on 2019 EBITDA or projected normalized operations in the case of Baker's Cay and the former Hotel Alessandra. After taking into account these 2 acquisitions, we have $1.3 billion of total available liquidity, including $139 million of FF&E reserves. As a reminder, we discussed the acquisition of 2 hotels and 2 golf courses on Maui on our first quarter earnings call. 
We purchased the 448-room Hyatt Regency Austin for $161 million or $359,000 per key at a 10% cap rate and 8.8x multiple on 2019 NOI and EBITDA, respectively. We also purchased the 444 key Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort for $610 million or $1.4 million per key at a 4.7% cap rate and 16.8x EBITDA multiple on 2019 NOI and EBITDA, respectively. We expect this iconic and irreplaceable resort to stabilize between 12 and 14x EBITDA in the 2023 and 2025 time frame. 
We also acquired the Royal Ka'anapali and Ka'anapali Kai Golf Courses in Maui for $28 million. All 3 of these acquisitions are performing meaningfully ahead of our underwriting expectations. As of June, the Hyatt Regency Austin is $4.1 million higher than our full year 2021 EBITDA forecast and the Four Seasons Resort Orlando is $11.7 million higher. Additionally, the golf courses have an expected cash-on-cash return of approximately 11% for the calendar year 2021.  
Turning to our most recent acquisitions. First, the Baker's Cay Resort, Key Largo, a beach front property and our first asset in the Florida Keys. We closed on this off-market acquisition on July 1 for $200 million through a long-standing relationship with the seller. The resort was attractively priced at an estimated 6.2% cap rate and 14.5x EBITDA multiple on 2021 forecast. While the property was closed for much of 2019 as it went through an extended renovation, this 2021 forecast performance would rank 8th in our 2019 pro forma portfolio on both RevPAR and EBITDA per key.  
Through opportunities we have identified to organically grow EBITDA at a property, we expect it to stabilize at approximately 13x EBITDA between 2023 and 2025. The 200-room resort in Hilton's Curio Collection is located on 13 acres of irreplaceable beachfront land on Key Largo's Gulf Coast. The resort is in excellent condition after reopening in 2019 following a complete renovation totaling $63 million or $315,000 per room. We are thrilled to have a presence in Key Largo as it benefits from the favorable supply-demand dynamics of the keys while still being close to Mainland Florida. The resort is about an hour's drive from the Miami Airport and is within a 5-hour drive for over 22 million Florida residents. 
This proximity to the mainland also allows for greater access to labor relative to keys that are further south. The Florida Keys are highly desirable from an owner's perspective given the unique supply and demand dynamics in the market. A rate of growth ordinance ensures that new hotel rooms can only be added if they replace existing entitled dwelling units, which has led to a 4% supply increase in the keys from 2000 to 2019 versus 25% for the U.S. according to STR. That, in turn, has led the keys consistently having leading upper upscale RevPAR and RevPAR growth as detailed in the Baker's Cay presentation on our website. 
Moving on to our most recent acquisition, the former Hotel Alessandra, a luxury downtown hotel in Houston Central Business District. We opportunistically acquired this 223-room hotel for $65 million or $291,000 per room on July 2 prior to a scheduled foreclosure auction. Our ability to source and close on this distressed, off-market acquisition is truly a testament to Host's deep industry relationships, strong balance sheet, and ability to close reliably and quickly.  
Having recently opened in October 2017, this hotel is in excellent condition, and we expect little to no capital to be invested in the near term. At $65 million, we purchased the hotel for an approximate 30% discount to its $90 million development cost. The hotel is currently closed and is fully unencumbered by brand and management. We have engaged HEI to operate this hotel with a nationally recognized brand reservation system and loyalty program, thereby maximizing its attractiveness to business transient and leisure guests.  
While this hotel had not reached stabilization in 2019, based on our forecast for normalized operations, which assumes a new manager, brand and operations in line with the 2019 operations of comparable Houston properties, the price would represent a 9.6% cap rate and 9.2x EBITDA multiple. Additionally, we have identified a number of opportunities to explore with our new operator, which we believe will increase the EBITDA growth profile of this hotel. We have deep knowledge of the Houston market, given our existing ownership of 4 hotels in the city. 
The former Hotel Alessandra is part of the GreenStreet mixed-use development in the center of downtown Houston, which has the second largest concentration of public companies in the U.S., including 24 Fortune 500 companies. In addition, Houston is the #2 U.S. metropolitan area by job growth according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the CBD grew RevPAR by 10% from 2016 to 2019. In total, we have invested $1.1 billion in early cycle acquisitions thus far in 2021 at a 13.8x EBITDA multiple. 
This compares favorably to the $3.5 billion of assets we disposed of at a blended 17x EBITDA multiple between 2018 and 2020. We continue to believe this is an opportune time to improve the quality of our portfolio by investing in markets with high expected growth. Our early cycle investments have historically provided years of elevated EBITDA growth alongside periods of strong economic recovery. 
Moving on to operations. We are excited to announce that we have reopened the 3 remaining hotels that have previously suspended operations. The ibis Rio de Janeiro opened on May 10 and The Westin River North opened on May 19. Sheraton Boston reopened on August 1, well ahead of our expectations due to an increase in group business demand  With the exception of our newly acquired hotel in Houston, which we expect to open later this year, our portfolio is now fully open and ready to take advantage of the next lodging cycle.  
Looking at second quarter operations, the recovery momentum continued to play out, driven once again by robust rates in our resort market as leisure demand was stronger than anticipated after the spring holidays. Portfolio-wide pro forma RevPAR sequentially improved each month, and we ended the second quarter with RevPAR just shy of $100. June RevPAR came in at over $111 representing a 25% increase over March and preliminary July RevPAR is expected to be in the mid-$130 range.  
Portfolio hotel-level EBITDA has remained positive each month since March, with 52 hotels delivering positive EBITDA in the second quarter, representing 56% of rooms, an increase from 31 hotels, representing 31% of rooms achieved in the first quarter of '21. We were particularly encouraged that June was the first month that our nonresort portfolio also realized positive hotel EBITDA driven by our properties in San Diego, San Antonio and New Orleans. As markets have lifted restrictions, demand has also improved at our urban hotels. 
Transient room nights in New York, New Orleans, San Francisco and Chicago grew significantly from the first quarter to the second quarter with New York up over 200%. Importantly, both room nights and rates have increased steadily each month since March. Leisure market weekly occupancy ended at 62% the last week in June, a 3 percentage point increase over the end of the first quarter. Urban and downtown market weekly occupancy recovery continues to be promising, finishing the quarter at 43%, up 15 percentage points from the beginning of the quarter with ADR up over 10% quarter-over-quarter.  
Turning to business mix. Pent-up leisure demand at our resorts has spilled over into the summer months and continues to lead the operational recovery. In the second quarter, both rate and revenue at all of our resorts not only exceeded our first quarter results but also surpassed 2019 levels. Resort revenue increased approximately $50 million over 2019 driven by 35,000 more room nights sold with a remarkable $95 increase in rates. This is particularly noteworthy as substantial room night increases have historically resulted in rate erosion. In the second quarter, 11 of our resorts had rates more than 25% above the second quarter of 2019. 
Transitioning to group demand. Our hotels sold nearly 344,000 group room nights in the second quarter, up 29% to first quarter. As a result, group revenue was up 39% over the first quarter, which includes an 8% rate improvement. Group demand in the second quarter was mostly concentrated in Sunbelt markets, although Boston and Denver were also contributors. We were encouraged to see meaningful month-over-month growth in both corporate and association group business. 
Looking forward, we currently have 1.2 million group rooms booked in the second half of the year, which is up approximately 20% since our last earnings call. Of the roughly 200,000 net group room nights booked in the second quarter for the second half of 2021, we are encouraged that over 2/3 of them were booked in Houston, Boston, New York and Denver. Net booking activity for 2022 also improved each month in the second quarter, resulting in 213,000 room nights booked. Our managers remain focused on holding future group rates, thus ADR on the books is slightly higher than the same period in 2019. 
We now have 2.4 million definite group room nights on the books, which represents 50% of 2019 actual group room nights. For comparison, in the second quarter of 2019 definite group room nights on the books for 2020 were 60% of 2019 actuals. Our group bookings for 2023 are echoing a very similar story. As of the second quarter, our net booking activity for 2023 totals 109,000 rooms, which sequentially increased each month in the quarter. In addition, our average rate on the books is slightly above levels for the same time in 2019. 
Finishing with business transient, we remain encouraged by the sequential growth we are seeing in this segment. Special corporate rooms sold in the second quarter were up over 100% compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in Denver, Texas, California, New York and Atlanta. We are also seeing booking activity come back from traditional top accounts, which include a mix of financial, government and consulting companies. We continue to believe that business transient demand will evolve post Labor Day with school back in session and the return to office for many companies.  
We are pleased to have shown a monthly average growth rate of nearly 30% in business transient room nights and revenue since January of this year. As I wrap up my comments, I would like to reiterate the incremental EBITDA we expect to achieve as we emerge from the pandemic into a new lodging cycle. Our acquisitions year-to-date provide us an estimated pro forma 2019 hotel EBITDA base of $1.570 billion. While it makes sense to think of 2019 as the base year, the timing of a return to 2019 levels of the hotel EBITDA remains highly uncertain, particularly given the unprecedented pandemic-driven nature of the downturn. 
The recovery may span several years, and our portfolio is likely to continue to evolve over that time. In addition, we expect $145 million to $220 million of annual incremental EBITDA on a stabilized basis over time coming from 3 strategic directives. First, redefining the operating model with our managers, which is expected to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term expense savings based on 2019 revenues. We have taken initial steps towards 50% to 60% of these savings to date. 
Second, gaining an expected 3 to 5 points of weighted RevPAR index growth at the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels as well as 5 other hotels where major renovations have recently been completed or are underway. As part of the Marriott program, during the second quarter, we completed the Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island and we will complete the multiyear transformation of the New York Marriott Marquis in 2 weeks. We expect to complete approximately 85% of the Marriott transformational capital program by year-end. The 5 other major renovations have expected completion dates through 2023.  
We expect these repositionings to generate $21 million to $35 million of annual incremental EBITDA on a stabilized basis over time. And finally, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of annual incremental EBITDA on a stabilized basis from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects with expected completion dates by the end of 2022. Renovation and development projects typically take 2 to 3 years to stabilize after completion. And as these projects are at different stages of the process, stabilization will occur over several years.  
During the quarter, we completed the development of a new water park at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort, Naples and additional villas at the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort. The 19 two-bedroom luxury villas achieved occupancy of 73% in the first full month of operation at an average rate of over $1,600. This compares favorably to our underwriting assumptions of mid-30% occupancy at an average rate of over $1,400 for the full year 2021. To conclude my remarks, we are very encouraged by the operational recovery we are seeing at our hotels and across the lodging industry as demand accelerates. While we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the Delta variant, we remain optimistic and well positioned to execute on our long-term goal of increasing the EBITDA growth profile and improving the quality of our portfolio. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav."
29574,1673840747,2362714,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on second quarter cash flow, operating expenses and our view on revenue and expense trends for the back half of 2021. During the second quarter, we generated positiv",1091,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on second quarter cash flow, operating expenses and our view on revenue and expense trends for the back half of 2021. During the second quarter, we generated positive cash flow from operations for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. Starting with pro forma hotel EBITDA of $126 million and backing out $65 million, the majority of which is made up of interest and corporate overhead, we generated $61 million of cash during the quarter.  
If you take into account our ongoing capital expenditure program, which totaled $87 million for the second quarter and include the ROI projects, maintenance CapEx and the Marriott transformational capital program, our net cash outflow was only $26 million. In addition, we maintained a strong liquidity position with $1.3 billion of cash, including $139 million of FF&E reserves after adjusting for our 2 hotel acquisitions in July. And we have no debt maturities until October 2023.  
Moving on to expenses. Total operating costs in the second quarter rose by only 32% compared to the first quarter despite a 54% increase in total revenues. Beginning in March, we proactively increased rate in our leisure markets given a demand surge and benefited from outsized out-of-room spend. That said, the slow pace of hiring by our operators caused operating expenses to remain unsustainably low, which we do not expect to continue. Variable expenses were down 59% relative to a total revenue decline of 54% when compared to the second quarter of 2019. These figures had kept pace with each other through February. But since March, revenues have come back faster than variable expenses. We expect this gap to narrow as we progress through 2021 and hiring increases to levels more in line with demand.  
Fixed expenses, including wages and benefits, were 32% lower than the second quarter of 2019 and 18% higher than last quarter. Hotel operating costs such as contract services, maintenance and utility costs was a driver of this modest quarter-over-quarter increase as some traditionally fixed expenses came back with increased business volumes. As it relates to above-property shared service expenses, both Marriott and Hyatt continue to provide cost relief and flexibility for services. Areas of savings in the second quarter include above-property sales and marketing, revenue management and IT costs. 
As a reminder, we introduced the expense reduction ratio several quarters ago to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue over a comparable pro forma time period in 2019. During the second quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.84, which means that for every 10% decline in hotel revenue compared to pro forma second quarter 2019 there was an 8.4% reduction in expenses. For reference, in the second quarter of 2021, total operating expenses were down 46% versus 2019 on revenues down 54%.  
This is the second quarter in a row that our expense reduction ratio came in much higher than our anticipated range of 0.65 to 0.70. While this is positive for profitability, this level of expense reduction is not sustainable in the long run, and it reflects the hiring challenges our operators are facing in certain markets. Our ratio in the second quarter also reflects better-than-expected ADR as well as tight expense control by our operators. Had our rates been closer to our forecast and hiring ramped up as expected, we estimate that our second quarter expense reduction ratio would have been 0.72. 
As we think about the second half of 2021, we are anticipating an expense reduction ratio in the 0.75 to 0.80 range. This partly reflects a rate decline in the third quarter, driven by a shift in the mix of business as properties ramp up operations. In addition, expense levels are anticipated to be more normalized as hiring continues ramping up in the labor challenged markets. Moving to our top line outlook, we are still unable to provide guidance at this time. That said, similar to the second quarter, we expect strong momentum in our top line growth trajectory in the second half of the year as business transient and group volumes increase. 
We continue to expect occupancy gains to drive RevPAR increases over the second half of the year. As a reminder, we expect that rates will decline in the third quarter before ticking back up in the fourth quarter as the extended peak season we have benefited from and our high-rated leisure market shifts towards lower-rated markets. We are still expecting steady increases in business transient and group demand with more pronounced increases beginning after Labor Day in conjunction with the return to office for many companies.  
We expect this to primarily benefit corporate and association group business. Based on a global business travel association survey in July, 63% of companies plan to resume domestic business travel in the next 1 to 3 months, which is up 35 points from the March survey. We continue to expect leisure travel to drive total RevPAR at our properties, particularly as key demand drivers return to normal operations in urban markets. Finally, during the quarter, we opportunistically issued 7.8 million shares of common stock through our at-the-market program at approximately $18 per share resulting in total net proceeds of $138 million.  
We have $460 million of remaining issuance capacity under our ATM program but we want to emphasize that our $1.3 billion cash balance is sizable, and the trajectory of cash from operations is expected to continue to increase. With that in mind, we will continue to be opportunistic with respect to our future issuances. To conclude, we are very pleased with the progression of the lodging recovery and the milestones we have achieved over the past few quarters. We continue to see increasing demand across all parts of our business at a faster pace than we expected, and we remain optimistic that this lodging recovery will continue to gain momentum through the course of 2021.  
Given our strong balance sheet, we remain very well positioned to execute on our goal of increasing the EBITDA growth profile and improving the quality of our portfolio, particularly given the strong recovery that is underway. We continue to make significant progress on redefining the operating model with our managers, increasing market share at renovated assets and strategically allocating capital. 
With that, we would be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question."

It moves based on facts and circumstances and conditions, and we're in a very volatile environment. We thought it was an opportune time to raise some cash, not a lot, given the acquisition pipeline that's out there. We were looking at Baker’s Cay at the time and some other deals at the time. So we just felt it was prudent to raise some equity around those acquisitions. And as Sourav made clear, it wasn't a lot of money and we do have ample liquidity on the balance sheet today, and we'll see where the future takes us."

And it's hard to say really where we were 30, 60 days ago today. Goi",545,"Sure, Neil. I will tell you, it is a -- really very much a variable pipeline today. Deals come into the pipeline, we evaluate them and make a decision whether or not to pursue something. And it's hard to say really where we were 30, 60 days ago today. Going forward, it can change in a matter of a day. As we think about the types of acquisitions that we're interested in, I think if you look at what we've acquired to date in 2021, $1.1 billion. Two of the assets were -- would really fall into the opportunistic category. As we talked about in February on the call, with an objective of moving beyond the typical markets that we're prepared to invest in, we were really casting a wider net. And a wider net allowed us to do 2 really great opportunistic distressed deals, 1 being the Hyatt Regency in Austin that we bought at roughly a 25% discount to prepandemic values and then the Hotel Alessandra, which we just recently closed on at a 30% discount to true development costs. The hotel was just completed construction and opened in 2017. 
So of course, we will continue to look for more opportunities along those lines. I think that 1 of the big stories of the pandemic that has played out is that there hasn't been as much distress out there as everyone thought there was going to be. As you know, there were a lot of funds raised to go buy distressed hospitality assets. And there just hasn't been that much trading in the distressed market. The other piece of it is, we'll continue to look at resorts, complex assets that we feel we can add a lot of value to. I mean if you look at the past performance of some of the properties that we have purchased like the one Hotel South Beach, performance of that asset has been off the charts. From a supply perspective, resorts and big box hotels have a lower supply growth of any asset class in hospitality. So we'll continue to look at those deals as well. 
Lastly, I haven't seen it yet, but I expect that we may be seeing assets come to market in some of the urban markets as things continue to open up, and we get back to a sense of more visibility with respect to underwriting. I think you'll see some of those assets trade. And by no means are we writing off the major urban markets. So I would tell you that, generally, we don't have a red line through any market today in the domestic United States, that is. I mean we're not interested in going offshore at this point in time. And it's a wide swathe. We still continue to believe that we are at the beginning of a lodging cycle. We feel that we're at the beginning of an economic cycle. We have some bumps in the road here today, in particular, with some of the earnings reports that were out there and the hiring report, the jobs report that was published this morning, but we feel we have a good run ahead of us. So we're interested in deploying capital smartly and accretively to benefit our shareholders."

What we said on the call today is that we picked up 200,000 definite group room nights for the second half of the year in the second quarter. That's a 20% pop over where we were when we spoke with you after the first quarter earnings release. So we now have 1.2 million group room nights on the books for the second quarter, which is greater than 50% of where we were in 2019. So we continue to be encouraged because of the fact that it's a sequential increase in group room night bookings. Over 2/3 of the group room nights that were booked in the second quarter were split out among several markets. So there wasn't any 1 market concentration. 
Just to give you a little color. Houston, we picked up 53,000 room nights; Boston, 23,000; Phoenix, 19,000; New York; and Denver also had pick ups in the quarter. So that gives us a lot of encouragement that the groups definitely want to get back out and they want to meet. There is no question about it. Convention centers are reopening in our key markets. And I think the trend on group is very healthy. Sourav -- I'll let Sourav chat a little bit about what we're seeing on the business transient front because that's another segment that obviously -- this is playing out exactly as we all thought it would when we entered the pandemic leisure first -- robust leisure travel, robust leisure demand followed by BT and then group.

And that's actually through the third week of July. It's effectively a 30% increase in BT room nights every month. So when you look at Q2 versus Q1, it was effectively over a 100% increase in BT. And what's actually encouraging on the BT that's on the total portfolio, 1/3 of that increase is being driven by urban markets. So when we see sort of our Q2 numbers, I'll put some numbers around this, our total portfolio we did about 150,000 room nights. And of that, 43,000 room nights is from our urban hotels. As we think about how we progress to -- from Q3 to Q4, second half of the year, obviously, it's still lower than 2019 levels, but we would expect by the time we get to the fourth quarter to get to about 50% to 55% of BT levels relative to '19. 
When I'm saying BT, this is specifically special corporate, just to clarify. But to the point on rate, I do want to say that we have -- as we did say earlier that we would see sequential decline in rate, even though you would see sequential improvement in RevPAR and that holds true. I mean you saw that happen in the second quarter. We were down quarter-over-quarter in rates. We would expect that to continue into Q3. And then Q4, we would expect that rate to be more similar to Q2 based on the information we have available today. So while we will see RevPAR improvement sequentially, we will see a rate decline and we expect a rate decline in the third quarter."

The other thing I'll point out is a lot of companies on a lot of the large accounts, they don't need the high-level approval anymore from their department head or their CEO in some cases to travel. That has been lifted. So travel has become much easier for a lot of these -- the top accounts, and we are certainly seeing that in the numbers as well.

We have seen the greatest level of staffing challenges in the markets where demand quickly returned such as South Florida, Atlanta, Texas and Phoenix.

We're seeing a slight increase in applicant flow over the last 4 weeks or so, 4 or 5 weeks. And we pinpoint that to we believe that, that is due to the fact that the Supplemental Unemployment Benefits are -- have run out or will be running out in about 25 states. 
And come September 6, the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit expires across the nation. So hourly labor is tougher to find in the Sunbelt. But the management labor is the challenge in the more northern markets right now. So as we think about it, we're not really overly concerned about wage inflation. Sourav can share some numbers on where we are with respect to $15 wage across our portfolio. This is something we looked at. This is something we think about.

I think Sourav can correct me here because it's been a while since we talked about the waiver.

While we are paying close attention t",2705,"Thank you, Jaime, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. As the saying goes, the trend is your friend, and that has certainly been the case for Host and the broader lodging sector since the first quarter. While we are paying close attention to the Delta variant and the potential impacts to our business, we are very pleased with the performance of our portfolio. We are seeing increased demand across all business segments as market restrictions lift and the lodging recovery gains momentum. TSA passenger throughput trends have accelerated since Memorial Day and are currently about 80% of 2019 levels compared to 60% in April.  
Leisure demand remains resilient and group and business transient volumes continue to trend in the right direction. We significantly outperformed expectations and meaningfully beat consensus estimates on all metrics in the second quarter. Our RevPAR increased 55% over the first quarter. We delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre of $110 million, pro forma hotel EBITDA of $126 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.12. Each of these metrics saw meaningful sequential increases over the first quarter. For the second quarter, pro forma revenues increased 54% over the first quarter, while hotel-level operating expenses grew by only 32%. 
The increase in revenues was driven by stronger-than-anticipated demand, continued expense savings from redefining the operating model and slower-than-expected hiring in Sunbelt market. These factors led to a 400% increase in pro forma hotel EBITDA in the second quarter versus the first quarter. We are continuing to see green shoots across all aspects of our business as the lodging recovery gains momentum. As a result, we are pleased to announce that as of August 1, all of our properties are open and operating with the exception of our latest acquisition, the former Hotel Alessandra, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly.  
In tandem with the operational recovery, we are continuing to increase the expected EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio and improve the quality of our assets by executing on our 3 strategic objectives, which are to: redefine the hotel operating model; gain market share of renovated hotels; and strategically allocate capital. As it relates to our capital allocation strategy, we closed on 2 more off-market acquisitions since our last call in May. The Baker's Cay Resort in Key Largo and a former Hotel Alessandra, a luxury downtown hotel in Houston Central Business District. 
Along with our previously announced acquisitions, these 2 hotels bring our 2021 year-to-date acquisitions to $1.1 billion at a 13.8x EBITDA multiple, which is based on 2019 EBITDA or projected normalized operations in the case of Baker's Cay and the former Hotel Alessandra. After taking into account these 2 acquisitions, we have $1.3 billion of total available liquidity, including $139 million of FF&E reserves. As a reminder, we discussed the acquisition of 2 hotels and 2 golf courses on Maui on our first quarter earnings call. 
We purchased the 448-room Hyatt Regency Austin for $161 million or $359,000 per key at a 10% cap rate and 8.8x multiple on 2019 NOI and EBITDA, respectively. We also purchased the 444 key Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort for $610 million or $1.4 million per key at a 4.7% cap rate and 16.8x EBITDA multiple on 2019 NOI and EBITDA, respectively. We expect this iconic and irreplaceable resort to stabilize between 12 and 14x EBITDA in the 2023 and 2025 time frame. 
We also acquired the Royal Ka'anapali and Ka'anapali Kai Golf Courses in Maui for $28 million. All 3 of these acquisitions are performing meaningfully ahead of our underwriting expectations. As of June, the Hyatt Regency Austin is $4.1 million higher than our full year 2021 EBITDA forecast and the Four Seasons Resort Orlando is $11.7 million higher. Additionally, the golf courses have an expected cash-on-cash return of approximately 11% for the calendar year 2021.  
Turning to our most recent acquisitions. First, the Baker's Cay Resort, Key Largo, a beach front property and our first asset in the Florida Keys. We closed on this off-market acquisition on July 1 for $200 million through a long-standing relationship with the seller. The resort was attractively priced at an estimated 6.2% cap rate and 14.5x EBITDA multiple on 2021 forecast. While the property was closed for much of 2019 as it went through an extended renovation, this 2021 forecast performance would rank 8th in our 2019 pro forma portfolio on both RevPAR and EBITDA per key.  
Through opportunities we have identified to organically grow EBITDA at a property, we expect it to stabilize at approximately 13x EBITDA between 2023 and 2025. The 200-room resort in Hilton's Curio Collection is located on 13 acres of irreplaceable beachfront land on Key Largo's Gulf Coast. The resort is in excellent condition after reopening in 2019 following a complete renovation totaling $63 million or $315,000 per room. We are thrilled to have a presence in Key Largo as it benefits from the favorable supply-demand dynamics of the keys while still being close to Mainland Florida. The resort is about an hour's drive from the Miami Airport and is within a 5-hour drive for over 22 million Florida residents. 
This proximity to the mainland also allows for greater access to labor relative to keys that are further south. The Florida Keys are highly desirable from an owner's perspective given the unique supply and demand dynamics in the market. A rate of growth ordinance ensures that new hotel rooms can only be added if they replace existing entitled dwelling units, which has led to a 4% supply increase in the keys from 2000 to 2019 versus 25% for the U.S. according to STR. That, in turn, has led the keys consistently having leading upper upscale RevPAR and RevPAR growth as detailed in the Baker's Cay presentation on our website. 
Moving on to our most recent acquisition, the former Hotel Alessandra, a luxury downtown hotel in Houston Central Business District. We opportunistically acquired this 223-room hotel for $65 million or $291,000 per room on July 2 prior to a scheduled foreclosure auction. Our ability to source and close on this distressed, off-market acquisition is truly a testament to Host's deep industry relationships, strong balance sheet, and ability to close reliably and quickly.  
Having recently opened in October 2017, this hotel is in excellent condition, and we expect little to no capital to be invested in the near term. At $65 million, we purchased the hotel for an approximate 30% discount to its $90 million development cost. The hotel is currently closed and is fully unencumbered by brand and management. We have engaged HEI to operate this hotel with a nationally recognized brand reservation system and loyalty program, thereby maximizing its attractiveness to business transient and leisure guests.  
While this hotel had not reached stabilization in 2019, based on our forecast for normalized operations, which assumes a new manager, brand and operations in line with the 2019 operations of comparable Houston properties, the price would represent a 9.6% cap rate and 9.2x EBITDA multiple. Additionally, we have identified a number of opportunities to explore with our new operator, which we believe will increase the EBITDA growth profile of this hotel. We have deep knowledge of the Houston market, given our existing ownership of 4 hotels in the city. 
The former Hotel Alessandra is part of the GreenStreet mixed-use development in the center of downtown Houston, which has the second largest concentration of public companies in the U.S., including 24 Fortune 500 companies. In addition, Houston is the #2 U.S. metropolitan area by job growth according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the CBD grew RevPAR by 10% from 2016 to 2019. In total, we have invested $1.1 billion in early cycle acquisitions thus far in 2021 at a 13.8x EBITDA multiple. 
This compares favorably to the $3.5 billion of assets we disposed of at a blended 17x EBITDA multiple between 2018 and 2020. We continue to believe this is an opportune time to improve the quality of our portfolio by investing in markets with high expected growth. Our early cycle investments have historically provided years of elevated EBITDA growth alongside periods of strong economic recovery. 
Moving on to operations. We are excited to announce that we have reopened the 3 remaining hotels that have previously suspended operations. The ibis Rio de Janeiro opened on May 10 and The Westin River North opened on May 19. Sheraton Boston reopened on August 1, well ahead of our expectations due to an increase in group business demand  With the exception of our newly acquired hotel in Houston, which we expect to open later this year, our portfolio is now fully open and ready to take advantage of the next lodging cycle.  
Looking at second quarter operations, the recovery momentum continued to play out, driven once again by robust rates in our resort market as leisure demand was stronger than anticipated after the spring holidays. Portfolio-wide pro forma RevPAR sequentially improved each month, and we ended the second quarter with RevPAR just shy of $100. June RevPAR came in at over $111 representing a 25% increase over March and preliminary July RevPAR is expected to be in the mid-$130 range.  
Portfolio hotel-level EBITDA has remained positive each month since March, with 52 hotels delivering positive EBITDA in the second quarter, representing 56% of rooms, an increase from 31 hotels, representing 31% of rooms achieved in the first quarter of '21. We were particularly encouraged that June was the first month that our nonresort portfolio also realized positive hotel EBITDA driven by our properties in San Diego, San Antonio and New Orleans. As markets have lifted restrictions, demand has also improved at our urban hotels. 
Transient room nights in New York, New Orleans, San Francisco and Chicago grew significantly from the first quarter to the second quarter with New York up over 200%. Importantly, both room nights and rates have increased steadily each month since March. Leisure market weekly occupancy ended at 62% the last week in June, a 3 percentage point increase over the end of the first quarter. Urban and downtown market weekly occupancy recovery continues to be promising, finishing the quarter at 43%, up 15 percentage points from the beginning of the quarter with ADR up over 10% quarter-over-quarter.  
Turning to business mix. Pent-up leisure demand at our resorts has spilled over into the summer months and continues to lead the operational recovery. In the second quarter, both rate and revenue at all of our resorts not only exceeded our first quarter results but also surpassed 2019 levels. Resort revenue increased approximately $50 million over 2019 driven by 35,000 more room nights sold with a remarkable $95 increase in rates. This is particularly noteworthy as substantial room night increases have historically resulted in rate erosion. In the second quarter, 11 of our resorts had rates more than 25% above the second quarter of 2019. 
Transitioning to group demand. Our hotels sold nearly 344,000 group room nights in the second quarter, up 29% to first quarter. As a result, group revenue was up 39% over the first quarter, which includes an 8% rate improvement. Group demand in the second quarter was mostly concentrated in Sunbelt markets, although Boston and Denver were also contributors. We were encouraged to see meaningful month-over-month growth in both corporate and association group business. 
Looking forward, we currently have 1.2 million group rooms booked in the second half of the year, which is up approximately 20% since our last earnings call. Of the roughly 200,000 net group room nights booked in the second quarter for the second half of 2021, we are encouraged that over 2/3 of them were booked in Houston, Boston, New York and Denver. Net booking activity for 2022 also improved each month in the second quarter, resulting in 213,000 room nights booked. Our managers remain focused on holding future group rates, thus ADR on the books is slightly higher than the same period in 2019. 
We now have 2.4 million definite group room nights on the books, which represents 50% of 2019 actual group room nights. For comparison, in the second quarter of 2019 definite group room nights on the books for 2020 were 60% of 2019 actuals. Our group bookings for 2023 are echoing a very similar story. As of the second quarter, our net booking activity for 2023 totals 109,000 rooms, which sequentially increased each month in the quarter. In addition, our average rate on the books is slightly above levels for the same time in 2019. 
Finishing with business transient, we remain encouraged by the sequential growth we are seeing in this segment. Special corporate rooms sold in the second quarter were up over 100% compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in Denver, Texas, California, New York and Atlanta. We are also seeing booking activity come back from traditional top accounts, which include a mix of financial, government and consulting companies. We continue to believe that business transient demand will evolve post Labor Day with school back in session and the return to office for many companies.  
We are pleased to have shown a monthly average growth rate of nearly 30% in business transient room nights and revenue since January of this year. As I wrap up my comments, I would like to reiterate the incremental EBITDA we expect to achieve as we emerge from the pandemic into a new lodging cycle. Our acquisitions year-to-date provide us an estimated pro forma 2019 hotel EBITDA base of $1.570 billion. While it makes sense to think of 2019 as the base year, the timing of a return to 2019 levels of the hotel EBITDA remains highly uncertain, particularly given the unprecedented pandemic-driven nature of the downturn. 
The recovery may span several years, and our portfolio is likely to continue to evolve over that time. In addition, we expect $145 million to $220 million of annual incremental EBITDA on a stabilized basis over time coming from 3 strategic directives. First, redefining the operating model with our managers, which is expected to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term expense savings based on 2019 revenues. We have taken initial steps towards 50% to 60% of these savings to date. 
Second, gaining an expected 3 to 5 points of weighted RevPAR index growth at the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels as well as 5 other hotels where major renovations have recently been completed or are underway. As part of the Marriott program, during the second quarter, we completed the Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island and we will complete the multiyear transformation of the New York Marriott Marquis in 2 weeks. We expect to complete approximately 85% of the Marriott transformational capital program by year-end. The 5 other major renovations have expected completion dates through 2023.  
We expect these repositionings to generate $21 million to $35 million of annual incremental EBITDA on a stabilized basis over time. And finally, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of annual incremental EBITDA on a stabilized basis from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects with expected completion dates by the end of 2022. Renovation and development projects typically take 2 to 3 years to stabilize after completion. And as these projects are at different stages of the process, stabilization will occur over several years.  
During the quarter, we completed the development of a new water park at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort, Naples and additional villas at the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort. The 19 two-bedroom luxury villas achieved occupancy of 73% in the first full month of operation at an average rate of over $1,600. This compares favorably to our underwriting assumptions of mid-30% occupancy at an average rate of over $1,400 for the full year 2021. To conclude my remarks, we are very encouraged by the operational recovery we are seeing at our hotels and across the lodging industry as demand accelerates. While we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the Delta variant, we remain optimistic and well positioned to execute on our long-term goal of increasing the EBITDA growth profile and improving the quality of our portfolio. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav."
29574,1673840747,2382183,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on second quarter cash flow, operating expenses and our view on revenue and expense trends for the back half of 2021. During the second quarter, we generated positiv",1091,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on second quarter cash flow, operating expenses and our view on revenue and expense trends for the back half of 2021. During the second quarter, we generated positive cash flow from operations for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. Starting with pro forma hotel EBITDA of $126 million and backing out $65 million, the majority of which is made up of interest and corporate overhead, we generated $61 million of cash during the quarter.  
If you take into account our ongoing capital expenditure program, which totaled $87 million for the second quarter and include the ROI projects, maintenance CapEx and the Marriott transformational capital program, our net cash outflow was only $26 million. In addition, we maintained a strong liquidity position with $1.3 billion of cash, including $139 million of FF&E reserves after adjusting for our 2 hotel acquisitions in July. And we have no debt maturities until October 2023.  
Moving on to expenses. Total operating costs in the second quarter rose by only 32% compared to the first quarter despite a 54% increase in total revenues. Beginning in March, we proactively increased rate in our leisure markets given a demand surge and benefited from outsized out-of-room spend. That said, the slow pace of hiring by our operators caused operating expenses to remain unsustainably low, which we do not expect to continue. Variable expenses were down 59% relative to a total revenue decline of 54% when compared to the second quarter of 2019. These figures had kept pace with each other through February. But since March, revenues have come back faster than variable expenses. We expect this gap to narrow as we progress through 2021 and hiring increases to levels more in line with demand.  
Fixed expenses, including wages and benefits, were 32% lower than the second quarter of 2019 and 18% higher than last quarter. Hotel operating costs such as contract services, maintenance and utility costs was a driver of this modest quarter-over-quarter increase as some traditionally fixed expenses came back with increased business volumes. As it relates to above-property shared service expenses, both Marriott and Hyatt continue to provide cost relief and flexibility for services. Areas of savings in the second quarter include above-property sales and marketing, revenue management and IT costs. 
As a reminder, we introduced the expense reduction ratio several quarters ago to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue over a comparable pro forma time period in 2019. During the second quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.84, which means that for every 10% decline in hotel revenue compared to pro forma second quarter 2019 there was an 8.4% reduction in expenses. For reference, in the second quarter of 2021, total operating expenses were down 46% versus 2019 on revenues down 54%.  
This is the second quarter in a row that our expense reduction ratio came in much higher than our anticipated range of 0.65 to 0.70. While this is positive for profitability, this level of expense reduction is not sustainable in the long run, and it reflects the hiring challenges our operators are facing in certain markets. Our ratio in the second quarter also reflects better-than-expected ADR as well as tight expense control by our operators. Had our rates been closer to our forecast and hiring ramped up as expected, we estimate that our second quarter expense reduction ratio would have been 0.72. 
As we think about the second half of 2021, we are anticipating an expense reduction ratio in the 0.75 to 0.80 range. This partly reflects a rate decline in the third quarter, driven by a shift in the mix of business as properties ramp up operations. In addition, expense levels are anticipated to be more normalized as hiring continues ramping up in the labor challenged markets. Moving to our top line outlook, we are still unable to provide guidance at this time. That said, similar to the second quarter, we expect strong momentum in our top line growth trajectory in the second half of the year as business transient and group volumes increase. 
We continue to expect occupancy gains to drive RevPAR increases over the second half of the year. As a reminder, we expect that rates will decline in the third quarter before ticking back up in the fourth quarter as the extended peak season we have benefited from and our high-rated leisure market shifts towards lower-rated markets. We are still expecting steady increases in business transient and group demand with more pronounced increases beginning after Labor Day in conjunction with the return to office for many companies.  
We expect this to primarily benefit corporate and association group business. Based on a global business travel association survey in July, 63% of companies plan to resume domestic business travel in the next 1 to 3 months, which is up 35 points from the March survey. We continue to expect leisure travel to drive total RevPAR at our properties, particularly as key demand drivers return to normal operations in urban markets. Finally, during the quarter, we opportunistically issued 7.8 million shares of common stock through our at-the-market program at approximately $18 per share resulting in total net proceeds of $138 million.  
We have $460 million of remaining issuance capacity under our ATM program but we want to emphasize that our $1.3 billion cash balance is sizable, and the trajectory of cash from operations is expected to continue to increase. With that in mind, we will continue to be opportunistic with respect to our future issuances. To conclude, we are very pleased with the progression of the lodging recovery and the milestones we have achieved over the past few quarters. We continue to see increasing demand across all parts of our business at a faster pace than we expected, and we remain optimistic that this lodging recovery will continue to gain momentum through the course of 2021.  
Given our strong balance sheet, we remain very well positioned to execute on our goal of increasing the EBITDA growth profile and improving the quality of our portfolio, particularly given the strong recovery that is underway. We continue to make significant progress on redefining the operating model with our managers, increasing market share at renovated assets and strategically allocating capital. 
With that, we would be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question."

As we think about valuation and NAV, which we don't talk about, we've never published it, and we won't talk about it today, our NAV changes at a point in time. It moves based on facts and circumstances and conditions, and we're in a very volatile environment. We thought it was an opportune time to raise some cash, not a lot, given the acquisition pipeline that's out there. We were looking at Baker’s Cay at the time and some other deals at the time. So we just felt it was prudent to raise some equity around those acquisitions. And as Sourav made clear, it wasn't a lot of money and we do have ample liquidity on the balance sheet today, and we'll see where the future takes us."

And it's hard to say really where we were 30, 60 days ago today. Goi",545,"Sure, Neil. I will tell you, it is a -- really very much a variable pipeline today. Deals come into the pipeline, we evaluate them and make a decision whether or not to pursue something. And it's hard to say really where we were 30, 60 days ago today. Going forward, it can change in a matter of a day. As we think about the types of acquisitions that we're interested in, I think if you look at what we've acquired to date in 2021, $1.1 billion. Two of the assets were -- would really fall into the opportunistic category. As we talked about in February on the call, with an objective of moving beyond the typical markets that we're prepared to invest in, we were really casting a wider net. And a wider net allowed us to do 2 really great opportunistic distressed deals, 1 being the Hyatt Regency in Austin that we bought at roughly a 25% discount to prepandemic values and then the Hotel Alessandra, which we just recently closed on at a 30% discount to true development costs. The hotel was just completed construction and opened in 2017. 
So of course, we will continue to look for more opportunities along those lines. I think that 1 of the big stories of the pandemic that has played out is that there hasn't been as much distress out there as everyone thought there was going to be. As you know, there were a lot of funds raised to go buy distressed hospitality assets. And there just hasn't been that much trading in the distressed market. The other piece of it is, we'll continue to look at resorts, complex assets that we feel we can add a lot of value to. I mean if you look at the past performance of some of the properties that we have purchased like the one Hotel South Beach, performance of that asset has been off the charts. From a supply perspective, resorts and big box hotels have a lower supply growth of any asset class in hospitality. So we'll continue to look at those deals as well. 
Lastly, I haven't seen it yet, but I expect that we may be seeing assets come to market in some of the urban markets as things continue to open up, and we get back to a sense of more visibility with respect to underwriting. I think you'll see some of those assets trade. And by no means are we writing off the major urban markets. So I would tell you that, generally, we don't have a red line through any market today in the domestic United States, that is. I mean we're not interested in going offshore at this point in time. And it's a wide swathe. We still continue to believe that we are at the beginning of a lodging cycle. We feel that we're at the beginning of an economic cycle. We have some bumps in the road here today, in particular, with some of the earnings reports that were out there and the hiring report, the jobs report that was published this morning, but we feel we have a good run ahead of us. So we're interested in deploying capital smartly and accretively to benefit our shareholders."

So we now have 1.2 million group room nights on the books for the second quarter, which is greater than 50% of where we were in 2019. So we continue to be encouraged because of the fact that it's a sequential increase in group room night bookings. Over 2/3 of the group room nights that were booked in the second quarter were split out among several markets. So there wasn't any 1 market concentration. 
Just to give you a little color. Houston, we picked up 53,000 room nights; Boston, 23,000; Phoenix, 19,000; New York; and Denver also had pick ups in the quarter. So that gives us a lot of encouragement that the groups definitely want to get back out and they want to meet. There is no question about it. Convention centers are reopening in our key markets. And I think the trend on group is very healthy. Sourav -- I'll let Sourav chat a little bit about what we're seeing on the business transient front because that's another segment that obviously -- this is playing out exactly as we all thought it would when we entered the pandemic leisure first -- robust leisure travel, robust leisure demand followed by BT and then group.

And that's actually through the third week of July. It's effectively a 30% increase in BT room nights every month. So when you look at Q2 versus Q1, it was effectively over a 100% increase in BT. And what's actually encouraging on the BT that's on the total portfolio, 1/3 of that increase is being driven by urban markets. So when we see sort of our Q2 numbers, I'll put some numbers around this, our total portfolio we did about 150,000 room nights. And of that, 43,000 room nights is from our urban hotels. As we think about how we progress to -- from Q3 to Q4, second half of the year, obviously, it's still lower than 2019 levels, but we would expect by the time we get to the fourth quarter to get to about 50% to 55% of BT levels relative to '19. 
When I'm saying BT, this is specifically special corporate, just to clarify. But to the point on rate, I do want to say that we have -- as we did say earlier that we would see sequential decline in rate, even though you would see sequential improvement in RevPAR and that holds true. I mean you saw that happen in the second quarter. We were down quarter-over-quarter in rates. We would expect that to continue into Q3. And then Q4, we would expect that rate to be more similar to Q2 based on the information we have available today. So while we will see RevPAR improvement sequentially, we will see a rate decline and we expect a rate decline in the third quarter."

So we're certainly seeing that. We are no exception at Host as well. We -- our offices are opening post Labor Day officially, but we have all been already on the road and going out to conferences. And that threw up a lot of the financial services companies out there. So I do think they're sort of not tied to each other. And then certainly, we expect that BT momentum to continue. The other thing I'll point out is a lot of companies on a lot of the large accounts, they don't need the high-level approval anymore from their department head or their CEO in some cases to travel. That has been lifted. So travel has become much easier for a lot of these -- the top accounts, and we are certainly seeing that in the numbers as well. And a lot of these have not actually opened up their offices."

We have seen the greatest level of staffing challenges in the markets where demand quickly returned such as South Florida, Atlanta, Texas and Phoenix.

We're seeing a slight increase in applicant flow over the last 4 weeks or so, 4 or 5 weeks. And we pinpoint that to we believe that, that is due to the fact that the Supplemental Unemployment Benefits are -- have run out or will be running out in about 25 states. 
And come September 6, the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit expires across the nation. So hourly labor is tougher to find in the Sunbelt. But the management labor is the challenge in the more northern markets right now. So as we think about it, we're not really overly concerned about wage inflation.

I think Sourav can correct me here because it's been a while since we talked about the waiver.

So we have a lot of flexibility under the existing credit waiver agreement to continue to acquire assets.

Despite the Delta variant, we continued to significantly outperform expectations and meaningfully beat consensus metrics during the third quarter. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $177",2431,"Thank you, Jamie, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Despite the Delta variant, we continued to significantly outperform expectations and meaningfully beat consensus metrics during the third quarter. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $177 million, which exceeded our interest and capital expenditures by $21 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.20 during the quarter. In addition to delivering positive metrics each quarter this year, these metrics continue to see meaningful sequential increases over the prior quarter.
Pro forma total revenues in the third quarter increased 25% sequentially over the second quarter, while pro forma hotel level operating expenses grew only 21%. The increase in revenues was driven by strong leisure demand at resorts and hotels in Sunbelt markets and Hawaii, which led to a $67 million increase in adjusted EBITDAre in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. RevPAR for the third quarter was strong, as volume improvements extended across the portfolio and rates held up in Sunbelt markets. While we saw softer demand in September due to Delta variant concerns, RevPAR for the quarter still improved by 26% compared to the second quarter.
Our hotels saw a 49% increase in business transient room nights and a 72% increase in group volume over the second quarter. Our recent acquisitions, all contributed to the outperformance during the third quarter and are exceeding our underwriting expectations. Preliminary October RevPAR is expected to be approximately $143, a $15 increase over September and the highest RevPAR we have seen this year. We believe RevPAR will dip slightly in November due to seasonality before coming back in December.
While much of the recovery was concentrated at resorts in Sunbelt markets during the first half of the year, our urban markets saw significant RevPAR improvements during the third quarter. At the start of the quarter, our urban and downtown markets had a weekly occupancy of 50%. And by the end of the quarter, these markets were running at nearly 56% occupancy. Quarter-over-quarter RevPAR in our urban and downtown markets grew by 89% to almost $96 driven by both ADR and occupancy improvements.
In addition to the sequential improvements in operations, we continue to execute on our 3 strategic objectives, all of which are aimed at elevating the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. Our objectives include redefining the hotel operating model, gaining market share at renovated hotels and strategically allocating capital. As it relates to the last strategic objective, we made another off-market acquisition during the third quarter, Alila Ventana Big Sur in California. This brings our 2021 year-to-date acquisitions total to $1.2 billion at a blended 13.1x EBITDA multiple. This is a continuation of our strategy to deploy capital into assets that will elevate the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio.
On the dispositions front, subsequent to quarter end, we sold 5 hotels totaling 2,323 keys for $551 million, including FF&E reserves at a 14.2x EBITDA multiple, including forgone CapEx based on 2019 results. Following this acquisition and our recent dispositions, which I will discuss in a moment, we have $1.7 billion of total available liquidity, including $138 million of FF&E reserves. As a reminder, we have completed 5 off-market hotel acquisitions this year, including the Hyatt Regency Austin, the Four Seasons Orlando at Walt Disney World, Baker's Cay Resort in Key Largo, the LoRa Hotel, which was formerly known as the Hotel Alessandra in Houston and Alila Ventana big Sur. 
We also acquired the Royal Ka'anapali and Ka'anapali Kai golf courses in Maui.
All our recent acquisitions are performing substantially ahead of our underwriting expectations. As of September, the updated 2021 forecasted EBITDA at the Hyatt Regency Austin is $3.4 million higher than the full year 2021 EBITDA that was estimated in underwriting. The Four Seasons Resort Orlando is $17.4 million higher. Baker's Cay Resort is $2.9 million higher and the golf courses are $3 million higher. In addition, we acquired the former Hotel Alessandra, a luxury downtown hotel in Houston's Central Business District. At the time of acquisition, the hotel was closed and fully unencumbered by brand and management. The property has been rebranded as a LoRa hotel and it will be operated by HEI Hotels and Resorts as part of the Autograph Collection by Marriott. We have identified a number of opportunities that we believe will increase the EBITDA growth profile of this hotel, including affiliating the property with a major brand reservation system, expanding the F&B outdoor seating capacity, activating the rooftop pool experience and leasing the ground for retail. The hotel is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
Turning to our most recent transaction. In September, we closed on the off-market acquisition of Alila Ventana Big Sur for $150 million. This ultraluxury resort is 1 of the most uniquely located hotels in the United States and benefits from extremely limited supply and high barriers to entry due to strict land-use regulations by the California Coastal Commission. We purchased the property at a 9.3x EBITDA multiple on 2021 forecast. The RevPAR is expected to be $1,320, the Trev Par is $1,870, and the EBITDA per key is $273,000 based on 2021 forecast. The performance ranks first in our 2019 pro forma portfolio on RevPAR, TrevPar and EBITDA per key by a very wide margin.
Alila Ventana Big Sur is located on 160 acres of irreplaceable fee simple land on the California coast. It benefits from use of both the ocean and the Redwood forest and is a drive-to destination for some of the country's most affluent areas. The hotel has 59 keys consisting of both rooms and suites and is operated under an all-inclusive model. It offers a luxury spa, 3 pools, a high-end fitness center, 12,000 square feet of event space and 2 restaurants with locally sourced foods and a variety of private dining experience. In addition, the hotel has a number of unique outdoor amenities, including 63 camp sites with 15 luxury located within the big serve Redwoods, as well as numerous tailored experiences and adventures. I cannot emphasize enough the unique nature of this asset, and we are delighted to add it to our portfolio as the 12th Hyatt branded property, continuing our position as the largest third-party owner of Hyatt Hotels.
The hotel is Hyatt managed under the Alila brand and since Hyatt's acquisition of Two Roads Hospitality in 2018, the properties has enjoyed increasing market share and a record year of profitability in 2021. The hotel significantly benefits from a tie affiliation and World of Hyatt redemption bookings, which contributed a substantial amount of total room nights sold in 2020 and 2021. This demonstrates the growing desire for high-end leisure experiences among World of Hyatt loyalty members.
In conjunction with the operator, we have identified additional opportunities to grow EBITDA at the property and we have conservatively modeled this asset to stabilize between 8 and 10x EBITDA in the 2025 to 2027 time frame. The hotel recently completed a $23 million renovation and repositioning, investing $390,000 per key in the guest rooms, public spaces, pools, camping facilities and back-of-house areas. We are excited to have an ownership presence in Big Sur, and we believe the iconic and irreplaceable nature of Alila Ventana Big Sur will further strengthen the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio.
As I mentioned, we disposed of 5 hotels totaling 2,323 keys for $551 million, which includes $11 million of FF&E reserves subsequent to quarter end. We sold the hotels at a 14.2x EBITDA multiple including foregone CapEx based on 2019 results. These 5 assets were sold as a portfolio and included the Westfields Marriott, Washington Dulles, the Westin Buckhead, Atlanta the Whitley, the San Ramon Marriott and the Westin LAX, both on ground leases. The avoided capital expenditures associated with these 5 properties is approximately $122 million over the next 5 years. We are pleased to have this capital to further bolster our EBITDA growth profile, as we deploy it into high-growth assets in our existing portfolio or into new acquisitions.
In total, we have invested $1.2 billion in early cycle acquisitions year-to-date. The blended EBITDA multiple on our 5 hotel acquisitions this year now stands at 13x, which compares favorably to the $551 million we disposed of at a 14.2x EBITDA multiple. Between 2018 and 2021, we acquired $2.8 billion of assets at a 14x EBITDA multiple and disposed of $4 billion of assets at a 17x EBITDA multiple, including foregone CapEx. Since 2017, we have dramatically improved the quality of our portfolio increasing the RevPAR of our assets by 10%, the EBITDA per key by 20%, and the EBITDA margins by 110 basis points based on 2019 pro forma results.
As we evaluate capital allocation opportunities going forward, we will continue to focus our efforts on assets with higher expected growth with the objective of elevating our EBITDA growth profile.
Moving on to third quarter operations. We saw significant improvements in transient room nights, which were up 18.5% compared to the second quarter. Our hotels in urban and downtown markets saw strong improvements in transient demand compared to last quarter, as municipalities relaxed COVID restrictions. Occupancy in these markets increased by 17.4 percentage points to approximately 50% in the third quarter along 24% ADR growth. In our Sunbelt and Hawaii markets, transient rates remained resilient, up 26% in the third quarter compared to 2019 despite a modest softening of transient demand over the prior quarter due to seasonality. Our hotels saw continued strength in leisure demand during the quarter. Encouragingly, we saw a solid pickup in leisure demand in our urban and downtown hotels.
For comparison, over Columbus Day weekend, our urban and downtown hotels achieved approximately 70% occupancy with an ADR of $231 versus 55% occupancy with an ADR of $180 over the July 4 holiday. Special events such as the Boston and Chicago Marathons and the return of Broadway shows in New York helped to drive this demand. Weekend occupancy at our entire portfolio reached 75% in early October with an ADR of $259 compared to a historical level of 87% and $259 in 2019. Resort revenue increased $43 million over 2019 driven by 39% ADR growth with rates in most of our resorts seeing double-digit percentage increases. We expect strong demand at our resorts to continue through year-end, particularly at our Hawaii hotels after the recent news that the state welcomed nonessential travel back on November 1.
Sourav will get into more detail on our business mix during the third quarter shortly. In addition to our successful capital allocation efforts this year, we remain focused on our 3 strategic objectives. As a reminder, we are targeting a potential $240 million to $315 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis as we execute the initiatives and projects underlying our strategic objectives. This range includes hotel EBITDA of approximately $93 million from our acquisitions year-to-date. First, we expect to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term cost savings over time based on 2019 revenues from redefining our operating model with our managers. We have taken steps towards 50% to 60% of these savings to date.
Second, we expect to generate $21 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis from our goal of gaining 3 to 5 points of weighted index growth at the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels and 5 other hotels, where major renovations have been recently completed or are underway. Keep in mind that our expectation of a 3- to 5-point gain in market share was a pre-pandemic estimate. As we have been in a unique position of deploying significantly greater capital in 2020 and 2021 than our competitors, we are optimistic that our market share gains could be greater as the property competitive set is either an inferior product due to lack of renovation or there will be meaningful business disruption as hotels are renovated. We expect to complete approximately 85% of the Marriott transformational capital program by year-end and substantially complete the program by the end of 2022.
We expect to invest $1.2 billion in these 21 assets or approximately $73,000 per key. As of the third quarter, we have invested $834 million in renovations at these hotels, and we do not expect to spend significant capital on these assets in future years. During the third quarter, we completed renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis, which included a complete upgrade of the guestrooms, renovations of over 140,000 square feet of meeting space, the expansion of the Skybridge line with 2 high-definition LED screens and a reimagined lobby with new bars and upgraded restaurants. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed transformational renovations at the Orlando World Center Marriott in Florida, which included the guest rooms and an updated lobby, restaurant and bar.
These multiyear comprehensive renovations at the 2 largest hotels in our portfolio were part of the Marriott transformational capital program and bring the total number of completed projects in this program to 10 of 16 properties. We avoided significant business disruption by completing these projects during the pandemic. And as a result, they are very well positioned to capture market share in the recovery. In addition to the Marriott transformational capital program assets, we recently completed the extensive guestroom renovations at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point in Florida.
Lastly, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects. These projects are at different stages of renovation and development, and stabilization is expected to occur 2 to 3 years after completion. Some recent examples of our ROI development projects include the Andaz Maui villas, which are targeting 49% occupancy with an ADR over $1,600 through 2021 versus our underwriting at 34% occupancy with an ADR of $1,400. And the One Hotel Beach Club enhancements, which have led to over $2.5 million in incremental revenues with returns exceeding the underwriting.
To conclude my remarks, we continue to be very encouraged by the operational recovery we are seeing across the lodging industry. As we move further into the recovery, our capital allocation efforts over the past few years, the improved quality of our assets and the elevated EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio should accrue to the benefit of our stockholders. These factors, combined with our strong balance sheet, geographic diversity and size, scale and reputation leave us very well positioned to capitalize on accelerating demand.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Saurav."

Following Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our third quarter cash flow, operations, expenses and our top line outlook for the remainder of the year. As Jim mentioned, we delivered positive adjusted EBITD",1334,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Following Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our third quarter cash flow, operations, expenses and our top line outlook for the remainder of the year. As Jim mentioned, we delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre and FFO during the third quarter. In addition, we achieved an important milestone this quarter with positive cash flow for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $177 million, which exceeded our interest and capital expenditures by $21 million. We continued to benefit from quarterly sequential improvements with 65 hotels achieving positive hotel level operating profit compared to 53 hotels last quarter.
Subsequent to quarter end, these operational improvements led us to another important milestone of exiting our credit facility covenant waiver period 3 quarters ahead of its expiration, and coming into compliance with our bond indenture debt incurrence covenant. This reduces our $2.5 billion credit facility interest rate by 40 basis points and gives us greater balance sheet flexibility.
Moving on to top line performance. While our Sunbelt hotels and our resorts continue to drive results, the third quarter represented the best quarter of the recovery for non-Sunbelt and large group hotels. Multiple hotels achieved positive EBITDA in Chicago, D.C., Boston and San Francisco and all hotels in Philadelphia and Denver maintained positive RevPAR for the second quarter in a row. Our large group hotels in San Diego, San Antonio and New Orleans also maintained positive EBITDA in the third quarter.
Expanding on Jim's business mix comments, our hotels saw business transient room nights increased 49% over the prior quarter with a 5% increase in ADR to more than $172. Even more encouraging is that 40% of those room nights came from our urban and downtown hotels, where business transient rooms sold increased 112% over the second quarter. Additionally, we saw increasing activity from traditional top 10 accounts, including a mix of Fortune 500 financial, government and consulting companies, a positive given the challenges the Delta variant presented during the quarter.
On the group front, group revenue showed steady sequential improvement over the prior quarter with a 72% increase in room nights combined with an 11% increase in rate driven by our hotels in San Diego, New York, Boston, San Antonio, Austin and Chicago. Overall, group room nights in the third quarter were 52% of 2019 levels despite the Delta variant headwinds. We were pleased to see Corporate Group perform better than expected in the quarter. This segment contributed 43% of total group room nights in the third quarter, which is on par with our pre-pandemic mix. Corporate group rate also spends into $196 in the third quarter, which is the highest it has been since the first quarter of 2020 and indicates that more traditional groups are coming back. Corporate Group also drove significant improvements in bankers revenue, which was up 100% quarter-over-quarter.
Association group room nights of $150,000 was more than triple that of the second quarter, which we view as another positive sign for the return of large traditional groups. Affinity groups, which includes social, military, education, religious and paternal organizations have been driving group demand during the pandemic. These groups continue to show sequential quarterly improvement, up 27% over the prior quarter.
Looking forward, we currently have over 570,000 definite group room nights on the books for the rest of 2021. And we maintained 1.2 million group room nights on the books for the third and fourth quarters despite concern over the Delta variant. Of those group room nights on the books for the fourth quarter, over 42% of them are booked in San Diego, Boston, Orlando and Phoenix. Net booking activity in the third quarter for 2022 totaled 180,000 room nights. Our managers remain focused on holding future group rates, thus, ADR on the books is slightly higher than the same period in 2019. We now have roughly 2.6 million group room nights on the books in 2022, an 8% increase over the second quarter. For comparison, this represents about 54% of 2019 actual group room nights compared to 50% last quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Pro forma total operating costs rose by 21% during the third quarter compared to the second quarter despite a 25% increase in total revenues. Variable expenses were down 40% relative to a total revenue decline of 32% when compared to the third quarter of 2019. Most of this gap is due to the hiring pace, lagging demand growth and we expect this gap to moderate through the fourth quarter as our operators continue to ramp up staffing levels. The number of open positions at our major operators indicate, they are at roughly 94% of targeted staffing based on current business volumes. For comparison, our managers have historically operated at 97% of targeted staffing based on historical business volumes.
Fixed expenses, including wages and benefits, were 19% lower than the third quarter of 2019 and 16% higher than last quarter. Similar to last quarter, some traditionally fixed expenses like sales and marketing, came back as business volumes continued to increase. Combining revenues and expenses this quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.93, which means that for every 10% decline in hotel revenue compared to pro forma third quarter 2019, there was a 9.3% reduction in expenses. As Jim mentioned, in the third quarter, pro forma total operating expenses were down 30% to the third quarter of 2019 on revenue down 32%.
On our last call, we indicated that we were expecting an expense reduction ratio of 0.75 to 0.80 for the second half of this year. The difference between our third quarter results and our forecast can be attributed fairly evenly to 3 factors. Average daily rates came in better than expected, wages and benefits did not ramp up as expected due to hiring challenges in certain markets, and we had unanticipated favorable onetime items in the quarter, including business interruption, insurance proceeds and property tax savings, totaling approximately $10 million. We are expecting an expense reduction ratio of approximately 0.85 for the year, which reflects our expectation of rate-driven RevPAR growth and a continued lag in expense growth driven by labor costs.
As you may recall, we introduced the expense reduction ratio during the pandemic to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue. As our revenue declines compared to 2019 decrease in size, onetime expenses have a much bigger impact on the ratio, thus making it less relevant. We, therefore, expect to revert to pre-pandemic metrics in the coming quarters as operations continue to normalize.
Turning to our top line outlook for the remainder of the year. We are still unable to provide guidance given the continued uncertainty surrounding COVID. That said, we continue to expect sequential quarterly RevPAR improvements driven by rate growth from leisure travelers at our resorts, and we are encouraged by the performance of our urban hotels as demand drivers in those markets continue to recover. We also expect group and business transient to continue improving in our urban and downtown markets as impacts from the Delta variant moderate, companies return to the office, and traditional groups get back to meeting in person.
To conclude, we are very pleased with our achievements during the third quarter, including generating positive adjusted EBITDAre, FFO and exiting our credit facility covenant waiver period the quarter ahead of its expiration. We remain very well positioned to execute on our goal of increasing the EBITDA growth profile and improving the quality of our portfolio, particularly given our strong balance sheet, accretive capital recycling and the strong recovery that is underway. We continue to make significant progress on redefining the operating model with our managers, increasing market share at our renovated assets and strategically allocating capital.
With that, we would be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to 1 question."

Is that a 2023 event? How do we think about that?"

The number that we provided for our October RevPAR is a preliminary portfolio number. And we do not have granular data at this point in time on -- in the performance at the Urban hotels versus Sunbelt leisure hotels. We did a rollout, and we saw that $143 is a good number, and that's the number we provided. So we're confident given the trajectory of the business return that we saw in the third quarter, in particular, that the business is going to continue to ramp. And the encouraging -- a lot of encouraging data points, as we said in our prepared comments.
But 1 of the most encouraging with respect to the urban hotels is the level of leisure business we saw come back to those properties, as amenities started to open up, such as Broadway in New York. We saw the Boston Marathon. We've had really strong performance on the leisure side. We're seeing a lot of solid business transients come back to the urban properties as well. And that's business transient from our traditional -- more traditional accounts. The top 10 accounts that are household makes financial services, consulting defense-related businesses, government accounts. So we are very encouraged with the ramp that we're seeing occur. To give -- go from 50% at the beginning of the quarter to 56% in occupancy at the end of the quarter and C&I uptick in rate is very encouraging to us. So as vaccines continue to be rolled out.
We had good news, I guess, it was just yesterday that adolescents are now approved for vaccines. So down to -- children down to 5 years old are eligible to get a vaccine. We think that's very encouraging. We feel that businesses are going to get back to work. They're going to open their offices. And there is clearly a pent-up demand on the part of businesses to get out on the road and meet people. I mean we're experiencing it ourselves in our offices. -- the number of folks who want to come behind saying hello, face-to-face really is a testament to the fact that there's no substitute for in-person communication and in-person collaboration. So Sourav, I don't know if you have anything else that we can add at this point in time."

If you recall from the beginning of the year from January through July, we had about, on average, a 30% sequential improvement in BT room nights every single month. We saw a slight increase from July to August and then a slight dip from August to September, but now we have picked up and back on the trajectory that we had seen early on in the year.
So very encouraged. And as Jim talked about, sort of our overall BT rate is actually up 5% quarter-over-quarter, and that's holding strong. As it relates to 2019, we are about, call it, around 50% of '19 levels as we stand right now, and we expect that to continue to improve with every single quarter going forward."

On the labor front, what I'll start off with is sort of end with $100 million to $150 million that we have messaged is when we were going into 2020, we were expecting higher than inflationary growth in a few of the Sunbelt markets, and that's obviously pre-pandemic. So as we went through the pandemic, there were obviously the rate of acceleration in terms of wage growth in those markets went up. For the portfolio -- if I can give you some specific numbers here, for the portfolio, I would say, we expect a CAGR from '19 to '22 of about 5% to 7%. Now I would break that down between urban and Sunbelt markets. For urban, just given a lot of those are covered under the CBA, that would be around 3% to 4% CAGR from '19 to '22. In the Sunbelt that CAGR would be about 6% to 8%. So again, the overall portfolio, we expect that CAGR of '19 to 2022 to be about 5% to 7%.
Now as it relates to the $100 million and $150 million that we messaged, remember that was in relation to 2019 revenues and expenses. So reality is, depending on how quickly we get back to '19 levels of revenue, we can see all that benefit sort of come through to the bottom line. Obviously, depending on how much inflationary -- above inflationary growth we see in wages and benefits, it will be shaved off and that will impact margin going forward. So hopefully, that answers your question."

And I think 1 of the most encouraging data points with respect to the second half of the year and the third quarter and the fourth quarter was the fact that we were able to maintain 1.2 million group room nights on books, notwithstanding Delta. So it just points out that there's a lot of pent-up demand in the economy in general, when people want to get back out, they want to meet, they want to travel. We've seen a little bit of a pullback as a result of Delta as everyone else did. But as the Delta trend line started to diminish and we got over the peak and new cases, and people saw that we were going in the same direction as countries and other parts of the world where, they got back on the road.
So there's no magic to it. I mean I think 1 of the -- and we've talked about this a lot. The quality of our assets is really second to none. And the fact that we have continued to invest capital in our portfolio, we think, it is going to be a true competitive advantage as business really starts to open up. I mean I said it in my prepared remarks with respect to market share gains, as we embarked upon the Marriott transformational capital program back in '17 and '18, we underwrote 3 to 5 points pickup in the RevPAR yield index, that was pre-pandemic. Now that we're going to have a portfolio that is largely refreshed, I mean we're going to spend $75,000 a key on the 21 properties that we referenced, 16 Marriotts and 5 other assets, we would expect that we'll continue to see strong performance going forward, and I'm optimistic quite frankly, that will pick up more than 3 to 5 points in yield index.
So I think it's a combination of the quality of our assets, the location of our assets. Our asset managers and enterprise analytics team is working very closely with the best in the business, whether it's Marriott, Hyatt, or independent managers that are out there, just really being very thoughtful about revenue management strategies and yield management strategies and getting business in the hotels while maintaining rate integrity. And I think that's a big -- that's another big story as we open up for business again. This pandemic and post-pandemic has been marked by a material yield ADR integrity as opposed to what happened coming out of the Great Recession.
So we're able to truly asset manage these hotels and revenue manage them to maximize RevPAR. And I expect we'll continue to do that going forward."

As you know, the deals that we've been able to get done this year have been off-market transactions, and that's where we continue to stay focused right now. Because there is a fair amount of competition out there, given that the debt markets are flush with cash, the CMBS market, in particular, flush with cash and a lot of the private equity firms were sitting on the sideline waiting for the CMBS markets to come back. So we are starting to see more competition. As we think about sources of capital, we're very, very delighted that we could exit the credit waiver amendment 3 quarters before expiration.
And 1 of the other data points that we did discuss is the fact that we had a debt incurrence test under our bond indenture. As you know, our portfolio is completely unencumbered. So it's all balance sheet debt. And we had a debt incurrence test under our bond indentures that precluded us from getting from issuing new debt, hard stop until we got back above 1.5x interest coverage. So we've met that threshold as well. I think it's going to, on the margin, give us a little more flexibility on the acquisition front. There were several transactions in the market that we worked on last year that had existing debt in place. And that debt was prohibitively expensive to break and pay off. So we had to take a pass. But now with the fact that we can acquire assets with that, that gives us another opportunity to look at a few hotels out there that are encumbered with existing financing.
So we're very happy with our cash position. We're happy with the fact that we have come out of the credit waiver amendment 3 quarters early. And between cash on hand and the ability to issue new debt, I think that is the direction you would see us going if we continue to deploy capital into new acquisitions."

So it's a little early to give you specific numbers, but I would venture that coming off the strong base in '21, that we're seeing it really every deal that we've acquired this year that '22 is likely to outperform our underwriting expectations as well. When we underwrote the acquisitions throughout the course of this year, we were in a very period of gray uncertainty. We didn't really have a sense on how Delta -- COVID was going to behave and when the country was going to be able to get COVID under control. So a long way of saying that we were conservative in our underwriting.
And conservative in our underwriting, but as we look out to, say, '23, '24 and beyond, and the financial performance that we baked into these properties, it penciled on an IRR basis and allowed us to pull the trigger and deploy capital. I think that it's going to be meaningfully better across the board. I mean if you just look at where we put capital and what's happening in these markets, some of the best, highest growing -- highest growth markets in the country, with meaningful barriers to new supply. If you think about Alila, truly iconic and irreplaceable asset to be able to buy that at 9.3x on this year's EBITDA, an asset that's generating $275,000 a key in EBITDA, and we're not seeing any slowdown there.
The Four Seasons Resort Walt Disney World. We're just starting to see the benefits of the celebration, the 50th anniversary celebration of Walt Disney World. It just kicked off in October. So I expect that we're going to see outperformance going forward. And I think that you'll see it across all the assets we bought that we're going to continue to see it in our resort portfolio, which is comprised of 16 properties now. And we will see business return to the major urban markets. We've been encouraged there as well this last quarter."

Despite the Delta variant, we continued to significantly outperform expectations and meaningfully beat consensus metrics during the third quarter. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $177",2430,"Thank you, Jaime, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. Despite the Delta variant, we continued to significantly outperform expectations and meaningfully beat consensus metrics during the third quarter. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $177 million, which exceeded our interest and capital expenditures by $21 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.20 during the quarter. 
In addition to delivering positive metrics each quarter this year, these metrics continue to see meaningful sequential increases over the prior quarter. Pro forma total revenues in the third quarter increased 25% sequentially over the second quarter, while pro forma hotel level operating expenses grew only 21%. The increase in revenues was driven by strong leisure demand at resorts and hotels in Sunbelt markets and Hawaii, which led to a $67 million increase in adjusted EBITDAre in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. 
RevPAR for the third quarter was strong, as volume improvements extended across the portfolio and rates held up in Sunbelt markets. While we saw softer demand in September due to Delta variant concerns, RevPAR for the quarter still improved by 26% compared to the second quarter. 
Our hotels saw a 49% increase in business transient room nights and a 72% increase in group volume over the second quarter. Our recent acquisitions, all contributed to the outperformance during the third quarter and are exceeding our underwriting expectations. 
Preliminary October RevPAR is expected to be approximately $143, a $15 increase over September and the highest RevPAR we have seen this year. We believe RevPAR will dip slightly in November due to seasonality before coming back in December. 
While much of the recovery was concentrated at resorts in Sunbelt markets during the first half of the year, our urban markets saw significant RevPAR improvements during the third quarter. At the start of the quarter, our urban and downtown markets had a weekly occupancy of 50%. And by the end of the quarter, these markets were running at nearly 56% occupancy. Quarter-over-quarter RevPAR in our urban and downtown markets grew by 89% to almost $96 driven by both ADR and occupancy improvements. 
In addition to the sequential improvements in operations, we continue to execute on our 3 strategic objectives, all of which are aimed at elevating the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. Our objectives include redefining the hotel operating model, gaining market share at renovated hotels and strategically allocating capital. 
As it relates to the last strategic objective, we made another off-market acquisition during the third quarter, Alila Ventana Big Sur in California. This brings our 2021 year-to-date acquisitions total to $1.2 billion at a blended 13.1x EBITDA multiple. This is a continuation of our strategy to deploy capital into assets that will elevate the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. 
On the dispositions front, subsequent to quarter end, we sold 5 hotels totaling 2,323 keys for $551 million, including FF&E reserves at a 14.2x EBITDA multiple, including forgone CapEx based on 2019 results. 
Following this acquisition and our recent dispositions, which I will discuss in a moment, we have $1.7 billion of total available liquidity, including $138 million of FF&E reserves. As a reminder, we have completed 5 off-market hotel acquisitions this year, including the Hyatt Regency Austin, the Four Seasons Orlando at Walt Disney World, Baker's Cay Resort in Key Largo, the Laura Hotel, which was formerly known as the Hotel Alessandra in Houston and Alila Ventana Big Sur.  
We also acquired the Royal Ka'anapali and Ka'anapali Kai Golf Courses in Maui. 
All our recent acquisitions are performing substantially ahead of our underwriting expectations. As of September, the updated 2021 forecasted EBITDA at the Hyatt Regency Austin is $3.4 million higher than the full year 2021 EBITDA that was estimated in underwriting. The Four Seasons Resort, Orlando is $17.4 million higher. Baker's Cay Resort is $2.9 million higher and the golf courses are $3 million higher. 
In addition, we acquired the former Hotel Alessandra, a luxury downtown hotel in Houston's Central Business District. At the time of acquisition, the hotel was closed and fully unencumbered by brand and management. The property has been rebranded as The Laura Hotel and it will be operated by HEI Hotels & Resorts as part of the Autograph Collection by Marriott. We have identified a number of opportunities that we believe will increase the EBITDA growth profile of this hotel, including affiliating the property with a major brand reservation system, expanding the F&B outdoor seating capacity, activating the rooftop pool experience and leasing the ground for retail. The hotel is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2021.  
Turning to our most recent transaction. In September, we closed on the off-market acquisition of Alila Ventana Big Sur for $150 million. This ultra-luxury resort is one of the most uniquely located hotels in the United States and benefits from extremely limited supply and high barriers to entry due to strict land-use regulations by the California Coastal Commission. We purchased the property at a 9.3x EBITDA multiple on 2021 forecast. The RevPAR is expected to be $1,320.  the TRevPAR is $1,870, and the EBITDA per key is $273,000 based on 2021 forecast. The performance ranks first in our 2019 pro forma portfolio on RevPAR, TrevPAR and EBITDA per key by a very wide margin. 
Alila Ventana Big Sur is located on 160 acres of irreplaceable fee, simple land on the California coast. It benefits from use of both the ocean and the redwood forest and is a drive-to destination for some of the country's most affluent areas. The hotel has 59 keys consisting of both rooms and suites and is operated under an all-inclusive model. It offers a luxury spa, 3 pools, a high-end fitness center, 12,000 square feet of event space and 2 restaurants with locally sourced foods and a variety of private dining experience. 
In addition, the hotel has a number of unique outdoor amenities, including 63 camp sites with 15 luxury tubs, located within the Big Sur Redwoods, as well as numerous tailored experiences and adventures. I cannot emphasize enough the unique nature of this asset, and we are delighted to add it to our portfolio as the 12th Hyatt branded property, continuing our position as the largest third-party owner of Hyatt Hotels. 
The hotel is Hyatt managed under the Alila brand and since Hyatt's acquisition of Two Roads Hospitality in 2018, the properties has enjoyed increasing market share and a record year of profitability in 2021. The hotel significantly benefits from its Hyatt affiliation and World of Hyatt redemption bookings, which contributed a substantial amount of total room nights sold in 2020 and 2021. This demonstrates the growing desire for high-end leisure experiences among World of Hyatt loyalty members. 
In conjunction with the operator, we have identified additional opportunities to grow EBITDA at the property and we have conservatively modeled this asset to stabilize between 8 and 10x EBITDA in the 2025 to 2027 timeframe. The hotel recently completed a $23 million renovation and repositioning, investing $390,000 per key in the guest rooms, public spaces, pools, camping facilities and back-of-house areas. We are excited to have an ownership presence in Big Sur, and we believe the iconic and irreplaceable nature of Alila Ventana Big Sur will further strengthen the EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. 
As I mentioned, we disposed the 5 hotels totaling 2,323 keys for $551 million, which includes $11 million of FF&E reserves subsequent to quarter end. We sold the hotels at a 14.2x EBITDA multiple including foregone CapEx based on 2019 results. These 5 assets were sold as a portfolio and included the Westfields Marriott, Washington Dulles, the Westin Buckhead, Atlanta the Whitley, the San Ramon Marriott and the Westin LAX, both on ground leases. The avoided capital expenditures associated with these 5 properties is approximately $122 million over the next 5 years. We are pleased to have this capital to further bolster our EBITDA growth profile, as we deploy it into high-growth assets in our existing portfolio or into new acquisitions. 
In total, we have invested $1.2 billion in early cycle acquisitions year-to-date. The blended EBITDA multiple on our 5 hotel acquisitions this year now stands at 13x, which compares favorably to the $551 million we disposed of at a 14.2x EBITDA multiple. 
Between 2018 and 2021, we acquired $2.8 billion of assets at a 14x EBITDA multiple and disposed of $4 billion of assets at a 17x EBITDA multiple, including foregone CapEx. Since 2017, we have dramatically improved the quality of our portfolio increasing the RevPAR of our assets by 10%, the EBITDA per key by 20%, and the EBITDA margins by 110 basis points based on 2019 pro forma results. 
As we evaluate capital allocation opportunities going forward, we will continue to focus our efforts on assets with higher expected growth with the objective of elevating our EBITDA growth profile. 
Moving on to third quarter operations. We saw significant improvements in transient room nights, which were up 18.5% compared to the second quarter. Our hotels in urban and downtown markets saw strong improvements in transient demand compared to last quarter, as municipalities relaxed COVID restrictions. Occupancy in these markets increased by 17.4 percentage points to approximately 50% in the third quarter along 24% ADR growth. In our Sunbelt and Hawaii markets, transient rates remained resilient, up 26% in the third quarter compared to 2019 despite a modest softening of transient demand over the prior quarter due to seasonality. Our hotels saw continued strength in leisure demand during the quarter. Encouragingly, we saw a solid pickup in leisure demand in our urban and downtown hotels. 
For comparison, over Columbus Day weekend, our urban and downtown hotels achieved approximately 70% occupancy with an ADR of $231 versus 55% occupancy with an ADR of $180 over the July 4 holiday. Special events such as the Boston and Chicago Marathons and the return of Broadway shows in New York helped to drive this demand. Weekend occupancy at our entire portfolio reached 75% in early October with an ADR of $259 compared to a historical level of 87% and $259 in 2019. 
Resort revenue increased $43 million over 2019 driven by 39% ADR growth with rates in most of our resorts seeing double-digit percentage increases. We expect strong demand at our resorts to continue through year-end, particularly at our Hawaii hotels after the recent news that the state welcomed nonessential travel back on November 1. Sourav will get into more detail on our business mix during the third quarter shortly. 
In addition to our successful capital allocation efforts this year, we remain focused on our 3 strategic objectives. As a reminder, we are targeting a potential $240 million to $315 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis as we execute the initiatives and projects underlying our strategic objectives. This range includes hotel EBITDA of approximately $93 million from our acquisitions year-to-date. 
First, we expect to generate $100 million to $150 million of potential long-term cost savings over time based on 2019 revenues from redefining our operating model with our managers. We have taken steps toward 50% to 60% of these savings to date. 
Second, we expect to generate $21 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis from our goal of gaining 3 to 5 points of weighted index growth at the 16 Marriott transformational capital program hotels and 5 other hotels, where major renovations have been recently completed or are underway. Keep in mind that our expectation of a 3- to 5-point gain in market share was a pre-pandemic estimate. As we have been in a unique position of deploying significantly greater capital in 2020 and 2021 than our competitors, we are optimistic that our market share gains could be greater as the property competitive set is either an inferior product due to lack of renovation or there will be meaningful business disruption as hotels are renovated. We expect to complete approximately 85% of the Marriott's transformational capital program by year-end and substantially complete the program by the end of 2022. 
We expect to invest $1.2 billion in these 21 assets or approximately $73,000 per key. As of the third quarter, we have invested $834 million in renovations at these hotels, and we do not expect to spend significant capital on these assets in future years. 
During the third quarter, we completed renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis, which included a complete upgrade of the guestrooms, renovations of over 140,000 square feet of meeting space, the expansion of the skybridge line with 2 high-definition LED screens and a reimagined lobby with new bars and upgraded restaurants. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed transformational renovations at the Orlando World Center Marriott in Florida, which included the guest rooms and an updated lobby, restaurant and bar. 
These multiyear comprehensive renovations at the 2 largest hotels in our portfolio were part of the Marriott transformational capital program and bring the total number of completed projects in this program to 10 of 16 properties. We avoided significant business disruption by completing these projects during the pandemic. And as a result, they are very well positioned to capture market share in the recovery. 
In addition to the Marriott transformational capital program assets, we recently completed the extensive guestroom renovations at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point in Florida. 
Lastly, we expect to generate $25 million to $35 million of incremental EBITDA over time on a stabilized annual basis from recently completed and ongoing ROI development projects. These projects are at different stages of renovation and development, and stabilization is expected to occur 2 to 3 years after completion. Some recent examples of our ROI development projects include the Andaz Maui villas, which are targeting 49% occupancy with an ADR over $1,600 through 2021 versus our underwriting at 34% occupancy with an ADR of $1,400. And the 1 Hotel Beach Club enhancements, which have led to over $2.5 million in incremental revenues with returns exceeding the underwriting. 
To conclude my remarks, we continue to be very encouraged by the operational recovery we are seeing across the lodging industry. As we move further into the recovery, our capital allocation efforts over the past few years, the improved quality of our assets and the elevated EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio should accrue to the benefit of our stockholders. These factors, combined with our strong balance sheet, geographic diversity and size, scale and reputation leave us very well positioned to capitalize on accelerating demand. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav."

Following Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our third quarter cash flow, operations, expenses and our topline outlook for the remainder of the year. As Jim mentioned, we delivered positive adjusted EBIT",1331,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Following Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our third quarter cash flow, operations, expenses and our topline outlook for the remainder of the year. 
As Jim mentioned, we delivered positive adjusted EBITDAre and FFO during the third quarter. In addition, we achieved an important milestone this quarter with positive cash flow for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $177 million, which exceeded our interest and capital expenditures by $21 million. We continued to benefit from quarterly sequential improvements with 65 hotels achieving positive hotel level operating profit compared to 53 hotels last quarter. 
Subsequent to quarter end, these operational improvements led us to another important milestone of exiting our credit facility covenant waiver period 3 quarters ahead of its expiration, and coming into compliance with our bond indenture debt incurrence covenant. This reduces our $2.5 billion credit facility interest rate by 40 basis points and gives us greater balance sheet flexibility. 
Moving on to topline performance. While our Sunbelt hotels and our resorts continue to drive results, the third quarter represented the best quarter of the recovery for non-Sunbelt and large group hotels. Multiple hotels achieved positive EBITDA in Chicago, D.C., Boston and San Francisco and all hotels in Philadelphia and Denver maintained positive RevPAR for the second quarter in a row. Our large group hotels in San Diego, San Antonio and New Orleans also maintained positive EBITDA in the third quarter. 
Expanding on Jim's business mix comments, our hotels saw business transient room nights increase 49% over the prior quarter with a 5% increase in ADR to more than $172. Even more encouraging is that 40% of those room nights came from our urban and downtown hotels, where business transient rooms sold increase 112% over the second quarter. 
Additionally, we saw increasing activity from traditional top 10 accounts, including a mix of Fortune 500 financial, government and consulting companies, a positive given the challenges the Delta variant presented during the quarter. 
On the group front, group revenue showed steady sequential improvement over the prior quarter with a 72% increase in room nights combined with a 11% increase in rate driven by our hotels in San Diego, New York, Boston, San Antonio, Austin and Chicago. Overall, group room nights in the third quarter were 52% of 2019 levels despite the Delta variant headwinds. We were pleased to see corporate group perform better than expected in the quarter. This segment contributed 43% of total group room nights in the third quarter, which is on par with our pre-pandemic mix. Corporate group rate also spends into $196 in the third quarter, which is the highest it has been since the first quarter of 2020 and indicates that more traditional groups are coming back. Corporate group also drove significant improvements in banker's revenue, which was up 100% quarter-over-quarter. 
Association group room nights of $150,000 was more than triple that of the second quarter, which we view as another positive sign for the return of large traditional groups. Affinity groups, which includes social, military, education, religious and paternal organizations have been driving group demand during the pandemic. These groups continue to show sequential quarterly improvement, up 27% over the prior quarter. 
Looking forward, we currently have over 570,000 definite group room nights on the books for the rest of 2021. And we maintained 1.2 million group room nights on the books for the third and fourth quarters despite concern over the Delta variant. Of those group room nights on the books for the fourth quarter, over 42% of them are booked in San Diego, Boston, Orlando and Phoenix. 
Net booking activity in the third quarter for 2022 totaled 180,000 room nights. Our managers remain focused on holding future group rates, thus, ADR on the books is slightly higher than the same period in 2019. We now have roughly 2.6 million group room nights on the books in 2022, an 8% increase over the second quarter. For comparison, this represents about 54% of 2019 actual group room nights compared to 50% last quarter. 
Moving on to expenses. Pro forma total operating costs rose by 21% during the third quarter compared to the second quarter despite a 25% increase in total revenues. Variable expenses were down 40% relative to a total revenue decline of 32% when compared to the third quarter of 2019. Most of this gap is due to the hiring pace, lagging demand growth and we expect this gap to moderate through the fourth quarter as our operators continue to ramp up staffing levels. The number of open positions at our major operators indicate, they are at roughly 94% of targeted staffing based on current business volumes. For comparison, our managers have historically operated at 97% of targeted staffing based on historical business volumes. 
Fixed expenses, including wages and benefits, were 19% lower than the third quarter of 2019 and 16% higher than last quarter. Similar to last quarter, some traditionally fixed expenses like sales and marketing, came back as business volumes continued to increase. Combining revenues and expenses this quarter, our expense reduction ratio came in at 0.93, which means that for every 10% decline in hotel revenue compared to pro forma third quarter 2019, there was a 9.3% reduction in expenses. As Jim mentioned, in the third quarter, pro forma total operating expenses were down 30% to the third quarter of 2019 on revenue down 32%. 
On our last call, we indicated that we were expecting an expense reduction ratio of 0.7 to 0.80 for the second half of this year. The difference between our third quarter result and our forecast can be attributed fairly evenly to 3 factors. Average daily rates came in better than expected. Wages and benefits did not ramp up as expected due to hiring challenges in certain markets. And we had unanticipated favorable onetime items in the quarter, including business interruption, insurance proceeds and property tax savings, totaling approximately $10 million. We are expecting an expense reduction ratio of approximately 0.85 for the year, which reflects our expectation of rate-driven RevPAR growth and a continued lag in expense growth driven by labor costs. 
As you may recall, we introduced the expense reduction ratio during the pandemic to measure the change in property level expenses against the change in total revenue. As our revenue declined compared to 2019 decrease in size, onetime expenses have a much bigger impact on the ratio, thus making it less relevant. We, therefore, expect to revert to pre-pandemic metrics in the coming quarters as operations continue to normalize. 
Turning to our top line outlook for the remainder of the year. We are still unable to provide guidance given the continued uncertainty surrounding COVID. That said, we continue to expect sequential quarterly RevPAR improvements driven by rate growth from leisure travelers at our resorts, and we are encouraged by the performance of our urban hotels as demand drivers in those markets continue to recover. We also expect group and business transient to continue improving in our urban and downtown markets as impacts from the Delta variant moderate, companies return to the office, and traditional groups get back to meeting in-person. 
To conclude, we are very pleased with our achievements during the third quarter, including generating positive adjusted EBITDAre, FFO and exiting our credit facility covenant waiver period 3 quarters ahead of its expiration. We remain very well positioned to execute on our goal of increasing the EBITDA growth profile and improving the quality of our portfolio, particularly given our strong balance sheet, accretive capital recycling and the strong recovery that is underway. We continue to make significant progress on redefining the operating model with our managers, increasing market share at our renovated assets and strategically allocating capital. 
With that, we would be happy to take any questions. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to 1 question."

The number that we provided for our October RevPAR is a preliminary portfolio number. And we do not have granular data at this point in time on -- in the performance at the Urban hotels versus Sunbelt leisure hotels. 
We did a rollout, and we saw that $143 is a good number, and that's the number we provided. So we're confident given the trajectory of the business return that we saw in the third quarter, in particular, that the business is going to continue to ramp. And the encouraging -- a lot of encouraging data points, as we said in our prepared comments.
But one of the most encouraging with respect to the urban hotels is the level of leisure business we saw come back to those properties, as amenities started to open up, such as Broadway in New York. We saw the Boston Marathon. We've had really strong performance on the leisure side. We're seeing a lot of solid business transient come back to the urban properties as well. And that's business transient from our traditional -- more traditional accounts. 
The top 10 accounts that are household makes financial services, consulting, defense-related businesses, government accounts. So we are very encouraged with the ramp that we're seeing occur. To give -- go from 50% at the beginning of the quarter to 56% in occupancy at the end of the quarter and see a nice uptick in rate is very encouraging to us. So as vaccines continue to be rolled out, we had good news, I guess, it was just yesterday that adolescents are now approved for vaccines. 
So down to -- children down to 5 years old are eligible to get a vaccine. We think that's very encouraging. We feel that businesses are going to get back to work. They're going to open their offices. And there is clearly a pent-up demand on the part of businesses to get out on the road and meet people. 
I mean we're experiencing it ourselves in our offices.  The number of folks who want to come behind and say, hello, face-to-face really is testament to the fact that there's no substitute for in-person communication and in-person collaboration. So Sourav, I don't know if you have anything else that we can add at this point in time."

If you recall from the beginning of the year from January through July, we had about, on average, a 30% sequential improvement in BT room nights every single month. We saw a slight increase from July to August and then a slight dip from August to September, but now we have picked up and back on the trajectory that we had seen early on in the year.
So very encouraged. And as Jim talked about, sort of our overall BT rate is actually up 5% quarter-over-quarter, and that's holding strong. As it relates to 2019, we are about, call it, around 50% of '19 levels as we stand right now, and we expect that to continue to improve with every single quarter going forward."

On the labor front, what I'll start off with sort of end with $100 million to $150 million that we have messaged is when we were going into 2020, we were expecting higher than inflationary growth in a few of the Sunbelt markets, and that's obviously pre-pandemic. So as we went through the pandemic, there were obviously the rate of acceleration in terms of wage growth and those markets went up. 
For the portfolio -- if I can give you some specific numbers here, for the portfolio, I would say, we expect a CAGR from '19 to '22 of about 5% to 7%. Now I would break that down between urban and Sunbelt markets. For urban, just given a lot of those are covered under the [ CBA ], that would be around 3% to 4% CAGR from '19 to '22. In the Sunbelt that CAGR would be about 6% to 8%. So again, the overall portfolio, we expect that CAGR of '19 to 2022 to be about 5% to 7%.
Now as it relates to the $100 million and $150 million that we messaged, remember that was in relation to 2019 revenues and expenses. So reality is, depending on how quickly we get back to '19 levels of revenue, we can see all that benefit sort of come through to the bottom line. Obviously, depending on how much inflationary -- above inflationary growth we see in wages and benefits, it will be shaved off and that will impact margin going forward. So hopefully, that answers your question."

And I think one of the most encouraging data points with respect to the second half of the year and the third quarter and the fourth quarter was the fact that we were able to maintain 1.2 million group room nights on books, notwithstanding Delta. So it just points out that there's a lot of pent-up demand in the economy. In general, when people want to get back out, they want to meet, they want to travel, we've seen a little bit of a pullback as a result of Delta as everyone else did. But as the Delta trend line started to diminish and we got over the peak and new cases, and people saw that we were going in the same direction as countries and other parts of the world were, they got back on the road.
So there's no magic to it. I mean I think one of the -- and we've talked about this a lot. The quality of our assets is really second to none. And the fact that we have continued to invest capital in our portfolio, we think is going to be a true competitive advantage as business really starts to open up. I mean I said it in my prepared remarks with respect to market share gains, as we embarked upon the Marriott transformational capital program back in '17 and '18, we underwrote 3 to 5 points pickup in the RevPAR yield index, that was pre-pandemic. 
Now that we're going to have a portfolio that is largely refreshed, I mean we're going to spend $75,000 a key on the 21 properties that we referenced, 16 Marriotts and 5 other assets, we would expect that we'll continue to see strong performance going forward, and I'm optimistic quite frankly, that we'll pick up more than 3 to 5 points in yield index.
So I think it's a combination of the quality of our assets, the location of our assets. Our asset managers and enterprise analytics team working very closely with the best in the business, whether it's Marriott, Hyatt, or independent managers that are out there, just really being very thoughtful about revenue management strategies and yield management strategies and getting business in the hotels while maintaining rate integrity. And I think that's a big -- that's another big story as we open up for business again. This pandemic and post-pandemic has been marked by a material yield ADR integrity as opposed to what happened coming out of the Great Recession.
So we're able to truly asset manage these hotels and revenue manage them to maximize RevPAR. And I expect we'll continue to do that going forward."

So we're encouraged that, that number actually ticked up from 50% at the end of our second quarter call to 54% now. 
So I don't know what Marriott said with respect to pace, but we're actually encouraged. I mean we have roughly 2.6 million group room nights on the books. And if we looked at the same period of time, quarter 3, 2019 for quarter 3, 2020, just to give you some context, and this is what we talked about last quarter, we had 68% of our actuals on the books at that point in time.

So San Francisco will recover. It's going to take time for San Francisco to recover.
With respect to New York, New York is a tough market, if you want to talk about citywide, because they don't have a lot of citywides in New York City. And what we're seeing in New York is the return of a lot of affinity groups, a lot of corporate groups are coming back. And we're very encouraged with what we're seeing in New York, particularly as international inbound comes back into that market. International inbound in New York City accounts for about 12% of our business. So again, as the borders open up, and it's early, but we are encouraged with what we're seeing in New York."

So while yes, pace is lower than what we had in '19 for '20, it's somewhat expected just given the skittishness in terms of booking, particularly with the blip that we had with Delta. We do believe a lot of those accounts are going to come out from the sidelines and then book in the year for the year. So we expect in the year for the year activity to be much greater than what we had seen back in 2019. And also, sort of since the start of 2021, just to put it in perspective, we booked 600,000 room nights for '23 to '25, and that's like a 20% increase since the start of the year. 
And if you compare the same time period, the 3 years from '19, that was at 23% for future years. So that we are doing really well. It's a matter of 2022, which we feel will do well in the year for the year. To answer your attrition cancellations question..."

As you know, the deals that we've been able to get done this year have been off-market transactions, and that's where we continue to stay focused right now. Because there is a fair amount of competition out there, given that the debt markets are flushed with cash, the CMBS market, in particular flushed with cash and a lot of the private equity firms were sitting on the sideline waiting for the CMBS markets to come back. So we are starting to see more competition. As we think about sources of capital, we're very, very delighted that we could exit the credit waiver amendment 3 quarters before expiration.
And one of the other data points that we didn't discuss is the fact that we had a debt incurrence test under our bond indenture. As you know, our portfolio is completely unencumbered. So it's all balance sheet debt. And we had a debt incurrence test under our bond indentures that precluded us from getting from issuing new debt, hard stop until we got back above 1.5x interest coverage. So we've met that threshold as well. I think it's going to, on the margin, give us a little more flexibility on the acquisition front. There were several transactions in the market that we worked on last year that had existing debt in place. And that debt was prohibitively expensive to break and pay off. So we had to take a pass. But now with the fact that we can acquire assets with that, that gives us another opportunity to look at a few hotels out there that are encumbered with existing financing.
So we're very happy with our cash position. We're happy with the fact that we have come out of the credit waiver amendment 3 quarters early. And between cash on hand and the ability to issue new debt, I think that is the direction you would see us going, if we continue to deploy capital into new acquisitions."

So it's a little early to give you specific numbers, but I would venture that coming off the strong base in '21, that we're seeing it really every deal that we've acquired this year that '22 is likely to outperform our underwriting expectations as well. When we underwrote the acquisitions throughout the course of this year, we were in a very period of gray uncertainty. We didn't really have a sense on how Delta -- COVID was going to behave and when the country was going to be able to get COVID under control. So a long way of saying that we were conservative in our underwriting.
And conservative in our underwriting, but as we look out to, say, '23, '24 and beyond, and the financial performance that we baked into these properties, it penciled on an IRR basis and allowed us to pull the trigger and deploy capital. I think that it's going to be meaningfully better across the board. I mean if you just look at where we put capital and what's happening in these markets, some of the best, highest growing -- highest growth markets in the country, with meaningful barriers to new supply. If you think about Alila, truly iconic and irreplaceable asset to be able to buy that at 9.3x on this year's EBITDA, an asset that's generating $275,000 a key in EBITDA, and we're not seeing any slowdown there.
The Four Seasons Resort, Walt Disney World, we're just starting to see the benefits of the celebration, the 50th anniversary celebration of Walt Disney World. It just kicked off in October. So I expect that we're going to see outperformance going forward. And I think that you'll see it across all the assets we bought that we're going to continue to see it in our resort portfolio, which is comprised of 16 properties now.
