And doubling the pace of a renovation program to more than 1,000 per year. We also launched our initial test for Dollar Tree Plus.

These variables include unknowns related to the COVID pandemic impact to customer shopping patterns. Timing and magnitude of government stimulus, a potential for the timing of changes federal minimum wage. 
I do want to share some points to assist your [indiscernible] for 2021. So February [indiscernible] have brought snow intrusion tempers through Texas and much of the central part of the state resulted more than 5,500 lost store days for closures of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores in areas most impacted. Stores are now back over and operating, but Q1 sales will be impacted from these closures. 
We will be cycling the 2020 onset of the COVID pandemic in [ '21 ] Q1. Our business segments were impacted in different ways a year ago. 
With Dollar Tree, both sales and gross margin were negatively impacted by those discretionary Easter related seasonal sales. 
As a result in Q1 2020, the [indiscernible] segment had a 0.9% comp decrease and a 31.9% gross margin. At Family Dollar for Q1, we'll be cycling a 15.5% comp increase in the prior year, which will be our toughest quarterly compare for 2021. 
We faced [indiscernible] always in freight costs in [ 2020 ]. Minimal ways has increased in certain standard and upcoming future legislation. The currently scheduled minimum wage increases are estimated to increase store payroll by $45 million to $50 million in 2021. 
We're experiencing some delays in receiving import merchant in results in on lignite shortages and issues with port congestion. 
As a result of current market conditions, we're seeing significant increases in cost of import rate and moderate pressure on domestic free. We currently project $80 million to $100 million of additional costs in fiscal 2021 as results market conditions. These costs primarily affects the first 3 quarters of the year as currently projected. 
We believe these headwinds will be more than offset by productivity and cost savings initiatives, such as Crafter Square, H2 and combo stores, continued focus and strength, our new cover related costs. 
Incurred COVID-related costs of $279 million in 2020 to support our associates, stores and customers. We will continue to incur costs for COVID activities in 2021, but we believe at a materially reduced level. 
We've got tailwinds as well. COVID checked are anticipated to provide a significant lift. We also expect that the base customer traffic could return to more normalized levels. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $34 million in Q1, approximately $135 million for fiscal 2021. 
Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 23.5% for the first quarter and 23.2% for fiscal 2021. 
Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 234.5 million shares for Q1 at 234.8 million shares for the full year. 
Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. But as noted, we increased our share repurchase authorization to $2.4 billion. 
Over the past several years, the company has reduced its debt from the acquisition by over $5 billion, returning to a solid investment-grade rating. 
With our strong flexible balance sheet, we'll be able to increase store growth and return to care purchases is an important part of capital allocation going forward. 
We'd expect to complete the [indiscernible] share repurchase authorization over the next 2 years or so. And I'll now turn the call back over to Mike."

And we delivered annual diluted EPS of $5.65. 
This morning, we announced our newest and tested concept that is working remarkably well in rural markets. What we refer to is our combination or combo store format. 
As I have said in the past, we will continue to refine strategic store formats designed to serve more customers in all types of geographic markets, while improving store productivity, margins and returns. 
The combination store leverages both Dollar Tree and Family dollar brands to serve small towns across the country. The comment, the store combines family dollars, great value and assortment with dollar trees, while to hunt and $1 price point. Core and new format targeted for populations ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 people. 
These are markets where we traditionally do not open a dollar tree store alone. We opened the first test combination store in late 2019. And followed by 2 additional test stores in early 2020. 
Closely analyzing the store performance and customer feedback and utilizing learnings, we refine the concept. Between July 2020 and calendar year-end, we opened or renovated 32 additional stores. And currently, we have nearly 50 new stores and small towns like wind and Alabat Owensville, Georgia, Urbina, New York and dozens of others. Compared to other small market Family Dollar stores, these combination stores are delivering same-store sales if on greater than 20% on average. Combination stores are more productive, delivering higher gross margins and our better leveraging store costs. 
Our successful H2 stores and combination stores will both be part of the family or new store and renovation strategy moving forward. 
We are extremely pleased with our customers' response to the new combination store concept. Our goal is to have formats that leverage the best of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands. To serve customers in all types of geographic markets. We believe we can continue to change, evolve and improve. 
To raise share why we are very excited to introduce this new format we are providing a 3-minute video, along with photos, introducing the new combination stores@familydollar.com for a combo stores. Please go check it out. 
Our teams worked incredibly hard throughout fiscal 2020. I could not be more proud of our team's commitment, dedication and focus. We believe our proven strategic store formats and accelerated store growth plan, 1,250 planned store renovations for the year.

The $45 million to $50 million that we spoke to in regards to payroll is very specific. Our operations, labor department looks at that by state. We know there's approximately 30 states affected this year. We know our our labor pool in those states, we know how many people we have and when we go through a calculation on that. Now that's no different than any other year. 
This is just really the first time we've given you a number as to what it relates to. We have -- we have faced the same type of increases over the last couple of years. But this time, we were just trying to put some graphics around it to help people understand the size of that. 
As it relates the freight costs, again, our current projection is roughly $80 million to $100 million of really fairly comparable across both banners. It is much more import related than domestic-related system probably 75-25, 80-20 as far as import related at this point in time. 
And that is just based upon current market conditions that we currently face. As many you know, we go-to-market with our freight contract or inflow great contracts in the spring here. These are negotiated in March and April and to go live them in a [indiscernible]. 
So really, a lot has been talked about in the marketplace in general. So I don't think there should be a lot of surprise around it. And again, we're just trying to give an idea of the size of that. And then obviously, if we look at the offsets, so obviously, COVID costs in here with themselves last year, we talked about were $279 million. If we even if we said we spent at the same rate we did in Q4, which is roughly $25 million. 
We spend, obviously, significantly less going into the new year. So I'll let you guys do the math on that at the end of the day, but those are the puts and takes. 
And obviously, it goes beyond that, obviously, driving sales. I think we obviously the talk this week spring about how we'll continue to drive sales. But also there's other items. When you look at shrink as a potential good item after maybe a second year in a row after having an upswing a couple of years prior to that. 
So some good progress being made there. We're still not where we think we can get to, but really proud of the teams, the operations teams and the asset protection team we have been working hard to mitigate the issue that we've faced there."

Going in the right direction, it's still not where want it to be ultimately. We've made big strides. And we do believe, obviously, as we began 2020, we spoke a lot about discretionary business and building that side of and being a more important player in building that kind of muscle. 
And obviously, the pandemic helped with that. But we do believe that we've made strides. And again, I think like in his comments talked about the fact that are just growing twice the market in that piece of business. So that's a great opportunity to go. But that doesn't mean we don't think there's other opportunities as well. 
You look at the -- as we talk about the combo store, we think that's a great opportunity. We believe there's at 3,000 locations out there where we can play an important role in our customers' lives and a day-to-day basis and be their place to shop many things. 
They may not live close to a large metropolitan area. And so it's a big opportunity as we think about it. So a lot of opportunity there. I think on the poultry side, I think, again, we've always be there's opportunity and solid years evolved over the years, as you well know, in the sense of we always reinvent ourselves most recently, we talked about snackzone, we've talked our Crafters Square initiative. 
And again, some of these initiatives are traffic driving. Some of these are really margin driving and -- but it's always relevant to the consumer. And the $1 fixed price point, despite a lot of style. People love the value it provides. 
And now we can add upon that, obviously, taking the Dollar Tree plus! opportunity, expanding into 500 stores continuing learn and build upon that and really be able to take that and benefit both banners by taking that $3 and $5 product."

And I absolutely believe there's growth for both banners. 
And Kevin hit out him. I'll start with Family Dollar. We are absolutely going to come out stronger on the back side of the Panda the front side for a lot of reasons. And I think about what Kevin was speaking to on March 4 last year. Our comp sales and consumables were strong low single-digit quarter quarter and where we needed to focus our energy was on our discretionary side. And it was a year ago in December that [indiscernible] was assigned to be the lead merchant for both banners and really leverage synergies were possible and bring disciplines and capabilities to the Family dollar team. 
So during this pandemic, we didn't just survive through we thrive through it and change our disciplines and strategies. And when you looked at -- in our merchandising, we looked at our basic assortment of what we're carrying, we've got sharper price points. 
We got better values and we're not going to go back to the old way. We're going to improve upon that. And the pandemic really accelerated our inventory from the past and really flushed that through last year. 
And then our new receipts coming in on all the discipline just got done the striving are really selling it at a great mix, stronger sell-throughs, less markdowns and better turns. But the second thing is, is our stores. 
You heard us talk about our customer satisfaction scores across the board for 3 quarters are improving. We've invested a lot in getting better initiatives and execution in our stores and our a responding. 
And we'll have that carrying forward compared to going into the pandemic. The fourth thing, as Kevin said, is we've got clear direction now on a format strategy. 
We've got H2 Form that is continuing to produce 10% comps when we go in and renovate them, and we're going to renovate another 1,250 of them this year. And then this wonderful new store of a company store in small towns that is producing a 20% comp. That's another thing that we didn't have prior to last year going into pandemic. And then our balance sheet, as Kevin spoke about. Generate a lot of cash flow. And we've got a $1.4 billion on our balance sheet, and that enables us to be very flexible and grow this company like we haven't grown because we don't have to pay $1 billion to $1.2 billion every year to pay down the debt. 
We can use it flexible to grow this company and grow shareholder value. And then the last thing I would say on Family Dollar side is, and we haven't even been into digital and omnichannel business. And you heard us just now tipping our tolls in the Instagram. 
And we [indiscernible] Instacart is just getting a huge response for our customers and it gives us a broader able to serve a broader segment of with Instacart. So there's another upside with our digital and outlet channel. And then you've heard us about Dollar Tree Plus. 
We will always grow that business, and we'll find those categories. And now we have our Crafter Square and all Dollar tree. We just got it done in January. We're going to go this entire year with Tractor Square. And you've heard us talk about Dollar Tree flow. So we're going to drive that Dollar Tree flow and then Dollar Tree didn't perform that well because it was COVID related. 
If you look at our fourth quarter, our November comps in Dollar Tree were spike in our January in 2 heaters. What happened was December locked down because of the coded cases increased in spite at highest levels across the country. 
And you all saw that. And the states because of that increased to the lockdowns, people did not go around. And what happens is there wasn't any celebrations. The Dollar Tree feeds those celebration in the schools, in the churches, at home, at work parties and all of our party categories flourish during the first 10 days before Christmas. 
And it just didn't happen because of COVID. Outside of that, we had a great quarter to 2.4% comp, which was better than the fourth quarter in 2019, and we had a COVID problem. We delivered 36 plus margin and a 16% top income at Family Dollar, and I believe we can beat that next year. So yes, to answer your question, I believe we have us for Europe, both banners for those reasons."

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining me today. What a year. I believe that from now -- that years from now, many of us will reflect upon 2020 as being one of the most unique, unpredictable and challenging business environments of our career. My sincerest gratitude goes out to our 195,000 plus associates working in more than 15,600 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores and in 26 distribution centers and to our field leadership teams as well as our store support team here in Chesapeake, Virginia. Your commitment and dedication to protect and serve our customers is critical to our company's success. As an essential retailer in the value segment, we will continue to be part of the solution for millions of households across North America.
Additionally, I would like to recognize our business partners, both supply chain and suppliers, for their efforts to support our business throughout the year. In 2020, we exceeded $25 billion in annual sales for the first time, and we have a long runway of growth ahead of us. As our business grows, so does the need and support from each of our business partners. We appreciate your continued support.
The recent trends have been encouraging. COVID cases are on the decline, and vaccinations are on the rise. However, we will continue to be relentless in our efforts to protect each other until this pandemic is behind us.
I am very pleased with the team's operating performance for the fourth quarter, highlighted by solid same-store sales increase, improved gross margin and expense leverage. The team delivered EPS increase of 310% compared to the prior year's quarters or 19% when adjusted for discrete charges in the prior year. Our results included a 4.9% enterprise comp increase, an 80 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 90 base increase in operating profit margin when compared to the prior year's adjusted numbers.
Our Dollar Tree segment delivered another quarter of positive same-store sales with a 2.4% increase. January was the strongest month of the quarter, followed by November. In fact, January was our strongest monthly comp since April of 2019. December was slightly negative as store traffic was impacted by an escalation in COVID cases, resulting in expanded lockdowns and significantly fewer holiday social gatherings among families, companies, churches and schools. As we have seen in the onset of the pandemic, sales were again driven by average ticket, which increased 17.9% as shoppers continue to consolidate trips. Comp transaction count declined 13.1%. 
We delivered a 36.1% gross margin, and Dollar Tree's operating margin, which included $13.8 million in COVID-related costs, came in at 16% operating income. Categories performing well included crafts, seasonal, household products, floral, kitchenware and beauty and eyewear. Building on the continued success of craft assortment, we completed the rollout of Crafter's Square to all U.S. Dollar Tree stores in January. Inspiring the creativity of our customers is at the core of Dollar Tree, and we are thrilled to provide an even broader assortment of art and crafts supplies at tremendous values. With our $1 fixed price point and more than 7,500 U.S. store locations, Crafter's Square presents customers with an unlimited solutions for current learn-from-home and work-from-home environment.
Additionally, terrific opportunity exist for DIY home projects and decor, crafts for the entire family, seasonal decorations and handmade gifts. Our shoppers love the expanded assortment, which is validated by the excitement Crafter's Square is generating across social media platforms, including YouTube and Instagram.
Regarding our Dollar Tree Plus!, our shoppers love the values, and we exceeded our initial sales plan for the fourth quarter. We had great sell-through on our seasonal products, on our toys and household consumables. We are on schedule to kick off the previously announced expansion of Dollar Tree Plus! this month. We are expanding multi-price assortment from the current base of 120 stores to a total of 500 stores and will be completed by August. Additionally, we are capturing great buying synergies as the majority of the $3 and $5 merchandise for the DT Plus! will be offered in both banners.
Family Dollar sales highlights for the quarter included an 8.1% comp increase, comprised of a 21.9% expansion in average ticket, partially offset by 11.3% decline in transaction count. This is similar to the ticket traffic trip consolidation dynamic we have seen since Q1 of 2020.
Regarding the cadence of comps, all 3 months were positive, with January being the strongest month. As a reminder, all Family Dollar stores were closed on Christmas Day in 2020, which has impacted December comp results as approximately 5,600 stores were open for business the previous year.
January was Family Dollar's strongest monthly comp since May of last year. We saw solid sales across many of the discretionary categories that we have been focused on improving, including home decor, apparel, household cleaning, lawn and garden, party, beauty care and seasonal.
The consumables side of the business delivered another positive quarterly comp at 6.2%, and the discretionary comp was a strong 13.5% comp. In Q4, discretionary as a percent of net sales at Family Dollar increased 120 basis points to 26.2% of sales. Similar to recent quarters, based on third-party data, our market share in discretionary grew 2x faster than the remaining market in Q4. Late in 2020, we launched our initial test for produce and frozen needs at select Family Dollar stores, targeting markets where shoppers have fewer local grocery options. We want to provide shoppers with convenient access to basic produce items as well as beef, poultry and pork. We plan to expand our test in 2021.
We recently announced the expansion of our new partnership with Instacart platform across the U.S. Same-day delivery is another example of meeting the evolving needs of Family Dollar shoppers. The initial results have exceeded our expectations, and we continue to receive very positive feedback from shoppers. These transactions have materially higher average ticket, and we believe the Instacart platform is enabling us to broaden our dollar -- our Family Dollar customer base. Interestingly, in the first 3 weeks of the national rollout, more than 80% of Family Dollar stores had 1 or more Instacart transactions.
As always, our most important scorecards come from our shoppers. We are seeing considerable improvements in our customer satisfaction survey scores. For Q4, we saw record numbers across each of the 4 key categories: store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service and speed of checkout. In fact, each of these categories have shown improvement for 3 consecutive quarters. Contributors to these -- this success is an enhanced Family Dollar brand strategy program that clearly conveys expectations and examples to our store teams. And the chains' annual store manager turnover are at the best in over a decade. The improved customer satisfaction results gives us confidence that we will be able to retain shoppers that discovered or reengage with Family Dollar during the pandemic.
Regarding Dollar Tree Canada, the team delivered another solid quarter, exceeding its plan for sales, gross margin and operating income. From a real estate perspective, we completed more than 280 projects, including 124 new stores, 11 relocations, 106 Family Dollar renovations and 45 store closings. We ended the year with 15,685 stores.
We accomplished a great deal in 2020. Much of this was made possible by our 2019 initiatives that really set the stage to gain traction and momentum in 2020 and beyond. To quickly recap, in 2019, we consolidated our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar store support centers into 1 campus, greatly improving efficiencies through enhanced communication, collaboration and support. We made tremendous progress on Family Dollar store optimization initiatives by rebannering 200 stores, closing more than 400 stores and doubling the pace of our renovation program to more than 1,000 per year.
We also launched our initial test for Dollar Tree Plus!, and we realigned our leadership team to enhance and align the consistency of communication, strategies, process and workflows. For example, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar merchants went through 2020 in complete unison for buying calendars, buying trip meetings, planning dates and category performance reviews. This strength in alignment was very evident in the success of our recent virtual buying trip in January, which is our biggest buying trip of the year. These initiatives help build the foundation for 2020 performance.
The progress we have made at Family Dollar in the past despite the pandemic has been remarkable. We are benefiting from improved store conditions and better execution on initiatives, resulting in market share gains. We have also seen improved customer satisfaction scores, store turnover and shrink improvements. I am convinced that Family Dollar will exit the pandemic as a much stronger organization. This progress is why I'm more enthusiastic about the opportunities in 2021 and beyond, including the expansion of Dollar Tree Plus! and the growth of our new Combination Stores into small towns across America.
I will go into more detail on our plans for 2021 after Kevin speaks to the Q4 performance and our outlook. Kevin?"

For the fourth quarter, consolidated net sales increased 7.2% to $6.77 billion, comprised of $3.71 billion of Dollar Tree and $3.06 billion of Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 4.9% or 5% when adjusted for Canadian currency fluctuations. Comps for Family Dollar increased 8.1% and Dollar Tree segment increased 2.4%.  
Overall, gross profit for the enterprise increased 9.8% to $2.15 billion, and gross margin improved 80 basis points to 31.8%. The gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 10 basis points to 36.1% when compared to the prior year's quarter. The factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance include distribution costs increased 40 basis points primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation. This includes the continued ramp-up of the 2 new distribution centers as well as $4.4 million or 10 basis points of COVID-related expenses primarily premium pay and bonuses. These higher DC costs as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by a 20 basis point improvement in markdowns and a 5 basis point improvement in shrink. Merchandise costs, including freight, also improved 5 basis points. Improvements in merchandise mix and markdown were mostly offset by increased freight costs.
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment improved 200 basis points to 26.6% in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following: markdown expense improved 100 basis points due to lower promotional activity and improved sell-through of seasonal merchandise and apparel; occupancy costs decreased approximately 50 basis points from leverage on the 8.1% comp sales increase; shrink improved 35 basis points on improved inventory results; distribution costs improved approximately 15 basis points compared to the prior year quarter; the current year quarter included approximately $3.2 million or 10 basis points of COVID-related expenses, primarily premium paying bonuses; and regarding merchandise costs, including freight, improvements in merchandise mix and markdown were essentially offset by increased freight costs during the quarter.
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 540 basis points to 21.7% of net sales compared to 27.1% in Q4 a year ago. The prior year's quarter included a $313 million noncash pretax and after-tax goodwill impairment charge, an $18 million charge to the litigation reserve. Excluding these items from the prior year's quarter, SG&A expenses improved 20 basis points from an adjusted 21.9% of net sales.
For the fourth quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of net sales improved slightly to 20.1% of net sales when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs improved approximately 30 basis points and is comprised of the following: payroll expenses increased approximately $7.2 million or 20 basis points for costs associated with COVID-19-related payroll and bonuses. Additionally, increased incentive compensation was partially offset by lower health insurance benefits.
Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 20 basis points primarily from reduced travel and lower legal and professional fees. The depreciation cost decreased 10 basis points. Excluding goodwill impairment and litigation reserve charges from the prior year's quarter, the SG&A rate for the Family Dollar segment improved approximately 80 basis points to 20.6% compared to an adjusted 21.4% for the fourth quarter of 2019.
Depreciation improved 30 basis points, primarily from leverage on strong comp sales increase. Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 30 basis points primarily due to lower advertising and travel costs as a percentage of net sales. Payroll-related expenses improved approximately 15 basis points, and store facility costs improved approximately 5 basis points, primarily from leverage on comp sales and lower electricity costs. Corporate and support expenses increased 20 basis points primarily related to higher incentive comp and stock compensation expense compared to the prior year's quarter.
Operating income improved 173% to $681.6 million compared with $249.4 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin was 10.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 3.9% in the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $313 million goodwill impairment and $18 million litigation reserve from the prior year's quarter, operating income margin improved 90 basis points from the adjusted 9.2%.
Q4 of 2020 included total incremental operating costs of $24.8 million for COVID-19-related expenses. These incremental costs by segment were $13.8 million for Dollar Tree, $10.6 million for Family Dollar and $0.4 million for Corporate, Support and Other. Nonoperating expenses totaled $34.2 million, comprised of net interest expense.
Our effective tax rate was 22.3% compared to 41.3% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The prior year rate was affected by the noncash goodwill impairment charge that was not tax deductible. Without the goodwill impairment charge, the tax rate was -- for Q4 2019 would have been 16.6%, which included a reduction in tax expense of $24.6 million for the reversal of our valuation allowance related to the company's foreign net operating loss carryforwards.
Company net income of $502.8 million or $2.13 per diluted share, which included $0.08 per diluted share for COVID-19-related expenses. This compares to a net earnings of $123 million or $0.52 per share in the prior year's quarter and an adjusted earnings per share of $1.79.
Combined cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled $1.42 billion compared to $539.2 million at the end of fiscal 2019. The company paid off the $300 million legacy Family Dollar note during the quarter. Outstanding debt as of January 30, 2021, was $3.25 billion.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.83 million shares for $200 million. With the Board action announced this morning, we now have $2.4 billion authorized for share repurchases. We will continue to invest in our business and will provide postquarter updates on share repurchase activity.
Inventory for Dollar Tree at year-end declined 5.9% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 3.7%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 9.2%. Inventory for Family Dollar at year-end increased 0.5% from the same period last year, while selling square footage increased 1.8%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 11.3%. Our inventory levels improved in Q4 and will continue to be more productive with lower inventory, significantly increasing our inventory turns.
Capital expenditures were $191.8 million in the fourth quarter versus $252.5 million in Q4 last year. For fiscal 2021, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion. Capital expenditures will be focused on 600 new stores and 1,250 Family Dollar H2 renovations. The new stores will be 400 Dollar Tree stores and 200 Family Dollar stores, including both H2 and combo stores, formats, based on market locations. The addition of frozen and refrigerated capability to select Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores, IT system enhancements and projects, development of our Chesapeake campus, installation of LED lighting and HVAC and flooring replacements in select stores and the ongoing construction for the second phase of our new distribution center in Ocala, Florida.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $182.9 million for Q4 compared to $179.1 million in the fourth quarter last year. And for the year, depreciation expense totaled $686.6 million. For fiscal 2021, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $720 million to $730 million.
Due to a number of variables and uncertainties, we're not providing specific sales and EPS guidance. These variables include unknowns related to the COVID pandemic and its impact to customer shopping patterns, timing and magnitude of government stimulus and potential for the timing of changes with federal minimum wage.
I do want to share some points to assist your modeling for 2021. The February storms have brought snow and freezing temperatures through Texas and much of the central part of the states, resulting in more than 5,500 lost store days for closures of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores in the areas most impacted. Stores are now back open and operating, but Q1 sales will be impacted from these closures.
We will be cycling the 2020 onset of the COVID pandemic in 20 -- in Q1. Our business segments were impacted in different ways a year ago. At Dollar Tree, both sales and gross margin were negatively impacted by losing discretionary Easter-related seasonal sales. As a result, in Q1 of 2020, the Dollar Tree segment had a 0.9% comp decrease and a 31.9% gross margin. At Family Dollar, for Q1, we'll be cycling a 15.5% comp increase in the prior year, which will be our toughest quarterly compare for 2021.
We face headwinds for minimum wage and freight costs in 2021. The minimum wage has increased in certain states and localities and may increase nationally depending on the outcome of future legislation. The currently scheduled minimum wage increases are estimated to increase store payroll by $45 million to $50 million in 2021.
We're experiencing some delays in receiving import merchandise as a result of worldwide equipment shortages and issues with port congestion. As a result of current market conditions, we're seeing significant increases in cost of import freight and moderate pressure on domestic freight. We currently project $80 million to $100 million of additional costs in fiscal 2021 as a result of these market conditions. These costs primarily affect the first 3 quarters of the year as currently projected.
We believe these headwinds will be more than offset by productivity and cost savings initiatives, such as Crafter's Square, H2 and combo stores, continued focus in shrink and reduced COVID-related costs.
We incurred COVID-related costs of $279 million in 2020 to support our associates, stores and customers. We will continue to incur costs for COVID activities in 2021 but, we believe, at a materially reduced level.
We've got tailwinds as well. COVID relief checks are anticipated to provide a significant lift. We also expect that the COVID -- the base customer traffic could return to more normalized levels.
Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $34 million in Q1, approximately $135 million for fiscal 2021. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 23.5% for the first quarter and 23.2% for fiscal 2021.
Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 234.5 million shares for Q1 and 234.8 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. But as noted, we increased our share repurchase authorization to $2.4 billion.
Over the past several years, the company has reduced its debt from the acquisition by over $5 billion, returning to a solid investment-grade rating. With our strong flexible balance sheet, we'll be able to increase store growth and return to share repurchases as an important part of capital allocation going forward. We'd expect to complete the $2.4 billion share repurchase authorization over the next 2 years or so.
And I'll now turn the call back over to Mike."

Again, I'm extremely proud of the team's efforts for fiscal 2020. For the year, our customer satisfaction scores are improving, and we are experiencing our lowest store manager turnover rates in many years.
The team delivered an enterprise comp increase of 6.1%. Gross profit increased by more than $740 million, a 70 basis point improvement. We delivered our SG&A costs, which were flat year-over-year, as a percent of net sales despite incurring $279 million or 110 basis points in COVID-related costs.
Enterprise operating profit margin improved 70 basis points to 7.4%. The company repurchased 400 million shares and ended the year with more than $1.4 billion in cash on the balance sheet. And we delivered annual diluted EPS of $5.65.
This morning, we announced our newest and tested concept that is working remarkably well in rural markets. What we refer to is our combination or combo store format. As I have said in the past, we will continue to refine strategic store formats designed to serve more customers in all types of geographic markets while improving store productivity, margins and returns. The Combination Store leverages both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands to serve small towns across the country. The store combines Family Dollar's great value and assortment with Dollar Tree's thrill of the hunt and $1 price point, creating a new format targeted for populations ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 people. These are markets where we traditionally do not open a Dollar Tree store alone.
We opened the first test Combination Store in late 2019, followed by 2 additional test stores in early 2020. Closely analyzing the store performance and customer feedback and utilizing learnings, we refined the concept. Between July 2020 and calendar year-end, we opened or renovated 32 additional stores. And currently, we have nearly 50 new stores in small towns like Linden, Alabama, Hogansville, Georgia, Bovina, New York and dozens of others. Compared to other small market Family Dollar stores, these Combination Stores are delivering same-store sales lift of greater than 20% on average. Combination Stores are more productive, delivering higher gross margins and are better leveraging store costs. Our successful H2 stores and Combination Stores will both be part of the Family Dollar and new store and renovation strategy moving forward.
We are extremely pleased with our customers' response to the new Combination Store concept. Our goal is to have formats that leverage the best of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands to serve customers in all types of geographic markets. We believe we can continue to change, evolve and improve.
To really share why we are very excited to introduce this new format, we are providing a 3-minute video, along with photos, introducing the new Combination Stores at FamilyDollar.com/ComboStores. Please go check it out.
Our teams worked incredibly hard throughout fiscal 2020. I could not be more proud of our team's commitment, dedication and focus. We believe our proven strategic store formats and accelerated store growth plan, 1,250 planned store renovations for the year, several key sales and traffic-driven initiatives, along with a robust balance sheet, will enable us to deliver long-term value for each of our stakeholders, our customers, associates, suppliers and shareholders.

Obviously, not giving specific guidance given the many variables that are out there right now. The $45 million to $50 million that we spoke to in regards to payroll is very specific. Our operations, labor department looks at that by state. We know there's approximately 30 states affected this year. We know our labor pool in those states. We know how many hourly people we have, and we go through a calculation on that.
Now that's no different than any other year. This is just really the first time we've given you a number as to what it relates to. We have done -- we have faced these same type of increases over the last couple of years. But this time, we were just trying to put some graphics around it to help people understand the size of that.
As it relates the freight costs, again, our current projection is roughly $80 million to $100 million, really fairly comparable across both banners. It is much more import related than domestic related so it's been probably 75-25, 80-20 as far as import related at this point in time. And that is just based upon current market conditions that we currently face. As many of you know, we go to market with our freight contract or import freight contracts in the spring here. These are negotiated in March and April and -- to go live then in May. So really, a lot has been talked about in the marketplace in general. So I don't think there should be a lot of surprise around it. And again, we're just trying to give an idea of the size of that.
And then obviously, if we look at the offsets, so obviously, COVID costs in and of themselves last year as we talked about were $279 million. If we -- even if we said we spent at the same rate we did in Q4, which is roughly $25 million, we'll spend, obviously, significantly less going into the new year. So I'll let you guys do the math on that at the end of the day, but those are the puts and takes.
And obviously, it goes beyond that. Obviously, driving sales -- I think we obviously talked this morning about how we'll continue to drive sales. But also there's other items. When you look at shrink as a potential good item after maybe a second year in a row after having an upswing a couple of years prior to that. So some good progress being made there. We're still not where we think we can get to, but really proud of the teams, the operations teams and the asset protection teams that have been working hard to mitigate the issue that we've faced there."

And to get goods move in some instances, people are paying more. And it's not just us. You've heard other retailers over the last 2 weeks speak to it as well. So it's not a Dollar Tree-specific issue. It's an industry issue.

Even if we've made a big leap this year with the Family Dollar operating income going in the right direction, it's still not where we want it to be ultimately. We've made big strides. And we do believe, obviously, as we began 2020, we spoke a lot about discretionary business and building that side of the house and us being a more important player in building that kind of muscle. And obviously, the pandemic helped with that, but we do believe that we've made strides. And again, I think Mike, in his comments, talked about the fact that are just -- we're growing twice the market in that piece of business. So that's a great opportunity to continue to go.
But that doesn't mean we don't think there's other opportunities as well. You look at the -- as we talk about the combo store, we think that's a great opportunity. We believe there's, at a minimum, 3,000 locations out there where we can play an important role in our customers' lives on a day-to-day basis and be their place to shop for many, many things. They may not live close to a large metropolitan area. And so it's a big opportunity as we think about it. So a lot of opportunity there.
I think on the Dollar Tree side, I think, again, we always believe there's opportunity. And Dollar Tree has evolved over the years, as you well know, in the sense of we always reinvent ourselves. Most recently, we've talked about Snack Zone. We've talked about our Crafter's Square initiative. And again, some of these initiatives are traffic driving. Some of these are really margin driving and -- but it's always relevant to the consumer, and the $1 fixed price point does not go out of style. People love the value it provides. And now we can add upon that, obviously, taking the Dollar Tree Plus! opportunity, expanding into 500 stores, continuing to learn and build upon that and really be able to take that and benefit both banners by taking that $3 and $5 product."

I am so excited about 2021. And I absolutely believe there's growth for both banners. And Kevin hit on them. I'll start with Family Dollar.

And I absolutely believe there's growth for both banners. And Kevin hit on them. I'll start with Family Dollar. We are absolutely going to come out stronger on the backside of the pandemic than on the front side for a lot of reasons. And I think about what Kevin was speaking to on March 4 of last year, our comp sales in consumables were strong low single-digit quarter after quarter. And where we needed to focus our energy was on our discretionary side. And it was a year ago in December that Rick McNeely was assigned to be the lead merchant for both banners and really leverage synergies where possible and bring disciplines and capabilities to the Family Dollar team.
So during this pandemic, we didn't just survive through it. We thrived through it and changed our disciplines and strategies. And we looked at -- in our merchandising, we looked at our basic assortment of what we're carrying by sharper price points. We got better values. And we're not going to go back to the old way. We're going to improve upon that. And the pandemic really accelerated our inventory from the past and really flushed that through last year. And then our new receipts coming in on all the disciplines that I just got done describing are really selling it at a great mix, stronger sell-throughs, less markdowns and better turns.
The second thing is our stores. You heard us talk about our customer satisfaction scores across the board for 3 quarters are improving. We've invested a lot in getting better initiatives and execution in our stores, and our customers are responding. And we'll have that carrying forward compared to going into the pandemic.
The fourth thing, as Kevin said, is we've got clear direction now on a format strategy. We've got H2 format that is continuing to produce 10% comps when we go in and renovate them, and we're going to renovate another 1,250 of them this year. And then this wonderful new store of a combo store in small towns that is producing a 20% comp, and so another thing that we didn't have prior to last year going into the pandemic.
And then our balance sheet as Kevin spoke about. We generate a lot of cash flow. And we've got $1.4 billion on our balance sheet, and that enables us to be very flexible and grow this company like we haven't grown before because we don't have to pay $1 billion to $1.2 billion every year to pay down the debt. We can use it flexible to grow this company and grow shareholder value.
And then the last thing I would say on Family Dollar's side is -- and we haven't even been in the digital and omnichannel business. And you heard us just now dipping our toes into Instagram and we're -- or Instacart. And the Instacart is just getting a huge response for our customers and it give us a broader -- able to serve a broader segment of this customer with Instacart. So there's another upside with our digital and omnichannel.
And then you've heard us about Dollar Tree Plus!. We will always grow that business, and we'll find those categories. And now we have our Crafter's Square in all Dollar Tree -- we just got it done in January. We're going on a goal this entire year with Crafter's Square. And you've heard us talk about Dollar Tree Plus!. So we're going to drive that Dollar Tree Plus.
And then Dollar Tree didn't perform that well because of those COVID related -- if you look at our fourth quarter, our November comps in Dollar Tree were spectacular, and our January was the best in 2 years. What happened was December lockdown, because of -- the COVID cases increased and spiked at the highest levels across the country. And you all saw that. And the states, because of that, increased the lockdowns. People did not go around. And what happens is there wasn't any celebrations. The Dollar Tree feeds those celebrations in the schools, in the churches, at-home/at-work parties, and all of our party categories flourish during the first 10 days before Christmas. And it just didn't happen because of COVID.
Outside of that, we had a great quarter with 2.4% comp, which was better than the fourth quarter in 2019, and we had a COVID problem. So we delivered 36 plus margin and a 16% op income at Family Dollar, and I believe we can beat that next year. So yes, to answer your question, I believe we're going to have a successful year at both banners for those reasons."

What I'm really excited about is -- on this format is that these are small towns that we would not go into the town with a Dollar Tree because the economics just don't support that. And we would go in with a Family Dollar and what we said is, well, let's go in with the great part of Dollar Tree and bring in the seasonal and the party and the stationery and the Crafter's Square and all the things that small-town America needs to celebrate their lives. And then on the Family Dollar side, it helps them live their lives and feed their families. So this Combination Store is really hitting on all cylinders from us because of the great mix and the great margin that provides and the overall productivity of the store.
And to your earlier comment, we will continue to look at the categories that do well. And don't forget that in our H2s, we already have about 20 categories that have the $1 items that we brought into those categories from the Dollar Tree banner that really helped bring that value program into those stores and are helping drive the H2 format as well.

Our record first quarter performance reflects the progress we continue to make on numerous initiatives to provide even greater value and convenience to our shoppers. Dollar Tree delivered its strongest quarterly s",1273,"Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Our record first quarter performance reflects the progress we continue to make on numerous initiatives to provide even greater value and convenience to our shoppers. Dollar Tree delivered its strongest quarterly same-store sales since 2017, while improving its operating margin by 290 basis points. Family Dollar effectively cycled a 15.5% comp sales increase from the prior year by driving its best post-merger quarterly operating profit. Combined, the enterprise produced positive same-store sales against a tough 2020 comparison and a 220 basis point improvement in operating margin driven by higher gross margins and better expense leverage. Overall, a very solid start to the year. 
During the initial post-merger years, much of the company's energy and focus was dedicated to integration-related projects such as stabilizing and restructuring the organization; improving store maintenance; harmonizing our technology; designing and testing store formats, optimizing our real estate portfolio; elevating the operational execution in our stores; offering improved assortments and value; and ultimately, consolidating our store support centers. These priorities were critical as we prepared the combined business for long-term profitable growth. 
Now over the last 18 months, we have transitioned to an aggressive approach under one aligned leadership team, dedicating our major efforts to customer focus initiatives with clarity, focus and speed. Examples of the innovation efforts are: Our brick-and-mortar initiatives include refining and growing our Dollar Tree Plus! multi-price initiative; continuing to evolve and improve the H2 store format with expanded home, seasonal and other discretionary categories; introducing the new combo stores for rural markets; testing fresh produce and frozen meat products in select stores; initiating self-checkout in a smaller number of stores. 
And on our digital and omnichannel initiatives, they include: Launching familydollar.com as a selling site; partnering with Instacart for same-store delivery, which expands our customer reach; and creating our new retail media network, the Chesapeake Media Group. I'm enthusiastic about the long-term impact of these actions designed to drive shopper satisfaction and loyalty, giving us the ability to meet the evolving needs of our shoppers better than any other company can, especially inside the Beltway and in rural America. 
I will share more details -- more detailed update on these exciting initiatives later on in the call. But for now, for the quarter, our Dollar Tree segment delivered its best quarterly same-store sales since Q3 of 2017. The 4.7% comp increase was comprised of a 9.5% increase in ticket, partially offset by a 4.4% decline in traffic. Notably, we saw a double-digit increase in traffic in April, which represented our best monthly comp traffic increase in years. 
From a cadence perspective, March was the strongest comp month with stronger pre-Easter sales compared to the prior year, followed by April. February was slightly negative as we lost more than 2,500 store days due to closures related to storms through Texas and Central U.S. Gross margin improved 180 basis points from the prior year as we saw record sell-through on seasonal merchandise, including Valentine's Day, Easter and Easter Candy. 
Compared to the prior year's quarter, the discretionary mix as a percentage of net sales increased 710 basis points to 52.3%. Categories performing well, included, crafts, party, our Easter seasonal, toys and floral. Our inventory turn improved 22 basis points for the quarter. 
Our merchant team continues to source great products that provide wonderful value at the margins we need. With the product already purchased for the back half of the year, I am thrilled with the discretionary back-to-school, crafts, holiday and seasonal assortments that will be hitting store shelves within the next few months. As COVID restrictions ease and customers continue to gather with friends and family for celebrations, we plan to fulfill that need with our compelling mix with even more exciting discretionary items at the dollar price point that our shoppers love. 
Family Dollar highlights for the quarter include its best post-merger quarterly operating profit at $211.4 million. Let me repeat that: Family Dollar achieved its best post-merger quarterly operating profit at $211.4 million, cycling a very strong 15.5% comp from the prior year. Same-store sales came in at a decline of 2.8%, equating to a positive 12.7% on a 2-year stack. Average ticket was up over 11%. And  traffic, cycling the initial pandemic-related demand for the consumables from a year ago, was down nearly 13% for the quarter. 
The Family Dollar merchants continue to do a terrific job refining the assortment to deliver meaningful value that is resonating with our shoppers. The discretionary side of the business saw a 14.7% comp increase. Consumable comp, again, cycling unprecedented demand from last year, was down 7.7%. 
Regarding Family Dollar's comp cadence through the quarter, February was the strongest comp followed by April. March was cycling a 20-plus comp from the prior year. From a category perspective, the strong performers were primarily on the discretionary side of the business, including party, apparel, home decor, beauty care and floral. We continue to see encouraging results for stores that added fresh produce and frozen meats to their assortment in late 2020. We are seeing materially higher average tickets when a basket contains produce or meats. I am excited to share that we will continue to expand on this initiative in 2021 and beyond, as we are focused on meeting the needs of shoppers in all markets. 
On the previous earnings call, I spoke to the fact that Family Dollar customer satisfaction survey scores had improved 3 consecutive quarters across each of the 4 key categories: store cleanliness; product assortment; customer service; and speed of checkout. Credit to our field leadership and our merchant and operations teams, each of those scores improved again for the first quarter, making it 4 quarters in a row. 
Increasing store productivity at Family Dollar has been a critical component of the turnaround. In addition to all the sales and traffic-driving initiatives that have been increasing average sales per store, we believe Family Dollar is squarely positioned to continue serving more customers and gaining market share with its compelling discretionary mix, especially as Family Dollar shoppers are benefiting from stimulus dollars, increased SNAP participation, child tax credits and earning higher wages. 
Now regarding Dollar Tree Canada, the team had a strong quarter 1. From an operating income standpoint, the Canada team exceeded their budget despite challenges to sales in April related to increased COVID restrictions. From a real estate perspective we completed 575 projects, including: 106 new stores; 36 relocations; 414 Family Dollar H2 renovations; 19 store closures. We ended the quarter with 15,772 stores. 
Before I hand it over to Kevin, I want to let you know that in April, we released our updated corporate sustainability report. The report is available on the homepage at our website, dollartree.com. I am very proud of the team's progress related to our ESG program in fiscal 2020. Accomplishments included that we conducted a detailed assessment of our impact on the environment and measured our carbon footprint to establish an initial baseline. 
We developed our first-generation of climate goals aimed to reducing emissions and increase the use of renewable energy. We participated in the chemical footprint project for the second consecutive year. We partnered with ADT Commercial for comprehensive and innovative security solutions. And we formed our Diversity Equity Inclusion Executive Counsel. And lastly, we launched our inaugural Choose to Give workplace-giving campaign. We will remain steadfastly committed to improvement, especially as related to our ESG goals and initiatives designed to minimize corporate sustainability risks while reducing cost and driving efficiencies. 
I will go into more detail on several initiatives after Kevin speaks to the Q1 performance and our outlook. Kevin?"

For the first quarter, consolidated net sales increased 3% to $6.48 billion, comprised of $3.32 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.16 billion at Family Dollar. Our enterprise same-store sales increased 0.8%, or 0.9% when adjusted for Canadian currency fluctuations. Comps for the Dollar Tree segment increased 4.7% or 4.8% when adjusted for the Canadian currency fluctuations. Family Dollar same-store sales decreased 2.8%, cycling the very strong 15.5% increase in the prior year's first quarter. 
Overall, gross profit for the enterprise increased 9.4% to $1.96 billion. Gross margin improved 180 basis points to 30.3%. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 180 basis points to 33.7% when compared to the prior year's quarter. The factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included: Merchandise costs, including freight, improved 85 basis points; improvements in merchandise mix were partially offset by increased freight costs and slightly lower mark on; a 50 basis point improvement in shrink resulting from favorable inventories and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate; a 30 basis point improvement in markdown related to improved sell-through of Easter-related products compared to the pandemic affected prior year; and 25 basis points of leverage on occupancy costs from the stronger comp sales. 
These improvements were partially offset by distribution costs, which increased 10 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll and depreciation costs. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment improved 140 basis points to 26.8% in the first quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following: merchandise costs, including freight, improved 85 basis points related to merchandise mix and initial mark on, which were partially offset by higher freight costs; shrink improved 60 basis points based on favorable inventory results; distribution costs improved 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. These improvements were partially offset by deleverage on occupancy costs based on the comparable store sales decline in the first quarter. 
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 40 basis points to 22.3% of total revenue compared to 22.7% in Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of total revenue improved 110 basis points to 21.6% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs improved 110 basis points, primarily due to decreased COVID-19-related store payroll costs and leverage related to the comp store sales increase. Other SG&A decreased by 5 basis points, resulting from lower store supply expense, partially offset by increased inventory service expense. Store facility costs increased 10 basis points due to higher repairs and maintenance costs. 
For Family Dollar, the first quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue was 20.2% compared to 19.9% in the prior year's quarter. Store facility costs increased 25 basis points, driven mainly by higher snow removal costs. Other SG&A expenses increased 20 basis points, and depreciation and amortization expense increased 5 basis points both due to deleverage on the comp sales. Payroll costs decreased 25 basis points, primarily due to decreased COVID-19-related store payroll costs, partially offset by deleverage related to the comp store sales decline. Corporate and support expenses as a percentage of total revenue were essentially flat compared to the prior year's quarter. 
Operating income increased 42.1% to $519.9 million compared with $365.9 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin was 8% in the first quarter compared to 5.8% in the prior year's quarter. The first quarter of 2021 included total incremental operating costs of $7.4 million for COVID-19-related expenses compared to $73.2 million in the first quarter of 2020. 
Nonoperating expenses totaled $33 million, which was comprised of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 23.9% in the prior year's first quarter. Company had net income of $374.5 million or $1.60 per diluted share. This compared to net earnings of $247.6 million or $1.04 per share in the prior year's quarter. 
Our combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.47 billion compared to $1.42 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. Outstanding debt as of May 1 was $3.25 billion. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.15 million shares for $250 million. We currently have $2.15 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. 
Inventory for Dollar Tree at quarter end increased 13.5% from the same time last year while selling square footage increased 4.1%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 9%. This includes a significant increase in goods and transit year-over-year. Excluding this increase, inventory per selling per square foot would be down 1.7%. 
Inventory for Family Dollar at quarter end increased 11.9% from the same period last year, while selling square footage increased 1.9%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 9.8%. Capital expenditures were $224.9 million in the first quarter versus $235.8 million in Q1 of last year. For fiscal 2021, we expect that consolidated capital expenditures will be approximately $1.2 billion, consistent with our initial 2021 outlook.  
Depreciation and amortization totaled $172.7 million for Q1 compared to $165.5 million in the first quarter of last year. For fiscal 2021, we continue to expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $720 million to $730 million. 
Our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes the following assumptions: We are forecasting a low single-digit consolidated comparable sales increase for the year; we expect the COVID expense run rate for Q2 through Q4 to be consistent with Q1 at approximately $7.5 million per quarter. As noted in our March earnings call, minimum wage increases in states and localities will increase store payroll by $45 million to $50 million for the year. And additionally, we expect pressure on wages due to the current shortage of workers available for our stores and distribution centers. 
With regards to freight, the market conditions have continued to deteriorate since our update in March. We are now expecting costs to be significantly higher than originally projected, led by import freight due to the continued disruption in the global supply chain from equipment shortages and capacity issues. Freight costs in the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2021 are projected to be $0.70 to $0.80 per diluted share higher than the comparable period in 2020. These additional costs will have the biggest effects on Q2 and Q3. These disruptions affect the timing of inventory receipts that could affect sales and mix. 
We expect shrink will continue to be a tailwind as we go through the year. Higher sales, lower store inventory levels and better processes continue to drive better results. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $34 million in Q2 and approximately $137 million for fiscal 2021. 
For fiscal '21, we expect net income per diluted share will range between $5.80 and $6.05. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 23.7% for the second quarter and 23.4% for fiscal 2021. And weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 232.9 million shares for Q2 and 233.3 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any additional share repurchases. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Mike."

Through 2020 and into 2021, we have demonstrated great momentum in our business. I believe this is attributed to all the work in developing great strategic store formats, finding our assortments and accelerating many key sales and traffic-driving initiatives. We have a resilient business model. And we are in what I believe is the most attractive sector in retail. Value and convenience is more important to the customer now than ever before. 
And like most retailers, we are currently faced with higher freight costs, both international and domestic, worker shortages and uncertainty related to inflation. These are issues -- these issues are rising as COVID abates, and they are not systemic to Dollar Tree and not expected to be permanent. In fact, we believe we've increased the long-term earnings potential for both banners. As always, we are working hard to adapt and react and navigate the business based on the current environment. I have great confidence in our team, and I'm extremely proud of their commitment, dedication and focus. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on several of our key initiatives. We incorporated the Dollar Tree Plus! a multi-price assortment, into an additional 128 Dollar Tree stores in Q1, bringing the total to more than 240 store locations by quarter end, and the offering is currently in just over 280 stores. Feedback from shoppers on a compelling offering has been extremely well received and very favorable. The Dollar Tree Plus! assortment has expanded into select stores in Colorado as well as states in the southeast such as Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and the Carolinas. 
The newest iteration is seeing sales lift of more than double prior versions, which is why it's been so important for us to evolve and refine before a larger rollout. We are committed to reaching our 500 store target. However, the timing may shift beyond August due to the stronger-than-forecasted sell-through and inventory availability. We will definitely continue to expand Dollar Tree Plus! in fiscal 2022. More details about the expansion will be provided later this year. 
Last quarter, we introduced our newest strategic store format, our Combination or Combo Store. We continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of these stores. At quarter end, we had 61 combo stores in rural communities, of which 34 are new stores, 19 are renovated stores and 8 are relocation or expansions. We continue to experience a 20% comp lift in renovated combo stores. The new stores are exceeding their pro forma. The combo store leverages both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands to serve small talents across the country. The store combines Family Dollar's great value and assortment with Dollar Tree's [ thrill of the hunt ] at a dollar price point, creating a new store format targeted for populations ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 people. Remember, these are markets where we would traditionally not open a Dollar Tree store alone. 
We will open more than 100 combo stores this year, and are in the process of building a strong pipeline for fiscal 2022 and beyond. You can get more information at familydollar.com/combostores. 
We continue to be very pleased with our partnership with Instacart. We are offering Instacart in more than 6,000 Family Dollar stores across 47 markets. During the quarter, approximately 5,500 of these stores had at least 1 order, and 96% of those stores had multiple orders. We are seeing a materially higher average ticket as well as higher gross margin on these transactions. With sales continued at a healthy pace on a weekly basis, as expected, we've seen a softening in the growth trajectory as vaccinations are on the rise and more shoppers are comfortable visiting all our retail store locations. 
Last month, we introduced our new retail network, the Chesapeake Media Group. This new platform provides our shoppers with compelling content never seen before on Family Dollar digital space. We serve 95 million weekly digital impressions and have approximately 14 million subscribers to our digital smart coupon program. We currently have commitments from our largest CPG brands for more than 40 campaigns. These engagements are coming to life through ad placement on the Family Dollar app, familydollar.com, e-mail and social media, influencing purchase decisions in real time. We believe the Chesapeake Media Group will enhance the opportunity to further drive loyalty and store traffic for Family Dollar, while increasing brand partner awareness and product sales, ultimately driving market share gains for Family Dollar. 
These are just a few examples of our ability to act with more speed, clarity and focus on initiatives since many of the integration priorities are now behind us. I cannot be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us, especially the H2 combo store formats and our Dollar Tree Plus! initiative. As an organization, we are certainly in a much better position to be aggressive and drive innovation. 
Looking forward, we believe our strategic store formats, our store growth plans, Dollar Tree Plus! and many key sales and traffic-driving initiatives, along with our robust balance sheet, will enable us to drive long-term value for our stakeholders.

The challenge that Dollar Tree had to their comp was in February when we had that huge snow storm. And that equated to well over 1%. So if you think about it, Dollar Tree, the 4 7, if it wasn't for that storm, could have came in at a 5, 7 or plus comp. 
Meat has been on plan. And to your point, we are seeing strong sales in party as people are having gatherings again, and our receipts are flowing to meet our needs for graduation.

But obviously, the global supply chain issues that are out there that everybody is working through and go through that. 
I would tell you this Matt, I think, obviously, the big question that you and others continue to ask is, as we've said, we do believe Dollar Tree can return to that 35% to 36% range from a gross profit standpoint, which is an important aspect. If we take the freight out of the picture this year, I think we would be right there on the cusp of that. 
So I think that just gives the indication that, obviously, our mix of product continues to be good, as Mike spoke to in many of the discretionary categories. We've seen some great progress in our shrink. And obviously, we have more work to do, but we have made some great progress and do expect that to continue to be a tailwind as we go through the year. 
And I think then as we go down the -- look at the rest of things, I think as the sales go, it helps leverage things. I don't think our leverage point, as it relates to SG&A, has really changed all that much. It's traditionally been in that 2% range and I don't think that's really changed. 
So I think all those things go into it. I think we have a great foundation built and as the -- this unusual event in the supply chain abates, I think that will give us the ability to flow that through."

So we can manage our mix. We can -- we're controlling our shrink, which is a component of margin. And if you think about -- what I really like about the first quarter, of course, we beat last year by 710 basis points and hit a 52.3%. But if you go back to 2019, for the first quarter, our discretionary mix was 49.4%. And we liked our mix back then, and we grew it above a normal baseline of 2019.

I'm just going to try to give you some better color, I guess, in general, around freight to begin with. 
So obviously, as we went through Q1, and again, we finalized our import contracts in late April, that's well known, we've talked about that in the past. But I think what we've seen out there is a capacity constraint, and we've seen a dislocation between what we would call the contract -- contracted rates in the spot market. 
And so really, where we're seeing from where we were at the beginning of the year to where we are now, the biggest drivers of the increased freight is really import freight and really just seeing higher rates to move product due to the capacity constraints, as well as looking at the spot market because we will use the spot market as well based upon all things. So that's by far the biggest category. 
I think the next thing we've seen that has tightened as we went through the Q1 is related to domestic freight inbound and outbound, and just a pressure from lack of drivers, as well as just trying -- everybody is trying to move freight across the country right now. And so it's putting pressure on drivers as well as you may not be paying surge rates to get goods moved. 
And then the third thing I would tell you that's up from the beginning of the year is the fuel prices have come up above where our assumptions were at the beginning of the year. Obviously, we saw that spike during the quarter with a couple of events that took place out there. So those are some of the things just in general that are driving the rate itself. 
And again, as we work through the year, our expectation right now is that the global supply chain will take pretty much the full year to work through this. And it's -- and that's really within our assumptions as to what those costs related to that are. If for some reason it breaks loose earlier, that could be a benefit to us. But that will be -- yet to be seen. 
Structurally, I don't know that we believe that there's anything structurally there, specifically for our business. I think we obviously have to look at the capacity and try to think through that and how we continue to get ahead of that in our planning."

The time that it takes to unload the ships, the amount of ships that are backed up and the equipment is in the wrong place. 
And then just the high demand as stores open up that were closed last year and are bringing product in. So clearly, this is a bubble. It's not structural for us. And we're doing -- we're looking at like every other retailer, looking at all other SG&A items. And as you heard Kevin speak to, our shrink is a tailwind, and that's offsetting these high costs. 
We don't have the $289 million in COVID costs from last year. So that's going to offset some of these costs.

Our merchant team is going to keep refining that assortment, better price points, more value. And expanding that discretionary business is key for us. And that's why -- what's so exciting about Family Dollar, what they've been able to do, is it's now -- Family Dollar is now a top 10 retailer in discretionary in the United States. And we've doubled our discretionary share of market in the U.S. 
So -- and the team is going to continue to refine this. And yet, we still have a lot of growth on the seasonal part of it. So yes, we just had the record Valentine's and a record Easter sales at Family Dollar and the best sell-through ever, but we've got tons of upside.

What has changed or what caught you off guard to have such a substantial impact on your profitability that you didn't anticipate 90 days ago? And as you mentioned, you signed those contracts in April that kicked in, in May. And now is it that you have to wait until the following [ May ] to see those costs come off, and so your profitability can be impacted by this for a while?

And what we thought is these are towns that Family Dollar wouldn't normally go in. So here we have 2 powerful brands, what if we brought them together into a small town to meet that customer needs? And by doing so, we absolutely are getting customers very enthusiastic about it. Our sales are higher than if it was just a Family Dollar. 
So now we're in a small town. There's 3,000 of them. We're going to get to over 100 this year, and we're going to continue to grow this. And we have the [ seed ] points identified on a map. And we're going to keep growing this rural format. And yes, it's got a better sales per square foot, more productive store. It's a better margin because you've got Dollar Tree items in there, leading off with what they're known for, on the seasonal, the party, the celebration, the greeting cards and the home. 
And then offset by everyday needs that the customer needs to live their life in rural America with the discretionary side, decorating their home, dressing up their children and their kids and feeding the family. So it's a great format. And we're going to continue to grow that in rural America. 
Now separate that from DT Plus! which is a Dollar tree format. And what we're trying to do is, we will always defend that $1 price point. It's the most defensible retail strategy in America. Nobody has been able to hold a dollar price point for 35 years over all those inflations. And we've got a great assortment and great excitement. There's great brand recognition. 
What we're trying to do is bring in now -- what if we take that same passion and value at $1 and give the offering of a $3 and $5 item to those customers in home, in party, in seasonal and certainly in the crafting area, and we're bringing those items to the customer and they're responding widely. They enjoy it, they appreciate the value, they recognize it and it's lifting our sales.

Our record first quarter performance reflects the progress we continue to make on numerous initiatives to provide even greater value and convenience to our shoppers. Dollar Tree delivered its strongest quarterly s",1272,"Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone. Our record first quarter performance reflects the progress we continue to make on numerous initiatives to provide even greater value and convenience to our shoppers. Dollar Tree delivered its strongest quarterly same-store sales since 2017, while improving its operating margin by 290 basis points. Family Dollar effectively cycled a 15.5% comp sales increase from the prior year by driving its best post-merger quarterly operating profit. Combined, the enterprise produced positive same-store sales against a tough 2020 comparison and a 220 basis point improvement in operating margin driven by higher gross margins and better expense leverage. Overall, a very solid start to the year.  
During the initial post-merger years, much of the company's energy and focus was dedicated to integration-related projects such as stabilizing and restructuring the organization; improving store maintenance; harmonizing our technology; designing and testing store formats, optimizing our real estate portfolio; elevating the operational execution in our stores; offering improved assortments and value; and ultimately, consolidating our store support centers. These priorities were critical as we prepared the combined business for long-term profitable growth.  
Now over the last 18 months, we have transitioned to an aggressive approach under one aligned leadership team, dedicating our major efforts to customer focus initiatives with clarity, focus and speed. Examples of the innovation efforts are: our brick-and-mortar initiatives include refining and growing our Dollar Tree Plus! multi-price initiative; continuing to evolve and improve the H2 store format with expanded home, seasonal and other discretionary categories; introducing the new combo stores for rural markets; testing fresh produce and frozen meat products in select stores; initiating self-checkout in smaller number of stores.  
And on our digital and omnichannel initiatives, they include: launching familydollar.com as a selling site; partnering with Instacart for same-store delivery, which expands our customer reach; and creating our new retail media network, the Chesapeake Media Group. I'm enthusiastic about the long-term impact of these actions designed to drive shopper satisfaction and loyalty, giving us the ability to meet the evolving needs of our shoppers better than any other company can, especially inside the Beltway and in rural America.  
I will share more details -- more detailed update on these exciting initiatives later on in the call. But for now, for the quarter, our Dollar Tree segment delivered its best quarterly same-store sales since Q3 of 2017. The 4.7% comp increase was comprised of a 9.5% increase in ticket, partially offset by a 4.4% decline in traffic. Notably, we saw a double-digit increase in traffic in April, which represented our best monthly comp traffic increase in years.  
From a cadence perspective, March was the strongest comp month with stronger pre-Easter sales compared to the prior year, followed by April. February was slightly negative as we lost more than 2,500 store days due to closures related to storms through Texas and Central U.S. Gross margin improved 180 basis points from the prior year as we saw record sell-through on seasonal merchandise, including Valentine's Day, Easter and Easter Candy.  
Compared to the prior year's quarter, the discretionary mix as a percentage of net sales increased 710 basis points to 52.3%. Categories performing well, included, crafts, party, our Easter seasonal, toys and floral. Our inventory turn improved 22 basis points for the quarter.  
Our merchant team continues to source great products that provide wonderful value at the margins we need. With the product already purchased for the back half of the year, I am thrilled with the discretionary back-to-school, crafts, holiday and seasonal assortments that will be hitting store shelves within the next few months. As COVID restrictions ease and customers continue to gather with friends and family for celebrations, we plan to fulfill that need with our compelling mix with even more exciting discretionary items at the dollar price point that our shoppers love.  
Family Dollar highlights for the quarter include its best post-merger quarterly operating profit at $211.4 million. Let me repeat that: Family Dollar achieved its best post-merger quarterly operating profit at $211.4 million, cycling a very strong 15.5% comp from the prior year. Same-store sales came in at a decline of 2.8%, equating to a positive 12.7% on a 2-year stack. Average ticket was up over 11%. And traffic, cycling the initial pandemic-related demand for the consumables from a year ago, was down nearly 13% for the quarter.  
The Family Dollar merchants continue to do a terrific job refining the assortment to deliver meaningful value that is resonating with our shoppers. The discretionary side of the business saw a 14.7% comp increase. Consumable comp, again, cycling unprecedented demand from last year, was down 7.7%.  
Regarding Family Dollar's comp cadence through the quarter, February was the strongest comp followed by April. March was cycling a 20-plus comp from the prior year. From a category perspective, the strong performers were primarily on the discretionary side of the business, including party, apparel, home decor, beauty care and floral. We continue to see encouraging results for stores that added fresh produce and frozen meats to their assortment in late 2020. We are seeing materially higher average tickets when a basket contains produce or meats. I am excited to share that we will continue to expand on this initiative in 2021 and beyond, as we are focused on meeting the needs of shoppers in all markets.  
On the previous earnings call, I spoke to the fact that Family Dollar customer satisfaction survey scores had improved 3 consecutive quarters across each of the 4 key categories: store cleanliness; product assortment; customer service; and speed of checkout. Credit to our field leadership and our merchant and operations teams, each of those scores improved again for the first quarter, making it 4 quarters in a row.  
Increasing store productivity at Family Dollar has been a critical component of the turnaround. In addition to all the sales and traffic-driving initiatives that have been increasing average sales per store, we believe Family Dollar is squarely positioned to continue serving more customers and gaining market share with its compelling discretionary mix, especially as Family Dollar shoppers are benefiting from stimulus dollars, increased SNAP participation, child tax credits and earning higher wages.  
Now regarding Dollar Tree Canada, the team had a strong quarter 1. From an operating income standpoint, the Canada team exceeded their budget despite challenges to sales in April related to increased COVID restrictions. From a real estate perspective, we completed 575 projects, including: 106 new stores; 36 relocations; 414 Family Dollar H2 renovations; 19 store closures. We ended the quarter with 15,772 stores.  
Before I hand it over to Kevin, I want to let you know that in April, we released our updated corporate sustainability report. The report is available on the homepage at our website, dollartree.com. I am very proud of the team's progress related to our ESG program in fiscal 2020. Accomplishments included that we conducted a detailed assessment of our impact on the environment and measured our carbon footprint to establish an initial baseline.  
We developed our first-generation of climate goals aimed to reducing emissions and increase the use of renewable energy. We participated in the chemical footprint project for the second consecutive year. We partnered with ADT Commercial for comprehensive and innovative security solutions. And we formed our Diversity Equity Inclusion Executive Counsel. And lastly, we launched our inaugural Choose to Give workplace-giving campaign. We will remain steadfastly committed to improvement, especially as related to our ESG goals and initiatives designed to minimize corporate sustainability risks while reducing cost and driving efficiencies.  
I will go into more detail on several initiatives after Kevin speaks to the Q1 performance and our outlook. Kevin?"

For the first quarter, consolidated net sales increased 3% to $6.48 billion, comprised of $3.32 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.16 billion at Family Dollar. Our enterprise same-store sales increased 0.8%, or 0.9% when adjusted for Canadian currency fluctuations. Comps for the Dollar Tree segment increased 4.7% or 4.8% when adjusted for the Canadian currency fluctuations.  
Family Dollar same-store sales decreased 2.8%, cycling the very strong 15.5% increase in the prior year's first quarter.  
Overall, gross profit for the enterprise increased 9.4% to $1.96 billion. Gross margin improved 180 basis points to 30.3%. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 180 basis points to 33.7% when compared to the prior year's quarter. The factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included: merchandise costs, including freight, improved 85 basis points. Improvements in merchandise mix were partially offset by increased freight costs and slightly lower mark on, a 50 basis point improvement in shrink resulting from favorable inventories and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate; a 30 basis point improvement in markdown related to improved sell-through of Easter-related products compared to the pandemic affected prior year; and 25 basis points of leverage on occupancy costs from the stronger comp sales.  
These improvements were partially offset by distribution costs, which increased 10 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll and depreciation costs. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment improved 140 basis points to 26.8% in the first quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following: merchandise costs, including freight, improved 85 basis points related to merchandise mix and initial mark on, which were partially offset by higher freight costs. Shrink improved 60 basis points based on favorable inventory results. Distribution costs improved 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. These improvements were partially offset by deleverage on occupancy costs based on the comparable store sales decline in the first quarter.  
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 40 basis points to 22.3% of total revenue compared to 22.7% in Q1 last year. For the first quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of total revenue improved 110 basis points to 21.6% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs improved 110 basis points, primarily due to decreased COVID-19-related store payroll costs and leverage related to the comp store sales increase. Other SG&A decreased by 5 basis points, resulting from lower store supply expense, partially offset by increased inventory service expense. Store facility costs increased 10 basis points due to higher repairs and maintenance costs.  
Family Dollar, the first quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue was 20.2% compared to 19.9% in the prior year's quarter. Store facility costs increased 25 basis points, driven mainly by higher snow removal costs. Other SG&A expenses increased 20 basis points, and depreciation and amortization expense increased 5 basis points both due to deleverage on the comp sales. 
Payroll costs decreased 25 basis points, primarily due to decreased COVID-19-related store payroll costs, partially offset by deleverage related to the comp store sales decline. 
Corporate and support expenses as a percentage of total revenue were essentially flat compared to the prior year's quarter.  
Operating income increased 42.1% to $519.9 million compared with $365.9 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin was 8% in the first quarter compared to 5.8% in the prior year's quarter. The first quarter of 2021 included total incremental operating costs of $7.4 million for COVID-19-related expenses compared to $73.2 million in the first quarter of 2020.  
Nonoperating expenses totaled $33 million, which was comprised of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 23.9% in the prior year's first quarter. Company had net income of $374.5 million or $1.60 per diluted share. This compared to net earnings of $247.6 million or $1.04 per share in the prior year's quarter.  
Our combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.47 billion compared to $1.42 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. Outstanding debt as of May 1 was $3.25 billion. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.15 million shares for $250 million. We currently have $2.15 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.  
Inventory for Dollar Tree at quarter end increased 13.5% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 4.1%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 9%. This includes a significant increase in goods and transit year-over-year. Excluding this increase, inventory per selling quare -- per square foot would be down 1.7%.  
Inventory for Family Dollar at quarter end increased 11.9% from the same period last year, while selling square footage increased 1.9%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 9.8%. Capital expenditures were $224.9 million in the first quarter versus $235.8 million in Q1 of last year. For fiscal 2021, we expect that consolidated capital expenditures will be approximately $1.2 billion, consistent with our initial 2021 outlook.   
Depreciation and amortization totaled $172.7 million for Q1 compared to $165.5 million in the first quarter of last year. And for fiscal 2021, we continue to expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $720 million to $730 million.  
Our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes the following assumptions: we are forecasting a low single-digit consolidated comparable sales increase for the year. We expect the COVID expense run rate for Q2 through Q4 to be consistent with Q1 at approximately $7.5 million per quarter. As noted in our March earnings call, minimum wage increases in states and localities will increase store payroll by $45 million to $50 million for the year. And additionally, we expect pressure on wages due to the current shortage of workers available for our stores and distribution centers.  
With regards to freight, the market conditions have continued to deteriorate since our update in March. We are now expecting costs to be significantly higher than originally projected that are led by import freight due to the continued disruption in the global supply chain from equipment shortages and capacity issues. Freight costs in the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2021 are projected to be $0.70 to $0.80 per diluted share higher than the comparable period in 2020. These additional costs will have the biggest effects on Q2 and Q3. These disruptions affect the timing of inventory receipts that could affect sales and mix.  
We expect shrink will continue to be a tailwind as we go through the year. Higher sales, lower store inventory levels and better processes continue to drive better results. 
Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $34 million in Q2 and approximately $137 million for fiscal 2021.  
For fiscal '21, we expect net income per diluted share will range between $5.80 and $6.05. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 23.7% for the second quarter and 23.4% for fiscal 2021. And weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 232.9 million shares for Q2 and 233.3 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any additional share repurchases.  
I'll now turn the call back over to Mike."

Through 2020 and into 2021, we have demonstrated great momentum in our business. I believe this is attributed to all the work in developing great strategic store formats, finding our assortments and accelerating many key sales and traffic-driving initiatives. We have a resilient business model. And we are and what I believe is the most attractive sector in retail. Value and convenience is more important to the customer now than ever before. 
And like most retailers, we are currently faced with higher freight costs, both international and domestic, worker shortages and uncertainty related to inflation. These are issues -- these issues are rising as COVID abates, and they are not systemic to Dollar Tree and not expected to be permanent. In fact, we believe we've increased the long-term earnings potential for both banners. As always, we are working hard to adapt and react and navigate the business based on the current environment. I have great confidence in our team, and I'm extremely proud of their commitment, dedication and focus. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on several of our key initiatives. We incorporated the Dollar Tree Plus! a multi-price assortment, into an additional 128 Dollar Tree stores in Q1, bringing the total to more than 240 store locations by quarter end, and the offering is currently in just over 280 stores. Feedback from shoppers on a compelling offering has been extremely well received and very favorable. The Dollar Tree Plus! assortment has expanded into select stores in Colorado as well as states in the southeast such as Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and the Carolinas. 
The newest iteration is seeing sales lift of more than double prior versions, which is why it's been so important for us to evolve and refine before a larger rollout. We are committed to reaching our 500 store target. However, the timing may shift beyond August due to the stronger-than-forecasted sell-through and inventory availability. We will definitely continue to expand Dollar Tree Plus! in fiscal 2022. More details about the expansion will be provided later this year. 
Last quarter, we introduced our newest strategic store format, our Combination or Combo Store. We continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of these stores. At quarter end, we had 61 combo stores in rural communities, of which 34 are new stores, 19 are renovated stores and 8 are relocation or expansions. We continue to experience a 20% comp lift in renovated combo stores. The new stores are exceeding their pro forma. The combo store leverages both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands to serve small talents across the country. The store combines Family Dollar's great value and assortment with Dollar Tree's Thrill-of-the-Hunt at a dollar price point, creating a new store format targeted for populations ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 people. Remember, these are markets where we would traditionally not open a Dollar Tree store alone. 
We will open more than 100 combo stores this year and are in the process of building a strong pipeline for fiscal 2022 and beyond. You can get more information at familydollar.com/combostores. 
We continue to be very pleased with our partnership with Instacart. We are offering Instacart in more than 6,000 Family Dollar stores across 47 markets. During the quarter, approximately 5,500 of these stores had at least 1 order, and 96% of those stores had multiple orders. We are seeing a materially higher average ticket as well as higher gross margin on these transactions. With sales continued at a healthy pace on a weekly basis, as expected, we've seen a softening in the growth trajectory as vaccinations are on the rise and more shoppers are comfortable visiting all our retail store locations. 
Last month, we introduced our new retail network, the Chesapeake Media Group. This new platform provides our shoppers with compelling content never seen before on Family Dollar digital space. We serve 95 million weekly digital impressions and have approximately 14 million subscribers to our digital smart coupon program. We currently have commitments from our largest CPG brands for more than 40 campaigns. These engagements are coming to life through ad placement on the Family Dollar app, familydollar.com, e-mail and social media, influencing purchase decisions in real time. We believe the Chesapeake Media Group will enhance the opportunity to further drive loyalty and store traffic for Family Dollar, while increasing brand partner awareness and product sales, ultimately driving market share gains for Family Dollar. 
These are just a few examples of our ability to act with more speed, clarity and focus on initiatives since many of the integration priorities are now behind us. I could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us, especially the H2 combo store formats and our Dollar Tree Plus! initiative. As an organization, we are certainly in a much better position to be aggressive and drive innovation. 
Looking forward, we believe our strategic store formats, our store growth plans, Dollar Tree Plus! and many key sales and traffic-driving initiatives, along with our robust balance sheet, will enable us to drive long-term value for our stakeholders.

And I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned comments regarding higher long-term operating margin targets than maybe you initially would have thought by brand. If you could just elaborate on that, I think that would be really, really helpful."

As we look at it, obviously, one significant headwind this year in the sense of freight, which we've tried to lay out for everybody to help them understand, we obviously don't believe it's permanent. But obviously, the global supply chain issues that are out there that everybody is working through and go through that. 
I would tell you this, Matt, I think, obviously, the big question that you and others continue to ask is, as we've said, we do believe Dollar Tree can return to that 35% to 36% range from a gross profit standpoint, which is an important aspect. If we take the freight out of the picture this year, I think we would be right there on the cusp of that. 
So I think that just gives the indication that, obviously, our mix of product continues to be good, as Mike spoke to in many of the discretionary categories. We've seen some great progress in our shrink. And obviously, we have more work to do, but we have made some great progress and do expect that to continue to be a tailwind as we go through the year. 
And I think then as we go down the -- look at the rest of things, I think as the sales go, it helps leverage things. I don't think our leverage point, as it relates to SG&A, has really changed all that much. It's traditionally been in that 2% range. And I don't think that's really changed. 
So I think all those things go into it. I think we have a great foundation built and as the -- this unusual event in the supply chain abates, I think that will give us the ability to flow that through."

Our teams just finished an April buy trip. We're getting great value at the margins we need and that discretionary mix we're driving. And just like with our Crafter's Square, we -- last year, we finished rolling it out to all stores. And now this year, we're actually expanding it and expanding the seasonal part of our craft. 
So we can manage our mix. We can -- we're controlling our shrink, which is a component of margin. And if you think about -- what I really like about the first quarter, of course, we beat last year by 710 basis points and hit a 52.3%. But if you go back to 2019, for the first quarter, our discretionary mix was 49.4%. And we liked our mix back then, and we grew it above a normal baseline of 2019. So those are the levers we can pull so that we can hit that 35% to 36% margin."

I'm just going to try to give you some better color, I guess, in general, around freight to begin with. 
So obviously, as we went through Q1, and again, we finalized our import contracts in late April, that's well known, we've talked about that in the past. But I think what we've seen out there is a capacity constraint. And we've seen a dislocation between what we would call the contract -- contracted rates in the spot market. 
And so really, where we're seeing from where we were at the beginning of the year to where we are now, the biggest drivers of the increased freight is really import freight and really just seeing higher rates to move product due to the capacity constraints as well as looking at the spot market because we will use the spot market as well based upon all things. So that's by far the biggest category. 
I think the next thing we've seen that has tightened as we went through the Q1 is related to domestic freight inbound and outbound and just a pressure from lack of drivers as well as just trying -- everybody is trying to move freight across the country right now. And so it's putting pressure on drivers as well as you may not be paying surge rates to get goods moved. 
And then the third thing I would tell you that's up from the beginning of the year is the fuel prices have come up above where our assumptions were at the beginning of the year. Obviously, we saw that spike during the quarter with a couple of events that took place out there. So those are some of the things just in general that are driving the rate itself. 
And again, as we work through the year, our expectation right now is that the global supply chain will take pretty much the full year to work through this. And it's -- and that's really within our assumptions as to what those costs related to that are. If for some reason it breaks loose earlier, that could be a benefit to us. But that will be -- yet to be seen. 
Structurally, I don't know that we believe that there's anything structurally there, specifically for our business. I think we obviously have to look at the capacity and try to think through that and how we continue to get ahead of that in our planning."

John, just to tail Kevin, I don't believe it's structural at all. I believe it's the downstream implications of COVID. And then the huge demand and that the industry right now is upside down where the equipment is. And the delay is still at the ports out on the West Coast and the East Coast. The time that it takes to unload the ships, the amount of ships that are backed up and the equipment is in the wrong place and then just the high demand as stores open up that were closed last year and are bringing product in. 
So clearly, this is a bubble. It's not structural for us. And we're doing -- we're looking at, like every other retailer, looking at all other SG&A items. And as you heard Kevin speak to, our shrink is a tailwind, and that's offsetting these high costs. 
We don't have the $289 million in COVID costs from last year. So that's going to offset some of these costs. And then our teams are navigating the challenge of this, the inflationary challenges and pressures that we have. And the teams look at the cost of goods and negotiate that.

Our merchant team is going to keep refining that assortment, better price points, more value. And expanding that discretionary business is key for us.

And we've doubled our discretionary share of market in the U.S. 
So -- and the team is going to continue to refine this. And yet, we still have a lot of growth on the seasonal part of it.

What if we brought them together into a small town that would meet that customer needs? And by doing so, we absolutely are getting customers very enthusiastic about it. Our sales are higher than if it was just a Family Dollar.

And we're going to keep growing this rural format. And yes, it's got a better sales per square foot, more productive store. It's a better margin because you've got Dollar Tree items in there, leading off with what they're known for, on the seasonal, the party, the celebration, the greeting cards and the home. 
And then offset by everyday needs that the customer needs to live their life in rural America with the discretionary side, decorating their home, dressing up their children and their kids and feeding the family. So it's a great format. And we're going to continue to grow that in rural America. 
Now separate that from DT Plus! which is a Dollar tree format. And what we're trying to do is, we will always defend that $1 price point. It's the most defensible retail strategy in America. Nobody has been able to hold a dollar price point for 35 years over all those inflations. And we've got a great assortment and great excitement. There's great brand recognition. 
What we're trying to do is bring in now -- what if we take that same passion and value at $1 and give the offering of a $3 and $5 item to those customers in home, in party, in seasonal and certainly in the crafting area, and we're bringing those items to the customer, and they're responding widely. They enjoy it. They appreciate the value. They recognize it, and it's lifting our sales.

On this morning's call, we're going to discuss our strong operating performance, talk through some of the headwinds facing our industry, and share details on the robust and accelerated strategic initiatives we have underway to drive short- and long-term value creation.
I am proud of our team's continuing efforts, especially in our stores and distribution centers, to adapt and react in this dynamic environment to serve customers and deliver improvements in both operating margin and earnings. Our second quarter earnings per share of $1.23, represented a year-over-year quarterly increase of 12% and 62% when compared to Q2 of 2019. We continue to see strong performance in the discretionary side of the business and our key initiatives, including H2, Dollar Tree Plus! and the new combo stores are delivering compelling results. All 3 concepts have performed very well, and we are significantly accelerating these initiatives in 2022 and beyond.
Regarding the continuing and well-publicized challenges in the global supply chain as well as higher freight costs and other inflationary pressures. Our teams are working hard to navigate these issues while staying focused, as always, on delivering the value and convenience our shoppers expect. I want to share more details on these challenges, how they affect our business and the actions we are taking to best manage and mitigate the impacts.
In recent quarters, we have spoken about the freight cost environment, both international and domestic. As you have certainly seen in the media and elsewhere, freight costs have reached unprecedented levels as a result of increased demand, limited capacity and shipping delays.
For context, 3 months ago, the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index, which reflects spot rates on ocean freight from China was already at an all-time high, up more than 280% year-over-year and more than 400% since 2019. Now these rates have continued to rise and have increased more than 20% on since we last reported on May 27.
According to the recent Journal of Commerce annual ranking of the top 100 importers, Dollar Tree ranked as the fifth largest among retailers. Dollar Tree brings in near 90,000 40-foot containers per year, predominantly for the Dollar Tree banner. As you can see in the slide deck on the Investor Relations portion of our website, at dollartreeinfo.com. We believe the Dollar Tree banner imports more containers per $100 million in sales than other large retailers. And combined with our low $1 price point, we have an outsized impact from freight costs.
After the first quarter of 2021, our updated freight outlook assume that our regular ocean carriers would fulfill only 85% of their contractual commitments and assume -- we also assume the higher part spot market rates. However, we now project that our regular carriers will fulfill only 60% to 65% of their commitments and the spot market rates will be much higher than previously estimated. This shortfall is caused by a variety of factors such as equipment shortages, equipment situated in wrong location, significant backlogs and delays in both China and U.S. ports. Outbreaks of coated causing labor shortages or closure of entire terminals and the lingering effects of the Suez Canal blockage.
To give you a real-life example of the kinds of challenges we're seeing, one of our dedicated charters was recently denied entry into China because a crew member tested positive for COVID, forcing the vessel return to Indonesia to change the entire crew before continuing. Overall, the voyage was delayed by 2 months. With the current pressure on carriers, once disruptions in the supply chain occur, there is not enough capacity to make it up. During a recent transportation webinar, a San Francisco-based freight forwarder stated the transit times from Shanghai to Chicago that more than doubled to 73 days from 35 days. Another transportation executive from carrier recently estimated that voyages are now taking 30 days longer than in previous years due to port congestion, container handling delays and other factors.
The Dollar Tree banner is more sensitive to freight cost than others in the industry. Our products have lower price points than other retail importers. And as a result, our freight costs are a higher percentage of our gross mark -- merchandise margin. The good news is our initial product margin, which exclude freight have been improving as evidenced by our most recent overseas product purchases included from manufacturers in more than 2 dozen countries.
Even in this inflationary environment, we continue to meet or exceed our desired initial product margins at values attractive to our customers. As freight costs moderate in the future, we are confident when paired with our team's significant efforts to enhance our supply chain, this will become a material tailwind, contributing to a better product margins.
Industry experts expect the ocean shipping capacity will normalize no later than 2023 when many new ships come online. We are not counting on material improvements in 2022 especially in the first portion of the year. As a result, we are working proactively to reduce the freight cost impact and otherwise improve gross margin merchandise. Examples of steps we are taking include: using dedicated space on chartered vessels for the first time, including 1 large vessel contracted for 3-year term, which is scheduled to make its first voyage within weeks. We are expecting to add more charters this year; we're adding alternative sources of supply, both domestic and international that do not rely on transpacific shipping. We expect some of this shift could become permanent. As an example, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar were well prepared for back-to-school season with alternatively sourced domestic product; we're taking a fresh look at which SKUs should be prioritized for import and which should be alternatively sourced; prioritizing containers based on seasonality, the margin impact and our overall inventory needs. We will be continuing to pull forward seasonal purchases by 30 days. We're optimizing which China and U.S. ports we use to take advantage of the shipping availability. And our operations team is delivering shrink improvements through technology, enhanced processes and disciplined execution.
We are confident that our teams will allow us to navigate through this period of global supply chain challenges. In addition to the supply chain channels, we are also being impacted by labor shortages in our distribution centers and stores. Steps we are taking to combat these trends include: Hosting national hiring events; paying sign-on bonuses; offering enhanced wages in select markets; paying tuition reimbursement; and more. All designed to be more competitive in a tight market for talent. We're continuing to optimize our DC network by reducing stem miles.
Partnering with suppliers to optimize and minimize length of haul for inbound freight. Testing, validating and expanding self-checkout in our stores, and developing and utilizing more efficient processes, both in our stores and DCs. Despite these challenges affecting our industry, I'm very pleased with the team's performance to deliver a 62% improvement in EPS in Q2 when compared to 2019.
Now let's talk about the exciting path forward. I'd like to highlight some of the key initiatives we have in place, especially Dollar Tree Plus! and our Combo stores, which are helping to position our company for the future. We are incredibly excited about the results we are seeing. As we have discussed in the past, we are well positioned to serve customers across all types of markets, urban, suburban and rural.
The Family Dollar H2 continues to perform very well. In Q2, we renovated 435 stores into the H2 format, and now have a total of approximately 3,300 H2 stores. Importantly, we are accelerating the expansion of Dollar Tree Plus! initiative and the rollout of Combo stores to better serve customers' needs and drive sustainable long-term value. We have been carefully improving and calibrating our Dollar Tree Plus! initiative with a better understanding of the multi-price offerings and greater values. Customers are increasingly embracing the Dollar Tree Plus! concept which provides extraordinary value in the discretionary categories they most desire while enhancing store productivity. As we have refined the Dollar Tree Plus! concept, the operating metrics have achieved strong results and have provided us valuable insights that are enabling accelerated expansion. On average, stores with Dollar Tree Plus! are experiencing an overall sales lift of approximately 6% with a similar lift in gross profit, improved contribution of approximately 13%, and a payback on investment of less than a year. For obvious reasons, we have focused first on large stores, and we are already seeing similar positive results as we are now implementing into smaller stores.
We currently have the multi-price assortment in about 340 stores, and we expect to be at 500 stores by year-end. Building on this continued success, we are planning to add Dollar Tree us to an additional 1,500 stores in fiscal '22. And we aim to have at least 5,000 Dollar Tree Plus! stores by the end of fiscal 2024. Many of our new stores will also be opening up as Dollar Tree Plus! stores.
This past March, we announced our newest store format, the Combo store, leveraging the strengths of both banners under 1 roof, to provide shoppers with extreme value and merchandise excitement. These stores represent another way to introduce the multi-price assortment to Dollar Tree shoppers and the $1 assortment to Family Dollar shoppers, a major benefit from the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar combination. We currently have 105 combo stores, and I believe we can reach 3,000 of these stores in rural markets alone.
Demonstrating our great confidence in combo stores as a strategic format, more than 85% of our new Family Dollar stores will be Combo stores in fiscal 2022. We anticipate 400 new renovated or relocated Combo stores next year. We are also in the process of validating Combo store concept and other demographic markets and are excited about the possibilities.
Our larger Combo stores, on average, are delivering 23% more sales, 31% more gross margin dollars, approximately 120% more cash contribution dollars and are reducing payback time by approximately 30%. New combo stores compared to similar size stores are showing sales increases of 17%. And even more encouraging, our renovated or relocated Combo stores are delivering greater than 40% more sales when compared to Family Dollar stores that have not been renovated or relocated. Details about our Combo stores are available at www.familydollar.com/combostores.
I will now hand the call over to Kevin to provide details on Q2 performance and our outlook."

Our second quarter EPS of $1.23 per share is an increase of 12% from the prior year's quarter and 62% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Consolidated net sales increased 1% to $6.34 billion comprised of $3.26 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.08 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales decreased 1.2% as we cycled a strong 7.2% from a year ago, representing a 6% increase on a 2-year stacked basis. Comps for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 0.2%. Family Dollar same-store sales decreased 2.1%, cycling a very strong 11.6% increase from last year. On a 2-year stacked basis, Dollar Tree comps increased 2.9%, and Family Dollar increased 9.5%.
Dollar Tree's comps was comprised of a 1.1% increase in traffic offset by a decline in average ticket. Family Dollar experienced a 3.5% decline in traffic, partially offset by an increase in average ticket. We do believe that Dollar Tree's traffic has continued to be hindered by a lack of shopper mobility as more than half of the workforce continues to work remote.
Gross profit was $1.86 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 29.4% compared to 30.5% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment declined 130 basis points to 32.4% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included merchandise costs, including freight, increased 175 basis points driven by increased freight costs, which was partially offset by favorable mix net of mark-on. Occupancy costs increased 10 basis points as a result of loss of leverage due to the comparable store sales decline.
Shrink improved 55 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate. And distribution costs decreased 5 basis points, cycling COVID-19-related expenses in the prior year.
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment declined 110 basis points to 26.1% in the second quarter. Year-over-year delta included the following: merchandise costs, including freight, increased 175 basis points related to higher freight costs and increased sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise; occupancy costs increased 35 basis points as a result of the comparable store sales decrease; shrink improved 50 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate; distribution costs improved 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter due to the lower COVID-19 related costs; and markdown costs decreased 25 basis points compared to last year based on civil unrest costs incurred a year ago.
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 150 basis points to 23% of total revenue compared to 24.5% in Q2 last year. For the second quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of total revenue improved 170 basis points to 22.3% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs improved 155 basis points, primarily due to decreased COVID-19-related store payroll costs. Other SG&A decreased by 20 basis points, resulting from lower general liability insurance costs, primarily offset by increased debit and credit card fees. Store facility costs decreased 5 basis points due to lower repairs and maintenance costs. And for the Family Dollar, the second quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue was 21% compared to 21.9% in the prior year's quarter.
Payroll costs decreased 95 basis points, primarily due to decreased COVID-19-related store payroll and incentive comp costs, partially offset by deleverage related to the comp store sales decline. Store facility costs decreased 30 basis points driven mainly by lower repairs and maintenance costs due to expense incurred from civil unrest in the prior year's quarter. Other SG&A expense increased 35 basis points primarily due to increased advertising and travel expense compared to the prior year, and depreciation and amortization expense increased 10 basis points due to deleverage on the comp sales. Corporate and support expenses as a percent of total revenue decreased 20 basis points compared to the prior year's quarter, primarily due to lower incentive and equity compensation. Operating income increased 7.3% to $402.2 million compared with $374.9 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin was 6.3% in the second quarter compared to 6% in the prior year quarter.
The second quarter of 2021 included total incremental operating costs of $3 million for COVID-19-related expenses compared to $134.9 million in the second quarter of 2020. Nonoperating expenses totaled $33 million comprised of net interest expense, and our effective tax rate was 23.5% compared to 23.1% in the prior year's second quarter. Company had net income of $282.4 million or $1.23 per diluted share, and this compared to net earnings of $261.5 million or $1.10 per share in the prior year's quarter.
Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $720.8 million compared to $1.42 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. Outstanding debt as of July 31 was $3.25 billion. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares of our common stock for $700 million. We currently have $1.45 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Inventory for Dollar Tree at quarter end increased 13.1% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 3.7%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 9%. Inventory for Family Dollar at quarter end increased 10.9% from the same period last year, while selling square footage increased 2.1%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 8.6%. Both banners store inventory levels are below 2019 levels at quarter end.
Capital expenditures were $229.1 million in the second quarter versus $232.5 million in Q2 last year. For fiscal 2021, we now expect that consolidated capital expenditures will be approximately $1.1 billion. Depreciation and amortization totaled $176.1 million for compared to $168.1 million in the second quarter of last year. And for fiscal 2021, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $720 million.
Our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes the following assumptions. We expect continued pressure on wages due to the current shortage of workers available for our distribution centers and stores. Spec shrink will continue to be a tailwind as we go through the back half of the year, but not at the same rate as we begin cycling improved results from the prior year.
Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $34 million in Q3 and approximately $134 million for fiscal 2021. We estimate consolidated net sales for the third quarter will range from $6.4 billion to $6.52 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales for the combined enterprise. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.98. Consolidated net sales for full fiscal 2021 are expected to range from $26.19 billion to $26.44 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and 3.4% square footage growth. The company now estimates diluted earnings per share will range from $5.40 to $5.60.
Freight costs for fiscal 2021 are now expected to be $1.50 to $1.60 higher than fiscal 2020, expressed in terms of the impact on diluted earnings per share. The updated outlook includes $0.60 to $0.65 per diluted share or $185 million to $200 million of additional freight costs since our prior guidance on May 27, 2021. As Mike noted earlier, the market conditions for freight have continued to deteriorate since our update in May. These changes include the significant difficulties our regular contract carriers are having in meeting their original commitments as well as continuing increases in the spot market rate. These disruptions have affected the timing of inventory receipts and have affected sales and mix.
Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 22.7% for the third quarter and 23% for fiscal 2021. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 225.9 million shares for Q3 and 228.9 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any additional share repurchases, although as I said before, we still have $1.45 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.
And I'll now turn the call back to Mike."

As Kevin stated, our updated outlook for fiscal 2021 is $5.40 to $5.60 per share. It's unfortunate that the global supply chain is in the condition it is. which is expected to result in a year-over-year drag to our business of $1.50 to $1.60 per share. If freight costs this year were similar to what we were just a year ago, we estimate that our earnings per share would be in the range of $6.90 to $7.20 for this fiscal 2021.
The work of our teams has been remarkable. Our store and distribution center teams continue to demonstrate their commitment to serving our shoppers each and every day. Our customer satisfaction survey scores have never been higher. We have seen improvements across the board for store cleanliness, assortment, service and speed of checkout.
The merchants are delivering greater value to our customers that are meeting that are meeting or exceeding our initial merchandise margin targets. Our buyers are disciplined, nimble and committed.
While it represents a smaller part of our overall business, our digital team saw a 70% increase in sales versus the first half of 2021. We're also pleased with the solid performance of our local delivery program through Instacart. Our initiatives are driving improved results. Customers are responding to Dollar Tree Plus!, the H2 format and our new Combo stores. We are pleased to accelerate both these initiatives in fiscal 2022.
The supply chain issues, which we are confident are transitory in nature, will take some time until the global demand and supply for equipment is rebalanced. Importantly, we believe the foundation of our business is stronger than ever. We believe we are in the process of materially improving the long-term earnings power of our business for years to come.
Before we get into questions, there's another topic I want to quickly touch on because it's important to all of us here at Dollar Tree. Recently, Morning Consult reported that the public views Dollar Tree as 1 of the 10 most trusted retail brands in America. We see this as a validation of our core mission of delivering value and convenience to our customers. but it also reflects our commitment to the broader communities we serve. As I wrote in our 2021 corporate sustainability report, Dollar Tree strives to be the best corporate citizen for all stakeholders and the thousands of neighborhoods, towns and rural markets where our stores are located. And that means taking concrete actions to implement our sustainable vision.
One recent step I can share, we are executing on our climate goals by pursuing 2 new solar projects for our stores and distribution centers. These will provide up to 6 megawatts of renewable power, taking that usage off the carbon grid for years to come. These and other efficiency projects show that our efforts to build out the infrastructure for sustainable growth are now taking root.
Additionally, our executive leadership team has leaned in on commitment to fostering an inclusive work environment where the individual differences are understood, respected and appreciated as a valuable source to strengthen our company. This strategy is designed to evolve our culture and sustain momentum through the guidance of our executive counsel that ensures leadership accountability to our very important DEI objectives.
We constantly seek to improve all aspects of our business, and that includes areas like store safety, healthier product offerings and many others that are so important to our associates, our customers, our neighbors and our shareholders. You should know that we always strive to be transparent on these topics. I look forward to providing future updates on the strides we are making.
In summary, there's a lot of inspiring news at Dollar Tree. We are excited that our strategic store formats, our accelerated growth plans and many key sales and traffic-driving initiatives, along with our robust balance sheet and commitment to sustainable growth will enable us to deliver long-term value for our stakeholders.
Operator, we are now ready to take questions."

Yes, we feel very good about Dollar Tree looking forward, especially in the inflationary times where a $1 price point will mean more to customers than ever. And our ability to continue to procure the product at the margins we expect. The second quarter, there was still some trip consolidation going on due to the COVID implications out there. And we saw that in the summer, of course, everybody in the country went on vacation twice to make up for last year. And there's the -- between that and -- and there's not really any huge holidays during the summer that Dollar Tree does so well on.
What I do like and what I'm really encouraged about is our average ticket is continuing on a 2-year stack to be at 20% to 21%. That's amazing growth over 2019. And if we can get the Dollar Tree traffic going along with that basket size, I really believe we're going to like the results.
And especially as we look ahead of us, we've got back-to-school, fall, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas. And with schools opening back up and offices, hopefully opening back up and traffic moving around and the trips aren't so consolidated. I believe there's upside for us. And we saw a little bit of while we weren't happy with the traffic in Q2, it was positive for the first time in 4 quarters. So we're very confident that Dollar Tree is going to have sustainable growth in that low single-digit comps."

We've done a good job controlling our SG&A costs, and everybody is very on top of those and doing a good job. So we feel good about that. And so now it's about driving that top line and working through the supply chain issues that we documented for everybody today. So I think a lot of good opportunity.
Your question as it relates to Dollar Trees and being additive, yes, I mean that is the whole reason to do that. It was if it's not additive to the bottom line, we don't want to spend our resources necessarily doing that. So that is the expectation. And with the mix change from the initial version that was very consumable driven to one that is now very discretionary driven. That obviously plays well. It's part of what we are known for our customers embracing it, and it allows us to drive that bottom line. And then, obviously, the top line does help us leverage some of the fixed costs."

And where I said they're not even meeting that, we think it's going to be 60% to 65%. What that means is the other 30% to 35% then will be at the market rate at a higher rate, and all those rates are calculated into our freight that Kevin described going forward."

Thanks for the question because I want to brag about our merchants and the great job that they do. When you sell everything for a dollar, there are, as you've read about, there's inflationary pressures all over the board. And we've got a very ex",647,"Yes. Yes. Thanks for the question because I want to brag about our merchants and the great job that they do. When you sell everything for a dollar, there are, as you've read about, there's inflationary pressures all over the board. And we've got a very experienced and knowledgeable team of merchants. And then they're supported by a best-in-class global sourcing team that worked really hard. And they're not just negotiating the end product you see on the shelf.
Our merchants absolutely understand all the components that drive the cost of the product as well as the value that they need out in the marketplace to sell it. So they know the main commodity of the product whether it's resin or cotton or paper or copper. So they go in very knowledgable on the cost and the components. They know the cost of a handle or a lid or stitching or the weight of the paper.
And as they build that product and understand that, that's how they come up with. They know the margin they need. They know what the retail is at a dollar and they know the sales that they have to obtain to drive the mix. So on this most recent trip in our July trip, they were just wrapping up a couple of weeks ago, we bought $1.8 billion in receipts. And they were able to obtain the margin, the initial markup and actually beat it by a little bit, and it's higher than 2019.
So that's why with all the pressures they have and with that $1 price point, our merchants are able to navigate and manage that and look at all the components. So it's not only what's making that product, but it's the packaging, it's the plastic, it's the -- it's how do we pack it in the case. They're very knowledgeable and negotiable because pennies matter when you're selling things for $1. And I couldn't be more proud of the work that they do.
And when they read out and shared the products. And they -- it gets down to the detail of how many puddles are on that role? What size of the pedal what size does the market have? Does that value look great? And then they produce this great product at the cost that they need to hit the margins we want at the dollar price point, and they did it over and over again. Because on this last trip, I think it was 70% to 73% of the items on that $1.8 billion buy had problems with inflation, the things that we had to solve for, and they did it. They worked at it, they did it. And the presentations were spectacular, and I'm so excited about the value and product we're having at $1. And I know it's hard to understand. That's why a lot of retailers can't do it. But we do it. We've been doing it for 30 years, and they just did it in July.
And that's why I said, if you think about the components of our margin, we have the initial markup that we're very excited about that I just described how we got to it. You heard from Kevin that our shrink is very favorable. Our markdowns are in line, and then you have freight. So if you take the freight and set it to a more normalized, we feel really good about the future of Dollar Tree.
And then to answer the second part of your -- the Dollar Tree Plus! rollout. We're doing it probably regionally and by distribution center. So as we put the product into DC, then we're going to look at the available stores around that DC network and then we'll grow it that way. So it's going to be probably a distribution center geographically driven. The good news is, is that..."

So I think it's more of that. I'm really excited about looking forward with what we have ahead of us. But I think you bring up a great point on the opportunity ahead with the SNAP benefits out there. Our enterprise has increased the SNAP benefits in our -- as a retailer by almost double since 2019. And why that's important is right now as an enterprise, we are the sixth largest SNAP retailer. And that's really important to us. And we're just behind the Walmart, Kroger, Ahold and Albertsons. So we are the #1 largest retailer of SNAP benefits in the dollar channel.
And think about the benefits, as you know, that they announced that they're going to increase them in October significantly. And in Family Dollar, what we really like about that is we've doubled since 2019 inside Family Dollar. But then inside that basket of SNAP, 42% of that customer buys a discretionary item.
So if you think about all the work we've done on the discretionary side in that mix and looking forward and the basket, we think there's a big upside for us when the SNAP benefits continue to increase in October. And then our capabilities that the merchants have been on the discretionary side and our customer willing to add that to the basket when they're in their store."

On this morning's call, we're going to discuss our strong operating performance, talk through some of the headwinds facing our industry and share details on the robust and accelerated strategic initiatives we have underway to drive short- and long-term value creation. 
I am proud of our team's continuing efforts, especially in our stores and distribution centers, to adapt and react in this dynamic environment to serve customers and deliver improvements in both operating margin and earnings. Our second quarter earnings per share of $1.23, represented a year-over-year quarterly increase of 12% and 62% when compared to Q2 of 2019. We continue to see strong performance in the discretionary side of the business and our key initiatives, including H2, Dollar Tree Plus! and the new Combo stores are delivering compelling results. All 3 concepts have performed very well, and we are significantly accelerating these initiatives in 2022 and beyond. 
Regarding the continuing and well-publicized challenges in the global supply chain as well as higher freight costs and other inflationary pressures, our teams are working hard to navigate these issues while staying focused, as always, on delivering the value and convenience our shoppers expect. I want to share more details on these challenges, how they affect our business and the actions we are taking to best manage and mitigate the impacts. 
In recent quarters, we have spoken about the freight cost environment, both international and domestic. As you have certainly seen in the media and elsewhere, freight costs have reached unprecedented levels as a result of increased demand, limited capacity and shipping delays. For context, 3 months ago, the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index, which reflects spot rates on ocean freight from China, was already at an all-time high, up more than 280% year-over-year and more than 400% since 2019. Now these rates have continued to rise and have increased more than 20% since we last reported on May 27. 
According to the recent Journal of Commerce annual ranking of the top 100 importers, Dollar Tree ranked as the fifth largest among retailers. Dollar Tree brings in nearly 90,000 40-foot containers per year, predominantly for the Dollar Tree banner. As you can see in the slide deck on the Investor Relations portion of our website at dollartreeinfo.com, we believe the Dollar Tree banner imports more containers per $100 million in sales than other large retailers. And combined with our low $1 price point, we have an outsized impact from freight costs. 
After the first quarter of 2021, our updated freight outlook assume that our regular ocean carriers would fulfill only 85% of their contractual commitments and assume -- we also assume the higher spot market rates. However, we now project that our regular carriers will fulfill only 60% to 65% of their commitments, and the spot market rates will be much higher than previously estimated. This shortfall is caused by a variety of factors such as equipment shortages, equipment situated in wrong location, significant backlogs and delays in both China and U.S. ports, outbreaks of COVID causing labor shortages or closure of entire terminals and the lingering effects of the Suez Canal blockage. 
To give you a real-life example of the kinds of challenges we're seeing, one of our dedicated charters was recently denied entry into China because a crew member tested positive for COVID, forcing the vessel return to Indonesia to change the entire crew before continuing. Overall, the voyage was delayed by 2 months. With the current pressure on carriers, once disruptions in the supply chain occur, there is not enough capacity to make it up. During a recent transportation webinar, a San Francisco-based freight forwarder stated the transit times from Shanghai to Chicago that more than doubled to 73 days from 35 days. Another transportation executive from a carrier recently estimated that voyages are now taking 30 days longer than in previous years due to port congestion, container handling delays and other factors. 
The Dollar Tree banner is more sensitive to freight cost than others in the industry. Our products have lower price points than other retail importers. And as a result, our freight costs are a higher percentage of our gross mark -- merchandise margin. The good news is our initial product margin, which exclude freight, have been improving as evidenced by our most recent overseas product purchases included from manufacturers in more than 2 dozen countries. Even in this inflationary environment, we continue to meet or exceed our desired initial product margins at values attractive to our customers. As freight costs moderate in the future, we are confident when paired with our team's significant efforts to enhance our supply chain. This will become a material tailwind, contributing to a better product margins. 
Industry experts expect the ocean shipping capacity will normalize no later than 2023 when many new ships come online. We are not counting on material improvements in 2022, especially in the first portion of the year. As a result, we are working proactively to reduce the freight cost impact and otherwise improve gross margin merchandise. Examples of steps we are taking include: using dedicated space on chartered vessels for the first time, including 1 large vessel contracted for a 3-year term, which is scheduled to make its first voyage within weeks. We are expecting to add more charters this year. We're adding alternative sources of supply, both domestic and international that do not rely on transpacific shipping. We expect some of this shift could become permanent. As an example, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar were well prepared for back-to-school season with alternatively sourced domestic product. We're taking a fresh look at which SKUs should be prioritized for import and which should be alternatively sourced, prioritizing containers based on seasonality, the margin impact and our overall inventory needs. 
We will be continuing to pull forward seasonal purchases by 30 days. We're optimizing which China and U.S. ports we use to take advantage of the shipping availability. And our operations team is delivering shrink improvements through technology, enhanced processes and disciplined execution. We are confident that our teams will allow us to navigate through this period of global supply chain challenges. 
In addition to the supply chain channels, we are also being impacted by labor shortages in our distribution centers and stores. Steps we are taking to combat these trends include: hosting national hiring events; paying sign-on bonuses; offering enhanced wages in select markets; paying tuition reimbursement; and more, all designed to be more competitive in a tight market for talent. We're continuing to optimize our DC network by reducing stem miles, partnering with suppliers to optimize and minimize length of haul for inbound freight, testing, validating and expanding self-checkout in our stores, and developing and utilizing more efficient processes, both in our stores and DCs. 
Despite these challenges affecting our industry, I'm very pleased with the team's performance to deliver a 62% improvement in EPS in Q2 when compared to 2019. 
Now let's talk about the exciting path forward. I'd like to highlight some of the key initiatives we have in place, especially Dollar Tree Plus! and our Combo stores, which are helping to position our company for the future. We are incredibly excited about the results we are seeing. As we have discussed in the past, we are well positioned to serve customers across all types of markets, urban, suburban and rural. 
The Family Dollar H2 continues to perform very well. In Q2, we renovated 435 stores into the H2 format, and now have a total of approximately 3,300 H2 stores. Importantly, we are accelerating the expansion of Dollar Tree Plus! initiative and the rollout of Combo stores to better serve customers' need and drive sustainable long-term value. We have been carefully improving and calibrating our Dollar Tree Plus! initiative with a better understanding of the multi-price offerings and greater values. Customers are increasingly embracing the Dollar Tree Plus! concept, which provides extraordinary value in the discretionary categories they most desire while enhancing store productivity. As we have refined the Dollar Tree Plus! concept, the operating metrics have achieved strong results and have provided us valuable insights that are enabling accelerated expansion. 
On average, stores with Dollar Tree Plus! are experiencing an overall sales lift of approximately 6% with a similar lift in gross profit, improved contribution of approximately 13%, and a payback on investment of less than a year. For obvious reasons, we have focused first on large stores, and we are already seeing similar positive results as we are now implementing into smaller stores. 
We currently have the multi-price assortment in about 340 stores, and we expect to be at 500 stores by year-end. Building on this continued success, we are planning to add Dollar Tree Plus! to an additional 1,500 stores in fiscal '22. And we aim to have at least 5,000 Dollar Tree Plus! stores by the end of fiscal 2024. Many of our new stores will also be opening up as Dollar Tree Plus! stores. 
This past March, we announced our newest store format, the Combo store, leveraging the strengths of both banners under 1 roof, to provide shoppers with extreme value and merchandise excitement. These stores represent another way to introduce the multi-price assortment to Dollar Tree shoppers and the $1 assortment to Family Dollar shoppers, a major benefit from the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar combination. We currently have 105 combo stores, and I believe we can reach 3,000 of these stores in rural markets alone. 
Demonstrating our great confidence in combo stores as a strategic format, more than 85% of our new Family Dollar stores will be Combo stores in fiscal 2022. We anticipate 400 new renovated or relocated combo stores next year. We are also in the process of validating Combo store concept and other demographic markets and are excited about the possibilities. 
Our larger Combo stores, on average, are delivering 23% more sales, 31% more gross margin dollars, approximately 120% more cash contribution dollars and are reducing payback time by approximately 30%. New combo stores compared to similar size stores are showing sales increases of 17%. And even more encouraging, our renovated or relocated Combo stores are delivering greater than 40% more sales when compared to Family Dollar stores that have not been renovated or relocated. Details about our Combo stores are available at www.familydollar.com/combostores. 
I will now hand the call over to Kevin to provide details on Q2 performance and our outlook."

Our second quarter EPS of $1.23 per share is an increase of 12% from the prior year's quarter and 62% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Consolidated net sales increased 1% to $6.34 billion comprised of $3.26 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.08 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales decreased 1.2% as we cycled a strong 7.2% from a year ago, representing a 6% increase on a 2-year stacked basis. Comps for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 0.2%. Family Dollar same-store sales decreased 2.1%, cycling a very strong 11.6% increase from last year. On a 2-year stacked basis, Dollar Tree comps increased 2.9%, and Family Dollar increased 9.5%. 
Dollar Tree's comps was comprised of a 1.1% increase in traffic offset by a decline in average ticket. Family Dollar experienced a 3.5% decline in traffic, partially offset by an increase in average ticket. We do believe that Dollar Tree's traffic has continued to be hindered by a lack of shopper mobility as more than half of the workforce continues to work remote. 
Gross profit was $1.86 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 29.4% compared to 30.5% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment declined 130 basis points to 32.4% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included merchandise costs, including freight, increased 175 basis points driven by increased freight costs, which was partially offset by favorable mix net of mark-on. Occupancy costs increased 10 basis points as a result of loss of leverage due to the comparable store sales decline. 
Shrink improved 55 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate. And distribution costs decreased 5 basis points, cycling COVID-19-related expenses in the prior year. 
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment declined 110 basis points to 26.1% in the second quarter. Year-over-year delta included the following: merchandise costs, including freight, increased 175 basis points related to higher freight costs and increased sales of lower-margin consumable merchandise. Occupancy costs increased 35 basis points as a result of the comparable store sales decrease. Shrink improved 50 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate; distribution costs improved 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter due to the lower COVID-19 related costs; and markdown costs decreased 25 basis points compared to last year based on civil unrest costs incurred a year ago. 
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 150 basis points to 23% of total revenue compared to 24.5% in Q2 last year. For the second quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of total revenue improved 170 basis points to 22.3% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs improved 155 basis points, primarily due to decreased COVID-19-related store payroll costs. Other SG&A decreased by 20 basis points, resulting from lower general liability insurance costs, primarily offset by increased debit and credit card fees. Store facility costs decreased 5 basis points due to lower repairs and maintenance costs. 
And for the Family Dollar, the second quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue was 21% compared to 21.9% in the prior year's quarter. 
Payroll costs decreased 95 basis points, primarily due to decreased COVID-19-related store payroll and incentive comp costs, partially offset by deleverage related to the comp store sales decline. 
Store facility costs decreased 30 basis points driven mainly by lower repairs and maintenance costs due to expense incurred from civil unrest in the prior year's quarter. Other SG&A expense increased 35 basis points primarily due to increased advertising and travel expense compared to the prior year, and depreciation and amortization expense increased 10 basis points due to deleverage on the comp sales. 
Corporate and support expenses as a percent of total revenue decreased 20 basis points compared to the prior year's quarter, primarily due to lower incentive and equity compensation. 
Operating income increased 7.3% to $402.2 million compared with $374.9 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin was 6.3% in the second quarter compared to 6% in the prior year quarter. The second quarter of 2021 included total incremental operating costs of $3 million for COVID-19-related expenses compared to $134.9 million in the second quarter of 2020. 
Nonoperating expenses totaled $33 million comprised of net interest expense, and our effective tax rate was 23.5% compared to 23.1% in the prior year's second quarter. Company had net income of $282.4 million or $1.23 per diluted share, and this compared to net earnings of $261.5 million or $1.10 per share in the prior year's quarter. 
Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $720.8 million compared to $1.42 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. Outstanding debt as of July 31 was $3.25 billion. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares of our common stock for $700 million. We currently have $1.45 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. 
Inventory for Dollar Tree at quarter end increased 13.1% from the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 3.7%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 9%. 
Inventory for Family Dollar at quarter end increased 10.9% from the same period last year, while selling square footage increased 2.1%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 8.6%. Both banners store inventory levels are below 2019 levels at quarter end. 
Capital expenditures were $229.1 million in the second quarter versus $232.5 million in Q2 last year. For fiscal 2021, we now expect that consolidated capital expenditures will be approximately $1.1 billion. 
Depreciation and amortization totaled $176.1 million for Q2 compared to $168.1 million in the second quarter of last year. And for fiscal 2021, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $720 million. 
Our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes the following assumptions: we expect continued pressure on wages due to the current shortage of workers available for our distribution centers and stores. Spec shrink will continue to be a tailwind as we go through the back half of the year but not at the same rate as we begin cycling improved results from the prior year. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $34 million in Q3 and approximately $134 million for fiscal 2021. We estimate consolidated net sales for the third quarter will range from $6.4 billion to $6.52 billion based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales for the combined enterprise. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.98. Consolidated net sales for full fiscal 2021 are expected to range from $26.19 billion to $26.44 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and 3.4% square footage growth. The company now estimates diluted earnings per share will range from $5.40 to $5.60. 
Freight costs for fiscal 2021 are now expected to be $1.50 to $1.60 higher than fiscal 2020, expressed in terms of the impact on diluted earnings per share. The updated outlook includes $0.60 to $0.65 per diluted share or $185 million to $200 million of additional freight costs since our prior guidance on May 27, 2021. As Mike noted earlier, the market conditions for freight have continued to deteriorate since our update in May. These changes include the significant difficulties our regular contract carriers are having in meeting their original commitments as well as continuing increases in the spot market rate. These disruptions have affected the timing of inventory receipts and have affected sales and mix. 
Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 22.7% for the third quarter and 23% for fiscal 2021. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 225.9 million shares for Q3 and 228.9 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any additional share repurchases, although as I said before, we still have $1.45 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. 
And I'll now turn the call back to Mike."

As Kevin stated, our updated outlook for fiscal 2021 is $5.40 to $5.60 per share. It's unfortunate that the global supply chain is in the condition it is, which is expected to result in a year-over-year drag to our business of $1.50 to $1.60 per share. If freight costs this year were similar to what we were just a year ago, we estimate that our earnings per share would be in the range of $6.90 to $7.20 for this fiscal 2021. 
The work of our teams has been remarkable. Our store and distribution center teams continue to demonstrate their commitment to serving our shoppers each and every day. Our customer satisfaction survey scores have never been higher. We have been -- we have seen improvements across the board for store cleanliness, assortment, service and speed of checkout. 
The merchants are delivering greater values to our customers that are meeting or exceeding our initial merchandise margin targets. Our buyers are disciplined, nimble and committed. While it represents a smaller part of our overall business, our digital team saw a 70% increase in sales versus the first half of 2021. We're also pleased with the solid performance of our local delivery program through Instacart. 
Our initiatives are driving improved results. Customers are responding to Dollar Tree Plus!, the H2 format and our new Combo stores. We are pleased to accelerate both these initiatives in fiscal 2022. The supply chain issues, which we are confident are transitory in nature, will take some time until the global demand and supply for equipment is rebalanced. Importantly, we believe the foundation of our business is stronger than ever. We believe we are in the process of materially improving the long-term earnings power of our business for years to come. 
Before we get into questions, there's another topic I want to quickly touch on because it's important to all of us here at Dollar Tree. Recently, Morning Consult reported that the public views Dollar Tree as 1 of the 10 most trusted retail brands in America. We see this as a validation of our core mission of delivering value and convenience to our customers, but it also reflects our commitment to the broader communities we serve. As I wrote in our 2021 corporate sustainability report, Dollar Tree strives to be the best corporate citizen for all stakeholders and the thousands of neighborhoods, towns and rural markets where our stores are located. And that means taking concrete actions to implement our sustainable vision. One recent step I can share, we are executing on our climate goals by pursuing 2 new solar projects for our stores and distribution centers. These will provide up to 6 megawatts of renewable power, taking that usage off the carbon grid for years to come. These and other efficiency projects show that our efforts to build out the infrastructure for sustainable growth are now taking root. 
Additionally, our executive leadership team has leaned in on commitment to fostering an inclusive work environment where the individual differences are understood, respected and appreciated as a valuable source to strengthen our company. This strategy is designed to evolve our culture and sustain momentum through the guidance of our executive counsel that ensures leadership accountability to our very important DEI objectives. 
We constantly seek to improve all aspects of our business, and that includes areas like store safety, healthier product offerings and many others that are so important to our associates, our customers, our neighbors and our shareholders. You should know that we always strive to be transparent on these topics. I look forward to providing future updates on the strides we are making. 
In summary, there's a lot of inspiring news at Dollar Tree. We are excited that our strategic store formats, our accelerated growth plans and many key sales and traffic-driving initiatives, along with our robust balance sheet and commitment to sustainable growth will enable us to deliver long-term value for our stakeholders.

And we saw that in the summer, of course, everybody in the country went on vacation twice  to make up for last year. And there's the -- between that and -- and there's not really any huge holidays during the summer that Dollar Tree does so well on.
What I do like and what I'm really encouraged about is our average ticket is continuing on a 2-year stack to be at 20% to 21%. That's amazing growth over 2019. And if we can get the Dollar Tree traffic going along with that basket size, I really believe we're going to like the results.
And especially as we look ahead of us, we've got back-to-school, fall, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas. And with schools opening back up and offices hopefully opening back up and traffic moving around and the trips aren't so consolidated, I believe there's upside for us. And we saw a little bit of it. While we weren't happy with the traffic in Q2, it was positive for the first time in 4 quarters.

Your question as it relates to Dollar Tree Plus! and being additive, yes, I mean that is the whole reason to do that.

And Family Dollar has been doing a great job at continually quarter after quarter to have a year-over-year look in enhancing our market share on the consumables side. And then on the discretionary side, as you called out, remember, the team did such a great job with apparel and toys and home and seasonal, and we are maintaining that 2-year stack of high double-digit market share in the teens.

When you sell everything for a dollar, there are, as you've read about, there's inflationary pressures all over the board. And we've got a very ex",649,"Yes. Yes. Thanks for the question because I want to brag about our merchants and the great job that they do. When you sell everything for a dollar, there are, as you've read about, there's inflationary pressures all over the board. And we've got a very experienced and knowledgeable team of merchants. And then they're supported by a best-in-class global sourcing team that worked really hard. And they're not just negotiating the end product you see on the shelf.
Our merchants absolutely understand all the components that drive the cost of the product as well as the value that they need out in the marketplace to sell it. So they know the main commodity of the product, whether it's resin or cotton or paper or copper. So they go in very knowledgable on the cost and the components. They know the cost of a handle or a lid or stitching or the weight of the paper.
And as they build that product and understand that, that's how they come up with. They know the margin they need. They know what the retail is at a dollar, and they know the sales that they have to obtain to drive the mix. So on this most recent trip, in our July trip, where they were just wrapping up a couple of weeks ago, we bought $1.8 billion in receipts. And they were able to obtain the margin, the initial markup and actually beat it by a little bit, and it's higher than 2019.
So that's why with all the pressures they have and with that $1 price point, our merchants are able to navigate and manage that and look at all the components. So it's not only what's making that product, but it's the packaging, it's the plastic, it's the -- it's how do we pack it in the case. They're very knowledgeable and negotiable because pennies matter when you're selling things for $1. And I couldn't be more proud of the work that they do.
And when they read out and shared the products. And they -- it gets down to the detail of how many pedals are on that road? What size of the pedal? What size does the market have? Does that value look great? And then they produce this great product at the cost that they need to hit the margins we want at the dollar price point, and they did it over and over again. Because on this last trip, I think it was 70% to 73% of the items on that $1.8 billion buy had problems with inflation, the things that we had to solve for, and they did it. They worked at it. They did it. And the presentations were spectacular, and I'm so excited about the value and product we're having at $1. And I know it's hard to understand. That's why a lot of retailers can't do it, but we do it. We've been doing it for 30 years, and they just did it in July.
And that's why I said, if you think about the components of our margin, we have the initial markup that we're very excited about that I just described how we got to it. You heard it from Kevin that our shrink is very favorable. Our markdowns are in line, and then you have freight. So if you take the freight and set it to a more normalized, we feel really good about the future of Dollar Tree.
And then to answer the second part of your -- the Dollar Tree Plus! rollout, we're doing it probably regionally and by distribution center. So as we put the product into DC, then we're going to look at the available stores around that DC network and then we'll grow it that way. So it's going to be probably a distribution center geographically driven. The good news is, is that..."

But I think you bring up a great point on the opportunity ahead with the SNAP benefits out there. Our enterprise has increased the SNAP benefits in our -- as a retailer by almost double since 2019. And why that's important is right now as an enterprise, we are the sixth largest SNAP retailer. And that's really important to us. And we're just behind the Walmart, Kroger, Ahold and Albertsons. So we are the #1 largest retailer of SNAP benefits in the dollar channel.
And think about the benefits, as you know, that they announced that they're going to increase them in October significantly. And in Family Dollar, what we really like about that is we've doubled it since 2019 inside Family Dollar. But then inside that basket of SNAP, 42% of that customer buys a discretionary item.
So if you think about all the work we've done on the discretionary side in that mix and looking forward and the basket, we think there's a big upside for us when the SNAP benefits continue to increase in October and then our capabilities that the merchants have been on the discretionary side and our customer willing to add that to the basket when they're in their store."

I can't reiterate enough how confident I am in the Dollar Tree format, especially with the Dollar Tree Plus! initiative that we're going to be driving to 5,000 stores in just a short few years. And then what I just described on what our merchants are able to do with a great value in the dollar price point. And keep in mind, this dollar price point is going to be more important than ever as other retailers are driving their comps by raising prices. That dollar price point is going to look good, and I'm confident going into the back half with our seasons, with our product that we have and what our merchants are delivering, we're going to continue to be able to drive this organization forward."

So obviously, the marketplace, in general, there's an expectation that it does not get better necessarily in the first half. And the other piece of what you have to remember is cost -- some of the costs that we'll incur this year in freight at the end of the year are attached to those goods that then gets sold in the next year. So a certain amount of freight gets capitalized in the inventory as it comes in. So as your inventory turns is when you burn that off. So anything along the lines that we've been incurring will fall -- there's a piece of that, that falls into next year. So that's how you have to remember that.
As far as $7, listen, obviously, we know what we know today. A lot of things are going to change in the next 6 months, and we'll know more then. And when we give guidance in March of 2022 for the year, we'll, again, be in a point where we'll put our best foot forward on what we know at that point in time.

I would first like to take a moment to recognize our store associates, distribution center staff, our field leadership and our world-class merchants. Our teams are working around the clock to do everything they can to defend against the current inflationary environment, keep our shelves stocked and provide customers with undeniable value and great service and easy-to-shop, close-to-home store locations. Their hard work and dedication is critical to our company's success, and I'd like to extend sincere thanks for their unwavering commitment to our customers.
We experienced a strong finish to the third quarter. As shoppers are increasingly focused on value in this inflationary environment, we continue to see accelerated progress in our key strategic initiatives, including Dollar Tree Plus!, Combo Stores and our H2 format.
During the past quarter, freight costs were significantly higher than expected. Our fourth quarter outlook, which Kevin will provide later in the call, reflects the higher cost structure we experienced in the third quarter. However, our EPS for the third quarter was at the higher end of the range as the performance of the rest of the business offset these higher freight costs. Freight and supply chain disruptions, of course, continue to be our biggest challenge in the near term by far, and the impact will continue for a while.
But this challenge is transitory. As we detailed last quarter, our team continues to take robust action to mitigate the impact of freight costs and supply chain disruptions. We believe that based on the steps that we have taken, we will benefit meaningfully as these challenges abate.
The Dollar Tree segment delivered a comp sales increase of 60 basis points against its toughest quarterly compare in nearly 3 years. On a 2-year comp stack basis, this was a sequential improvement of 170 basis points from the prior quarter.
Discretionary continues to perform well with a 3.2% comp for the quarter. Consumables were impacted by assortment constraints and past dues. Our $3 and $5-plus assortment continues to resonate well with our shoppers as we had tremendous sell-through in our Halloween merchandise and fall decor. And for the year, our multi-price point merchandise will exceed our sales plan. And we will end this fiscal year with Dollar Tree Plus! in nearly 600 stores, exceeding our previous target of 500 stores by the end of the year.
Family Dollar delivered a positive 2.7% comp against the 6.4% increase a year ago. This represented the third consecutive quarter that Family Dollar 2-year comp stack has exceeded 9%.
The consumable side of the business comped over 3%, while discretionary was slightly negative as we cycled stimulus dollars from the prior year. We are extremely pleased with the Family Dollar brand as the business continues to gain share.
Comps at both banners were driven by an increase in average ticket, partially offset by a decline in transaction comp. The last month of the quarter, October, represented the strongest comp for both banners.
Our digital offerings continue to evolve while we are steadfastly focused on best meeting our customers' changing needs. In October, we announced our expanded partnership with Instacart to now include same-day delivery from nearly 7,000 Dollar Tree stores. Nearly 100 million U.S. households now have delivery options from 13,000 of our store locations. We are very pleased with the initial results from the latest expansion.
Turning to the $1.25 price point. Our leadership team has been planning for the expansion of this initiative since late summer. As you know, in September, we announced our plans to add price points above $1 to all Dollar Tree stores and on a test-and-learn basis to select legacy Dollar Tree stores. As a result of the positive customer feedback and store performance during the initial phase, we have introduced the initiative to nearly 200 additional legacy Dollar Tree stores.
In today's press release, we announced for the first time in Dollar Tree's 35-year history we are lifting the $1 price point cap at all Dollar Tree stores on the majority of our assortment. The $1.25 price point enhances our ability to materially expand assortments, introduce new products and sizes and provide families with more of their daily essentials. We will have greater flexibility to continue providing incredible value and help customers get the everyday items they need and celebratory and seasonal products that Dollar Tree is best known for.
Additionally, we are now reintroducing many customer favorites and key traffic driving domestic and consumable products that Dollar Tree had previously discontinued due to the constraints of a $1 price point. The new price point will also enable us to mitigate historically high merchandising cost increases, including freight and distribution costs as well as higher operating costs such as wage increase.
Our teams are focused on speed, execution and customer research, and our shoppers are responding favorably. When surveyed, the majority of our customers indicated they were already aware of the previously announced new price point. And not surprisingly, many have also indicated they are seeing price increases across the market and that Dollar Tree is still providing the products they need at undeniable value. We are extremely focused on flawless execution and are providing our leadership team out in the field with tools to support a seamless transition.
Actions include: providing teams with a conversion checklist to ensure consistently exceed across markets and stores; dedicate adequate store hours to complete the preparation tasks, including removing the signage and display elements referring to the Everything is a Dollar; implementing the new signage regarding the $1.25 price point on displays, end caps and shelf strips throughout the store, posting clear communications to customers in entry ways and at the checkout; and we are equipping our store teams with messaging for responding to customer inquiries.
We have closely monitored the performance of the test stores and shopper reaction through extensive customer intercepts and third-party surveys since our initial test began. We will continue to gather our feedback throughout the process to ensure we remain fiercely committed to our brand promise of providing customers with extreme value every day, along with more thrills, more fun and more new items every week.
For 35 years, we've been able to manage through inflationary periods to maintain the Everything for $1 philosophy that distinguished Dollar Tree and made it one of the most successful retail concepts for 3 decades. However, we strongly believe this is the appropriate time to shift away from the constraints of the $1 price point in order to continue offering extreme value to our customers.
The independent surveys of shoppers across the U.S. have indicated that 77% of the shoppers were almost immediately aware of the price point change. And of those 77%, 31% already knew before they visited the store and 17% became immediately aware upon entering the store, while 29 were -- 29% were aware within minutes of entering the store. Critically, 91% of those surveyed indicated they would shop with the same or increased frequency. We will continue to monitor the success of these initiatives, and we believe we will see improvement in the survey results since now we have the ability to further expand the product offering and reintroduce key traffic-driving items.
Upon validating the store execution, customer reception and the performance results were as anticipated. We expanded the program to nearly 200 additional stores across 3 major markets, and we are pleased to say the results have been relatively consistent. As expected, we are seeing lifts in comp sales, partially offset by a smaller decline in unit sales. We are seeing an initial lift to product margins that will normalize over time as our merchant teams evolve our assortments.
Importantly, we expect this initiative will enable us to mitigate the higher freight other inflationary costs in order to return to our historical gross margin of 35% to 36% in fiscal 2022 while improving the merchandising we're providing for our customers.
All the steps I mentioned have set a solid foundation to streamline the execution of this important milestone in our company's history. We have been working hard to prepare this for this key strategic initiative to ensure that we are providing customers with great products while unlocking long-term shareholder value. We are focused on aggressively executing our plan to roll out the new price point across the entire footprint of legacy Dollar Tree stores.
Our teams will be introducing the new price point in more than 2,000 additional legacy Dollar Tree stores in December and complete the rollout to all stores by the end of the first quarter in fiscal 2022. Concurrently, our company's merchants are working to continually enhance their offerings to drive traffic, capture market share and further grow customer loyalty. We are working with our suppliers, and we have already begun introducing new items every week, including seasonal crafts, party supplies, food essentials and more.
Beyond the changes at our legacy Dollar Tree stores, we are also continuing to expand the availability of a $3 and $5-plus assortment. As I noted a few moments ago, we will exceed our previous goal of now adding the Plus! concept to nearly 600 stores by the end of the year. We plan to add the Plus! assortment to another 1,500 stores in fiscal 2022 and and complete at least 5,000 stores in total by the end of fiscal 2024.
We are enthusiastic about the opportunity and improve performance of Dollar Tree by continuing to deliver extreme value to our customers at the new $1.25 price point, driving comp sales and improving store productivity, enhancing flexibility to better manage the overall business in an inflationary environment and as previously mentioned, returning Dollar Tree gross margins back to the change historical 35% to 36% annual range in fiscal 2022.
I will now hand the call over to Kevin to provide details on Q3 performance and our outlook."

Consolidated net sales increased 3.9% to $6.42 billion, comprised of $3.42 billion at Dollar Tree and $3 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 1.6% as we cycled a 5.1% increase from a year ago, representing a 6.7% increase on a 2-year stacked basis.
Comps for the Dollar Tree segment increased 0.6%. Family Dollar same-store sales increased 2.7%, cycling a strong 6.4% increase from last year. On a 2-year stacked basis, Dollar Tree comps increased 4.6%, which was a 170 basis point improvement from Q2, and Family Dollar increased 9.1%.

Gross profit was $1.76 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 27.5% compared to 31.2% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for Dollar Tree segment declined 470 basis points to 30.2% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included merchandise costs, including freight, increased 475 basis points driven by higher freight costs and lower initial mark-on, partially offset by favorable mix from increased sales of higher-margin discretionary merchandise.
Occupancy costs increased 10 basis points as a result of loss of leverage due to a lower comparable store net sales increase and higher real estate tax expense. Distribution costs increased 10 basis points from higher depreciation costs related to 2 new distribution centers and higher hourly wages, partially offset by lower COVID-19-related expenses. And shrink improved 25 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate.
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment declined 240 basis points to 24.4% in the third quarter. The year-over-year delta included the following. Merchandise costs, including freight, increased 220 basis points related to higher freight costs. Distribution costs increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter due to higher wages, partially offset by lower COVID-19-related expenses. Markdown costs increased 20 basis points, primarily due to higher clearance markdowns. Occupancy costs increased 5 basis points, primarily due to higher real estate taxes, and shrink improved 30 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate.
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 100 basis points to 22.7% of total revenue compared to 23.7% in Q3 last year. We cycled $35.3 million in COVID-19-related costs or 57 basis points in the prior year's quarter. For the third quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of total revenue improved 50 basis points to 21.7% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs improved 30 basis points, primarily due to lower COVID-19-related store payroll costs and lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by minimum wage increases and higher health insurance costs. And other SG&A decreased by 25 basis points, resulting from the benefit associated with the settlement of a contractual dispute and the realization of certain tax credits.
For Family Dollar, the third quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue improved 80 basis points to 21.4% compared to 22.2% in the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs decreased 65 basis points, primarily due to lower COVID-19-related store payroll costs and lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by minimum wage increases. Store facility costs decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to lower repair and maintenance expenses and lower telecommunication expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5 basis points due to expenditures associated with the store optimization program. And other SG&A expense increased 20 basis points, primarily due to increases in advertising and travel expenses and an increase in insurance costs related to general liability claims.
Corporate support and other expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased approximately 30 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower incentive compensation. Operating income was $310.5 million or 4.8% of total revenue in the third quarter. Our nonoperating expenses totaled $33.6 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate was 21.7% compared to [ 21.8% ] in the prior year quarter.
Company had net income of $216.8 million or $0.96 per diluted share as compared to net earnings of $330 million or $1.39 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $701.4 million compared to $1.42 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. Outstanding debt as of October 30 were $3.25 billion. The company did not repurchase shares during the quarter as it was preparing for the announcement and launch of its $1.25 price point initiative across the Dollar Tree stores. We currently have $2.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Inventory for Dollar Tree at quarter end increased 15.2% from the same time last year, consisting primarily of a significant increase in goods on the water year-over-year. Comp store inventories are down 6.4% compared to a year ago when they were down 7.4%. Inventory for Family Dollar at quarter end increased 12.4% from the same period last year. comp store inventories are up 7.2% after being down 13.2% in 2020.
Capital expenditures were $295.6 million in the third quarter versus $238.7 million in Q3 last year. For fiscal 2021, we expect the consolidated CapEx will be approximately $1.1 billion. Depreciation and amortization totaled $178.5 million for Q3 compared to $170.1 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2021, we now expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $715 million.
Our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes the following assumptions. We have forecasted continued pressure on wages due to the current shortage of workers available for our stores and distribution centers. We expect shrink will continue to be a tailwind but not at the same rate as we are cycling improved results from the prior year. Higher sales, lower store inventory levels, technology and better processes continue to drive better results. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $33.6 million in Q4 and approximately $133 million for fiscal 2021.
We estimate consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter will range from $7.02 billion to $7.18 billion based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales for the combined enterprise. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $1.69 to $1.79. As Mike mentioned earlier, freight costs were significantly higher than expected in the third quarter. Our fourth quarter outlook reflects the expectation of higher transportation costs. These costs will be offset by the benefit of the Dollar Tree stores that are transitioned to the $1.25 price point net of onetime costs to implement that change.
Consolidated net sales for full fiscal year 2021 are expected to range from $26.25 billion to $26.41 billion based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and 3.3% square footage growth. The company now estimates diluted earnings per share will range from $5.48 to $5.58. Freight costs for fiscal 2021 are now expected to be approximately $2 higher than fiscal 2020 expressed in terms of the impact on diluted earnings per share.
While much of the focus has been on trans-Pacific Ocean container rates, we are being impacted by all aspects of freight, including higher cost for inland transportation by truck and rail and higher diesel costs. Additionally, in the third quarter, we moved more containers than originally planned, which required utilizing the spot market at rates higher than forecasted. To echo Mike's comments, freight continues to be our biggest challenge in the near term. We believe the majority of the freight challenges are transitory. The rest of the business is performing much better in the near term.
Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 22.1% for the fourth quarter and 22.7% for fiscal 2021. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 225.9 million shares for Q4 and 228.9 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. We have $2.5 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.
And I'll now turn the call back over to Mike."

But more importantly is that Combo Store, that bringing these 2 great companies together allow us to drive a great format in rural America. And there's 3,000 towns that we've identified, and we're going to grow that store count by more than 400. And as we shared on the last quarter, and I think we have it posted on our website, our Combo Stores deliver 17% more than our pro forma than our new store expected. They grow 23% more when we renovate them. And when we relocate them, it's a 40% increase.
So those things are really driving not only top line, but our margin is stronger and it's translating into a more productive store. So I think our initiatives -- I think the foundational things that we fixed at Family Dollar and then with our key initiatives going forward will enable us to continue to grow single store comp."

So it's the majority of the footprint inside of our store. And we will share -- as we continue to roll this out, we will share more details about the comp lift and the margin.

And then we can tell in some of the unit decline in some of the categories where our intuition we knew that we needed to improve some of our assortment and value in certain categories.

Then we come in and we clearly sign it, and we're putting signage throughout the entire store so this customer understands the $1.25.
And then at the same time, our merchants are working hard today, and they have been working actually. On their last buy trip, it was with the intent of the $1.25 price point. So our assortment is better than ever, and we're so excited on the hard work that our merchant team is doing. In fact, they've already looked at and reviewed over 7,000 of our core items. It's almost 7,500 of our core items. They put them on a table. They've done a comp shop, so they bring in product from other competitors to make sure that at $1.25, this product still has unbelievable value for our customers and it resonates well with them. And then the ones that don't, we're working hard on and we're attacking, and we're bringing in those new items.
And then beside that, we're bringing in additional items that we had to discontinue in the past. So now those items will be coming in. The customers responded to very favorably in the past, and we believe that will drive traffic. And most of those items are in your consumable side of the business, where we've seen softness over this year, where we've been limited to the $1 price point. We've lost some items. And we'll be able to bring meaningful value at $1.25 in our frozen section and in our food section. So we're really excited about our plan.
And then the -- in our Dollar Tree Plus!, the way we think about it, we -- that's sitting in about over 600 of our stores. And it's about 10% to 12% of the space in our stores, 200 linear feet. And the team is very good at -- they've been delivering that all year. So next year, we are just going to deliver an expansion of that, so just grow, same exact product assortment, different seasonal items, of course, but the same categories, the same square footage that we've done to 600 stores this year. So it's something we've already done. We already know what it takes to get it done. And our stores are executing it very well. And our customers understand it in a store. It will be a $1.25 now, a $3 and $5 that's clearly marked, and they're responding very, very well to the $3 and $5 items.
And then if you think about that's in 2022. And then in 2023 for our Dollar Tree Plus!, the growth will be twofold. We will grow more store count, but then also our merchants next year, while we're rolling out the same footprint to 1,500 stores next year, behind the scenes, at the same time, the merchants are going to be working really hard at more categories, more assortment. Can you go from a 10% of your store to 20% of your store? What kind of items can we really bring in at that $3 and $5 that will really drive more business to the stores?
So our lift is 6%, as we've -- and it's still hovering around that 6%. We think it can be more as we grow this going forward. So the $1.25, we got a great answer on. We're going to go with clarity and focus and speed from a marketing in-store execution, and then our merchants are working hard at analyzing every item to make sure it's got that great value. And then we're going to grow the Dollar Tree Plus! as we did the 600 stores with focus."

And I'd say we're seeing the same thing in our stores in markets we followed where we had to, to increase our labor rates to attract associates in our stores.
And as you've seen across retail, people are still sitting on the sidelines and not working. So we are working hard at driving benefits, and we're raising our hourly wage where we need to and being a convenient place to work through other things of -- having their schedule on their phones, having a program called Daily Pay, where they can get their pay. They don't have to wait for their paycheck, and our associates are liking that a lot, and there's a high use of that. So we're doing a lot of things to attract the hourly work out there in our stores to operate our stores effectively. But yes, it still is a tough environment out there.
And we have seen a little bit of a slip in our store manager turnover where last year during the pandemic, we hit our lowest turnover ever in store manager. And now there's -- I think there's a little bit of fatigue and it's creeped up a little bit on us, but our teams are working hard at filling those roles and attracting the talent we need.
Regarding managing the $1.25, there is -- as Kevin said, in our fourth quarter, there will be onetime costs of cleansing the store and then remarketing and resigning the store. But once that is set aside, it's really running the same play. They unload the truck, they put it up on the shelf. It's clearly marked already. So there really isn't any additional labor hours needed.
And then on our Dollar Tree Plus!, as we've rolled that out to 600 stores, we have not had to add any additional labor in those stores because the majority of those products are coming in pre-priced, the sections in the store are clearly marked $3 and $5 items, and now they'll be $1.25, $3 and $5.

So we'll manage this going forward. I think at first, we're going to go to $1.25, and then we'll be carrying that $1.25 into our Combo Stores as well. So our Combo Stores' baseline will be at $1.25 going forward, and it will be wrapped around that Dollar Tree brand and then have the great products at the Family Dollar on that side of the business as well. So moving off the $1 gives us the flexibility to make changes we need to going into the future."

I would first like to take a moment to recognize our store associates, distribution center staff, our field leadership and our world-class merchants. Our teams are working around the clock to do everything they can to defend against the current inflationary environment, keep our shelves stocked and provide customers with undeniable value and great service and easy-to-shop, close-to-home store locations. Their hard work and dedication is critical to our company's success, and I'd like to extend sincere thanks for their unwavering commitment to our customers.
We experienced a strong finish to the third quarter. As shoppers are increasingly focused on value in this inflationary environment, we continue to see accelerated progress in our key strategic initiatives, including Dollar Tree Plus!, Combo Stores and our H2 format.
During the past quarter, freight costs were significantly higher than expected. Our fourth quarter outlook, which Kevin will provide later in the call, reflects the higher cost structure we experienced in the third quarter. However, our EPS for the third quarter was at the higher end of the range as the performance of the rest of the business offset these higher freight costs. Freight and supply chain disruptions, of course, continue to be our biggest challenge in the near term by far, and the impact will continue for a while.
But this challenge is transitory. As we detailed last quarter, our team continues to take robust action to mitigate the impact of freight costs and supply chain disruptions. We believe that based on the steps that we have taken, we will benefit meaningfully as these challenges abate.
The Dollar Tree segment delivered a comp sales increase of 60 basis points against its toughest quarterly compare in nearly 3 years. On a 2-year comp stack basis, this was a sequential improvement of 170 basis points from the prior quarter.
Discretionary continues to perform well with a 3.2% comp for the quarter. Consumables were impacted by assortment constraints and past dues. Our $3 and $5-plus assortment continues to resonate well with our shoppers as we had tremendous sell-through in our Halloween merchandise and fall decor. And for the year, our multi-price point merchandise will exceed our sales plan. And we will end this fiscal year with Dollar Tree Plus! in nearly 600 stores, exceeding our previous target of 500 stores by the end of the year.
Family Dollar delivered a positive 2.7% comp against the 6.4% increase a year ago. This represented the third consecutive quarter that Family Dollar 2-year comp stack has exceeded 9%.
The consumable side of the business comped over 3%, while discretionary was slightly negative as we cycled stimulus dollars from the prior year. We are extremely pleased with the Family Dollar brand as the business continues to gain share.
Comps at both banners were driven by an increase in average ticket, partially offset by a decline in transaction comp. The last month of the quarter, October, represented the strongest comp for both banners.
Our digital offerings continue to evolve while we are steadfastly focused on best meeting our customers' changing needs. In October, we announced our expanded partnership with Instacart to now include same-day delivery from nearly 7,000 Dollar Tree stores. Nearly 100 million U.S. households now have delivery options from 13,000 of our store locations. We are very pleased with the initial results from the latest expansion.
Turning to the $1.25 price point. Our leadership team has been planning for the expansion of this initiative since late summer. As you know, in September, we announced our plans to add price points above $1 to all Dollar Tree stores and on a test-and-learn basis to select legacy Dollar Tree stores. As a result of the positive customer feedback and store performance during the initial phase, we have introduced the initiative to nearly 200 additional legacy Dollar Tree stores.
In today's press release, we announced for the first time in Dollar Tree's 35-year history we are lifting the $1 price point cap at all Dollar Tree stores on the majority of our assortment. The $1.25 price point enhances our ability to materially expand assortments, introduce new products and sizes and provide families with more of their daily essentials. We will have greater flexibility to continue providing incredible value and help customers get the everyday items they need and celebratory and seasonal products that Dollar Tree is best known for.
Additionally, we are now reintroducing many customer favorites and key traffic driving domestic and consumable products that Dollar Tree had previously discontinued due to the constraints of a $1 price point. The new price point will also enable us to mitigate historically high merchandising cost increases, including freight and distribution costs as well as higher operating costs such as wage increased.
Our teams are focused on speed, execution and customer research, and our shoppers are responding favorably. When surveyed, the majority of our customers indicated they were already aware of the previously announced new price point. And not surprisingly, many have also indicated they are seeing price increases across the market and that Dollar Tree is still providing the products they need at undeniable value. We are extremely focused on flawless execution and are providing our leadership team out in the field with tools to support a seamless transition.
Actions include: providing teams with a conversion checklist to ensure consistently exceed across markets and stores; dedicate adequate store hours to complete the preparation tasks, including removing the signage and display elements referring to the Everything's a Dollar; implementing the new signage regarding the $1.25 price point on displays, end caps and shelf strips throughout the store, posting clear communications to customers in entry ways and at the checkout; and we are equipping our store teams with messaging for responding to customer inquiries.
We have closely monitored the performance of the test stores and shopper reaction through extensive customer intercepts and third-party surveys since our initial test began. We will continue to gather our feedback throughout the process to ensure we remain fiercely committed to our brand promise of providing customers with extreme value every day, along with more thrills, more fun and more new items every week.
For 35 years, we've been able to manage through inflationary periods to maintain the Everything for $1 philosophy that distinguished Dollar Tree and made it one of the most successful retail concepts for 3 decades. However, we strongly believe this is the appropriate time to shift away from the constraints of the $1 price point in order to continue offering extreme value to our customers.
The independent surveys of shoppers across the U.S. have indicated that 77% of the shoppers were almost immediately aware of the price point change. And of those 77%, 31% already knew before they visited the store and 17% became immediately aware upon entering the store, while 29% were aware within minutes of entering the store. Critically, 91% of those surveyed indicated they would shop with the same or increased frequency. We will continue to monitor the success of these initiatives, and we believe we will see improvement in the survey results since now we have the ability to further expand the product offering and reintroduce key traffic-driving items.
Upon validating the store execution, customer reception and the performance results were as anticipated. We expanded the program to nearly 200 additional stores across 3 major markets, and we are pleased to say the results have been relatively consistent. As expected, we are seeing lifts in comp sales, partially offset by a smaller decline in unit sales. We are seeing an initial lift to product margins that will normalize over time as our merchant teams evolve our assortments.
Importantly, we expect this initiative will enable us to mitigate the higher freight other inflationary costs in order to return to our historical gross margin of 35% to 36% in fiscal 2022 while improving the merchandising we're providing for our customers.
All the steps I mentioned have set a solid foundation to streamline the execution of this important milestone in our company's history. We have been working hard to prepare this for this key strategic initiative to ensure that we are providing customers with great products while unlocking long-term shareholder value. We are focused on aggressively executing our plan to roll out the new price point across the entire footprint of legacy Dollar Tree stores.
Our teams will be introducing the new price point in more than 2,000 additional legacy Dollar Tree stores in December and complete the rollout to all stores by the end of the first quarter in fiscal 2022. Concurrently, our company's merchants are working to continually enhance the offerings to drive traffic, capture market share and further grow customer loyalty. We are working with our suppliers, and we have already begun introducing new items every week, including seasonal, crafts, party supplies, food essentials and more.
Beyond the changes at our legacy Dollar Tree stores, we are also continuing to expand the availability of a $3 and $5-plus assortment. As I noted a few moments ago, we will exceed our previous goal of now adding the Plus! concept to nearly 600 stores by the end of the year. We plan to add the Plus! assortment to another 1,500 stores in fiscal 2022 and complete at least 5,000 stores in total by the end of fiscal 2024.
We are enthusiastic about the opportunity and improve performance of Dollar Tree by continuing to deliver extreme value to our customers at the new $1.25 price point, driving comp sales and improving store productivity, enhancing flexibility to better manage the overall business in an inflationary environment and as previously mentioned, returning Dollar Tree gross margins back to the change historical 35% to 36% annual range in fiscal 2022.
I will now hand the call over to Kevin to provide details on Q3 performance and our outlook."

Consolidated net sales increased 3.9% to $6.42 billion, comprised of $3.42 billion at Dollar Tree and $3 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 1.6% as we cycled a 5.1% increase from a year ago, representing a 6.7% increase on a 2-year stacked basis.
Comps for the Dollar Tree segment increased 0.6%. Family Dollar same-store sales increased 2.7%, cycling a strong 6.4% increase from last year. On a 2-year stacked basis, Dollar Tree comps increased 4.6%, which was a 170 basis point improvement from Q2, and Family Dollar increased 9.1%.
Dollar Tree's comp was comprised of a 1.8% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 1.1% decline in traffic. Family Dollar experienced a 5.8% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 3% decline in traffic.
Gross profit was $1.76 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 27.5% compared to 31.2% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for Dollar Tree segment declined 470 basis points to 30.2% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included merchandise costs, including freight, increased 475 basis points driven by higher freight costs and lower initial mark-on, partially offset by favorable mix from increased sales of higher-margin discretionary merchandise.
Occupancy costs increased 10 basis points as a result of loss of leverage due to a lower comparable store net sales increase and higher real estate tax expense. Distribution costs increased 10 basis points from higher depreciation costs related to 2 new distribution centers and higher hourly wages, partially offset by lower COVID-19-related expenses. And shrink improved 25 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate.
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment declined 240 basis points to 24.4% in the third quarter. The year-over-year delta included the following. Merchandise costs, including freight, increased 220 basis points related to higher freight costs. Distribution costs increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter due to higher wages, partially offset by lower COVID-19-related expenses. Markdown costs increased 20 basis points, primarily due to higher clearance markdowns. Occupancy costs increased 5 basis points, primarily due to higher real estate taxes, and shrink improved 30 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate.
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 100 basis points to 22.7% of total revenue compared to 23.7% in Q3 last year. We cycled $35.3 million in COVID-19-related costs or 57 basis points in the prior year's quarter. For the third quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of total revenue improved 50 basis points to 21.7% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs improved 30 basis points, primarily due to lower COVID-19-related store payroll costs and lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by minimum wage increases and higher health insurance costs. And other SG&A decreased by 25 basis points, resulting from the benefit associated with the settlement of a contractual dispute and the realization of certain tax credits.
For Family Dollar, the third quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue improved 80 basis points to 21.4% compared to 22.2% in the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs decreased 65 basis points, primarily due to lower COVID-19-related store payroll costs and lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by minimum wage increases. Store facility costs decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to lower repair and maintenance expenses and lower telecommunication expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5 basis points due to expenditures associated with the store optimization program. And other SG&A expense increased 20 basis points, primarily due to increases in advertising and travel expenses and an increase in insurance costs related to general liability claims.
Corporate support and other expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased approximately 30 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower incentive compensation. Operating income was $310.5 million or 4.8% of total revenue in the third quarter. Our nonoperating expenses totaled $33.6 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate was 21.7% compared to 22.8% in the prior year quarter.
Company had net income of $216.8 million or $0.96 per diluted share as compared to net earnings of $330 million or $1.39 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $701.4 million compared to $1.42 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. Outstanding debt as of October 30 were $3.25 billion. The company did not repurchase shares during the quarter as it was preparing for the announcement and launch of its $1.25 price point initiative across the Dollar Tree stores. We currently have $2.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Inventory for Dollar Tree at quarter end increased 15.2% from the same time last year, consisting primarily of a significant increase in goods on the water year-over-year. Comp store inventories are down 6.4% compared to a year ago when they were down 7.4%. Inventory for Family Dollar at quarter end increased 12.4% from the same period last year. Comp store inventories are up 7.2% after being down 13.2% in 2020.
Capital expenditures were $295.6 million in the third quarter versus $238.7 million in Q3 last year. For fiscal 2021, we expect the consolidated CapEx will be approximately $1.1 billion. Depreciation and amortization totaled $178.5 million for Q3 compared to $170.1 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2021, we now expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $715 million.
Our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes the following assumptions. We have forecasted continued pressure on wages due to the current shortage of workers available for our stores and distribution centers. We expect shrink will continue to be a tailwind but not at the same rate as we are cycling improved results from the prior year. Higher sales, lower store inventory levels, technology and better processes continue to drive better results. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $33.6 million in Q4 and approximately $133 million for fiscal 2021.
We estimate consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter will range from $7.02 billion to $7.18 billion based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales for the combined enterprise. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $1.69 to $1.79. As Mike mentioned earlier, freight costs were significantly higher than expected in the third quarter. Our fourth quarter outlook reflects the expectation of higher transportation costs. These costs will be offset by the benefit of the Dollar Tree stores that are transitioned to the $1.25 price point net of onetime costs to implement that change.
Consolidated net sales for full fiscal year 2021 are expected to range from $26.25 billion to $26.41 billion based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and 3.3% square footage growth. The company now estimates diluted earnings per share will range from $5.48 to $5.58. Freight costs for fiscal 2021 are now expected to be approximately $2 higher than fiscal 2020 expressed in terms of the impact on diluted earnings per share.
While much of the focus has been on transpacific ocean container rates, we are being impacted by all aspects of freight, including higher cost for inland transportation by truck and rail and higher diesel costs. Additionally, in the third quarter, we moved more containers than originally planned, which required utilizing the spot market at rates higher than forecasted. To echo Mike's comments, freight continues to be our biggest challenge in the near term. We believe the majority of the freight challenges are transitory. The rest of the business is performing much better in the near term.
Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 22.1% for the fourth quarter and 22.7% for fiscal 2021. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 225.9 million shares for Q4 and 228.9 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. We have $2.5 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.
And I'll now turn the call back over to Mike."

Through the end of last week quarter-to-date, our comps were running at a 4.9% increase at Family Dollar and a 3% increase at Dollar Tree, and we are seeing positive trends as customers are planning to gather in person with family and friends to celebrate the holidays this year. The combination of shoppers seeking value in the inflationary environment, along with the acceleration of the company's initiatives, including Combo Stores and Dollar Tree Plus!, bode well for the continued traction and store productivity. In 2022, we plan implementing the $3 and $5-plus assortment into 1,500 more Dollar Tree stores. We will also be adding 400 Combo Stores through new or renovated stores, and we plan to renovate 800 legacy Family Dollar stores into the H2 format.
Additionally, lifting the $1 constraint represents a monumental step for our organization, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to meaningfully improve our shoppers' experience and unlock value for our stakeholders. We will be relentless in our commitment to offer our customers the best value possible, albeit at a different price point, while guided by Dollar Tree's same founding principles.
We are extremely excited and confident about the opportunities in 2022 and beyond. We are very focused on the acceleration of the initiatives that are working for us and are operating with clarity, focus and speed. As I previously mentioned, we do expect Dollar Tree banner to return to its historical annual range of 35% to 36% gross margin in fiscal 2022.

So on the Family Dollar side, we believe that based on the fundamental changes our merchants have made in our price points and in our assortment on discretionary side, along with the continued growth we see on the consumables side, we believe that we will sustain our growth beyond the pandemic as we exit it.
And it's evident in our 3 quarters in a row over a 9% 2-year stack of comp sales. And we're seeing our customers really gravitate to our assortment. You heard us say our consumables side is comping well, and they're buying more of the discretionary side as we get it in our stores. And we believe that long term, we can sustain that low single-digit growth. And it's really evident in our Combo Stores and our H2 format. So we're going to exceed our 1,250 H2 renovations, and we continue to see a 10% increase when we renovate those stores.
But more importantly is that Combo Store, that bringing these 2 great companies together allow us to drive a great format in rural America. And there's 3,000 towns that we've identified, and we're going to grow that store count by more than 400. And as we shared on the last quarter, and I think we have it posted on our website, our Combo Stores deliver 17% more than our pro forma than our new store expected. They grow 23% more when we renovate them. And when we relocate them, it's a 40% increase.
So those things are really driving not only top line, but our margin is stronger and it's translating into a more productive store. So I think our initiatives -- I think the foundational things that we fixed at Family Dollar and then with our key initiatives going forward will enable us to continue to grow single store comp."

And then we could tell in some of the unit decline in some of the categories where our intuition we knew that we needed to improve some of our assortment and value in certain categories.

Then we come in and we clearly sign it, and we're putting signage throughout the entire store so that customer understands the $1.25.
And then at the same time, our merchants are working hard today, and they have been working actually. On their last buy trip, it was with the intent of the $1.25 price point. So our assortment is better than ever, and we're so excited on the hard work that our merchant team is doing. In fact, they've already looked at and reviewed over 7,000 of our core items. It's almost 7,500 of our core items. They put them on a table. They've done a comp shop, so they bring in product from other competitors to make sure that at $1.25, this product still has unbelievable value for our customers and it resonates well with them. And then the ones that don't, we're working hard on and we're attacking, and we're bringing in those new items.
And then beside that, we're bringing in additional items that we had to discontinue in the past. So now those items will be coming in. The customers responded to very favorably in the past, and we believe that will drive traffic. And most of those items are in your consumable side of the business, where we've seen softness over this year, where we've been limited to the $1 price point. We've lost some items. And we'll be able to bring meaningful value at $1.25 in our frozen section and in our food section. So we're really excited about our plan.
And then the -- in our Dollar Tree Plus!, the way we think about it, we -- that's sitting in about over 600 of our stores. And it's about 10% to 12% of the space in our stores, 200 linear feet. And the team is very good at -- they've been delivering that all year. So next year, we are just going to deliver an expansion of that, so just grow, same exact product assortment, different seasonal items, of course, but the same categories, the same square footage that we've done to 600 stores this year. So it's something we've already done. We already know what it takes to get it done. And our stores are executing it very well. And our customers understand it in a store. It will be a $1.25 now, a $3 and $5 that's clearly marked, and they're responding very, very well to the $3 and $5 items.
And then if you think about that's in 2022. And then in 2023 for our Dollar Tree Plus!, the growth will be twofold. We will grow more store count, but then also our merchants next year, while we're rolling out the same footprint to 1,500 stores next year, behind the scenes, at the same time, the merchants are going to be working really hard at more categories, more assortment. Can you go from a 10% of your store to 20% of your store? What kind of items can we really bring in at that $3 and $5 that will really drive more business to the stores?
So our lift is 6%, as we've -- and it's still hovering around at 6%. We think it can be more as we grow this going forward. So the $1.25, we got a great answer on. We're going to go with clarity and focus and speed from a marketing in-store execution, and then our merchants are working hard at analyzing every item to make sure it's got that great value. And then we're going to grow the Dollar Tree Plus! as we did the 600 stores with focus."

They don't have to wait for their paycheck, and our associates are liking that a lot, and there's a high use of that. So we're doing a lot of things to attract the hourly work out there in our stores to operate our stores effectively. But yes, it still is a tough environment out there.
And we have seen a little bit of a slip in our store manager turnover where last year during the pandemic, we hit our lowest turnover ever in store manager. And now there's -- I think there's a little bit of fatigue and it's creeped up a little bit on us, but our teams are working hard at filling those roles and attracting the talent we need.
Regarding managing the $1.25, there is -- as Kevin said, in our fourth quarter, there will be onetime costs of cleansing the store and then remarketing and resigning the store. But once that is set aside, it's really running the same play. They unload the truck, they put it up on the shelf. It's clearly marked already. So there really isn't any additional labor hours needed.
And then on our Dollar Tree Plus!, as we've rolled that out to 600 stores, we have not had to add any additional labor in those stores because the majority of those products are coming in pre-priced, the sections in the store are clearly marked $3 and $5 items, and now they'll be $1.25, $3 and $5. So there really isn't any additional labor needed in those stores either."

You could perhaps be even more precise with price points and manage to different SKUs and categories. So I'm curious kind of what went into that decision process? And am I interpreting, I guess, the strategy with the price point correctly in that regard?
And then bigger picture on that, is there an even longer-term vision of perhaps price points going up across the store and then you have a separate initiative with Plus! at even higher price points and perhaps even melding these initiatives together, expanding Plus! even more of the store? Just I guess the longer-term vision would be interested to hear about as well."

So the reason we moved to the $1.25 is, it allows us to do all 3 of those things.
Our merchants are, I believe, the best in the industry, and they've been able to defend and get great product at $1. And we know the type of product we can get at that $1.25, and we'll be able to bring in exciting, great product that will drive the business and drive traffic into our stores and enable us to get back to that 35% to 36% margin. And it gives us the flexibility to manage our business going forward.
And it really brings simplicity. Simplicity's still very important to us as it's a single price point, our customers understand it and our shoppers, our customers and our associates understand it. So we'll manage this going forward. I think at first, we're going to go to $1.25, and then we'll be carrying that $1.25 into our Combo Stores as well. So our Combo Stores' baseline will be at $1.25 going forward, and it will be wrapped around that Dollar Tree brand and then have the great products at the Family Dollar on that side of the business as well. So moving off the $1 gives us the flexibility to make changes we need to, going into the future."

I would first like to take a moment to recognize our store associates, distribution center staff, our field leadership and our world-class merchants. Our teams are working around the clock to do everything they can to defend against the current inflationary environment, keep our shelves stocked and provide customers with undeniable value and great service and easy-to-shop, close-to-home store locations. Their hard work and dedication is critical to our company's success, and I'd like to extend sincere thanks for their unwavering commitment to our customers.
We experienced a strong finish to the third quarter. As shoppers are increasingly focused on value in this inflationary environment, we continue to see accelerated progress in our key strategic initiatives, including Dollar Tree Plus, Combo Stores and our H2 format.
During the past quarter, freight costs were significantly higher than expected. Our fourth quarter outlook, which Kevin will provide later in the call, reflects the higher cost structure we experienced in the third quarter. However, our EPS for the third quarter was at the higher end of the range as the performance of the rest of the business offset these higher freight costs. 
Freight and supply chain disruptions, of course, continue to be our biggest challenge in the near term by far, and the impact will continue for a while. But this challenge is transitory. As we detailed last quarter, our team continues to take robust action to mitigate the impact of freight costs and supply chain disruptions. We believe that based on the steps that we have taken, we will benefit meaningfully as these challenges abate.
The Dollar Tree segment delivered a comp sales increase of 60 basis points against its toughest quarterly compare in nearly 3 years. On a 2-year comp stacked basis, this was a sequential improvement of 170 basis points from the prior quarter.
Discretionary continues to perform well with a 3.2% comp for the quarter. Consumables were impacted by assortment constraints and past dues. Our $3 and $5-plus assortment continues to resonate well with our shoppers as we had tremendous sell-through on our Halloween merchandise and fall decor. And for the year, our multi-price point merchandise will exceed our sales plan. And we will end this fiscal year with Dollar Tree Plus in nearly 600 stores, exceeding our previous target of 500 stores by the end of the year.
Family Dollar delivered a positive 2.7% comp against the 6.4% increase a year ago. This represented the third consecutive quarter that Family Dollar 2-year comp stack has exceeded 9%. The consumable side of the business comp'ed over 3%, while discretionary was slightly negative as we cycled stimulus dollars from the prior year. We are extremely pleased with the Family Dollar brand as the business continues to gain share.
Comps at both banners were driven by an increase in average ticket, partially offset by a decline in transaction comp. The last month of the quarter, October, represented the strongest comp for both banners.
Our digital offerings continue to evolve while we are steadfastly focused on best meeting our customers' changing needs. In October, we announced our expanded partnership with Instacart to now include same-day delivery from nearly 7,000 Dollar Tree stores. Nearly 100 million U.S. households now have delivery options from 13,000 of our store locations. We are very pleased with the initial results from the latest expansion.
Turning to the $1.25 price point. Our leadership team has been planning for the expansion of this initiative since late summer. As you know, in September, we announced our plans to add price points above $1 to all Dollar Tree Plus stores and on a test-and-learn basis to select legacy Dollar Tree stores. As a result of the positive customer feedback and store performance during the initial phase, we have introduced the initiative to nearly 200 additional legacy Dollar Tree stores.
In today's press release, we announced for the first time in Dollar Tree's 35-year history, we are lifting the $1 price point cap at all Dollar Tree stores on the majority of our assortment. The $1.25 price point enhances our ability to materially expand assortments, introduce new products and sizes, and provide families with more of their daily essentials. We will have greater flexibility to continue providing incredible value and help customers get the everyday items they need and celebratory and seasonal products that Dollar Tree is best known for.
Additionally, we are now reintroducing many customer favorites and key traffic driving domestic and consumable products that Dollar Tree had previously discontinued due to the constraints of a $1 price point. The new price point will also enable us to mitigate historically high merchandising cost increases, including freight and distribution costs as well as higher operating costs such as wage increases.
Our teams are focused on speed, execution and customer research, and our shoppers are responding favorably. When surveyed, the majority of our customers indicated they were already aware of the previously announced new price point. And not surprisingly, many have also indicated they are seeing price increases across the market and that Dollar Tree is still providing the products they need at undeniable value. 
We are extremely focused on flawless execution and are providing our leadership team out in the field with tools to support a seamless transition. Actions include: providing teams with a conversion checklist to ensure consistently exceed across markets and stores; dedicate adequate store hours to complete the preparation tasks, including removing the signage and display elements referring to the Everything's a Dollar; implementing the new signage regarding the $1.25 price point on displays, end caps and shelf strips throughout the store, posting clear communications to customers in entry ways and at the checkout; and we are equipping our store teams with messaging for responding to customer inquiries.
We have closely monitored the performance of the test stores and shopper reaction through extensive customer intercepts and third-party surveys since our initial test began. We will continue to gather feedback throughout the process to ensure we remain fiercely committed to our brand promise of providing customers with extreme value every day, along with more thrills, more fun and more new items every week.
For 35 years, we've been able to manage through inflationary periods to maintain the Everything for $1 philosophy that distinguished Dollar Tree and made it one of the most successful retail concepts for 3 decades. However, we strongly believe this is the appropriate time to shift away from the constraints of the $1 price point in order to continue offering extreme value to our customers.
The independent surveys of shoppers across the U.S. have indicated that 77% of the shoppers were almost immediately aware of the price point change. And of those 77%, 31% already knew before they visited the store and 17% became immediately aware upon entering the store, while 29% were aware within minutes of entering the store. Critically, 91% of those surveyed indicated they would shop with the same or increased frequency. We will continue to monitor the success of these initiatives, and we believe we will see improvement in the survey results since now we have the ability to further expand the product offering and reintroduce key traffic-driving items.
Upon validating the store execution, customer reception and the performance results were as anticipated. We expanded the program to nearly 200 additional stores across 3 major markets, and we are pleased to say the results have been relatively consistent. As expected, we are seeing lifts in comp sales, partially offset by a smaller decline in unit sales. We are seeing an initial lift to product margins that will normalize over time as our merchant teams evolve our assortments.
Importantly, we expect this initiative will enable us to mitigate the higher freight other inflationary costs in order to return to our historical gross margin of 35% to 36% in fiscal 2022, while improving the merchandising we're providing for our customers.
All the steps I mentioned have set a solid foundation to streamline the execution of this important milestone in our company's history. We have been working hard to prepare this -- for this key strategic initiative to ensure that we are providing customers with great products while unlocking long-term shareholder value. 
We are focused on aggressively executing our plan to roll out the new price point across the entire footprint of legacy Dollar Tree stores. Our teams will be introducing the new price point in more than 2,000 additional legacy Dollar Tree stores in December and complete the rollout to all stores by the end of the first quarter in fiscal 2022. 
Concurrently, our company's merchants are working to continually enhance the offerings to drive traffic, capture market share and further grow customer loyalty. We are working with our suppliers, and we have already begun introducing new items every week, including seasonal, crafts, party supplies, food essentials and more.
Beyond the changes at our legacy Dollar Tree stores, we are also continuing to expand the availability of a $3 and $5-plus assortment. As I noted a few moments ago, we will exceed our previous goal of now adding the Plus concept to nearly 600 stores by the end of the year. We plan to add the Plus assortment to another 1,500 stores in fiscal 2022 and complete at least 5,000 stores in total by the end of fiscal 2024.
We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to improve performance of Dollar Tree by continuing to deliver extreme value to our customers at the new $1.25 price point, driving comp sales and improving store productivity, enhancing flexibility to better manage the overall business in an inflationary environment and as previously mentioned, returning Dollar Tree gross margins back to the change historical 35% to 36% annual range in fiscal 2022.
I will now hand the call over to Kevin to provide details on Q3 performance and our outlook."

Enterprise same-store sales increased 1.6% as we cycled a 5.1% increase from a year ago, representing a 6.7% increase on a 2-year stacked basis.
Comps for the Dollar Tree segment increased 0.6%. Family Dollar same-store sales increased 2.7%, cycling a strong 6.4% increase from last year. On a 2-year stacked basis, Dollar Tree comps increased 4.6%, which was a 170 basis point improvement from Q2, and Family Dollar increased 9.1%.
Dollar Tree's comp was comprised of a 1.8% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 1.1% decline in traffic. Family Dollar experienced a 5.8% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 3% decline in traffic.
Gross profit was $1.76 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 27.5% compared to 31.2% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for Dollar Tree segment declined 470 basis points to 30.2% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included merchandise costs, including freight, increased 475 basis points driven by higher freight costs and lower initial mark-on, partially offset by favorable mix from increased sales of higher-margin discretionary merchandise.
Occupancy costs increased 10 basis points as a result of loss of leverage due to a lower comparable store net sales increase and higher real estate tax expense. Distribution costs increased 10 basis points from higher depreciation costs related to 2 new distribution centers and higher hourly wages, partially offset by lower COVID-19-related expenses. And shrink improved 25 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate.
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment declined 240 basis points to 24.4% in the third quarter. The year-over-year delta included the following: Merchandise costs, including freight, increased 220 basis points related to higher freight costs. Distribution costs increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter due to higher wages, partially offset by lower COVID-19-related expenses. Markdown costs increased 20 basis points, primarily due to higher clearance markdowns. Occupancy costs increased 5 basis points, primarily due to higher real estate taxes, and shrink improved 30 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate.
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 100 basis points to 22.7% of total revenue compared to 23.7% in Q3 last year. We cycled $35.3 million in COVID-19-related costs or 57 basis points in the prior year's quarter. For the third quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of total revenue improved 50 basis points to 21.7% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs improved 30 basis points, primarily due to lower COVID-19-related store payroll costs and lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by minimum wage increases and higher health insurance costs. And other SG&A decreased by 25 basis points, resulting from the benefit associated with the settlement of a contractual dispute and the realization of certain tax credits.
For Family Dollar, the third quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue improved 80 basis points to 21.4% compared to 22.2% in the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs decreased 65 basis points, primarily due to lower COVID-19-related store payroll costs and lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by minimum wage increases. Store facility costs decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to lower repair and maintenance expenses and lower telecommunication expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5 basis points due to expenditures associated with the store optimization program. And other SG&A expense increased 20 basis points, primarily due to increases in advertising and travel expenses and an increase in insurance costs related to general liability claims.
Corporate support and other expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased approximately 30 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower incentive compensation. Operating income was $310.5 million or 4.8% of total revenue in the third quarter. Our nonoperating expenses totaled $33.6 million, comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate was 21.7% compared to 22.8% in the prior year quarter.
Company had net income of $216.8 million or $0.96 per diluted share as compared to net earnings of $330 million or $1.39 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $701.4 million compared to $1.42 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. Outstanding debt as of October 30 were $3.25 billion. The company did not repurchase shares during the quarter as it was preparing for the announcement and launch of its $1.25 price point initiative across the Dollar Tree stores. We currently have $2.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Inventory for Dollar Tree at quarter end increased 15.2% from the same time last year, consisting primarily of a significant increase in goods on the water year-over-year. Comp store inventories are down 6.4% compared to a year ago when they were down 7.4%. Inventory for Family Dollar at quarter end increased 12.4% from the same period last year. Comp store inventories are up 7.2% after being down 13.2% in 2020.
Capital expenditures were $295.6 million in the third quarter versus $238.7 million in Q3 last year. For fiscal 2021, we expect the consolidated CapEx will be approximately $1.1 billion. Depreciation and amortization totaled $178.5 million for Q3 compared to $170.1 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2021, we now expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $715 million.
Our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes the following assumptions. We have forecasted continued pressure on wages due to the current shortage of workers available for our stores and distribution centers. We expect shrink will continue to be a tailwind but not at the same rate as we are cycling improved results from the prior year. Higher sales, lower store inventory levels, technology and better processes continue to drive better results. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $33.6 million in Q4 and approximately $133 million for fiscal 2021.
We estimate consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter will range from $7.02 billion to $7.18 billion based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales for the combined enterprise. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $1.69 to $1.79. As Mike mentioned earlier, freight costs were significantly higher than expected in the third quarter. Our fourth quarter outlook reflects the expectation of higher transportation costs. These costs will be offset by the benefit of the Dollar Tree stores that are transitioned to the $1.25 price point net of onetime costs to implement that change.
Consolidated net sales for full fiscal year 2021 are expected to range from $26.25 billion to $26.41 billion based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and 3.3% square footage growth. The company now estimates diluted earnings per share will range from $5.48 to $5.58. Freight costs for fiscal 2021 are now expected to be approximately $2 higher than fiscal 2020 expressed in terms of the impact on diluted earnings per share.
While much of the focus has been on transpacific ocean container rates, we are being impacted by all aspects of freight, including higher cost for inland transportation by truck and rail and higher diesel costs. Additionally, in the third quarter, we moved more containers than originally planned, which required utilizing the spot market at rates higher than forecasted. To echo Mike's comments, freight continues to be our biggest challenge in the near term. We believe the majority of the freight challenges are transitory. The rest of the business is performing much better in the near term.
Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 22.1% for the fourth quarter and 22.7% for fiscal 2021. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 225.9 million shares for Q4 and 228.9 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. We have $2.5 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.
And I'll now turn the call back over to Mike."

As I mentioned earlier on the call, we ended the third quarter with momentum in the business, and that has certainly continued in both segments. Through the end of last week quarter-to-date, our comps were running at a 4.9% increase at Family Dollar and a 3% increase at Dollar Tree, and we are seeing positive trends as customers are planning to gather in person with family and friends to celebrate the holidays this year. The combination of shoppers seeking value in the inflationary environment, along with the acceleration of the company's initiatives, including Combo Stores and Dollar Tree Plus, bode well for the continued traction and store productivity. In 2022, we plan implementing the $3 and $5-plus assortment into 1,500 more Dollar Tree stores. We will also be adding 400 Combo Stores through new or renovated stores, and we plan to renovate 800 legacy Family Dollar stores into the H2 format.
Additionally, lifting the $1 constraint represents a monumental step for our organization, and we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to meaningfully improve our shoppers' experience and unlock value for our stakeholders. We will be relentless in our commitment to offer our customers the best value possible, albeit at a different price point, while guided by Dollar Tree's same founding principles.
We are extremely excited and confident about the opportunities in 2022 and beyond. We are very focused on the acceleration of the initiatives that are working for us and are operating with clarity, focus and speed. As I previously mentioned, we do expect Dollar Tree banner to return to its historical annual range of 35% to 36% gross margin in fiscal 2022.
Before we go into Q&A, I would like to make a brief statement. We appreciate that many of you are focused on the Form 13D filed by Mantle Ridge 2 Fridays ago. So we will make a short statement about that, but we'll not entertain any questions on the topic. We believe Mantle Ridge has made a very smart investment. As we said, Dollar Tree's Board of Directors and management team are always open to listen to input and engaging with our shareholders, and we evaluate any ideas for constructive value creation with the best interest of all shareholders and stakeholders in mind. 
In keeping with our practice not to comment publicly on our private discussions with individual investors, we will not take any questions regarding Mantle Ridge. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

So on the Family Dollar side, we believe that based on the fundamental changes our merchants have made in our price points and in our assortment on discretionary side, along with the continued growth we see on the consumables side, we believe that we will sustain our growth beyond the pandemic as we exit it.
And it's evident in our 3 quarters in a row over a 9% 2-year stack of comp sales. And we're seeing our customers really gravitate to our assortment. You heard us say our consumables side is comping well, and they're buying more of the discretionary side as we get it in our stores. And we believe that long term, we can sustain that low single-digit growth. And it's really evident in our Combo Stores and our H2 format. So we're going to exceed our 1,250 H2 renovations, and we continue to see a 10% increase when we renovate those stores.
But more importantly is that Combo Store, that bringing these 2 great companies together allow us to drive a great format in rural America. And there's 3,000 towns that we've identified, and we're going to grow that store count by more than 400. And as we shared on the last quarter, and I think we have it posted on our website, our Combo Stores deliver 17% more than our pro forma than our new store expected. They grow 23% more when we renovate them. And when we relocate them, it's a 40% increase.
So those things are really driving not only top line, but our margin is stronger and it's translating into a more productive store. So I think our initiatives -- I think the foundational things that we fixed at Family Dollar and then with our key initiatives going forward will enable us to continue to grow single-store comp."

Then we come in and we clearly sign it, and we're putting signage throughout the entire store so that customer understands the $1.25.
And then at the same time, our merchants are working hard today, and they have been working actually. On their last buy trip, it was with the intent of the $1.25 price point. So our assortment is better than ever, and we're so excited on the hard work that our merchant team is doing. In fact, they've already looked at and reviewed over 7,000 of our core items. It's almost 7,500 of our core items. They put them on a table. They've done a comp shop, so they bring in product from other competitors to make sure that at $1.25, this product still has unbelievable value for our customers and it resonates well with them. And then the ones that don't, we're working hard on and we're attacking, and we're bringing in those new items.
And then beside that, we're bringing in additional items that we had to discontinue in the past. So now those items will be coming in. The customers responded to very favorably in the past, and we believe that will drive traffic. And most of those items are in your consumable side of the business, where we've seen softness over this year, where we've been limited to the $1 price point. We've lost some items. And we'll be able to bring meaningful value at $1.25 in our frozen section and in our food section. So we're really excited about our plan.
And then the -- in our Dollar Tree Plus, the way we think about it, we -- that's sitting in about over 600 of our stores. And it's about 10% to 12% of the space in our stores, 200 linear feet. And the team is very good at; they've been delivering that all year. So next year, we are just going to deliver an expansion of that, so just grow, same exact product assortment, different seasonal items, of course, but the same categories, the same square footage that we've done to 600 stores this year. So it's something we've already done. We already know what it takes to get it done. And our stores are executing it very well. And our customers understand it in a store. It will be a $1.25 now, a $3 and $5 that's clearly marked, and they're responding very, very well to the $3 and $5 items.
And then if you think about that's in 2022. And then in 2023 for our Dollar Tree Plus, the growth will be twofold. We will grow more store count, but then also our merchants next year, while we're rolling out the same footprint to 1,500 stores next year, behind the scenes, at the same time, the merchants are going to be working really hard at more categories, more assortment. Can you go from a 10% of your store to 20% of your store? What kind of items can we really bring in at that $3 and $5 that will really drive more business to the stores?
So our lift is 6%, as we've -- and it's still hovering around at 6%. We think it can be more as we grow this going forward. So the $1.25, we got a great answer on. We're going to go with clarity and focus and speed from a marketing in-store execution, and then our merchants are working hard at analyzing every item to make sure it's got that great value. And then we're going to grow the Dollar Tree Plus as we did the 600 stores with focus."

I mean our customers are benefiting from child tax credit stimulus. In October, they had a huge increase of SNAP benefits, and they're experiencing increase in hourly wages that you're seeing across the industry. So I think our customers are in a pretty good position, but they are also feeling a lot of pressure on other costs, the gas and fuel prices and energy for their homes.
So I think right now, more than ever, they are going to be relying on great value. And that's why I think Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are in a great position to be able to offer that to them in 15,000 locations that are conveniently located.
As far as trading down, we're still not seeing a lot of trade down. There's not a lot of promotion out there in national brands. Private brands are about as steady as they were throughout the first half of the year. So it's -- we haven't seen a big shift right now from the customer."

So yes, there are still pressures, and it's market-driven both in our distribution centers. We've had to increase our hourly wages in our DCs and have done so, and that's embedded in our fourth quarter outlook, and we've made movements there. And I'd say we're seeing the same thing in our stores in markets we followed where we had to, to increase our labor rates to attract associates in our stores.
And as you've seen across retail, people are still sitting on the sidelines and not working. So we are working hard at driving benefits, and we're raising our hourly wage where we need to and being a convenient place to work through other things of -- having their schedule on their phones, having a program called DailyPay, where they can get their pay. They don't have to wait for their paycheck, and our associates are liking that a lot, and there's a high use of that. So we're doing a lot of things to attract the hourly work out there in our stores to operate our stores effectively. But yes, it still is a tough environment out there.
And we have seen a little bit of a slip in our store manager turnover where last year during the pandemic, we hit our lowest turnover ever in store manager. And now there's -- I think there's a little bit of fatigue and it's creeped up a little bit on us, but our teams are working hard at filling those roles and attracting the talent we need.
Regarding managing the $1.25, there is -- as Kevin said, in our fourth quarter, there will be onetime costs of cleansing the store and then remarketing and resigning the store. But once that is set aside, it's really running the same play. They unload the truck, they put it up on the shelf. It's clearly marked already. So there really isn't any additional labor hours needed.
And then on our Dollar Tree Plus, as we've rolled that out to 600 stores, we have not had to add any additional labor in those stores because the majority of those products are coming in pre-priced, the sections in the store are clearly marked $3 and $5 items, and now they'll be $1.25, $3 and $5. So there really isn't any additional labor needed in those stores either."

If I could squeeze in one more. Curious why not be more diverse with the price point? It sounds like you're really sticking to the $1.25. You could perhaps be even more precise with price points and manage to different SKUs and categories. So I'm curious kind of what went into that decision process? And am I interpreting, I guess, the strategy with the price point correctly in that regard?
And then bigger picture on that, is there an even longer-term vision of perhaps price points going up across the store and then you have a separate initiative with Plus at even higher price points and perhaps even melding these initiatives together, expanding Plus to even more of the store? Just I guess the longer-term vision would be interested to hear about as well."

So first of all, moving off the $1 price point gives us the flexibility to manage our business and really drive the assortment that our customers are used to and bring value and simplicity to them. So the reason we moved to the $1.25 is, it allows us to do all 3 of those things.
Our merchants are, I believe, the best in the industry, and they've been able to defend and get great product at $1. And we know the type of product we can get at that $1.25, and we'll be able to bring in exciting, great product that will drive the business and drive traffic into our stores and enable us to get back to that 35% to 36% margin. And it gives us the flexibility to manage our business going forward.
And it really brings simplicity. Simplicity is still very important to us as it's a single price point, our customers understand it and our shoppers, our customers and our associates understand it. So we'll manage this going forward. I think at first, we're going to go to $1.25, and then we'll be carrying that $1.25 into our Combo Stores as well. So our Combo Stores' baseline will be at $1.25 going forward, and it will be wrapped around that Dollar Tree brand and then have the great products at the Family Dollar on that side of the business as well. So moving off the $1 gives us the flexibility to make changes we need to, going into the future."
