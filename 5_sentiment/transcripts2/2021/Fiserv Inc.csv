We've now",1515,"Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. 2020 was unprecedented on many levels. We started the year strong. And after entering the pandemic, we continued investing heavily in technology, innovation, our client franchise and our people. 
We've now entered 2021 with tremendous momentum. Your company performed very well given the circumstances across a number of facets of our business. Our 22% sales growth for the year demonstrates that we're clearly winning in the client's office. 
We strengthened our client franchise, raising our client satisfaction scores across all measures. We invest in our people platform, resulting in top quartile engagement scores amongst companies in the Fortune 500. We made outstanding progress on integration. We accelerated and increased synergy execution while ramping our investment in innovative products and solutions. 
We delivered 12% adjusted earnings per share growth for the year, marking our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and we delivered record free cash flow. We are exiting the year stronger than we entered, and we're well positioned to capitalize on our momentum in 2021 and beyond. 
Let me provide a brief overview of our financial results in the quarter, and Bob will provide more detail later on the call. Total company internal revenue growth was 1%. That performance was led by our Merchant Acceptance segments, which was up 3%, a strong result in light of the global pandemic. 
Total company adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 420 basis points and adjusted earnings per share increased 16%. Free cash flow was again excellent, coming in at $1.1 billion in the quarter, bringing free cash flow for the full year to more than $3.6 billion. 
Our sales momentum remains quite strong. Fourth quarter sales were up 19%, with terrific results in our credit processing, merchant acquiring and account processing businesses. Sales for the full year were up an impressive 22%. The combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline into 2021 is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of Fiserv's offerings together with our integrated sales model is extremely well received in the client's office and bodes well for the future. 
Now I'd like to update you on how our leading digital-enabled merchant business is performing. Through Clover, a leading SMB platform, Carat, our enterprise omnichannel commerce solution and Clover Connect, our rich ISV solution set. 
We continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients. The momentum within the digital-enabled segments of the merchant business continues to be excellent. 
Clover's gross payment volume grew 25% to $34 billion in the quarter or $135 billion annualized. We continue to extend the breadth of services to Clover merchants with innovative solutions that enhance convenience, especially in the digital segment. 
For example, we recently introduced invoicing capabilities that allow Clover merchants, especially those in the services vertical, to build and collect payments from consumers electronically. 
Carat. So our continued growth with global e-commerce transactions up about 25% both in the quarter and for the full year. 
We saw our omnichannel transactions, such as order-ahead and pick-up in store, grow more than 125% year-over-year with some of our best-known quick service restaurant clients seeing excellent growth. We continue to capture market share winning 46 new enterprise-level e-comm clients in the fourth quarter, including digital acquiring for overstock.com and wingstop in North America. 
In Europe, we signed Total, one of the largest energy providers in the world to provide global digital payment acceptance services across more than 100 countries around the world. We also expanded employer relationships, delivering new products and services to key clients such as Lyft, where we are now powering disbursements to drivers. Clover Connect allows us to win new partnerships and drive growth in our partner Solutions business. 
In the fourth quarter, we signed 44 new ISV partners, bringing us to 176 new ISVs signed for the year. Those new partner relationships are driving strong results in active merchants, up 43% in Q4. And strong revenue growth in the ISV channel. 
For example, during the quarter, Fiserv signed a strategic partnership agreement with RFMS, the largest provider of software services for foreign installation professionals to provide omni-channel payment capabilities to their foreign customers. 
We also signed one of the largest providers of eye care products and technology to provide payment acceptance services to its more than 7,000 eye care professional customers. 
To further expand our value-added services for merchants, Fiserv and Citizens Financial Group have partnered to offer merchants a new suite of lending solutions at the point-of-sale through Citizens Pay, providing merchants with flexible payment options for customers to finance purchases at the point of sale. 
The program expands a partnership with citizens since 2015 to provide new financing options. And we expect it to drive adoption in the fast-growing buy now, pay later space. 
Moving to account processing business. We continue to expand the number of privileged relationships we have in our account processing business across financial institutions of all sizes and types. We signed 19 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 5 on the DNA platform, bringing the total to 60 for the year with 25 on DNA. 
I'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins. Service First, a commercial bank with more than $11 billion in assets, signed on for a full suite of Fiserv products including: core processing, card services and output solutions. 
Late Side Bank, a full-service bank with more than $2 billion in assets, signed-on core processing, along with a robust suite of solutions that includes CheckFree, debit card services and Zelle. I'm also pleased that just recently, Republic Bank has partnered with Fiserv for core processing plus a rich suite of digital and payment solutions. 
Republic, is a $5 billion asset, full-service retail and commercial bank that was voted the #1 Bank in America for Service by Forbes in 2020. 
All of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. They selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service. 
I'm also pleased to note that we signed 3 more de novo banks in the quarter. In our payment and network segment, we continue to see robust sales activity, including several notable card production and personalization wins. We gained a new agreement with Capital One to a tap on more than 1,500 ATMs to Fiserv's MoneyPass ATM network, while offering their customers access to thousands of additional surcharge-free ATMs across the country. And I'm pleased to note that we expanded our long-standing partnership with PayPal, signing a deal in the quarter to integrate PayPal as a bill payment option for 5 share billers, a notable synergy sale. 
With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. At Investor Day, we discussed how our integration continues to go extraordinary well and our synergy execution is far ahead of original schedule. Through December 31, we've already actioned over $1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to fully action at $1.2 billion cost synergies by the end of this year. 
We entered 2021 with the majority of the integration work behind us and a focus on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. 
On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the fourth quarter. As of year-end, we've already actioned $215 million in annualized revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly. Giving us confidence in meeting or exceeding $600 million target. 
Our bank merchant program continues to be one of the larger synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes and ability to offer their important merchant clients, a modern suite of merchant acquiring capabilities including the innovative Clover platform, along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-comm solutions. In the fourth quarter, we added 45 new bank merchant clients, bringing the total to 231 new clients since the merger, with more than half of those wins competitive takeaways. The pipeline into 2021 remains robust with over 500 financial institutions, prompting our continued confidence in achieving a sizable revenue synergy opportunity. 
One final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to Bob. As you've heard us discuss in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefine the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities across our payments ecosystem. 
We've taken 2 important steps in the last 60 days in this area. First, we acquired on.systems, it's the leading digital card services platform for financial institutions of all sizes. 
We're committed to deploying capital, both organically and inorganically, to develop the digital and data next generational solutions that will drive growth long into the future. 
And second, further demonstrating our commitment to leadership in this area, we appointed a Chief Digital and Data Officer to lead these important strategic growth initiatives across all of tier. 
Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on the financial results."
128209,701917266,2201005,"Fiserv, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe.

We had a strong fourth quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Total company internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter, led by the Merchant Accepted segment, which grew 3%. 
For the full year, internal revenue was flat versus last year, in line with our expectations that we communicated during our last earnings call. Growth from revenue synergies, which were $46 million in the quarter and $160 million for the year, helps mitigate the impact from continued pressure related to the pandemic. 
During our last earnings call, we shared that we saw transaction growth rates stabilize at or around July levels. In the fourth quarter, our transaction and payment growth rates remain relatively in line with what we saw in the third quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 10% to $1.3 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 420 basis points to 35.6%, driven by our rigorous cost synergy, execution was produced $177 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance. 
For the full year, adjusted operating income increased by 2% to $4.4 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased $170 basis points to 31.4%, benefiting from $581 million of incremental cost synergies in the year and excellent operational performance. 
The fact that we improved our margin by 170 basis points due to worst economic cycle in memory is a strong validation of the robust quality and resilience of our business. And since most of the cost actions in 2020 were focused on permanent synergy achievement, not short-term cost savings, we believe our adjusted operating margin improvements are sustainable and expect continued strong improvements in 2021 and beyond. 
Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $1.30 compared to $1.12 in the prior year, as adjusted for divestitures. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year increased 12% to $4.42, ahead of our prior expectations. Free cash flow in the quarter was once again very strong at $1.1 billion. 
For the full year, free cash flow increased 11% to more than $3.6 billion. Free cash flow conversion was also very strong at 119% for the fourth quarter and 121% for the full year. 
Turning to each of the segments. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 3% in the quarter, an impressive result given the headwinds faced from economy that was hampered by the pandemic. Our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio SMB clients, supported by our Clover platform, enterprise clients supported by our Carat and another strong quarter from our ISV business. 
For the full year, internal revenue is in line with the prior year. As Frank discussed, our Clover GPV continues to grow very nicely, up 25% in the quarter despite the difficult macroeconomic environment for SMBs. I we feel great about the strength of that portfolio in 2020 and even better about its performance in the months and quarters ahead as we get beyond the pandemic. 
Our integrated payments, or ISV business, continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we recently rolled out Clover Connect, a Clover integrated solution for ISVs. We believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for ISVs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. Adjusted operating income in the aerospace -- in the Acceptance segment increased 8% to $443 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was up 280 basis points in the quarter to 30.7% and increased 150 basis points sequentially. 
On our Q2 earnings call, after reporting our COVID impact at low point for our Acceptance financial results, we said the segment's adjusted operating margin was expected to improve by more than 800 basis points in the second half of 2020 compared to the first half. We're pleased to achieve that with our second half acceptance margin of nearly 1,000 basis points, bringing our full year margin to 25.4%. 
The Fintech segment. Internal revenue declined 1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year as growth in high-quality recurring revenue was again offset by much lower periodic revenue, most prominently termination fees. Which created approximately 350 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. 
For the full year, internal revenue was in line with the prior year. The shift towards digital banking took a strong step forward in 2020 with lockdowns leading consumers and businesses alike to consider new ways of banking, and we continue to see strong demand for a broad array of digital solutions as a result. For example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, mobility and architect, grew 15% in the quarter. 
Architect implementations continue at a strong pace. In fact, during the second half of the year, we completed more architect implementations than in all of 2019, an excellent indicator for future growth. 
Fiserv's offerings such as remote data capture, have allowed our FI clients to offer safe, convenient and fast self-service check deposits for their consumer and commercial clients, while improving efficiency in their own results. Mobile deposits in Q4 grew 33% over prior year and were up more than 30% for the full year, while self-service ATM deposits grew more than 50% in both the quarter and full year. 
Adjusted operating income was up a strong 14% in the quarter to $271 million and grew 12% in the full year to $992 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 590 basis points in the quarter to 36.5% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. 
For the year, adjusted operating margin was up an impressive 510 basis points to 34.2%. And as the benefits of growth in processing revenue in our highly scaled business and the combination of both synergy and productivity gains more than offset the impact from lower periodic revenue. 
The payments and network segment saw internal revenue declined 1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year as growth in our international issuer, card services and output solutions businesses including the benefit of revenue synergies, was more than offset by COVID-driven impacts elsewhere in this segment. 
Internal revenue for the year was in line with the prior year. Debit transactions continue to show very stable levels of growth in the mid-single-digit range. We've seen this consistent mid- to high-single-digit transaction growth since June. And remain confident that this level is sustainable going forward. 
We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions, such as account-to-account and P2P. Zelle transactions in the quarter more than double compared to prior year and were up 18% sequentially. The number of clients live on Zelle has grown significantly this year, nearly tripling our client count compared to a year ago, and we expect continued strong growth in 2021 and beyond. 
Adjusted operating income for the segment was strong, up 5% to $660 million in the quarter, and was up 6% to $2.4 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points to 46.4% in the quarter, was up 280 basis points to 43.3% for the year. The positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies drove our solid adjusted operating income results, both in the quarter and the full year. 
The adjusted corporate operating loss was $87 million in the fourth quarter and $404 million for the full year, a 5% improvement over last year. This improvement was driven by a combination of cost synergies and productivity as well as lower variable compensation, partially offset by incremental COVID costs. 
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.7% and 20.9% for the full year, down slightly from the prior year. For 2021, we expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. However, we do expect some variability in the rates by quarter, given different comparison points and the timing of discrete tax items. As such, we expect our Q1 2021 effective tax rate will be higher than Q1 last year. 
As previously communicated, our capital allocation priority for the second half of the year was to focus primarily on debt repayment. We repaid $740 million of debt in the quarter and $1.8 billion in the year. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares of stock for $200 million in the fourth quarter, bringing total capital allocated to share repurchase to $1.6 billion for the full year. We have 65.7 million shares authorized for repurchase as of December 31. 
In rounding out our top capital allocation priorities, as Frank mentioned earlier, in December, we announced the acquisition of the Ondot Systems and closed that acquisition in January. Total debt outstanding was $20.7 billion at December 31 and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA dropped to 3.6x. We are well on track to achieve our targeted leverage in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and some further debt repayment this year. 
As you heard us emphasize throughout our Investor Day in December, we are fully committed to our long-standing capital strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, organic investment in innovative solutions and high-value acquisitions like Ondot. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Frank."

We expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be 8% to 12% for the full year. This is modestly better at the bottom end of the range than our preliminary outlook we shared at our recent Investor Day. Given our current view of economic conditions,",688,"Thanks, Bob. We expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be 8% to 12% for the full year. This is modestly better at the bottom end of the range than our preliminary outlook we shared at our recent Investor Day. Given our current view of economic conditions, including the second stimulus in late December, and the prospect of a third stimulus package later this quarter, the significant growth rate acceleration relative to 2020 is driven by the multi-pronged impacts of our current expectations for an improving global economy. 
The overall continuing strength in our global merchant Business the cumulative impact of sales and implementation and continued achievement of in-year revenue synergies. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.30 to $5.50, which is above the range we provided at our Investor Day in December. The improvement is driven by the stronger exit rate from 2020 and the benefit of stimulus programs in the U.S. 
We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points. And free cash flow conversion will be greater than 108% for the year. Our internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth rate assumptions are grounded in our internal assumptions of when and how the economy will recover from the pandemic in 2021. The midpoint of our guidance generally assumes improvement of the pandemic and increased vaccinations throughout the first half of the year, leading to economic recovery in the second half. There are several factors that we believe will impact the quarterly cadence of the year-over-year growth rates, largely driven by lapping our 2020 performance, which included pre pandemic performance for much of the first quarter, the depth of the impact in Q2 and then the start of improvement in the second half. 
Quarterly results may vary, including rates that may fall outside of the full year guidance range both on the low and high end for a particular quarter. We expect Q1 to be our toughest comparison; and Q2, the most favorable comparison. Then see more normalized comparisons for the second half of the year. 
Throughout this past year, every Fiserv associate was challenged to work differently, to reimagine how we do our jobs to serve our clients, who in turn were learning how to serve their customers. Faced with these challenges, I'm proud of our results. Across a number of measures, 2020 was a successful year. Our client satisfaction scores improved measurably during a time when our clients needed us the most. We saw our employee engagement scores improve even as we executed against a complex integration and through a pandemic. 
We meaningfully increased our synergy targets and accelerated the time to achieve those targets and then regress the integration of First Data to the verge of completion in 2021. And at the end of the day, your company achieved its 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Among the most important initiatives your company undertook was the creation of our Forward Together plan to be a force for positive change in our communities. Our Forward Together plan is a 4-part commitment to support and empower underrepresented associates, business owners and not-for-profits. A pillar of our forward together plan, the back-to-business program was launched last summer. 
As part of back-to-business, we committed to invest $10 million to support black and minority-owned business owners and entrepreneurs. We are well into that monetary commitment and are now meaningfully increasing it to $50 million. 
As a further indication of our commitment to continued progress in this important initiative, we recently appointed a senior executive as Head of Corporate Social responsibility to lead these efforts for Fiserv as well as overseas sustainability efforts for the organization. 
Fiserv was once again named a world's most admired company for the eighth consecutive year with excellent scores in people management, social responsibility and a host of other categories. This is well-deserved recognition of the more than 40,000 hard-working and caring Fiserv associates around the world. I will close by thanking all of them. For working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders.

We don't give specific guidance by our individual segments, but let me try to give you a little bit of color to get you kind of directionally.

We don't give specific guidance by our individual segments, but let me try to give you a little bit of color to get you kind of directionally. Obviously, if you look at our Merchant Acceptance segment represents about 40% of the overall company revenue. We had given during Investor Day an expectation of mid-term or medium-term growth of about 9% to 12%. And we certainly expect in 2021 to be above even the high end of that. As we rebound/recover from what has certainly been a pretty difficult year and in particular, in second quarter of 2020. 
Frank laid out a little bit of some of the key assumptions that we've got in our overall revenue and EPS growth for that matter. And it certainly plays a key part in the improvement, accelerated growth in the merchant segment, things like having a large number of folks vaccinated, seeing some of the restrictions that are in place, particularly in Europe, but even across the United States being lifted and seeing a recovery -- a general economic recovery in the second half of the year. 
If you look at the Fintech segment, very much impacted this year by periodic revenue. We've seen that really across the year, in particular, in the second half of the year, but even a little bit in the first half and overall impact this year. 
As we look to 2021, we see some of that persisting in Q1 and a bit into the second quarter, but by the time we get to the second half of the year, we see that headwind subsiding such that we would expect the Fintech segment, which has medium-term outlook of about 4% to 6% to be in that range for the full year 2021. And we're not counting on a recovery or a rebound of periodic revenue termination fees. It's really that we lap the pretty significant decline we've had over the last several quarters, and it doesn't continue. And so we'll see benefit really in the second half of 2021. 
And then the final segment, the Payments segment, again, about the other 40% of the overall company. Medium-term guidance here was 5% to 8%. I would expect this segment to probably be at the upper end of that range in 2021. And as we see transaction growth improve kind of post-COVID, in particular, in our bill pay business, some of our prepaids. And of course, as you know, we have a leading position in retail private label. And as those retailers improve, again, particularly in the second half of the year, we'll see some improvement. 
And of course, you certainly heard us talk about some very significant wins in our issuer processing business in this segment. The very large ones that we talked about during the last earnings call really won't provide much lift in 2021. But there are quite a few below those top 3. It don't take quite as long to implement, and you'll see some of those come on into 2021, and again, provides some nice growth into that business into that segment. And the last driver of that business, I'd probably point to is Zelle. 
As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, nearly a tripling number of FIs on Zelle through Fiserv and not only do we see that continuing to grow, but also more and more consumers choosing a bank-centric P2P network and seeing more transaction volume. So that gives us some confidence that we'll be kind of in the upper end of the mid-term range of 5% to 8%. 
And the last thing I'd point, Lisa, is we're going to see some probably unique variation in the growth rates by quarter. Again, Frank talked a little bit about this in his prepared remarks. Q1, as you recall, in 2020, was essentially COVID-free for, call it, roughly 10 of the 13 weeks of the first quarter. And we had, had a very strong first quarter until COVID hit really at the latter part of March. And obviously, very significantly in so I would expect Q1 to not only be our lowest point in the quarter in terms of growth rate year-over-year, but actually probably be below the guidance range with a rebound and the opposite take place in the second quarter when you have much easier comps, will be on the -- above the upper end of our guidance range, such that by the time we exit the first half of the year, we're trading in that -- within the overall internal revenue growth and EPS guidance range on the first half basis and be set nicely for the second half."

And you heard us report very strong growth throughout the year in overall Clover volume. We'll obviously see that continue. 
But as a percent of the overall share of activity within the merchant segment, you won't necessarily see a big change overall. So the margin improvement really is driven by continued productivity, scale business benefit as well as synergy benefits."

I mean, you see Verizon packaging us in their offering now. So I'd like to take a broader perspective on the partnership, and then we could drop down to what we're doing with our bank partners. 
And because we have these privileged relationships in the core, the ability to brant feels very, very good and very strong. Will it have the same margin as a fabulous Carat offering, the answer would be no. But if you think about our ability to deliver and grow merchants throughout the country, it's very, very high and very powerful. In some of the cases, it's just penetrating their base. It gives them a new offering into their base. Our ability to do it digitally is much higher than it would have been 2 or 3 years ago. So completely accretive and is fundamentally our responsibility with our bank partners to do this, to bring them the possibility. And it's actually a revenue generator for them also. So from that perspective, it's good for our partnerships. It deepens it. We're building integrated stacks, that caused them to have a better relationship with their client also."

I mean, back to the question about bank partnerships and bank distributions, that's 1 avenue for us. So what we've seen is growth in all of those. And if you think about what's happened and the question one might ask is how has your business performed as it has? It's because of the fabulous client base we have, in general. And then secondarily, us having invested heavily before we got here, actually in '17, '18 and through '19, we had a good strong industry-leading growth rate through '19. And then the combination of the 2 companies allowed us to be able to grow all facets of this. And I would say, when you look at it, it's growth across all of it. Across SMB in every manner, shape and form. Across ISVs as we didn't have a big position, and we continue to grow that out, and that will continue that pipeline is strong.

But when you bring it inside to the company, our excitement and the founder's excitements are that we can do something much larger than they could have done on their own. And if you think about the Clover acquisition and what it turned into, there's great similarities. Of course, this is a much larger enterprise. We definitely increased our digital DNA inside the company.

Now if you go back to Investor Day, we had talked about the $500 million was in our outlook. That we had given you, but there was nothing on the top line for it and we're already spending it.

And now I'll turn the call over to Frank."

We started the year strong. And after entering the pandemic, we continued investing heavily in technology, innovation, our client franchise and our people.  We've now",1523,"Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. 2020 was unprecedented on many levels. We started the year strong. And after entering the pandemic, we continued investing heavily in technology, innovation, our client franchise and our people.  
We've now entered 2021 with tremendous momentum. Your company performed very well given the circumstances across a number of facets of our business. Our 22% sales growth for the year demonstrates that we're clearly winning in the client's office. We strengthened our client franchise, raising our client satisfaction scores across all measures. We invest in our people platform, resulting in top quartile engagement scores amongst companies in the Fortune 500.  
We made outstanding progress on integration. We accelerated and increased synergy execution while ramping our investment in innovative products and solutions. We delivered 12% adjusted earnings per share growth for the year, marking our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and we delivered record free cash flow. We are exiting the year stronger than we entered, and we're well positioned to capitalize on our momentum in 2021 and beyond.  
Let me provide a brief overview of our financial results in the quarter, and Bob will provide more detail later on the call. Total company internal revenue growth was 1%. That performance was led by our Merchant Acceptance segments, which was up 3%, a strong result in light of the global pandemic.  
Total company adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 420 basis points and adjusted earnings per share increased 16%. Free cash flow was again excellent, coming in at $1.1 billion in the quarter, bringing free cash flow for the full year to more than $3.6 billion.  
Our sales momentum remains quite strong. Fourth quarter sales were up 19%, with terrific results in our credit processing, merchant acquiring and account processing businesses. Sales for the full year were up an impressive 22%. The combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline into 2021 is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of Fiserv's offerings together with our integrated sales model is extremely well received in the client's office and bodes well for the future.  
Now I'd like to update you on how our leading digital-enabled merchant business is performing. Through Clover, our leading SMB platform; Carat, our enterprise omni-channel commerce solution; and Clover Connect, our rich ISV solution set, we continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients. The momentum within the digital-enabled segments of the merchant business continues to be excellent.  
Clover's gross payment volume grew 25% to $34 billion in the quarter or $135 billion annualized. We continue to extend the breadth of services to clover merchants with innovative solutions that enhance convenience, especially in the digital segment. For example, we recently introduced invoicing capabilities that allow Clover merchants, especially those in the services vertical, to build and collect payments from consumers electronically.  
Carat. So our continued growth with global e-commerce transaction is up about 25% both in the quarter and for the full year. We saw our omni-channel transactions, such as order-ahead and pick up in store, grow more than 125% year-over-year with some of our best-known quick service restaurant clients seeing excellent growth. We continue to capture market share winning 46 new enterprise-level e-comm clients in the fourth quarter, including digital acquiring for Overstock.com and Wingstop in North America.  
In Europe, we signed Total, one of the largest energy providers in the world to provide global digital payment acceptance services across more than 100 countries around the world. We also expanded employer relationships, delivering new products and services to key clients such as Lyft, where we are now powering disbursements to drivers. Clover Connect allows us to win new partnerships and drive growth in our partner solutions business.  
In the fourth quarter, we signed 44 new ISV partners, bringing us to 176 new ISVs signed for the year. Those new partner relationships are driving strong results in active merchants, up 43% in Q4. And strong revenue growth in the ISV channel. For example, during the quarter, Fiserv signed a strategic partnership agreement with RFMS, the largest provider of software services for floor installation professionals to provide omni-channel payment capabilities to their flooring customers.  We also signed one of the largest providers of eye care products and technology to provide payment acceptance services to its more than 7,000 eye care professional customers.  
To further expand our value-added services for merchants, Fiserv and Citizens Financial Group have partnered to offer merchants a new suite of lending solutions at the point-of-sale through Citizens Pay, providing merchants with flexible payment options for customers to finance purchases at the point of sale. The program expands a partnership we've had with Citizen since 2015 to provide new financing options. And we expect it to drive adoption in the fast-growing buy now, pay later space.  
Moving to account processing business. We continue to expand the number of privileged relationships we have in our account processing business across financial institutions of all sizes and types. We signed 19 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 5 on the DNA platform, bringing the total to 60 for the year with 25 on DNA.  
I'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins. Service First, a commercial bank with more than $11 billion in assets, signed on for a full suite of Fiserv products including core processing, card services and output solutions. Lakeside Bank, a full-service bank with more than $2 billion in assets, signed on for our core processing, along with a robust suite of solutions that includes CheckFree, debit card services and Zelle. I'm also pleased that just recently, Republic Bank has partnered with Fiserv for core processing plus a rich suite of digital and payment solutions.  Republic is a $5 billion asset, full-service retail and commercial bank that was voted the #1 Bank in America for Service by Forbes in 2020.  
All of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. They selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service.  
I'm also pleased to note that we signed 3 more de novo banks in the quarter. In our payment and network segment, we continue to see robust sales activity, including several notable card production and personalization wins. We gained a new agreement with Capital One to add Cap One's more than 1,500 ATMs to Fiserv's Money Pass ATM network, while offering their customers access to thousands of additional surcharge-free ATMs across the country. And I'm pleased to note that we expanded our long-standing partnership with PayPal, signing a deal in the quarter to integrate PayPal as a bill payment option for 5 share billers, a notable synergy sale.  
With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. At Investor Day, we discussed how our integration continues to go extraordinarily well and our synergy execution is far ahead of original schedule. Through December 31, we've already actioned over $1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to fully action a $1.2 billion cost synergies by the end of this year.  
We entered 2021 with the majority of the integration work behind us and a focus on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead.  
On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the fourth quarter. As of year-end, we've already actioned $215 million in annualized revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly. Giving us confidence in meeting or exceeding our $600 million target.  
Our bank merchant program continues to be one of the larger synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes and ability to offer their important merchant clients a modern suite of merchant acquiring capabilities including the innovative Clover platform, along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-comm solutions. In the fourth quarter, we added 45 new bank merchant clients, bringing the total to 231 new clients since the merger, with more than half of those wins competitive takeaways. The pipeline into 2021 remains robust with over 500 financial institutions, prompting our continued confidence in achieving a sizable revenue synergy opportunity.  
One final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to Bob. As you've heard us discuss in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefine the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities across our payments ecosystem.  
We've taken 2 important steps in the last 60 days in this area. First, we acquired Ondot Systems, the leading digital card services platform for financial institutions of all sizes. We're committed to deploying capital, both organically and inorganically, to develop the digital and data next generational solutions that will drive growth long into the future.  
And second, further demonstrating our commitment to leadership in this area, we appointed a Chief Digital and Data Officer to lead these important strategic growth initiatives across all of Fiserv. Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on the financial results."
128209,701917266,2201192,"Fiserv, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe.

We had a strong fourth quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Total company internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 3%.  
For the full year, internal revenue was flat versus last year, in line with our expectations that we communicated during our last earnings call. Growth from revenue synergies, which were $46 million in the quarter and $160 million for the year, helps mitigate the impact from continued pressure related to the pandemic.  
During our last earnings call, we shared that we saw transaction growth rates stabilize at or around July levels. In the fourth quarter, our transaction and payment volume growth rates remain relatively in line with what we saw in the third quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 10% to $1.3 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 420 basis points to 35.6%, driven by our rigorous cost synergy, execution, which produced $177 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance.  
For the full year, adjusted operating income increased by 2% to $4.4 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 31.4%, benefiting from $581 million of incremental cost synergies in the year and excellent operational performance.  
The fact that we improved our margin by 170 basis points to the worst economic cycle in memory is a strong validation of the robust quality and resilience of our business. And since most of the cost actions in 2020 were focused on permanent synergy achievement, not short-term cost savings, we believe our adjusted operating margin improvements are sustainable and expect continued strong improvements in 2021 and beyond.  
Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $1.30 compared to $1.12 in the prior year, as adjusted for divestitures. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year increased 12% to $4.42, ahead of our prior expectations. Free cash flow in the quarter was once again very strong at $1.1 billion. For the full year, free cash flow increased 11% to more than $3.6 billion. Free cash flow conversion was also very strong at 119% for the fourth quarter and 121% for the full year. 
Turning to each of the segments. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 3% in the quarter, an impressive result given the headwinds faced from economy that was hampered by the pandemic. Our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio SMB clients, supported by our Clover platform, enterprise clients supported by Carat and another strong quarter from our ISV business.  
For the full year, internal revenue is in line with the prior year. As Frank discussed, our Clover GPV continues to grow very nicely, up 25% in the quarter despite the difficult macroeconomic environment for SMBs. We feel great about the strength of that portfolio in 2020 and even better about its performance in the months and quarters ahead as we get beyond the pandemic.  
Our integrated payments, or ISV business, continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we recently rolled out Clover Connect, a Clover integrated solution for ISVs. We believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for ISVs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. Adjusted operating income in the aerospace -- excuse me, in the Acceptance segment increased 8% to $443 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was up 280 basis points in the quarter to 30.7% and increased 150 basis points sequentially.  
On our Q2 earnings call, after reporting our COVID impact at low point for our Acceptance financial results, we said the segment's adjusted operating margin was expected to improve by more than 800 basis points in the second half of 2020 compared to the first half. We're pleased to achieve that with our second half acceptance margin of nearly 1,000 basis points, bringing our full year margin to 25.4%.  
The Fintech segment internal revenue declined 1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year as growth in high-quality recurring revenue was again offset by much lower periodic revenue, most prominently, termination fees, which created approximately 350 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter.  
For the full year, internal revenue was in line with the prior year. The shift towards digital banking took a strong step forward in 2020 with lockdowns leading consumers and businesses alike to consider new ways of banking, and we continue to see strong demand for a broad array of digital solutions as a result. For example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, mobility and architect, grew 15% in the quarter.  
Architect implementations continue at a strong pace. In fact, during the second half of the year, we completed more architect implementations than in all of 2019, an excellent indicator for future growth.  
Fiserv offerings such as remote data capture, have allowed our FI clients to offer safe, convenient and fast self-service check deposits for their consumer and commercial clients, while improving efficiency in their own results. Mobile deposits in Q4 grew 33% over prior year and were up more than 30% for the full year, while self-service ATM deposits grew more than 50% in both the quarter and full year.  
Adjusted operating income was up a strong 14% in the quarter to $271 million and grew 12% in the full year to $992 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 590 basis points in the quarter to 36.5% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies.  
For the year, adjusted operating margin was up an impressive 510 basis points to 34.2%. And as the benefits of growth in processing revenue in our highly scaled business and the combination of both synergy and productivity gains more than offset the impact from lower periodic revenue.  
The payments and network segment saw internal revenue decline 1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year as growth in our international issuer, card services and output solutions businesses, including the benefit of revenue synergies, was more than offset by COVID-driven impacts elsewhere in this segment.  
Internal revenue for the year was in line with the prior year. Debit transactions continue to show very stable levels of growth in the mid-single-digit range. We've seen this consistent mid- to high-single-digit transaction growth since June. And remain confident that this level is sustainable going forward.  
We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions, such as account-to-account and P2P. Zelle transactions in the quarter more than doubled compared to prior year and were up 18% sequentially. The number of clients live on Zelle has grown significantly this year, nearly tripling our client count compared to a year ago, and we expect continued strong growth in 2021 and beyond. 
Adjusted operating income for the segment was strong, up 5% to $660 million in the quarter, and was up 6% to $2.4 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points to 46.4% in the quarter and was up 280 basis points to 43.3% for the year. The positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies drove our solid adjusted operating income results, both in the quarter and the full year. 
The adjusted corporate operating loss was $87 million in the fourth quarter and $404 million for the full year, a 5% improvement over last year. This improvement was driven by a combination of cost synergies and productivity as well as lower variable compensation, partially offset by incremental COVID costs. 
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.7% and 20.9% for the full year, down slightly from the prior year. For 2021, we expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. However, we do expect some variability in the rates by quarter, given different comparison points and the timing of discrete tax items. As such, we expect our Q1 2021 effective tax rate will be higher than Q1 last year. 
As previously communicated, our capital allocation priority for the second half of the year was to focus primarily on debt repayment. We repaid $740 million of debt in the quarter and $1.8 billion in the year. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares of stock for $200 million in the fourth quarter, bringing total capital allocated to share repurchase to $1.6 billion for the full year. We have 65.7 million shares authorized for repurchase as of December 31. 
In rounding out our top capital allocation priorities, as Frank mentioned earlier, in December, we announced the acquisition of the Ondot Systems and closed that acquisition in January. Total debt outstanding was $20.7 billion at December 31 and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA dropped to 3.6x. We are well on track to achieve our targeted leverage in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and some further debt repayment this year. 
As you heard us emphasize throughout our Investor Day in December, we are fully committed to our long-standing capital strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, organic investment in innovative solutions and high-value acquisitions like Ondot. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Frank."
128209,701917266,2201192,"Fiserv, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. We expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be 8% to 12% for the full year. This is modestly better at the bottom end of the range than our preliminary outlook we shared at our recent Investor Day. Given our current view of economic conditions,",688,"Thanks, Bob. We expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be 8% to 12% for the full year. This is modestly better at the bottom end of the range than our preliminary outlook we shared at our recent Investor Day. Given our current view of economic conditions, including the second stimulus in late December, and the prospect of a third stimulus package later this quarter, the significant growth rate acceleration relative to 2020 is driven by the multi-pronged impacts of our current expectations for an improving global economy, the overall continuing strength in our global Merchant Business, the cumulative impact of sales and implementation and continued achievement of in-year revenue synergies. 
We expect 2021 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.30 to $5.50, which is $0.05 above the range we provided at our Investor Day in December. The improvement is driven by the stronger exit rate from 2020 and the benefit of stimulus programs in the U.S. 
We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points. And free cash flow conversion will be greater than 108% for the year. Our internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth rate assumptions are grounded in our internal assumptions of when and how the economy will recover from the pandemic in 2021. The midpoint of our guidance generally assumes improvement of the pandemic and increased vaccinations throughout the first half of the year, leading to economic recovery in the second half. There are several factors that we believe will impact the quarterly cadence of the year-over-year growth rates, largely driven by lapping our 2020 performance, which included pre-pandemic performance for much of the first quarter, the depth of the impact in Q2 and then the start of improvement in the second half. 
Quarterly results may vary, including rates that may fall outside of the full year guidance range both on the low and high end for a particular quarter. We expect Q1 to be our toughest comparison and Q2, the most favorable comparison, then see more normalized comparisons for the second half of the year. 
Throughout this past year, every Fiserv associate was challenged to work differently, to reimagine how we do our jobs to serve our clients, who in turn were learning how to serve their customers. Faced with these challenges, I'm proud of our results. Across a number of measures, 2020 was a successful year. Our client satisfaction scores improved measurably during a time when our clients needed us the most. We saw our employee engagement scores improve even as we executed against a complex integration and through a pandemic. 
We meaningfully increased our synergy targets and accelerated the time to achieve those targets and then regress the integration of First Data to the verge of completion in 2021. And at the end of the day, your company achieved its 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. 
Among the most important initiatives your company undertook was the creation of our Forward Together plan to be a force for positive change in our communities. Our Forward Together plan is a 4-part commitment to support and empower underrepresented associates, business owners and not-for-profits. A pillar of our Forward Together plan, the Back2Business program was launched last summer. 
As part of Back2Business, we committed to invest $10 million to support black and minority-owned business owners and entrepreneurs. We are well into that monetary commitment and are now meaningfully increasing it to $50 million. 
As a further indication of our commitment to continued progress in this important initiative, we recently appointed a senior executive as Head of Corporate Social responsibility to lead these efforts for Fiserv as well as oversee sustainability efforts for the organization. 
Fiserv was once again named a world's most admired company for the eighth consecutive year with excellent scores in people management, social responsibility and a host of other categories. This is well-deserved recognition of the more than 40,000 hardworking and caring Fiserv associates around the world. I will close by thanking all of them, for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders.

We don't give specific guidance by our individual segments, but let me try to give you a little bit of color to get you, kind of, directionally. Obviously, if you look at our Merchant Acceptance segment, it represents about 40% of the overall company revenue. We had given during Investor Day an expectation of mid-term or medium-term growth of about 9% to 12%. And we certainly expect in 2021 to be above even the high end of that as we rebound/recover from what has certainly been a pretty difficult year and, in particular, in second quarter of 2020. 
Frank laid out a little bit of some of the key assumptions that we've got in our overall revenue and EPS growth for that matter. And it certainly plays a key part in the improvement, accelerated growth in the Merchant segment, things like having a large number of folks vaccinated, seeing some of the restrictions that are in place, particularly in Europe, but even across the United States, being lifted and seeing a recovery -- a general economic recovery in the second half of the year. 
If you look at the Fintech segment, very much impacted this year by periodic revenue. We've seen that really across the year, in particular, in the second half of the year, but even a little bit in the first half and overall impact this year. 
As we look to 2021, we see some of that persisting in Q1 and a bit into the second quarter. But by the time we get to the second half of the year, we see that headwind subsiding such that we would expect the Fintech segment, which has medium-term outlook of about 4% to 6%, to be in that range for the full year 2021. And we're not counting on a recovery or a rebound of a periodic revenue/termination fees. It's really that we lap the pretty significant decline we've had over the last several quarters, and it doesn't continue. And so we'll see benefit really in the second half of 2021. 
And then the final segment, the Payments segment, again, about the other 40% of the overall company. Medium-term guidance here was 5% to 8%. I would expect this segment to probably be at the upper end of that range in 2021,  as we see transaction growth improve kind of post-COVID, in particular, in our bill pay business, some of our prepaids and, of course, as you know, we have a leading position in retail private label. And as those retailers improve, again, particularly in the second half of the year, we'll see some improvement. 
And of course, you certainly heard us talk about some very significant wins in our issuer processing business in this segment. The very large ones that we talked about during the last earnings call really won't provide much lift in 2021. But there are quite a few below those top 3. It don't take quite as long to implement, and you'll see some of those come on into 2021, and again, provide some nice growth into that business, into that segment. And the last driver of that business, I'd probably point to is Zelle. 
As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, nearly a tripling number of FIs on Zelle through Fiserv and not only do we see that continuing to grow, but also more and more consumers choosing a bank-centric P2P network and seeing more transaction volume. So that gives us some confidence that we'll be kind of in the upper end of the mid-term range of 5% to 8%. 
And the last thing I'd point, Lisa, is we're going to see some probably unique variation in the growth rates by quarter. Again, Frank talked a little bit about this in his prepared remarks. Q1, as you recall, in 2020, was essentially COVID-free for, call it, roughly 10 of the 13 weeks of the first quarter. And we had, had a very strong first quarter until COVID hit really at the latter part of March and, obviously, very significantly in Q2. So I would expect Q1 to not only be our lowest point in the quarter in terms of growth rate year-over-year, but actually probably be below the guidance range with a rebound and the opposite take place in the second quarter when you have much easier comps, will be on the -- above the upper end of our guidance range. Such that by the time we exit the first half of the year, we're trading in that -- within the overall internal revenue growth and EPS guidance range on the first half basis and be set nicely for the second half."

Certainly, the thing to consider though is that was a big element of the growth in 2020. And so you don't necessarily see a massive acceleration of that because that was actually one of the things that helped the overall growth rate of the Merchant segment. As small businesses and retail broadly shut down again, particularly in the second quarter, people moved to tech-enabled e-commerce type transactions. And you heard us report very strong growth throughout the year in overall Clover volume. We'll obviously see that continue. 
But as a percent of the overall share of activity within the Merchant segment, you won't necessarily see a big change overall. So the margin improvement really is driven by continued productivity, scale business benefit as well as synergy benefits."

So these are contact points where, in fact, they're touching SMBs, and they think they'll enhance their relationship with the SMB through a Clover offering. I mean you see Verizon packaging us in their offering now. So I'd like to take a broader perspective on the partnership, and then we could drop down to what we're doing with our bank partners. 
And because we have these privileged relationships in the core, the ability to brand feels very, very good and very strong. Will it have the same margin as our fabulous Carat offering? The answer would be no. But if you think about our ability to deliver and grow merchants throughout the country, it's very, very high and very powerful. In some of the cases, it's just penetrating their base. It gives them a new offering into their base. 
Our ability to do it digitally is much higher than it would have been 2 or 3 years ago. So completely accretive and is fundamentally our responsibility with our bank partners to do this, to bring them the possibility. And it's actually a revenue generator for them also. So from that perspective, it's good for our partnerships. It deepens it. We're building integrated stacks that caused them to have a better relationship with their client also."

I mean back to the question about bank partnerships and bank distributions, that's 1 avenue for us. So what we've seen is growth in all of those. And if you think about what's happened and the question one might ask is how has your business performed as it has. It's because of the fabulous client base we have in general. And then secondarily, us having invested heavily before we got here, actually in '17, '18 and through '19, we had a good strong industry-leading growth rate through '19. 
And then the combination of the 2 companies allowed us to be able to grow all facets of this. And I would say, when you look at it, it's growth across all of it: Across SMB in every manner, shape and form; across ISVs as we didn't have a big position, and we continue to grow that out, and that will continue, that pipeline is strong; and then bringing us into really Carat offering to our large institutional clients.

I think we always view it as the leading card-enablement platform for virtual access. 
But when you bring it inside to the company, our excitement and the founder's excitement are that we can do something much larger than they could have done on their own. And if you think about the Clover acquisition and what it turned into, there's great similarities. Of course, this is a much larger enterprise. We definitely increased our digital DNA inside the company. It will be a complement to our Sunnyvale -- large Sunnyvale presence with Clover and then with us sitting up a Chief Digital and Data Officer, the ability to ultimately take debit, credit, core banking and give our financial institutions the opportunity to have one click for their clients to get to all of that data is really where we're taking it.

Of course, we already have begun that, and begin to do it in a way that will accelerate growth as we go forward. 
Now if you go back to Investor Day, we had talked about the $500 million was in our outlook that we had given you. But there was nothing on the top line for it and we're already spending it. 
So I think what you can find today is a set of initiatives, a series of projects being deployed, a structure built inside the company with a Chief Digital and Data Officer to be able to help it move forward in a manner that is across the whole company. And so I would think as we get into the second half of this year and you move into next year, you'll start seeing these digital and data initiatives, which ultimately will roll into the P&L on the top.

You may have noticed that Q1 earnings presentation has been updated. If you're going along, I will provide some overview comments captured on the first 3 pages, and then Bob will provide more detail on the subsequent slides. 
Total company internal revenue growth was 4% for the quarter, including low double-digit growth in March. That performance was led by our Merchant Acceptance segment, which was up 8%, an exceptional result in light of the global pandemic and continued COVID restrictions, particularly in Brazil, India and a variety of countries in EMEA for much of the quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin grew 360 basis points resulting in an 18% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Free cash flow grew 8% to $821 million, a 103% conversion to adjusted net income. Our sales momentum remains quite strong as first quarter sales were up 42% with strong results in our payments and international businesses, and this momentum continues into the second quarter. Yesterday, we announced a 20-year agreement with Pasha Economics Federal to become the exclusive provider of merchant acquiring services. Pasha is one of Brazil's largest banks with more than 26,000 sales outlets and a broad presence throughout all of Brazil, making this one of the largest wins for our company in Latin America and one of the largest globally. Also this morning, we announced a new solution with PayPal to enable our merchant network across the global and Carat platforms to accept payments via PayPal and Venmo through QR codes presented at the point of sale. We believe this is an important offering for our merchants as consumer preferences continue to shift towards touch-free transactions. 
The combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of Fiserv's offerings, together with our integrated sales model, is extremely well received in the client's office and we believe bodes well for the future. 
Now I'd like to update you on how our leading digital-enabled Merchant business is performing. Through Clover, our leading SMB platform; Carat, our enterprise omnichannel commerce solution; and Clover Connect, a rich ISV solution set, we continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients. The momentum within the digital-enabled segments of the Merchant business continues to be excellent. 
Clover's gross payment volume grew 36% year-over-year to $141 billion annualized. To provide some more context around the strength of the Clover platform, GEV has grown 75% from $81 billion in Q1 to 2019 -- in Q1 to $141 billion in Q1 this year despite the economic headwinds from the pandemic. 
Carat, our enterprise omnichannel solution, continue to perform very well. E-commerce transactions grew 24% compared to the prior year. Omnichannel transactions, such as order ahead and pick up in store, were up over 122% year-over-year. We won a record 51 new enterprise level e-commerce clients in the first quarter, including Cost Plus World Market, a U.S. specialty retailer, who Fiserv has been chosen to provide e-commerce gateway, point-of-sale hardware devices and value-added services like security tokenization. 
We had a very strong results for sales internationally. The notable wins in EMEA include Selecta, Europe's leading self-service retailer, operating coffee and convenience food solutions, through Fiserv has been chosen to provide acquiring services in unattended POS hardware. And what you have, we extended our relationship with one of the largest e-commerce marketplaces in the region. In APAC, we won the Merchant Acquired business for Australia's second largest bill payment provider. 
We also expanded our relationship with key brands such as State Farm where we are piloting a new digital payout experience through insurance claims. Recognizing our innovation to bring digital payments to all consumers, Fiserv was named one of the world's most innovative companies by Fast Company for our role in enabling the Acceptance of U.S. Department of Agriculture's Snap Online EBT payments during the pandemic. 
We continue to see great momentum in the ISV space with Clover Connect. In the first quarter, we signed 42 new ISV partners. Our continued strength in expanding partner relationships is driving strong results in active merchants, which were up 38% in Q1 and ISV revenue channel growth, which was up 34%. For example, during the quarter, Fiserv further cemented its leads in the mortgage servicing software vertical by signing a strategic partnership agreement with Mortgage Cadence, an Accenture company, which provides lower origination software for the mortgage industry. This is yet another example of a successful integrated sale continuing to fuel future growth in our ISV channel. 
Additionally, we are continuing to build and enhance our existing ISV relationships by leveraging our technology and market knowledge. In the quarter, we finalized an agreement with Etail Pet to move their large set of existing merchants to us and build upon the agreement we had in place for new merchants. 
Moving to our account processing business, we continue to expand our number of privileged relationships across financial institutions of all sizes and types. We signed 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 5 on the DNA platform. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we signed Republic First Bank, a commercial bank with more than $5 billion in assets and rated America's Best Bank by Forbes, for a full-service of Fiserv products, including core processing, card services and output solutions in February. 
Additionally, we signed 2 de novo banks in the quarter, including Genesis Bank, a newly chartered bank focused as a minority depository institution. This win continues to show our commitment to supporting minority communities. A majority of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. The client selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service. These wins also reflect the strength of our offering for a wide range of clients, from de novo banks to large financial institutions. 
In our Payment and Network segment, we continue to leverage the power of our combined solutions to drive revenue synergies. In Q1, we signed a significant new agreement to provide statement and letter services to a major U.S. health care services provider, strengthening our position in this industry vertical. Further building on our digital momentum, in Q1, we signed agreements to provide digital solutions to First Horizon Bank as well as Penfed Credit unit, in both cases, leveraging our newly acquired Ondot capabilities. Through Ondot, we can enable our FI clients to offer their cardholders personalized, realtime, digital experiences, driving cardholder engagement and spend. We expect continued adoption of these digital solutions across our client base. 
With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. Through Q1, we've already actioned nearly $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to deploy actional $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. With the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. 
On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the first quarter. As of the end of Q1, we've already actioned $265 million in annual revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly and we expect to meet or exceed a $600 million target over the 5 years post-merger. 
Our bank merchant program continues to be a synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes of the ability to offer their important merchant clients a modern suite of merchant-acquiring capabilities, including the innovative Clover platform, along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-commerce solutions. 
In the first quarter, we added 34 new bank merchant clients, 6 with assets over $1 billion. Additionally, half of these wins were competitive takeaways. The pipeline remains robust for the rest of 2021. 
One final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to Bob. As you've heard us discuss in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefine the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities to cross-sell payments ecosystem. An example of our commitment to this area is the acquisition of Ondot Systems, a leading digital experience platform provider for financial institutions of all sizes, which closed in the first quarter. We also acquired Radius A, a cloud-based platform that adds hyperlocalized commerce capabilities to Carat, thereby enhancing out beyond our Beyond the [indiscernible] strategy. 
Last but not least, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Pineapple Payments, a leading ISO focused on integrated payments. 
Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results."

If you're following along on our new slides, I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. We had a strong first quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Q1 represents the f",1033,"Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our new slides, I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. We had a strong first quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Q1 represents the final period of prepandemic comparison points with the impact beginning to materialize in the final 2 weeks of March last year. Total company internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 8%. First quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 360 basis points to 31.4%. This margin improvement was driven by our rigorous cost synergy execution, which produced $129 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance. 
First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $1.17 compared to $0.99 in the prior year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $821 million, up 8% over Q1 last year and a 103% conversion to adjusted net income. Impacting Q1's free cash flow was an increase in accounts receivable, driven by a strong revenue rebound in March. 
Turning to each of the segments. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 8% in the quarter. Our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio of SMB clients, supported by our Clover platform; enterprise clients, supported by Carrot; and another strong quarter from our ISV business. This result includes a meaningful headwind from our EMEA region, which experienced restrictions for much of the quarter in several important markets for us, including the U.K., Germany, Ireland and Poland. 
As Frank discussed, our Clover GPV continues to grow very nicely, up 36% in the quarter. The outlook for the SMB business looks strong as the sequential uplift that we witnessed in this business in the last few weeks of March has continued through April. 
Our integrated payments, or ISV business, continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we recently rolled out Clover Connect, a Clover-integrated solution for ISVs. we believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for ISVs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. 
Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 37% to $387 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 650 basis points to 27.7%, driven by the strength in the top line and continued cost synergies. 
The Fintech segment internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter compared to the prior year. As growth in high-quality recurring revenue was again partially offset by lower periodic revenue, most prominently termination fees, which created approximately 150 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. The shift towards digital banking and the result in strong demand for our broad array of digital solutions continues. For example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, mobility and architect grew 12% in the quarter. Mobile deposits in Q1 grew 30% over the prior year while self-service ATM deposits grew 65% over last year. We expect these trends to continue as users who have moved to mobile or ATM for check deposits may adopt these as preferred channels after experiencing their convenience and safety. 
Adjusted operating income was up a strong 21% in the quarter to $246 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 510 basis points in the quarter to 33.4% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. 
The Payments and Network segment saw internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter as growth in our card services, output solutions, Zelle and prepaid businesses, including the benefit from revenue synergies, was partially offset by headwinds in our Bill Pay and Credit businesses. 
Debit transactions grew a strong 16% year-over-year, slightly ahead of levels last quarter. We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions, such as our account transfers and P2P. Both Zelle transactions and the number of clients live on Zelle more than doubled in the quarter versus a year ago. 
Our Bill Pay and Credit businesses,  in particular, given our retail private label mix, saw headwinds from the pandemic that we expect to subside as we reach the second half of the year with better economic activity and better revenue comparisons. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 2% to $585 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points to 41.4% in the quarter. The results were driven by a positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies, in part offset by the lower revenue in our higher-margin credit processing and Bill Pay businesses. 
The adjusted corporate operating loss was $102 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.2%, flat versus prior year. We also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5.2 million shares for $612 million, and we have more than 16 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. In addition, as Frank mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Ondot Systems in January and increased our investment related to the Tegra 118, our former Investment Services business in connection with its combination with Wealthtech Holdings. 
Total debt outstanding was $21.2 billion at March 31, and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remained at 3.6x. We are on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3x in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and debt repayment this year. 
As you heard us emphasize throughout our Investor Day in December, we're fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment in innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions like Ondot, Radius 8 and Pineapple Payments. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Frank."

Given our strong Q1 performance and an improved economic outlook, we are raising the low end of our outlook range for both internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth. We now expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be in the 9% to 12% range versus 8% to 12% previously. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the $5.35 to $5.50 range, which is a 21% to 24% growth over last year. This is up $0.05 at the bottom end from our prior outlook. 
We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points and free cash flow conversion to be greater than 108% for the year. The group range for internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth outlook are grounded in our performance to date. The current state of the economy and our internal assumptions about the trajectory of economic recovery, both of which have improved versus February when we provided our prior outlook. To remind you, the low end of our original outlook in February assumed no material economic recovery from where we were at that time. Similarly, the 9% at the low end of our updated outlook assumes the same, no material economic recovery for the remainder of the year. 
Regionally, we are seeing good economic progress in the U.S., driven both by government stimulus as well as COVID vaccine distribution with uneven recovery outside the U.S. as more pronounced COVID impacts persisted in parts of EMEA, LatAm and APAC. As we indicated during our last earnings call, given the timing of the pandemic impact last year, we expect more variability in quarterly growth in 2021. Given difficult comparisons, we expected Q1 performance to be below our full year outlook range and it was. We expect Q2 growth rates will be above the full year outlook range, driven by our business momentum and an easier year ago comparison. 
I'm proud of the results we've delivered as we navigate the ongoing global crisis. Our business has shown incredible strength and resilience leading to what we expect to be a 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2021 and setting a foundation for even stronger results beyond. 
In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our communities. During the quarter, we successfully completed a Back2Business grant program in the original 6 locations that were selected in 2020. We also held 2 additional programs in Milwaukee, partnering with the Milwaukee Bucks to celebrate Black History Month, and in March, a second event, partnering with the books and Nancy Lieberman during Women's History Month to award additional grants to minority-, women-owned small businesses. 
Last, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and to review our shareholders.

We did see a strong March. We saw a weaker February in the U.S. I'd create a fair amount of that to weather that you store going on with sort of stronger March. But I think on top of that, we saw more lockdowns in EMEA and Brazil as I had talked about previously, although hampered tremendously by COVID still had spending going on. And I'd say as we come into April and as we're kind of head to the end of it, we see the progression in the U.S. Obviously, India is a challenged environment in total right now. EMEA is beginning to open up. And Brazil continues to perform and why we take the bottom-up from 8 to 9 there if that's helpful to you."

If I recall, prior to the merger with Fiserv, this was an area First Data had invested really heavily in, in building the online sales channel so a Merchant could apply, get approved instantly by their Clover's directly. And I realized we haven't heard a lot about this too much in the last year or 2. So I was just wondering at the time, that was a major differentiator for your platform compared to your large competitors. Could you just update us on how widely this channel has been deployed and how significant of a factor it is in Clover sales?"

When you look at the totality of our business globally, I would still put it in the not meaningful in total category, but a channel which continues to accelerate its growth and one that we believe we will deliver more integrated opportunities for digital sign up. And when you think about the thing we will do longer term with our bank partner is having a one of a kind digital experience for that bank merchant partner while continuing to work with Paychecks and the Verizons also and using our direct channel to digitally sign up. So I think it will be part of the 5-year journey we talked about. It's not the overwhelming part of our sign up machine. But our capability is huge and our ability to attract new partners because of that digital capability and sign up merchants has been contributing to the growth rate."

But there, we fit it together with Clover and began that journey and we see that. You well know how probably people thought were in e-com lagger, and we continue to win in that space. 
Now in some of these cases, it's new markets. But in many cases, it's taking it from all the places you would suspect. And I would look at us saying, ""Hey, if you go through the hundreds of bank merchant wins we've talked about, fundamentally, those are 50% takeaways.

The other half -- excuse me, half a month, the other half the month was a pretty severe shutdown as -- particularly in the U.S. but also in Europe. People really significantly went home, and e-commerce really took a hit in 2nd half of March last year. So you see the year-over-year comp get significantly better in those last 2 weeks. If you just look at kind of the raw transactions, January started out the year, the quarter strong. February, as Frank mentioned, we saw some weather particularly in the South and the U.S. slow things down a bit, and then March came back quite a bit stronger. If you can adjust for weather, I would say January started out nice. February, again, adjusted for weather, was again in line or good with January. And then we started seeing things really pick up in March. I'm sure not coincidentally in help supported by the 3 payments that started flowing out, and we've seen that continue into April. So we're definitely feeling the recovery of the pandemic. As vaccines really spread in the U.S., we're seeing more and more commerce, retail picking up. Restaurants starting to pick up, still down year-over-year in a meaningful way, but starting to improve sequentially pretty nicely."

Andrew, as you point out, we saw some very nice KPIs support in the overall payments business, Zelle, with both the number of transactions and number of users doubling, certainly supports debit processing as well as the debit network performing quite well. We continue to love the acquisition of Ondot and our ability to provide additional digital services for card controls and card activation to our overall channel. We see that as a significant growth opportunity, not only to obviously provide that particular capability, but that as an overall part of our solution. We certainly have the benefit of some of the significant wins in the credit issuing business that we talked about over the last couple of quarters beginning to ramp late 2021 and into 2022. The 2% growth in the Payments segment in the first quarter here is not an indication of where we see the opportunity for the full year. There's some definite headwinds there from the pandemic that we expect to subside. And I think we said this at the end of last earnings call, but I still believe it today, we expect the payments segment for the full year to be at the upper end of the medium-term outlook for internal revenue growth. So we believe 2022, '23, that Payment segment can grow 5% to 8% and we think this year, we'll be at the upper end of that as we head into the second half of the year, and then we see the full year result. So we think we're in a great spot. We'll see some continued growth, particularly in our digital side of the payments.

Great to have you on the team. 2021 is off to a strong start, with Q1 at or better than our expectations across a broad range of metrics. The strength of our results reflects our continued investment in technology, innovation, our client portfolio and our people through the COVID-19 pandemic. Let me provide a brief overview of our strong financial results in the quarter. 
You may have noticed our Q1 earnings presentation has been updated. If you're following along, I will provide some overview comments captured on the first 3 pages, and then Bob will provide more detail on the subsequent slides. 
Total company internal revenue growth was 4% for the quarter, including low double-digit growth in March. That performance was led by our Merchant Acceptance segment, which was up 8%, an exceptional result in light of the global pandemic and continued COVID restrictions, particularly in Brazil, India and a variety of countries in EMEA for much of the quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin grew 360 basis points, resulting in an 18% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Free cash flow grew 8% to $821 million, a 103% conversion to adjusted net income. Our sales momentum remains quite strong as first quarter sales were up 42%, with strong results in our payments and international businesses. And this momentum continues into the second quarter. 
Yesterday, we announced a 20-year agreement with Caixa Econômica Federal to become the exclusive provider of merchant acquiring services. Caixa is one of Brazil's largest banks with more than 26,000 sales outlets and a broad presence throughout all of Brazil, making this one of the largest wins for our company in Latin America and one of the largest globally. 
Also this morning, we announced a new solution with PayPal to enable our merchant network across the Clover and Carat platforms to accept payments via PayPal and Venmo through QR codes presented at the point of sale. We believe this is an important offering for our merchants as consumer preferences continue to shift towards touch-free transactions. 
The combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of Fiserv's offerings, together with our integrated sales model, is extremely well received in the client's office and we believe bodes well for the future. 
Now I'd like to update you on how our leading digital-enabled merchant business is performing. Through Clover, our leading SMB platform; Carat, our enterprise omnichannel commerce solution; and Clover Connect, our rich ISV solution set, we continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients. The momentum within the digital-enabled segments of the merchant business continues to be excellent. 
Clover's gross payment volume grew 36% year-over-year to $141 billion annualized. To provide some more context around the strength of the Clover platform, GPV has grown 75% from $81 billion in Q1 to 2019 -- in Q1 to $141 billion in Q1 this year despite the economic headwinds from the pandemic. 
Carat, our enterprise omnichannel solution, continued to perform very well. E-commerce transactions grew 24% compared to the prior year. Omnichannel transactions, such as order ahead and pick up in store, were up over 122% year-over-year. We won a record 51 new enterprise level e-commerce clients in the first quarter, including Cost Plus World Market, a U.S. specialty retailer, for which Fiserv has been chosen to provide e-commerce gateway, point-of-sale hardware devices and value-added services like security tokenization. 
We had a very strong results for sales internationally. The notable wins in EMEA include Selecta, Europe's leading self-service retailer, offering coffee and convenience food solutions, for which Fiserv has been chosen to provide acquiring services in unattended POS hardware. And once again, we extended our relationship with one of the largest e-commerce marketplaces in the region. In APAC, we won the merchant acquiring business for Australia's second largest bill payment provider. 
We also expanded our relationship with key brands such as State Farm, where we are piloting a new digital payout experience for insurance claims. Recognizing our innovation to bring digital payments to all consumers, Fiserv was named one of the world's most innovative companies by Fast Company for our role in enabling the acceptance of U.S. Department of Agriculture's SNAP Online EBT payments during the pandemic. 
We continue to see great momentum in the ISV space with Clover Connect. In the first quarter, we signed 42 new ISV partners. Our continued strength in expanding partner relationships is driving strong results in active merchants, which were up 38% in Q1 and ISV revenue channel growth, which was up 34%. 
For example, during the quarter, Fiserv further cemented its leads in the mortgage servicing software vertical by signing a strategic partnership agreement with Mortgage Cadence, an Accenture company, which provides loan origination software for the mortgage industry. This is yet another example of a successful integrated sale continuing to fuel future growth in our ISV channel. 
Additionally, we are continuing to build and enhance our existing ISV relationships by leveraging our technology and market knowledge. In the quarter, we finalized an agreement with eTailPet to move their large set of existing merchants to us and build upon the agreement we had in place for new merchants. 
Moving to our account processing business, we continue to expand our number of privileged relationships across financial institutions of all sizes and types. We signed 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 5 on the DNA platform. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins. 
As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we signed Republic First Bank, a commercial bank with more than $5 billion in assets and rated America's Best Bank by Forbes, for a full-service of Fiserv products, including core processing, card services and output solutions in February. Additionally, we signed 2 de novo banks in the quarter, including Genesis Bank, a newly chartered bank focused as a minority depository institution. This win continues to show our commitment to supporting minority communities. 
A majority of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. The client selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service. These wins also reflect the strength of our offering for a wide range of clients, from de novo banks to large financial institutions. 
In our Payment and Network segment, we continue to leverage the power of our combined solutions to drive revenue synergies. In Q1, we signed a significant new agreement to provide statement and letter services to a major U.S. health care services provider, strengthening our position in this industry vertical. 
Further building on our digital momentum, in Q1, we signed agreements to provide digital solutions to First Horizon Bank as well as PenFed Credit Union, in both cases, leveraging our newly acquired Ondot capabilities. Through Ondot, we can enable our FI clients to offer their cardholders personalized, real time, digital experiences, driving cardholder engagement and spend. We expect continued adoption of these digital solutions across our client base. 
With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. Through Q1, we've already actioned nearly $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to deploying action of $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. With the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. 
On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the first quarter. As of the end of Q1, we've already actioned $265 million in annual revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly and we expect to meet or exceed our $600 million target over the 5 years post-merger. 
Our bank merchant program continues to be a synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes the ability to offer their important merchant clients a modern suite of merchant-acquiring capabilities, including the innovative Clover platform, along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-commerce solutions. In the first quarter, we added 34 new bank merchant clients, 6 with assets over $1 billion. Additionally, half of these wins were competitive takeaways. The pipeline remains robust for the rest of 2021. 
One final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to Bob. As you've heard us discuss in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefine the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities across our payments ecosystem. 
An example of our commitment to this area is the acquisition of Ondot Systems, a leading digital experience platform provider for financial institutions of all sizes, which closed in the first quarter. We also acquired Radius8, a cloud-based platform that adds hyperlocalized commerce capabilities to Carat, thereby enhancing our beyond the buy button strategy. Last but not least, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Pineapple Payments, a leading ISO focused on integrated payments. 
Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results."
128209,710591097,2259130,"Fiserv, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our new slides, I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. We had a strong first quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Q1 represents the f",1031,"Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our new slides, I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. We had a strong first quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Q1 represents the final period of pre-pandemic comparison points with the impact beginning to materialize in the final 2 weeks of March last year. 
Total company internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 8%. First quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 360 basis points to 31.4%. This margin improvement was driven by our rigorous cost synergy execution, which produced $129 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance. 
First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $1.17 compared to $0.99 in the prior year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $821 million, up 8% over Q1 last year and a 103% conversion to adjusted net income. Impacting Q1's free cash flow was an increase in accounts receivable, driven by a strong revenue rebound in March. 
Turning to each of the segments. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 8% in the quarter. Our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio of SMB clients, supported by our Clover platform, enterprise clients, supported by Carat and another strong quarter from our ISV business. This result includes a meaningful headwind from our EMEA region, which experienced restrictions for much of the quarter in several important markets for us, including the U.K., Germany, Ireland and Poland. 
As Frank discussed, our Clover GPV continues to grow very nicely, up 36% in the quarter. The outlook for the SMB business looks strong as the sequential uplift that we witnessed in this business in the last few weeks of March has continued through April. Our integrated payments or ISV business continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. 
As we discussed at our Investor Day, we recently rolled out Clover Connect, a Clover-integrated solution for ISVs. We believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for ISVs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. 
Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 37% to $387 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 650 basis points to 27.7%, driven by the strength in the top line and continued cost synergies. 
The Fintech segment internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter compared to the prior year as growth in high-quality recurring revenue was again partially offset by lower periodic revenue, most prominently termination fees, which created approximately 150 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. 
The shift towards digital banking and the result in strong demand for our broad array of digital solutions continues. For example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobiliti and Architect grew 12% in the quarter. Mobile deposits in Q1 grew 30% over the prior year while self-service ATM deposits grew 65% over last year. We expect these trends to continue as users who have moved to mobile or ATM for check deposits may adopt these as preferred channels after experiencing their convenience and safety. 
Adjusted operating income was up a strong 21% in the quarter to $246 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 510 basis points in the quarter to 33.4% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. 
The Payments and Network segment saw internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter as growth in our card services, output solutions, Zelle and prepaid businesses, including the benefit from revenue synergies, was partially offset by headwinds in our Bill Pay and Credit businesses. 
Debit transactions grew a strong 16% year-over-year, slightly ahead of levels last quarter. We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions such as our account transfers and P2P. Both Zelle transactions and the number of clients live on Zelle more than doubled in the quarter versus a year ago. 
Our bill pay and credit businesses, in particular, given our retail private label mix, saw headwinds from the pandemic that we expect to subside as we reach the second half of the year with better economic activity and better revenue comparisons. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 2% to $585 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points to 41.4% in the quarter. The results were driven by a positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies, in part offset by the lower revenue in our higher-margin credit processing and bill pay businesses. 
The adjusted corporate operating loss was $102 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.2%, flat versus prior year. We also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5.2 million shares for $612 million, and we have more than 16 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. In addition, as Frank mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Ondot Systems in January and increased our investment related to the Tegra118, our former Investment Services business in connection with its combination with Wealthtech Holdings. 
Total debt outstanding was $21.2 billion at March 31, and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remained at 3.6x. We are on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3x in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and debt repayment this year. 
As you heard us emphasize throughout our Investor Day in December, we're fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment in innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions like Ondot, Radius8 and Pineapple Payments. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment.
With that, let me turn the call back to Frank."

Given our strong Q1 performance and an improved economic outlook, we are raising the low end of our outlook range for both internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth. We now expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be in the 9% to 12% range versus 8% to 12% previously. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the $5.35 to $5.50 range, which is a 21% to 24% growth over last year. This is up $0.05 at the bottom end from our prior outlook. 
We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points and free cash flow conversion to be greater than 108% for the year. The group range for internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth outlook are grounded in our performance to date, the current state of the economy and our internal assumptions about the trajectory of economic recovery, both of which have improved versus February when we provided our prior outlook. 
To remind you, the low end of our original outlook in February assumed no material economic recovery from where we were at that time. Similarly, the 9% at the low end of our updated outlook assumes the same, no material economic recovery for the remainder of the year. Regionally, we are seeing good economic progress in the U.S., driven both by government stimulus as well as COVID vaccine distribution with uneven recovery outside the U.S. as more pronounced COVID impacts persisted in parts of EMEA, LatAm and APAC. 
As we indicated during our last earnings call, given the timing of the pandemic impact last year, we expect more variability in quarterly growth in 2021. Given difficult comparisons, we expected Q1 performance to be below our full year outlook range and it was. We expect Q2 growth rates will be above the full year outlook range, driven by our business momentum and an easier year-ago comparison. 
I'm proud of the results we've delivered as we navigate the ongoing global crisis. Our business has shown incredible strength and resilience leading to what we expect to be our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2021 and setting a foundation for even stronger results beyond. 
In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our communities. During the quarter, we successfully completed our Back2Business grant program in the original 6 locations that were selected in 2020. We also held 2 additional programs in Milwaukee, partnering with the Milwaukee Bucks to celebrate Black History Month, and in March, a second event, partnering with the Bucks and Nancy Lieberman during Women's History Month to award additional grants to minority-, women-owned small businesses. 
Last, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and for you, our shareholders.

We did see a strong March. We saw a weaker February in the U.S. I'd credit a fair amount of that to weather that you saw going on with sort of a stronger March. But I think on top of that, we saw more lockdowns in EMEA and Brazil as I had talked about previously, although hampered tremendously by COVID still had spending going on. And I'd say as we come into April and as we're kind of heading to the end of it, we see the progression in the U.S. Obviously, India is a challenged environment in total right now. EMEA is beginning to open up. And Brazil continues to perform and why we take the bottom-up from 8 to 9 there if that's helpful to you."

We do expect sequentially to continue to see seasonality benefit Q1 to Q2 in the Merchant segment. We'll also see the benefit of the pandemic continuing to subside, particularly in the U.S. as more and more people get inoculated and hopefully improvement in EMEA as some of the lockdowns begin to be relaxed."

Darrin, I think there's a couple of things that will play. Number one, as Frank pointed out, while we have strength of diversity of geography and client base, meaning we serve the largest retailers in the world all the way down to the smallest SMBs, the breadth has served us well. But we also, of course, have pretty meaningful exposure to restaurants and retail that have still a lot of recovery ahead of them that will help us with growth going forward. 
We think we've outperformed the market the last 4, 6, 8 quarters, quite frankly, and we have the opportunity to continue to do that. The other dynamic, of course, is as Clover and ISV and e-comm, which are growing faster than the overall average become a larger part, you'll see better growth from those becoming a more meaningful piece of the overall company. As we pointed out, $1 billion e-comm business continuing to grow nicely. It becomes a bigger part of that $6 billion segment and providing some nice growth."

And when you think about the things we will do longer term with our bank partners, having a one of a kind digital experience for that bank merchant partner while continuing to work with Paychex and the Verizons also and using our direct channel to digitally sign up.

But then we stitched it together with Clover and began that journey and we see that. You well know how probably people thought we were an e-comm lagger, and we continue to win in that space. 
Now in some of these cases, it's new markets. But in many cases, it's taking it from all the places you would suspect. And I would look at us saying, hey, if you go through the hundreds of bank merchant wins we've talked about, fundamentally, those are 50% takeaways. So we continue to compete against everybody very strongly, and that's in every market and in every vertical. And it gets back to what we had said on Investor Day, when you look at this portfolio at Clover, with Clover Connect, with Carat, with global distribution, with the client base that we have from largest in the world, the corner, as I like to say, at the corner store.

The other half -- half the month, the other half of the month was a pretty severe shutdown as -- particularly in the U.S. but also in Europe. People really significantly went home, and e-commerce really took a hit in 2nd half of March last year. So you see the year-over-year comp get significantly better in those last 2 weeks. 
If you just look at kind of the raw transactions, January started out the year, the quarter strong. February, as Frank mentioned, we saw some weather particularly in the South and the U.S. slow things down a bit, and then March came back quite a bit stronger. If you can adjust for weather, I would say January started out nice. February, again, adjusted for weather, was again in line or good with January. And then we started seeing things really pick up in March. 
I'm sure not coincidentally and helped, supported by the stim 3 payments that started flowing out, and we've seen that continue into April. So we're definitely feeling the recovery of the pandemic. As vaccines really spread in the U.S., we're seeing more and more commerce, retail picking up. Restaurants starting to pick up, still down year-over-year in a meaningful way, but starting to improve sequentially pretty nicely."

Andrew, as you point out, we saw some very nice KPIs support in the overall payments business, Zelle, with both the number of transactions and number of users doubling, certainly supports debit processing as well as the debit network performing quite well. 
We continue to love the acquisition of Ondot and our ability to provide additional digital services for card controls and card activation to our overall channel. We see that as a significant growth opportunity, not only to obviously provide that particular capability, but that as an overall part of our solution. 
We certainly have the benefit of some of the significant wins in the credit issuing business that we talked about over the last couple of quarters beginning to ramp late 2021 and into 2022. The 2% growth in the Payments segment in the first quarter here is not an indication of where we see the opportunity for the full year. There's some definite headwinds there from the pandemic that we expect to subside. 
And I think we said this at the end of last earnings call, but still believe it today, we expect the Payments segment for the full year to be at the upper end of the medium-term outlook for internal revenue growth. So we believe 2022, '23, that Payment segment can grow 5% to 8%. And we think this year, we'll be at the upper end of that as we head into the second half of the year, and then we'll see the full year result.

Great to have you on the team. 2021 is off to a strong start, with Q1 at or better than our expectations across a broad range of metrics. The strength of our results reflects our continued investment in technology, innovation, our client portfolio and our people through the COVID-19 pandemic. Let me provide a brief overview of our strong financial results in the quarter. 
You may have noticed our Q1 earnings presentation has been updated. If you're following along, I will provide some overview comments captured on the first 3 pages, and then Bob will provide more detail on the subsequent slides. 
Total company internal revenue growth was 4% for the quarter, including low double-digit growth in March. That performance was led by our Merchant Acceptance segment, which was up 8%, an exceptional result in light of the global pandemic and continued COVID restrictions, particularly in Brazil, India and a variety of countries in EMEA for much of the quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin grew 360 basis points, resulting in an 18% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Free cash flow grew 8% to $821 million, a 103% conversion to adjusted net income. Our sales momentum remains quite strong as first quarter sales were up 42%, with strong results in our payments and international businesses. And this momentum continues into the second quarter. 
Yesterday, we announced a 20-year agreement with Caixa EconÃ´mica Federal to become the exclusive provider of merchant acquiring services. Caixa is one of Brazil's largest banks with more than 26,000 sales outlets and a broad presence throughout all of Brazil, making this one of the largest wins for our company in Latin America and one of the largest globally. 
Also this morning, we announced a new solution with PayPal to enable our merchant network across the Clover and Carat platforms to accept payments via PayPal and Venmo through QR codes presented at the point of sale. We believe this is an important offering for our merchants as consumer preferences continue to shift towards touch-free transactions. 
The combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of Fiserv's offerings, together with our integrated sales model, is extremely well received in the client's office and we believe bodes well for the future. 
Now I'd like to update you on how our leading digital-enabled merchant business is performing. Through Clover, our leading SMB platform; Carat, our enterprise omnichannel commerce solution; and Clover Connect, our rich ISV solution set, we continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients. The momentum within the digital-enabled segments of the merchant business continues to be excellent. 
Clover's gross payment volume grew 36% year-over-year to $141 billion annualized. To provide some more context around the strength of the Clover platform, GPV has grown 75% from $81 billion in Q1 to 2019 -- in Q1 to $141 billion in Q1 this year despite the economic headwinds from the pandemic. 
Carat, our enterprise omnichannel solution, continued to perform very well. E-commerce transactions grew 24% compared to the prior year. Omnichannel transactions, such as order ahead and pick up in store, were up over 122% year-over-year. We won a record 51 new enterprise level e-commerce clients in the first quarter, including Cost Plus World Market, a U.S. specialty retailer, for which Fiserv has been chosen to provide e-commerce gateway, point-of-sale hardware devices and value-added services like security tokenization. 
We had a very strong results for sales internationally. The notable wins in EMEA include Selecta, Europe's leading self-service retailer, offering coffee and convenience food solutions, for which Fiserv has been chosen to provide acquiring services in unattended POS hardware. And once again, we extended our relationship with one of the largest e-commerce marketplaces in the region. In APAC, we won the merchant acquiring business for Australia's second largest bill payment provider. 
We also expanded our relationship with key brands such as State Farm, where we are piloting a new digital payout experience for insurance claims. Recognizing our innovation to bring digital payments to all consumers, Fiserv was named one of the world's most innovative companies by Fast Company for our role in enabling the acceptance of U.S. Department of Agriculture's SNAP Online EBT payments during the pandemic. 
We continue to see great momentum in the ISV space with Clover Connect. In the first quarter, we signed 42 new ISV partners. Our continued strength in expanding partner relationships is driving strong results in active merchants, which were up 38% in Q1 and ISV revenue channel growth, which was up 34%. 
For example, during the quarter, Fiserv further cemented its leads in the mortgage servicing software vertical by signing a strategic partnership agreement with Mortgage Cadence, an Accenture company, which provides loan origination software for the mortgage industry. This is yet another example of a successful integrated sale continuing to fuel future growth in our ISV channel. 
Additionally, we are continuing to build and enhance our existing ISV relationships by leveraging our technology and market knowledge. In the quarter, we finalized an agreement with eTailPet to move their large set of existing merchants to us and build upon the agreement we had in place for new merchants. 
Moving to our account processing business, we continue to expand our number of privileged relationships across financial institutions of all sizes and types. We signed 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 5 on the DNA platform. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins. 
As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we signed Republic First Bank, a commercial bank with more than $5 billion in assets and rated America's Best Bank by Forbes, for a full-service of Fiserv products, including core processing, card services and output solutions in February. Additionally, we signed 2 de novo banks in the quarter, including Genesis Bank, a newly chartered bank focused as a minority depository institution. This win continues to show our commitment to supporting minority communities. 
A majority of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. The client selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service. These wins also reflect the strength of our offering for a wide range of clients, from de novo banks to large financial institutions. 
In our Payment and Network segment, we continue to leverage the power of our combined solutions to drive revenue synergies. In Q1, we signed a significant new agreement to provide statement and letter services to a major U.S. health care services provider, strengthening our position in this industry vertical. 
Further building on our digital momentum, in Q1, we signed agreements to provide digital solutions to First Horizon Bank as well as PenFed Credit Union, in both cases, leveraging our newly acquired Ondot capabilities. Through Ondot, we can enable our FI clients to offer their cardholders personalized, real time, digital experiences, driving cardholder engagement and spend. We expect continued adoption of these digital solutions across our client base. 
With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. Through Q1, we've already actioned nearly $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to deploying action of $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. With the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. 
On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the first quarter. As of the end of Q1, we've already actioned $265 million in annual revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly and we expect to meet or exceed our $600 million target over the 5 years post-merger. 
Our bank merchant program continues to be a synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes the ability to offer their important merchant clients a modern suite of merchant-acquiring capabilities, including the innovative Clover platform, along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-commerce solutions. In the first quarter, we added 34 new bank merchant clients, 6 with assets over $1 billion. Additionally, half of these wins were competitive takeaways. The pipeline remains robust for the rest of 2021. 
One final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to Bob. As you've heard us discuss in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefine the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities across our payments ecosystem. 
An example of our commitment to this area is the acquisition of Ondot Systems, a leading digital experience platform provider for financial institutions of all sizes, which closed in the first quarter. We also acquired Radius8, a cloud-based platform that adds hyperlocalized commerce capabilities to Carat, thereby enhancing our beyond the buy button strategy. Last but not least, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Pineapple Payments, a leading ISO focused on integrated payments. 
Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results."
128209,710591097,2259417,"Fiserv, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our new slides, I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. We had a strong first quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Q1 represents the f",1031,"Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our new slides, I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. We had a strong first quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Q1 represents the final period of pre-pandemic comparison points with the impact beginning to materialize in the final 2 weeks of March last year. 
Total company internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 8%. First quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 360 basis points to 31.4%. This margin improvement was driven by our rigorous cost synergy execution, which produced $129 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance. 
First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $1.17 compared to $0.99 in the prior year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $821 million, up 8% over Q1 last year and a 103% conversion to adjusted net income. Impacting Q1's free cash flow was an increase in accounts receivable, driven by a strong revenue rebound in March. 
Turning to each of the segments. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 8% in the quarter. Our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio of SMB clients, supported by our Clover platform, enterprise clients, supported by Carat and another strong quarter from our ISV business. This result includes a meaningful headwind from our EMEA region, which experienced restrictions for much of the quarter in several important markets for us, including the U.K., Germany, Ireland and Poland. 
As Frank discussed, our Clover GPV continues to grow very nicely, up 36% in the quarter. The outlook for the SMB business looks strong as the sequential uplift that we witnessed in this business in the last few weeks of March has continued through April. Our integrated payments or ISV business continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. 
As we discussed at our Investor Day, we recently rolled out Clover Connect, a Clover-integrated solution for ISVs. We believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for ISVs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. 
Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 37% to $387 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 650 basis points to 27.7%, driven by the strength in the top line and continued cost synergies. 
The Fintech segment internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter compared to the prior year as growth in high-quality recurring revenue was again partially offset by lower periodic revenue, most prominently termination fees, which created approximately 150 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. 
The shift towards digital banking and the result in strong demand for our broad array of digital solutions continues. For example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobiliti and Architect grew 12% in the quarter. Mobile deposits in Q1 grew 30% over the prior year while self-service ATM deposits grew 65% over last year. We expect these trends to continue as users who have moved to mobile or ATM for check deposits may adopt these as preferred channels after experiencing their convenience and safety. 
Adjusted operating income was up a strong 21% in the quarter to $246 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 510 basis points in the quarter to 33.4% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. 
The Payments and Network segment saw internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter as growth in our card services, output solutions, Zelle and prepaid businesses, including the benefit from revenue synergies, was partially offset by headwinds in our Bill Pay and Credit businesses. 
Debit transactions grew a strong 16% year-over-year, slightly ahead of levels last quarter. We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions such as our account transfers and P2P. Both Zelle transactions and the number of clients live on Zelle more than doubled in the quarter versus a year ago. 
Our bill pay and credit businesses, in particular, given our retail private label mix, saw headwinds from the pandemic that we expect to subside as we reach the second half of the year with better economic activity and better revenue comparisons. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 2% to $585 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points to 41.4% in the quarter. The results were driven by a positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies, in part offset by the lower revenue in our higher-margin credit processing and bill pay businesses. 
The adjusted corporate operating loss was $102 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.2%, flat versus prior year. We also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5.2 million shares for $612 million, and we have more than 16 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. In addition, as Frank mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Ondot Systems in January and increased our investment related to the Tegra118, our former Investment Services business in connection with its combination with Wealthtech Holdings. 
Total debt outstanding was $21.2 billion at March 31, and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remained at 3.6x. We are on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3x in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and debt repayment this year. 
As you heard us emphasize throughout our Investor Day in December, we're fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment in innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions like Ondot, Radius8 and Pineapple Payments. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment.
With that, let me turn the call back to Frank."
128209,710591097,2259417,"Fiserv, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2021",2021-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Given our strong Q1 performance and an improved economic outlook, we are raising the low end of our outlook range for both internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth.

Given our strong Q1 performance and an improved economic outlook, we are raising the low end of our outlook range for both internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth. We now expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be in the 9% to 12% range versus 8% to 12% previously. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the $5.35 to $5.50 range, which is a 21% to 24% growth over last year. This is up $0.05 at the bottom end from our prior outlook. 
We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points and free cash flow conversion to be greater than 108% for the year. The group range for internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth outlook are grounded in our performance to date, the current state of the economy and our internal assumptions about the trajectory of economic recovery, both of which have improved versus February when we provided our prior outlook. 
To remind you, the low end of our original outlook in February assumed no material economic recovery from where we were at that time. Similarly, the 9% at the low end of our updated outlook assumes the same, no material economic recovery for the remainder of the year. Regionally, we are seeing good economic progress in the U.S., driven both by government stimulus as well as COVID vaccine distribution with uneven recovery outside the U.S. as more pronounced COVID impacts persisted in parts of EMEA, LatAm and APAC. 
As we indicated during our last earnings call, given the timing of the pandemic impact last year, we expect more variability in quarterly growth in 2021. Given difficult comparisons, we expected Q1 performance to be below our full year outlook range and it was. We expect Q2 growth rates will be above the full year outlook range, driven by our business momentum and an easier year-ago comparison. 
I'm proud of the results we've delivered as we navigate the ongoing global crisis. Our business has shown incredible strength and resilience leading to what we expect to be our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2021 and setting a foundation for even stronger results beyond. 
In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our communities. During the quarter, we successfully completed our Back2Business grant program in the original 6 locations that were selected in 2020. We also held 2 additional programs in Milwaukee, partnering with the Milwaukee Bucks to celebrate Black History Month, and in March, a second event, partnering with the Bucks and Nancy Lieberman during Women's History Month to award additional grants to minority-, women-owned small businesses.

If you remember, in February, we talked to you all and gave a little look at what we saw up until then. And that's when we took really that bottom end up from -- for the full firm, up from 7 to 8 because we felt that it felt better than it did when we talked to you on December 8 at Investor Day. 
We did see a strong March. We saw a weaker February in the U.S. I'd credit a fair amount of that to weather that you saw going on with sort of a stronger March. But I think on top of that, we saw more lockdowns in EMEA and Brazil as I had talked about previously, although hampered tremendously by COVID still had spending going on. And I'd say as we come into April and as we're kind of heading to the end of it, we see the progression in the U.S. Obviously, India is a challenged environment in total right now. EMEA is beginning to open up. And Brazil continues to perform and why we take the bottom-up from 8 to 9 there if that's helpful to you."

We think we've outperformed the market the last 4, 6, 8 quarters, quite frankly, and we have the opportunity to continue to do that.

Now in some of these cases, it's new markets. But in many cases, it's taking it from all the places you would suspect. And I would look at us saying, hey, if you go through the hundreds of bank merchant wins we've talked about, fundamentally, those are 50% takeaways. So we continue to compete against everybody very strongly, and that's in every market and in every vertical.

The other half -- half the month, the other half of the month was a pretty severe shutdown as -- particularly in the U.S. but also in Europe. People really significantly went home, and e-commerce really took a hit in 2nd half of March last year. So you see the year-over-year comp get significantly better in those last 2 weeks. 
If you just look at kind of the raw transactions, January started out the year, the quarter strong. February, as Frank mentioned, we saw some weather particularly in the South and the U.S. slow things down a bit, and then March came back quite a bit stronger. If you can adjust for weather, I would say January started out nice. February, again, adjusted for weather, was again in line or good with January. And then we started seeing things really pick up in March. 
I'm sure not coincidentally and helped, supported by the stim 3 payments that started flowing out, and we've seen that continue into April. So we're definitely feeling the recovery of the pandemic. As vaccines really spread in the U.S., we're seeing more and more commerce, retail picking up. Restaurants starting to pick up, still down year-over-year in a meaningful way, but starting to improve sequentially pretty nicely."

And I think we said this at the end of last earnings call, but still believe it today, we expect the Payments segment for the full year to be at the upper end of the medium-term outlook for internal revenue growth. So we believe 2022, '23, that Payment segment can grow 5% to 8%. And we think this year, we'll be at the upper end of that as we head into the second half of the year, and then we'll see the full year result. 
So we think we're in a great spot. We'll see some continued growth, particularly in our digital side of the payments. And we'll see improvement in that bill pay and credit issuing, particularly at the retail private label in the second half."

Great to have you on the team. 2021 is off to a strong start, with Q1 at or better than our expectations across a broad range of metrics. The strength of our results reflects our continued investment in technology, innovation, our client portfolio and our people through the COVID-19 pandemic. Let me provide a brief overview of our strong financial results in the quarter. 
You may have noticed our Q1 earnings presentation has been updated. If you're following along, I will provide some overview comments captured on the first 3 pages, and then Bob will provide more detail on the subsequent slides. 
Total company internal revenue growth was 4% for the quarter, including low double-digit growth in March. That performance was led by our Merchant Acceptance segment, which was up 8%, an exceptional result in light of the global pandemic and continued COVID restrictions, particularly in Brazil, India and a variety of countries in EMEA for much of the quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin grew 360 basis points, resulting in an 18% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Free cash flow grew 8% to $821 million, a 103% conversion to adjusted net income. Our sales momentum remains quite strong as first quarter sales were up 42%, with strong results in our payments and international businesses. And this momentum continues into the second quarter. 
Yesterday, we announced a 20-year agreement with Caixa Economica Federal to become the exclusive provider of merchant acquiring services. Caixa is one of Brazil's largest banks with more than 26,000 sales outlets and a broad presence throughout all of Brazil, making this one of the largest wins for our company in Latin America and one of the largest globally. 
Also this morning, we announced a new solution with PayPal to enable our merchant network across the Clover and Carat platforms to accept payments via PayPal and Venmo through QR codes presented at the point of sale. We believe this is an important offering for our merchants as consumer preferences continue to shift towards touch-free transactions. 
The combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of Fiserv's offerings, together with our integrated sales model, is extremely well received in the client's office and we believe bodes well for the future. 
Now I'd like to update you on how our leading digital-enabled merchant business is performing. Through Clover, our leading SMB platform; Carat, our enterprise omnichannel commerce solution; and Clover Connect, our rich ISV solution set, we continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients. The momentum within the digital-enabled segments of the merchant business continues to be excellent. 
Clover's gross payment volume grew 36% year-over-year to $141 billion annualized. To provide some more context around the strength of the Clover platform, GPV has grown 75% from $81 billion in Q1 to 2019 -- in Q1 to $141 billion in Q1 this year despite the economic headwinds from the pandemic. 
Carat, our enterprise omnichannel solution, continued to perform very well. E-commerce transactions grew 24% compared to the prior year. Omnichannel transactions, such as order ahead and pick up in store, were up over 122% year-over-year. We won a record 51 new enterprise level e-commerce clients in the first quarter, including Cost Plus World Market, a U.S. specialty retailer, for which Fiserv has been chosen to provide e-commerce gateway, point-of-sale hardware devices and value-added services like security tokenization. 
We had a very strong results for sales internationally. The notable wins in EMEA include Selecta, Europe's leading self-service retailer, offering coffee and convenience food solutions, for which Fiserv has been chosen to provide acquiring services in unattended POS hardware. And once again, we extended our relationship with one of the largest e-commerce marketplaces in the region. In APAC, we won the merchant acquiring business for Australia's second largest bill payment provider. 
We also expanded our relationship with key brands such as State Farm, where we are piloting a new digital payout experience for insurance claims. Recognizing our innovation to bring digital payments to all consumers, Fiserv was named one of the world's most innovative companies by Fast Company for our role in enabling the acceptance of U.S. Department of Agriculture's SNAP Online EBT payments during the pandemic. 
We continue to see great momentum in the ISV space with Clover Connect. In the first quarter, we signed 42 new ISV partners. Our continued strength in expanding partner relationships is driving strong results in active merchants, which were up 38% in Q1 and ISV revenue channel growth, which was up 34%. 
For example, during the quarter, Fiserv further cemented its leads in the mortgage servicing software vertical by signing a strategic partnership agreement with Mortgage Cadence, an Accenture company, which provides loan origination software for the mortgage industry. This is yet another example of a successful integrated sale continuing to fuel future growth in our ISV channel. 
Additionally, we are continuing to build and enhance our existing ISV relationships by leveraging our technology and market knowledge. In the quarter, we finalized an agreement with eTailPet to move their large set of existing merchants to us and build upon the agreement we had in place for new merchants. 
Moving to our account processing business, we continue to expand our number of privileged relationships across financial institutions of all sizes and types. We signed 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 5 on the DNA platform. I'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins. 
As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we signed Republic First Bank, a commercial bank with more than $5 billion in assets and rated America's Best Bank by Forbes, for a full-service of Fiserv products, including core processing, card services and output solutions in February. Additionally, we signed 2 de novo banks in the quarter, including Genesis Bank, a newly chartered bank focused as a minority depository institution. This win continues to show our commitment to supporting minority communities. 
A majority of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. The client selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service. These wins also reflect the strength of our offering for a wide range of clients, from de novo banks to large financial institutions. 
In our Payment and Network segment, we continue to leverage the power of our combined solutions to drive revenue synergies. In Q1, we signed a significant new agreement to provide statement and letter services to a major U.S. health care services provider, strengthening our position in this industry vertical. 
Further building on our digital momentum, in Q1, we signed agreements to provide digital solutions to First Horizon Bank as well as PenFed Credit Union, in both cases, leveraging our newly acquired Ondot capabilities. Through Ondot, we can enable our FI clients to offer their cardholders personalized, real time, digital experiences, driving cardholder engagement and spend. We expect continued adoption of these digital solutions across our client base. 
With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. Through Q1, we've already actioned nearly $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to deploying action of $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. With the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. 
On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the first quarter. As of the end of Q1, we've already actioned $265 million in annual revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly and we expect to meet or exceed our $600 million target over the 5 years post-merger. 
Our bank merchant program continues to be a synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes the ability to offer their important merchant clients a modern suite of merchant-acquiring capabilities, including the innovative Clover platform, along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-commerce solutions. In the first quarter, we added 34 new bank merchant clients, 6 with assets over $1 billion. Additionally, half of these wins were competitive takeaways. The pipeline remains robust for the rest of 2021. 
One final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to Bob. As you've heard us discuss in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefine the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities across our payments ecosystem. 
An example of our commitment to this area is the acquisition of Ondot Systems, a leading digital experience platform provider for financial institutions of all sizes, which closed in the first quarter. We also acquired Radius8, a cloud-based platform that adds hyperlocalized commerce capabilities to Carat, thereby enhancing our beyond the buy button strategy. Last but not least, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Pineapple Payments, a leading ISO focused on integrated payments. 
Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results."

If you're following along on our new slides, I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. We had a strong first quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Q1 represents the f",1031,"Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along on our new slides, I'll cover some detail on each of our segments. We had a strong first quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. Q1 represents the final period of pre-pandemic comparison points with the impact beginning to materialize in the final 2 weeks of March last year. 
Total company internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter, led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 8%. First quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 360 basis points to 31.4%. This margin improvement was driven by our rigorous cost synergy execution, which produced $129 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance. 
First quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $1.17 compared to $0.99 in the prior year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $821 million, up 8% over Q1 last year and a 103% conversion to adjusted net income. Impacting Q1's free cash flow was an increase in accounts receivable, driven by a strong revenue rebound in March. 
Turning to each of the segments. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was 8% in the quarter. Our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio of SMB clients, supported by our Clover platform, enterprise clients, supported by Carat and another strong quarter from our ISV business. This result includes a meaningful headwind from our EMEA region, which experienced restrictions for much of the quarter in several important markets for us, including the U.K., Germany, Ireland and Poland. 
As Frank discussed, our Clover GPV continues to grow very nicely, up 36% in the quarter. The outlook for the SMB business looks strong as the sequential uplift that we witnessed in this business in the last few weeks of March has continued through April. Our integrated payments or ISV business continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. 
As we discussed at our Investor Day, we recently rolled out Clover Connect, a Clover-integrated solution for ISVs. We believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for ISVs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. 
Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 37% to $387 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 650 basis points to 27.7%, driven by the strength in the top line and continued cost synergies. 
The Fintech segment internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter compared to the prior year as growth in high-quality recurring revenue was again partially offset by lower periodic revenue, most prominently termination fees, which created approximately 150 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. 
The shift towards digital banking and the result in strong demand for our broad array of digital solutions continues. For example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobiliti and Architect grew 12% in the quarter. Mobile deposits in Q1 grew 30% over the prior year while self-service ATM deposits grew 65% over last year. We expect these trends to continue as users who have moved to mobile or ATM for check deposits may adopt these as preferred channels after experiencing their convenience and safety. 
Adjusted operating income was up a strong 21% in the quarter to $246 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 510 basis points in the quarter to 33.4% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. 
The Payments and Network segment saw internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter as growth in our card services, output solutions, Zelle and prepaid businesses, including the benefit from revenue synergies, was partially offset by headwinds in our Bill Pay and Credit businesses. 
Debit transactions grew a strong 16% year-over-year, slightly ahead of levels last quarter. We continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions such as our account transfers and P2P. Both Zelle transactions and the number of clients live on Zelle more than doubled in the quarter versus a year ago. 
Our bill pay and credit businesses, in particular, given our retail private label mix, saw headwinds from the pandemic that we expect to subside as we reach the second half of the year with better economic activity and better revenue comparisons. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 2% to $585 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points to 41.4% in the quarter. The results were driven by a positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies, in part offset by the lower revenue in our higher-margin credit processing and bill pay businesses. 
The adjusted corporate operating loss was $102 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.2%, flat versus prior year. We also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5.2 million shares for $612 million, and we have more than 16 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. In addition, as Frank mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Ondot Systems in January and increased our investment related to the Tegra118, our former Investment Services business in connection with its combination with Wealthtech Holdings. 
Total debt outstanding was $21.2 billion at March 31, and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remained at 3.6x. We are on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3x in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted EBITDA growth and debt repayment this year. 
As you heard us emphasize throughout our Investor Day in December, we're fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment in innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions like Ondot, Radius8 and Pineapple Payments. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment.
With that, let me turn the call back to Frank."

Given our strong Q1 performance and an improved economic outlook, we are raising the low end of our outlook range for both internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth. We now expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be in the 9% to 12% range versus 8% to 12% previously. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the $5.35 to $5.50 range, which is a 21% to 24% growth over last year. This is up $0.05 at the bottom end from our prior outlook. 
We continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points and free cash flow conversion to be greater than 108% for the year. The group range for internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth outlook are grounded in our performance to date, the current state of the economy and our internal assumptions about the trajectory of economic recovery, both of which have improved versus February when we provided our prior outlook. 
To remind you, the low end of our original outlook in February assumed no material economic recovery from where we were at that time. Similarly, the 9% at the low end of our updated outlook assumes the same, no material economic recovery for the remainder of the year. Regionally, we are seeing good economic progress in the U.S., driven both by government stimulus as well as COVID vaccine distribution with uneven recovery outside the U.S. as more pronounced COVID impacts persisted in parts of EMEA, LatAm and APAC. 
As we indicated during our last earnings call, given the timing of the pandemic impact last year, we expect more variability in quarterly growth in 2021. Given difficult comparisons, we expected Q1 performance to be below our full year outlook range and it was. We expect Q2 growth rates will be above the full year outlook range, driven by our business momentum and an easier year-ago comparison. 
I'm proud of the results we've delivered as we navigate the ongoing global crisis. Our business has shown incredible strength and resilience leading to what we expect to be our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2021 and setting a foundation for even stronger results beyond. 
In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our communities. During the quarter, we successfully completed our Back2Business grant program in the original 6 locations that were selected in 2020. We also held 2 additional programs in Milwaukee, partnering with the Milwaukee Bucks to celebrate Black History Month, and in March, a second event, partnering with the Bucks and Nancy Lieberman during Women's History Month to award additional grants to minority-, women-owned small businesses. 
Last, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and for you, our shareholders. 
With that, operator, let's open the line for questions."

And that's when we took really that bottom end up from -- for the full firm, up from 7 to 8 because we felt that it felt better than it did when we talked to you on December 8 at Investor Day. 
We did see a strong March. We saw a weaker February in the U.S. I'd credit a fair amount of that to weather that you saw going on with sort of a stronger March. But I think on top of that, we saw more lockdowns in EMEA and Brazil as I had talked about previously, although hampered tremendously by COVID still had spending going on. And I'd say as we come into April and as we're kind of heading to the end of it, we see the progression in the U.S. Obviously, India is a challenged environment in total right now. EMEA is beginning to open up. And Brazil continues to perform and why we take the bottom-up from 8 to 9 there if that's helpful to you."

It would almost seem like the seasonality would be even better this Q2 than some of those past trends? But just trying to triangulate that."

Then second quarter would actually be above the full year guidance range, with the second half of the year more in line with that overall full year. 
We do expect sequentially to continue to see seasonality benefit Q1 to Q2 in the Merchant segment. We'll also see the benefit of the pandemic continuing to subside, particularly in the U.S. as more and more people get inoculated and hopefully improvement in EMEA as some of the lockdowns begin to be relaxed."

And we've been -- we started that Brazilian business back in '14 and '15. And we've been taking share beyond where anybody thought was capable in that market itself. So I'd point to that because we weren't a big ISV player back in '15, '16 or probably '17 until we bought CardConnect and Bluepay. But then we stitched it together with Clover and began that journey and we see that. You well know how probably people thought we were an e-comm lagger, and we continue to win in that space. 
Now in some of these cases, it's new markets. But in many cases, it's taking it from all the places you would suspect. And I would look at us saying, hey, if you go through the hundreds of bank merchant wins we've talked about, fundamentally, those are 50% takeaways. So we continue to compete against everybody very strongly, and that's in every market and in every vertical. And it gets back to what we had said on Investor Day, when you look at this portfolio at Clover, with Clover Connect, with Carat, with global distribution, with the client base that we have from largest in the world, the corner, as I like to say, at the corner store. I think we built a business that's the most diverse and probably has the most technology, in all honesty."

If you look at the year-over-year growth rate, obviously, given the pre-pandemic comparison in January and February. And then March, half the quarter was pre-pandemic. The other half -- half the month, the other half of the month was a pretty severe shutdown as -- particularly in the U.S. but also in Europe. People really significantly went home, and e-commerce really took a hit in 2nd half of March last year. So you see the year-over-year comp get significantly better in those last 2 weeks. 
If you just look at kind of the raw transactions, January started out the year, the quarter strong. February, as Frank mentioned, we saw some weather particularly in the South and the U.S. slow things down a bit, and then March came back quite a bit stronger. If you can adjust for weather, I would say January started out nice. February, again, adjusted for weather, was again in line or good with January. And then we started seeing things really pick up in March. 
I'm sure not coincidentally and helped, supported by the stim 3 payments that started flowing out, and we've seen that continue into April. So we're definitely feeling the recovery of the pandemic. As vaccines really spread in the U.S., we're seeing more and more commerce, retail picking up. Restaurants starting to pick up, still down year-over-year in a meaningful way, but starting to improve sequentially pretty nicely."

Well, a pandemic gets a lot of people to shut down their businesses, it gets lot of people to open up new businesses. I think we're going to see the strongest small business formation in the second half that we've ever seen. And that's why these channels we have are so invaluable. Our commitment to the small businesses, you probably saw us even as a technical provider, one of a few to the SBA for the restaurant brands. 
So I think we've done a good job over the long-haul of keeping our clients. And I think our Clover platform, our ISV platform and our Carat platform all are well received by our client base. And I look for strength in small business formation even for those who shut down to come back in a different shape and form. 
So I guess churn seems very good for us if you want to think about attrition. I mean, we feel strong about the job we're doing. And of course, any client leaving upsets us at any level. But I think the other point we got to put on top of it is a tremendously strong small business formation and why all these channels we have, we believe, are so darn valuable for us in that process."

Andrew, as you point out, we saw some very nice KPIs support in the overall payments business, Zelle, with both the number of transactions and number of users doubling, certainly supports debit processing as well as the debit network performing quite well. 
We continue to love the acquisition of Ondot and our ability to provide additional digital services for card controls and card activation to our overall channel. We see that as a significant growth opportunity, not only to obviously provide that particular capability, but that as an overall part of our solution. 
We certainly have the benefit of some of the significant wins in the credit issuing business that we talked about over the last couple of quarters beginning to ramp late 2021 and into 2022. The 2% growth in the Payments segment in the first quarter here is not an indication of where we see the opportunity for the full year. There's some definite headwinds there from the pandemic that we expect to subside. 
And I think we said this at the end of last earnings call, but still believe it today, we expect the Payments segment for the full year to be at the upper end of the medium-term outlook for internal revenue growth. So we believe 2022, '23, that Payment segment can grow 5% to 8%. And we think this year, we'll be at the upper end of that as we head into the second half of the year, and then we'll see the full year result. 
So we think we're in a great spot. We'll see some continued growth, particularly in our digital side of the payments. And we'll see improvement in that bill pay and credit issuing, particularly at the retail private label in the second half."

Second quarter was a very strong quarter for us across the company. Total company adjusted revenue grew 20%. Adjusted operating margin grew 510 basis points, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 41%. Adjusted EPS grew 47% to",2141,"Thank you, Shub. Second quarter was a very strong quarter for us across the company. 
Total company adjusted revenue grew 20%. Adjusted operating margin grew 510 basis points, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 41%. Adjusted EPS grew 47% to $1.37. Free cash flow in the quarter was in line with last year, just under $900 million, including the impact of a diminished NOL. Second quarter sales were up 31% with growth across the business. 
Our strong second quarter was driven by a combination of continued economic recovery and strong execution of our business strategy. 
On the macroeconomic side, we saw a continued recovery in the U.S. with uneven recovery in other parts of the world. The shift to digital commerce drove consumer demand for seamless experiences across channels. Amidst these trends, we executed on our strategies to continue to win business and grow share. 
We serve as the operating system for commerce across our client base, ranging from micro merchants to the world's largest corporations, financial institutions, banks and credit unions, Fintechs and governments. This enables us to focus not only on growth at our core, but also on new services, business models, and adjacencies. 
Given the strong results to date and our solid pipeline, we are raising our outlook range for internal revenue growth and now expect 10% to 12% growth for 2021 from 9% to 12% previously. Additionally, we are raising our adjusted EPS full year outlook and now expect a range of $5.50 to $5.60, up from $5.35 to $5.50 previously. The increased adjusted EPS guidance outlook represents a 24% to 27% growth versus last year. 
Drilling down to the business segments. The quarter was led by our Merchant Acceptance segment, which posted internal revenue growth of 41% year-over-year. Normalizing for the year-ago comps, the segment posted a 13% growth in the quarter on a 2-year basis above our pre-pandemic run rate. 
Both North America and international largely grew in line with the segment average. North America purchase volume was up 33% in the quarter led by strength in retail, petro, and restaurants. 
One of the trends that the pandemic has accelerated is the shift to omni-commerce. Consumers are increasingly looking to engage with merchants in whatever way is most convenient. Fiserv's ability to support clients with leading solutions in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce environments is a differentiator. 
We saw the manifestation of this trend during the second quarter as offline commerce recovered with volumes growing 46% versus 2020 and 11% versus 2019. Online commerce volume also grew unabated at 21% year-over-year, highlighting the criticality of equipping merchants with omnichannel commerce capabilities. 
[ Our lead ] in omni-commerce is the reason we were honored with the Omnichannel Provider of the Year award from the Strawhecker Group, a leading payments industry analyst firm. As you know, Clover, Carat, and Clover Connect are Fiserv's 3 leading platforms for small- and medium-sized merchants, enterprises and ISVs, respectively. 
Starting with Clover, GPV in the quarter grew 96% year-over-year, reflecting a 38% CAGR since 2019 to $184 billion on an annualized basis. In the SMB space, we continue to build out vertical-specific solutions in retail, restaurants, and services. 
Our vertical sector strategy aims at expanding beyond the buy button offering an integrated suite of products that help merchants generate revenue and run their business. Value-added services on the Clover platform include Corporate Capital, Clover Dining, Clover Order Ahead, and Clover Inventory as well as our unique app marketplace, which provides access to services such as payroll management, loyalty, and marketing that enable us to increase our share of the merchant's wallet and become the platform of choice. 
On the enterprise side, Carat, our enterprise omnichannel ecosystem, continued its strong momentum in the second quarter with new wins and continued innovation in key verticals. In restaurants, Carat powers digital commerce for 10 of the top 15 QSRs. 
Carat has helped Burger King expand its mobile payments experience into Latin America; in restaurant brands international expansion in the U.K. and other parts of EMEA. In grocery, where Carat now serves 9 of the top 10 grocers, we have helped new clients such as Wakefern, Aldi, and the companies of [ Ahold Delahays U.S.A. ], expand their digital grocery ordering capabilities with new payment types. 
Evidence of Carat's commitment to the grocery industry and transform digital experience is exemplified by Carat's leading online EBT program that has processed $2.5 billion in GPV year-to-date. 
In retail, where Carat serves 7 of the top 10 retailers, we expand the e-merchant services by working with clients such as adidas on innovative solutions, including a new consumer recommendation engine. [ This engine ] connects digital experiences to local stores enabled by the integration of [ Radius8 ], an acquisition we completed in the first quarter of this year. 
Carat has also established new at-scale leadership with crypto wallets where we power Carat's funds in and funds out solutions. Through this capability, we help consumers move more than $4 billion in payments volume in and out of wallets for the past 12 months. 
In the second quarter alone, we moved $2 billion of volume, demonstrating the sharp ramp in digital currency movement. 
Moving to Clover Connect, our ISV-focused offering, momentum continued in the second quarter with ISV volume up 122% year-over-year. We signed 53 new ISV partners in the quarter, bringing the new ISV partnerships to 95 year-to-date. 
We're signing up buyers fees that are new to payments and those that are converting from competitors. Year-to-date, almost half of our wins are competitive takeaways. Our ISV partners drive great value in getting access to our partner management tool, CoPilot, in integrating with Clover. 
On our Investor Day, we talked to you about our merchant acceptance growth strategy for international. We remain focused on growing our global market presence with world-class bank partners and through our direct channels, all while leveraging the strength of common platforms and connections. 
In the quarter, we announced the JV with Deutsche Bank in Germany that offers us access to over 800,000 merchants, many of whom will power with our Clover platform. In Asia Pacific region, we won a multi-country acquiring processing mandate from Citibank for its new integrated digital commerce offering, Spring by Citi. 
Early in July, we began onboarding and processing payment transactions as part of the merchant acquiring services agreement signed with Brazil's [ Casabank ] in April of this year. The onboarding began 70 days after contract signing once again, demonstrating our speed to market. 
In addition to the successes I mentioned above, in our Merchant Acceptance segment yesterday, we announced a strategic relationship with Goldman Sachs to integrate cross-border payment functionality into our B2B accounts receivable and accounts payable solution, Snap Pay. As you know, B2B payments is a vast and growing market, ripe with opportunity. We believe that in partnership with Goldman Sachs, we can deliver best-in-class B2B payment capabilities, enhancing visibility, operational efficiencies, and cost savings for our large and mid-market business clients. 
Moving to the Payments and Network segment. We posted internal revenue growth of 7% over the second quarter of last year. Positives in the quarter included the continued growth of sales, continued strength in debit transaction volume, initial recovery in credit account volumes, and international growth with some weakness in bill pay, although results improved sequentially. 
The differentiated and industry-leading businesses within our Payments and Network portfolio and our agile execution are the key reasons why we continue to win with clients. We are proceeding well with onboarding $120 million of credit issuing wins we told you about on our Investor Day. We completed boarding [ Atlantic ] in Q2 and have completed several stages of migrating both Alliance Data and Genesis Financial to the Optus environment. In less than 12 months, after announcing these 3 banner wins, we are poised to recognize revenue on all 3 clients in the third quarter of this year. 
We continue to grow our relationship with innovative growth-stage Fintechs, digital banks, and consumer lenders. In June, we signed an agreement with [ Prosper ], a Fintech pioneer and a premier AI-driven consumer lending marketplace for credit card processing services. This space is a growth focus for us. 
Our revenue with Fintech issuers grew over 300% during the first half of this year versus the same period in 2019. On Investor Day, you'll recall that driving best-in-class integrated digital consumer journeys is a key differentiator and imperative for our clients. 
Experiences are the new currency of loyalty. Customers gravitate towards institutions that could give them a unified, seamless experience across both channels and products. To that end, yesterday, we announced enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities for integrated digital banking and card management. 
This enriched mobile-first suite will enable financial institutions to offer their consumer and business customers a best-in-class digital banking experience that's designed for the way customers expect to engage. 
To introduce these enhanced capabilities, we rapidly integrated 2 recent acquisitions, [ On Dot and Spend Labs ]. The result is a single unified platform for consumer and small and midsized business cardholders that enables expense and business card management. 
This offering allows us to deliver a single point of access for all banking products. 
Our enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities will span all 3 business: In payments through a leading digital cardholder experience; in financial technology, by driving the penetration of our core account processing and digital surrounds; in merchant acceptance, by increasing the uptake of value-added services from integrating Spend Labs with our Clover platform. We expect to see incremental usage, engagement, and services revenue on the Fiserv platform as a result. 
Before I close out the Payments segment, I would like to mention the strong growth we are seeing in our debit networks, [ STAR and Excel ] as we are winning new issuers through our ability to support all transaction type, including best-in-class fraud management and chargeback products. 
Moving to the Financial Technologies segment. The quarter was in line with our expectations, posting internal revenue growth of 5%, including an 80 basis points headwind from periodic revenue. 
I want to highlight some key achievements in the quarter that reflect our strong market position. We added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 8 on the DNA platform and 4 in the over $1 billion asset size market. 
As the smaller end of the banking industry consolidates, we're moving up the asset chains, winning share in the $1 billion to $50 billion market. One such win is [ Sunstream ] business services, a service entity, which spans 12 financial institutions and provides business and technology services to farm credit associations, totaling more than $115 billion in assets. Sunstream will be convert into DNA in a number of surround solutions. 
Continuing our strong momentum in the de novo bank market, we signed LCA Financial Services, a newly created -- a newly chartered bank focused on small business. While we continue to win with our digital surround solutions, ability is the new paradigm in digital banking, a single retail and business online and mobile platform. 
We had our first client go live on the [ ABILITY ] platform in the second quarter with more than 100 clients signed up. We are also fully embracing openness as a strategy. 
The Fiserv Developer Studio is aimed at attracting the developer community to build innovative products using the range of APIs we expose across cards, payments, banking, small, medium and large businesses. Additionally, we are building a pre-integrated Fintech app marketplace where financial institutions clients can acquire, test, and deploy third-party apps seamlessly, easily and quickly. 
This openness strategy creates a net new revenue opportunity within our existing client base while widening the value-added services opportunity. 
With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. Through the second quarter, we already actioned $1.1 billion -- over $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to completing a $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. With the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. 
On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the second quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, we've already actioned $325 million in annual revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly and we expect to meet or exceed our $600 million target over the 5 years post merger. 
Revenue synergies in the quarter were driven by payments, debit network, and card sales across our 3 major client segments FIs, corporates, and government. Additionally, as the partner of choice, we continue to see momentum in our bank merchant program. 
Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results."

If you're following along on our slides, I will cover some of the detail on each of our segments, starting with Slide 4. 
We had a very strong second quarter, thanks to our broad portfolio of products and services as well as the positioning of our assets and strong execution of business. Total company internal revenue growth was 18% in the quarter, with growth across all segments and led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 41%. Year-to-date, total company internal revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 23%. 
Second quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 41% to $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 510 basis points to 33.9%. This margin improvement was driven by our outstanding revenue results and our continued and disciplined cost synergy execution, which produced $90 million of incremental cost synergies during the quarter as well as strong operating performance. 
First half adjusted operating income increased 28% to $2.4 billion. Adjusted operating margin through the end of June expanded 440 basis points to 32.7%. 
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 47% to $1.37 compared to $0.93 in the prior year. Through June 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $2.54, putting us on a pace to achieve our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, a testament to the incredible resiliency of this company. 
Free cash flow in the quarter of $897 million was in line with last year, with free cash flow for the first 6 months of the year, up 4% to $1.72 billion. Free cash flow conversion was 97% to adjusted net income, including a $172 million impact from reduced net operating loss carryforwards. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion came in at 100%, and we continue to expect at least 108% free cash flow conversion for 2021. 
Now looking at our segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a stellar 41% in the quarter and 23% year-to-date. Our results were driven by a strong performance of our SMB platform, Clover; our enterprise platform, Carat; and our ISV platform, Clover Connect. These results were driven by a strong global performance despite uneven economic recovery outside North America. 
The second quarter was a record quarter for Clover. In addition to a very strong 96% annualized GPV growth, this quarter was also the highest shipment volume for Clover hardware, having recently shipped our 2 millionth Clover device. 
Moving to Carat. We won 52 new global enterprise e-commerce clients on a platform in the quarter. Including existing clients, Carat won or expanded business with brands such as Sport Trade, Aldi, and [ Yak Stone ]. In India, Carat won the business of a leading digital food delivery platform. 
Our ISV volume in the quarter through Clover Connect grew 122% year-over-year. And we're winning both ISVs that are new to the payments as well as competitive takeaways. 
Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 135% to $524 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up more than 12 full percentage points to 31.4%, driven by the strength in the top line. Through June 30, adjusted operating income improved 80% to $911 million, and adjusted operating margin grew 950 basis points to 29.7%. 
The Payments and Network segment posted internal revenue growth of 7% in this quarter, resulting in a year-to-date growth of 4%. Debit transactions grew a strong 31% in the quarter and this was a low double-digit sequential grower versus last quarter. 
We continue to build upon the strong momentum of transaction growth in account-to-account transfers and P2P solutions. Versus prior year, Zelle transactions in the quarter were up 94% and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 88% in the quarter. 
Our bill pay business saw a sequential improvement in growth from Q1 and is expected to continue to improve through the second half of this year. 
We continue to expect to see the full year internal revenue growth for the Payments and Network segment to be toward the upper end of the medium-term growth rate of 5% to 8%. 
Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 14% to $636 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 260 basis points to 44.6% in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 8% to $1.2 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points to 43%. The results were driven by positive momentum in our issuer business and the impact of revenue and cost synergies. 
The Financial Technology segment, internal revenue grew in line with expectations at 5% in the second quarter as continued growth in high-quality recurring revenue was partially offset by lower periodic revenue, which created an 80 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth. For the first half of the year, internal revenue growth for the Financial Technology segment is now 4%, reaching the lower end of our medium-term outlook for the segment of 4% to 6%. 
Demand for our digital banking capabilities and for our deep offering of digital solutions continues to build momentum. As Frank mentioned, we added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter. 
Total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobility and Architect, grew 9% in the quarter. Mobile deposits in Q2 grew 12% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew 70% over last year. 
Adjusted operating income was up a strong 8% in the quarter to $273 million and up 14% year-to-date to $519 million. Adjusted operating margin in this segment increased a robust 80 basis points in the quarter to 36.2% and 300 basis points to 34.9% through the end of June, due to a combination of revenue growth, operational effectiveness benefits, and cost synergies. 
The adjusted corporate operating loss was $124 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations, up from last year, largely on higher variable compensation expenses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.3%, increasing 80 basis points versus prior year. We also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate will be fairly consistent with 2020 rate and at the lower end of our previously forecasted range of 21% to 22%. 
During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5 million shares for $588 million, and we have more than 55 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. 
We completed 2 acquisitions in the quarter, Spend Labs, a mobile native cloud-based commercial card payments and software company; and [ Pineapple Payments ], a leading independent sales organization focused on integrated payments. Additionally, we divested our remaining interest in the investment services business and received pretax proceeds of $460 million from the transaction. 
Total debt outstanding was $20.8 billion on June 30, and the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.3x, putting us well on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3x by the end of this year. 
We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investments in innovative solutions, and pursuing high-value acquisitions. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Frank."

Our speed to market with the enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities for banking and card management announced yesterday, along with the integration of business expense management into the Clover platform, all of which leverage the full capabilities of recent acquisitions, On Dot and Spend Labs add to our continued success. 
In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our people and on our communities. Earlier this month, Fiserv was named by Forbes as the Best Employer for Diversity, recognizing our commitment to putting diversity at the forefront of our values and having implemented long-term initiatives to create a more inclusive environment. 
During the quarter, we published our first annual corporate social responsibility report, which is available on the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website. We also expanded our back-to-business grant program beyond the original locations that were selected in 2020. 
In May, we partnered with the New York Mets to recognize small businesses as part of our Asian, American, and Pacific Islander Heritage month. And in June, we awarded grants to businesses in Tulsa as part of the centennial observation of the Tulsa race massacre. 
None of these achievements would have been possible without our world-class talent. I thank our more than 40,000 associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. 
And finally, before I close, I want to congratulate the Milwaukee Box for winning the NBA championship at Fiserv Forum last week. The Box, our terrific partners, and our partnership goes way beyond putting our name on their arena. Clover has been deployed throughout Fiserv Forum for food and beverage concessions, providing attendees with seamless, quick and easy transactions. They also partnered with us for several back-to-business events earlier this year. Congratulations to the entire Milwaukee Bucks organization.

And then two, I wanted to kind of just drill into it a little bit, given that that's above your medium-term outlook for that segment, which as per Investor Day, was 9% to 12%. Can you just highlight like what you're seeing, say, in North America versus ex-U.S.? And are there any unusual dynamics in this quarter? Or do you see that sustainable going forward? And kind of what's different about the business now than prior to the pandemic one? I believe it was running closer to about 10%."

So I would say really driven by U.S. When you see that we say U.S. and international for the quarter performed fundamentally evenly, that was a spotty evenness, meaning not every country was the same, and you could kind of map to where recoveries are happen or not. 
So I think it's all about our platform strategy and our client strategy that's driving the outcomes. And I think our team's galvanized very well around it."

So the ability to take 2,100 mobility banks and bring them a fully integrated card experience at the highest level of card via the On Dot and bring that in a way that maybe a simple way to think about it is everything you can imagine in one application that allows you to do everything from originate transactions, to digital card issuance, to digital card view, to card-free cash, all in the same place that you're doing your bill pay and you're doing your Zelle transactions. 
So we're going to take 2,100 mobility clients, 1,300 card valet and bringing that to them. And then that will be what we all -- and those are financial institutions. We believe that will also help our clients increase their digital adoption quotient with their clients. 
So we see this as a game changer. So it's early innings. We got banks up and running on it, and we will deploy. And then you hear us talking about on top of all of that, for financial institutions. We bring an ability that sits on top of all of it.

And then you got an integration of a Spend Lab into Clover, which allows -- these are our digital platforms. We're talking about digital platforms, one-of-a-kind digital platform. 
So -- and I think what you should take away, there's an element of this company that's digitally agile and can deliver, and you saw it on those credit conversions. I think those are good track rate speeds for those size and scope cautious unparalleled. 70 days from signing. We're boarding merchants for them every day.

It's why you hear us talk about the investments we're making in mobile capability and integrating our digital banking and card management experience, more and more digital transactions, e-commerce, et cetera, is certainly, I believe the pandemic brought forward multiple periods of transition into that space. And I do think it was not transitory. Those changes are here to stay. 
And we'll see, as people return to whatever normal is going to be what that continued transition growth rate happens. But obviously, we're seeing great growth in Zelle. We're seeing more and more transactions on account-to-account transfers and good e-comm volume here to talk about in our merchant space, up 21%. 
So getting mobile-first capability and digital experiences was a focus of ours over the last several quarters, and we're bringing a number of that into a single instance right now and continue to see that integration going forward."

Second quarter was a very strong quarter for us across the company. Total company adjusted revenue grew 20%.

Second quarter was a very strong quarter for us across the company. 
Total company adjusted revenue grew 20%. Adjusted operating margin grew 510 basis points, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 41%. Adjusted EPS grew 47% to $1.37. Free cash flow in the quarter was in line with last year, just under $900 million, including the impact of a diminished NOL. Second quarter sales were up 31% with growth across the business. 
Our strong second quarter was driven by a combination of continued economic recovery and strong execution of our business strategy. 
On the macroeconomic side, we saw a continued recovery in the U.S. with uneven recovery in other parts of the world. The shift to digital commerce drove consumer demand for seamless experiences across channels. Amidst these trends, we executed on our strategies to continue to win business and grow share. 
We serve as the operating system for commerce across our client base, ranging from micro merchants to the world's largest corporations, financial institutions, banks and credit unions, Fintechs and governments. This enables us to focus not only on growth at our core, but also on new services, business models, and adjacencies. 
Given the strong results to date and our solid pipeline, we are raising our outlook range for internal revenue growth and now expect 10% to 12% growth for 2021 from 9% to 12% previously. Additionally, we are raising our adjusted EPS full year outlook and now expect a range of $5.50 to $5.60, up from $5.35 to $5.50 previously. The increased adjusted EPS guidance outlook represents a 24% to 27% growth versus last year. 
Drilling down to the business segments. The quarter was led by our Merchant Acceptance segment, which posted internal revenue growth of 41% year-over-year. Normalizing for the year-ago comps, the segment posted a 13% growth in the quarter on a 2-year basis above our pre-pandemic run rate. 
Both North America and international largely grew in line with the segment average. North America purchase volume was up 33% in the quarter led by strength in retail, petro, and restaurants. 
One of the trends that the pandemic has accelerated is the shift to omni-commerce. Consumers are increasingly looking to engage with merchants in whatever way is most convenient. Fiserv's ability to support clients with leading solutions in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce environments is a differentiator. 
We saw the manifestation of this trend during the second quarter as offline commerce recovered with volumes growing 46% versus 2020 and 11% versus 2019. Online commerce volume also grew unabated at 21% year-over-year, highlighting the criticality of equipping merchants with omnichannel commerce capabilities. 
[ Our lead ] in omni-commerce is the reason we were honored with the Omnichannel Provider of the Year award from the Strawhecker Group, a leading payments industry analyst firm. As you know, Clover, Carat, and Clover Connect are Fiserv's 3 leading platforms for small- and medium-sized merchants, enterprises and ISVs, respectively. 
Starting with Clover, GPV in the quarter grew 96% year-over-year, reflecting a 38% CAGR since 2019 to $184 billion on an annualized basis. In the SMB space, we continue to build out vertical-specific solutions in retail, restaurants, and services. 
Our vertical sector strategy aims at expanding beyond the buy button offering an integrated suite of products that help merchants generate revenue and run their business. Value-added services on the Clover platform include Corporate Capital, Clover Dining, Clover Order Ahead, and Clover Inventory as well as our unique app marketplace, which provides access to services such as payroll management, loyalty, and marketing that enable us to increase our share of the merchant's wallet and become the platform of choice. 
On the enterprise side, Carat, our enterprise omnichannel ecosystem, continued its strong momentum in the second quarter with new wins and continued innovation in key verticals. In restaurants, Carat powers digital commerce for 10 of the top 15 QSRs. 
Carat has helped Burger King expand its mobile payments experience into Latin America; in restaurant brands international expansion in the U.K. and other parts of EMEA. In grocery, where Carat now serves 9 of the top 10 grocers, we have helped new clients such as Wakefern, Aldi, and the companies of [ Ahold Delahays U.S.A. ], expand their digital grocery ordering capabilities with new payment types. 
Evidence of Carat's commitment to the grocery industry and transform digital experience is exemplified by Carat's leading online EBT program that has processed $2.5 billion in GPV year-to-date. 
In retail, where Carat serves 7 of the top 10 retailers, we expand the e-merchant services by working with clients such as adidas on innovative solutions, including a new consumer recommendation engine. [ This engine ] connects digital experiences to local stores enabled by the integration of [ Radius8 ], an acquisition we completed in the first quarter of this year. 
Carat has also established new at-scale leadership with crypto wallets where we power Carat's funds in and funds out solutions. Through this capability, we help consumers move more than $4 billion in payments volume in and out of wallets for the past 12 months. 
In the second quarter alone, we moved $2 billion of volume, demonstrating the sharp ramp in digital currency movement. 
Moving to Clover Connect, our ISV-focused offering, momentum continued in the second quarter with ISV volume up 122% year-over-year. We signed 53 new ISV partners in the quarter, bringing the new ISV partnerships to 95 year-to-date. 
We're signing up buyers fees that are new to payments and those that are converting from competitors. Year-to-date, almost half of our wins are competitive takeaways. Our ISV partners drive great value in getting access to our partner management tool, CoPilot, in integrating with Clover. 
On our Investor Day, we talked to you about our merchant acceptance growth strategy for international. We remain focused on growing our global market presence with world-class bank partners and through our direct channels, all while leveraging the strength of common platforms and connections. 
In the quarter, we announced the JV with Deutsche Bank in Germany that offers us access to over 800,000 merchants, many of whom will power with our Clover platform. In Asia Pacific region, we won a multi-country acquiring processing mandate from Citibank for its new integrated digital commerce offering, Spring by Citi. 
Early in July, we began onboarding and processing payment transactions as part of the merchant acquiring services agreement signed with Brazil's [ Casabank ] in April of this year. The onboarding began 70 days after contract signing once again, demonstrating our speed to market. 
In addition to the successes I mentioned above, in our Merchant Acceptance segment yesterday, we announced a strategic relationship with Goldman Sachs to integrate cross-border payment functionality into our B2B accounts receivable and accounts payable solution, Snap Pay. As you know, B2B payments is a vast and growing market, ripe with opportunity. We believe that in partnership with Goldman Sachs, we can deliver best-in-class B2B payment capabilities, enhancing visibility, operational efficiencies, and cost savings for our large and mid-market business clients. 
Moving to the Payments and Network segment. We posted internal revenue growth of 7% over the second quarter of last year. Positives in the quarter included the continued growth of sales, continued strength in debit transaction volume, initial recovery in credit account volumes, and international growth with some weakness in bill pay, although results improved sequentially. 
The differentiated and industry-leading businesses within our Payments and Network portfolio and our agile execution are the key reasons why we continue to win with clients. We are proceeding well with onboarding $120 million of credit issuing wins we told you about on our Investor Day. We completed boarding [ Atlantic ] in Q2 and have completed several stages of migrating both Alliance Data and Genesis Financial to the Optus environment. In less than 12 months, after announcing these 3 banner wins, we are poised to recognize revenue on all 3 clients in the third quarter of this year. 
We continue to grow our relationship with innovative growth-stage Fintechs, digital banks, and consumer lenders. In June, we signed an agreement with [ Prosper ], a Fintech pioneer and a premier AI-driven consumer lending marketplace for credit card processing services. This space is a growth focus for us. 
Our revenue with Fintech issuers grew over 300% during the first half of this year versus the same period in 2019. On Investor Day, you'll recall that driving best-in-class integrated digital consumer journeys is a key differentiator and imperative for our clients. 
Experiences are the new currency of loyalty. Customers gravitate towards institutions that could give them a unified, seamless experience across both channels and products. To that end, yesterday, we announced enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities for integrated digital banking and card management. 
This enriched mobile-first suite will enable financial institutions to offer their consumer and business customers a best-in-class digital banking experience that's designed for the way customers expect to engage. 
To introduce these enhanced capabilities, we rapidly integrated 2 recent acquisitions, [ On Dot and Spend Labs ]. The result is a single unified platform for consumer and small and midsized business cardholders that enables expense and business card management. 
This offering allows us to deliver a single point of access for all banking products. 
Our enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities will span all 3 business: In payments through a leading digital cardholder experience; in financial technology, by driving the penetration of our core account processing and digital surrounds; in merchant acceptance, by increasing the uptake of value-added services from integrating Spend Labs with our Clover platform. We expect to see incremental usage, engagement, and services revenue on the Fiserv platform as a result. 
Before I close out the Payments segment, I would like to mention the strong growth we are seeing in our debit networks, [ STAR and Excel ] as we are winning new issuers through our ability to support all transaction type, including best-in-class fraud management and chargeback products. 
Moving to the Financial Technologies segment. The quarter was in line with our expectations, posting internal revenue growth of 5%, including an 80 basis points headwind from periodic revenue. 
I want to highlight some key achievements in the quarter that reflect our strong market position. We added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 8 on the DNA platform and 4 in the over $1 billion asset size market. 
As the smaller end of the banking industry consolidates, we're moving up the asset chains, winning share in the $1 billion to $50 billion market. One such win is [ Sunstream ] business services, a service entity, which spans 12 financial institutions and provides business and technology services to farm credit associations, totaling more than $115 billion in assets. Sunstream will be convert into DNA in a number of surround solutions. 
Continuing our strong momentum in the de novo bank market, we signed LCA Financial Services, a newly created -- a newly chartered bank focused on small business. While we continue to win with our digital surround solutions, ability is the new paradigm in digital banking, a single retail and business online and mobile platform. 
We had our first client go live on the [ ABILITY ] platform in the second quarter with more than 100 clients signed up. We are also fully embracing openness as a strategy. 
The Fiserv Developer Studio is aimed at attracting the developer community to build innovative products using the range of APIs we expose across cards, payments, banking, small, medium and large businesses. Additionally, we are building a pre-integrated Fintech app marketplace where financial institutions clients can acquire, test, and deploy third-party apps seamlessly, easily and quickly. 
This openness strategy creates a net new revenue opportunity within our existing client base while widening the value-added services opportunity. 
With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. Through the second quarter, we already actioned $1.1 billion -- over $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to completing a $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. With the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. 
On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the second quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, we've already actioned $325 million in annual revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly and we expect to meet or exceed our $600 million target over the 5 years post merger. 
Revenue synergies in the quarter were driven by payments, debit network, and card sales across our 3 major client segments FIs, corporates, and government. Additionally, as the partner of choice, we continue to see momentum in our bank merchant program. 
Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results."

If you're following along on our slides, I will cover some of the detail on each of our segments, starting with Slide 4. 
We had a very strong second quarter, thanks to our broad portfolio of products and services as well as the positioning of our assets and strong execution of business. Total company internal revenue growth was 18% in the quarter, with growth across all segments and led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 41%. Year-to-date, total company internal revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 23%. 
Second quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 41% to $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 510 basis points to 33.9%. This margin improvement was driven by our outstanding revenue results and our continued and disciplined cost synergy execution, which produced $90 million of incremental cost synergies during the quarter as well as strong operating performance. 
First half adjusted operating income increased 28% to $2.4 billion. Adjusted operating margin through the end of June expanded 440 basis points to 32.7%. 
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 47% to $1.37 compared to $0.93 in the prior year. Through June 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $2.54, putting us on a pace to achieve our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, a testament to the incredible resiliency of this company. 
Free cash flow in the quarter of $897 million was in line with last year, with free cash flow for the first 6 months of the year, up 4% to $1.72 billion. Free cash flow conversion was 97% to adjusted net income, including a $172 million impact from reduced net operating loss carryforwards. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion came in at 100%, and we continue to expect at least 108% free cash flow conversion for 2021. 
Now looking at our segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a stellar 41% in the quarter and 23% year-to-date. Our results were driven by a strong performance of our SMB platform, Clover; our enterprise platform, Carat; and our ISV platform, Clover Connect. These results were driven by a strong global performance despite uneven economic recovery outside North America. 
The second quarter was a record quarter for Clover. In addition to a very strong 96% annualized GPV growth, this quarter was also the highest shipment volume for Clover hardware, having recently shipped our 2 millionth Clover device. 
Moving to Carat. We won 52 new global enterprise e-commerce clients on a platform in the quarter. Including existing clients, Carat won or expanded business with brands such as Sport Trade, Aldi, and [ Yak Stone ]. In India, Carat won the business of a leading digital food delivery platform. 
Our ISV volume in the quarter through Clover Connect grew 122% year-over-year. And we're winning both ISVs that are new to the payments as well as competitive takeaways. 
Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 135% to $524 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up more than 12 full percentage points to 31.4%, driven by the strength in the top line. Through June 30, adjusted operating income improved 80% to $911 million, and adjusted operating margin grew 950 basis points to 29.7%. 
The Payments and Network segment posted internal revenue growth of 7% in this quarter, resulting in a year-to-date growth of 4%. Debit transactions grew a strong 31% in the quarter and this was a low double-digit sequential grower versus last quarter. 
We continue to build upon the strong momentum of transaction growth in account-to-account transfers and P2P solutions. Versus prior year, Zelle transactions in the quarter were up 94% and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 88% in the quarter. 
Our bill pay business saw a sequential improvement in growth from Q1 and is expected to continue to improve through the second half of this year. 
We continue to expect to see the full year internal revenue growth for the Payments and Network segment to be toward the upper end of the medium-term growth rate of 5% to 8%. 
Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 14% to $636 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 260 basis points to 44.6% in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 8% to $1.2 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points to 43%. The results were driven by positive momentum in our issuer business and the impact of revenue and cost synergies. 
The Financial Technology segment, internal revenue grew in line with expectations at 5% in the second quarter as continued growth in high-quality recurring revenue was partially offset by lower periodic revenue, which created an 80 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth. For the first half of the year, internal revenue growth for the Financial Technology segment is now 4%, reaching the lower end of our medium-term outlook for the segment of 4% to 6%. 
Demand for our digital banking capabilities and for our deep offering of digital solutions continues to build momentum. As Frank mentioned, we added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter. 
Total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobility and Architect, grew 9% in the quarter. Mobile deposits in Q2 grew 12% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew 70% over last year. 
Adjusted operating income was up a strong 8% in the quarter to $273 million and up 14% year-to-date to $519 million. Adjusted operating margin in this segment increased a robust 80 basis points in the quarter to 36.2% and 300 basis points to 34.9% through the end of June, due to a combination of revenue growth, operational effectiveness benefits, and cost synergies. 
The adjusted corporate operating loss was $124 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations, up from last year, largely on higher variable compensation expenses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.3%, increasing 80 basis points versus prior year. We also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate will be fairly consistent with 2020 rate and at the lower end of our previously forecasted range of 21% to 22%. 
During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5 million shares for $588 million, and we have more than 55 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. 
We completed 2 acquisitions in the quarter, Spend Labs, a mobile native cloud-based commercial card payments and software company; and [ Pineapple Payments ], a leading independent sales organization focused on integrated payments. Additionally, we divested our remaining interest in the investment services business and received pretax proceeds of $460 million from the transaction. 
Total debt outstanding was $20.8 billion on June 30, and the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.3x, putting us well on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3x by the end of this year. 
We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investments in innovative solutions, and pursuing high-value acquisitions. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Frank."

In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our people and on our communities. Earlier this month, Fiserv was named by Forbes as the Best Employer for Diversity, recognizing our commitment to putting diversity at the forefront of our values and having implemented long-term initiatives to create a more inclusive environment. 
During the quarter, we published our first annual corporate social responsibility report, which is available on the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website. We also expanded our back-to-business grant program beyond the original locations that were selected in 2020. 
In May, we partnered with the New York Mets to recognize small businesses as part of our Asian, American, and Pacific Islander Heritage month. And in June, we awarded grants to businesses in Tulsa as part of the centennial observation of the Tulsa race massacre. 
None of these achievements would have been possible without our world-class talent. I thank our more than 40,000 associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. 
And finally, before I close, I want to congratulate the Milwaukee Box for winning the NBA championship at Fiserv Forum last week. The Box, our terrific partners, and our partnership goes way beyond putting our name on their arena. Clover has been deployed throughout Fiserv Forum for food and beverage concessions, providing attendees with seamless, quick and easy transactions.

And kind of what's different about the business now than prior to the pandemic one? I believe it was running closer to about 10%."

I do think you got to focus on the 3 legs in the U.S. and internationally. The 3 legs are Clover, Carat, and Clover Connect, right? And all of those were continued investments, continued build-out, and we're seeing it show up in the client's office. 
So I would say really driven by U.S. When you see that we say U.S. and international for the quarter performed fundamentally evenly, that was a spotty evenness, meaning not every country was the same, and you could kind of map to where recoveries are happen or not. 
So I think it's all about our platform strategy and our client strategy that's driving the outcomes. And I think our team's galvanized very well around it."

So the ability to take 2,100 mobility banks and bring them a fully integrated card experience at the highest level of card via the On Dot and bring that in a way that maybe a simple way to think about it is everything you can imagine in one application that allows you to do everything from originate transactions, to digital card issuance, to digital card view, to card-free cash, all in the same place that you're doing your bill pay and you're doing your Zelle transactions.

And then you got an integration of a Spend Lab into Clover, which allows -- these are our digital platforms. We're talking about digital platforms, one-of-a-kind digital platform. 
So -- and I think what you should take away, there's an element of this company that's digitally agile and can deliver, and you saw it on those credit conversions. I think those are good track rate speeds for those size and scope cautious unparalleled. 70 days from signing. We're boarding merchants for them every day.

So we're looking at versus prior year as well as versus 2019. 
But slight improvement in July versus what we saw in June, consistent with what we've got loaded in our full year outlook with that growth rate and EPS growth. Call it, mid-20%, 25%, 26% merchant growth -- volume growth over 2019. 
And in terms of yield, you saw a recovery, so to speak, in Q2 versus what we saw in Q1 as our SMB portfolio continues to grow nicely. I think that's going to be consistent in the second half of the year."

Second quarter was a very strong quarter for us across the company. Total company adjusted revenue grew 20%. Adjusted operating margin grew 510 basis points, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 41%. Adjusted EPS grew 47% to",2120,"Thank you, Shub. Second quarter was a very strong quarter for us across the company. 
Total company adjusted revenue grew 20%. Adjusted operating margin grew 510 basis points, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 41%. Adjusted EPS grew 47% to $1.37. Free cash flow in the quarter was in line with last year, just under $900 million, including the impact of a diminished NOL. Second quarter sales were up 31% with growth across the business. 
Our strong second quarter was driven by a combination of continued economic recovery and strong execution of our business strategy. 
On the macroeconomic side, we saw a continued recovery in the U.S. with uneven recovery in other parts of the world. The shift to digital commerce drove consumer demand for seamless experiences across channels. Amidst these trends, we executed on our strategies to continue to win business and grow share. 
We serve as the operating system for commerce across our client base, ranging from micro merchants to the world's largest corporations, financial institutions, banks and credit unions, Fintechs and governments. This enables us to focus not only on growth at our core, but also on new services, business models, and adjacencies. 
Given the strong results to date and our solid pipeline, we are raising our outlook range for internal revenue growth and now expect 10% to 12% growth for 2021 from 9% to 12% previously. Additionally, we are raising our adjusted EPS full year outlook and now expect a range of $5.50 to $5.60, up from $5.35 to $5.50 previously. The increased adjusted EPS guidance outlook represents a 24% to 27% growth versus last year. 
Drilling down to the business segments. The quarter was led by our Merchant Acceptance segment, which posted internal revenue growth of 41% year-over-year. Normalizing for the year-ago comps, the segment posted a 13% growth in the quarter on a 2-year basis above our pre-pandemic run rate. 
Both North America and international largely grew in line with the segment average. North America purchase volume was up 33% in the quarter led by strength in retail, petro, and restaurants. 
One of the trends that the pandemic has accelerated is the shift to omni-commerce. Consumers are increasingly looking to engage with merchants in whatever way is most convenient. Fiserv's ability to support clients with leading solutions in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce environments is a differentiator. 
We saw the manifestation of this trend during the second quarter as offline commerce recovered with volumes growing 46% versus 2020 and 11% versus 2019. Online commerce volume also grew unabated at 21% year-over-year, highlighting the criticality of equipping merchants with omnichannel commerce capabilities. 
Our lead in omni-commerce is the reason we were honored with the Omnichannel Provider of the Year award from the Strawhecker Group, a leading payments industry analyst firm. As you know, Clover, Carat, and Clover Connect are Fiserv's 3 leading platforms for small- and medium-sized merchants, enterprises and ISVs, respectively. 
Starting with Clover, GPV in the quarter grew 96% year-over-year, reflecting a 38% CAGR since 2019 to $184 billion on an annualized basis. In the SMB space, we continue to build out vertical-specific solutions in retail, restaurants, and services. 
Our vertical sector strategy aims at expanding beyond the buy button offering an integrated suite of products that help merchants generate revenue and run their business. Value-added services on the Clover platform include Corporate Capital, Clover Dining, Clover Order Ahead, and Clover Inventory as well as our unique app marketplace, which provides access to services such as payroll management, loyalty, and marketing that enable us to increase our share of the merchant's wallet and become the platform of choice. 
On the enterprise side, Carat, our enterprise omnichannel ecosystem, continued its strong momentum in the second quarter with new wins and continued innovation in key verticals. In restaurants, Carat powers digital commerce for 10 of the top 15 QSRs. 
Carat has helped Burger King expand its mobile payments experience into Latin America; in restaurant brands, international expansion in the U.K. and other parts of EMEA. In grocery, where Carat now serves 9 of the top 10 grocers, we have helped new clients such as Wakefern, Aldi, and the companies of Ahold Delhaize U.S.A., expand their digital grocery ordering capabilities with new payment types. 
Evidence of Carat's commitment to the grocery industry and transform digital experience is exemplified by Carat's leading online EBT program that has processed $2.5 billion in GPV year-to-date. 
In retail, where Carat serves 7 of the top 10 retailers, we expand the e-merchant services by working with clients such as adidas on innovative solutions, including a new consumer recommendation engine. This engine connects digital experiences to local stores enabled by the integration of Radius8, an acquisition we completed in the first quarter of this year. 
Carat has also established new at-scale leadership with crypto wallets where we power Carat's funds in and funds out solutions. Through this capability, we help consumers move more than $4 billion in payments volume in and out of wallets for the past 12 months. 
In the second quarter alone, we moved $2 billion of volume, demonstrating the sharp ramp in digital currency movement. 
Moving to Clover Connect, our ISV-focused offering, momentum continued in the second quarter with ISV volume up 122% year-over-year. We signed 53 new ISV partners in the quarter, bringing the new ISV partnerships to 95 year-to-date. 
We're signing up buyers fees that are new to payments and those that are converting from competitors. Year-to-date, almost half of our wins are competitive takeaways. Our ISV partners drive great value in getting access to our partner management tool, CoPilot, in integrating with Clover. 
On our Investor Day, we talked to you about our Merchant Acceptance growth strategy for international. We remain focused on growing our global market presence with world-class bank partners and through our direct channels, all while leveraging the strength of common platforms and connections. 
In the quarter, we announced the JV with Deutsche Bank in Germany that offers us access to over 800,000 merchants, many of whom we'll power with our Clover platform. In Asia Pacific region, we won a multi-country acquiring processing mandate from Citibank for its new integrated digital commerce offering, Spring by Citi. 
Early in July, we began onboarding and processing payment transactions as part of the merchant acquiring services agreement signed with Brazil's Caixa Bank in April of this year. The onboarding began 70 days after contract signing once again, demonstrating our speed to market. 
In addition to the successes I mentioned above, in our Merchant Acceptance segment yesterday, we announced a strategic relationship with Goldman Sachs to integrate cross-border payment functionality into our B2B accounts receivable and accounts payable solution, SnapPay. As you know, B2B payments is a vast and growing market, ripe with opportunity. We believe that in partnership with Goldman Sachs, we can deliver best-in-class B2B payment capabilities, enhancing visibility, operational efficiencies, and cost savings for our large and mid-market business clients. 
Moving to the Payments and Network segment. We posted internal revenue growth of 7% over the second quarter of last year. Positives in the quarter included the continued growth of sales, continued strength in debit transaction volume, initial recovery in credit account volumes, and international growth with some weakness in bill pay, although results improved sequentially. 
The differentiated and industry-leading businesses within our Payments and Network portfolio and our agile execution are the key reasons why we continue to win with clients. We are proceeding well with onboarding $120 million of credit issuing wins we told you about on our Investor Day. We completed boarding Atlanticus in Q2 and have completed several stages of migrating both Alliance Data and Genesis Financial to the Optus environment. In less than 12 months, after announcing these 3 banner wins, we are poised to recognize revenue on all 3 clients in the third quarter of this year. 
We continue to grow our relationship with innovative growth-stage Fintechs, digital banks, and consumer lenders. In June, we signed an agreement with Prosper, a Fintech pioneer and a premier AI-driven consumer lending marketplace for credit card processing services. This space is a growth focus for us. 
Our revenue with Fintech issuers grew over 300% during the first half of this year versus the same period in 2019. On Investor Day, you'll recall that driving best-in-class integrated digital consumer journeys is a key differentiator and imperative for our clients. 
Experiences are the new currency of loyalty. Customers gravitate towards institutions that could give them a unified, seamless experience across both channels and products. To that end, yesterday, we announced enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities for integrated digital banking and card management. 
This enriched mobile-first suite will enable financial institutions to offer their consumer and business customers a best-in-class digital banking experience that's designed for the way customers expect to engage. 
To introduce these enhanced capabilities, we rapidly integrated 2 recent acquisitions, Ondot and SpendLabs. The result is a single unified platform for consumer and small and midsized business cardholders that enables expense and business card management. 
This offering allows us to deliver a single point of access for all banking products. 
Our enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities will span all 3 business segments: In Payments through a leading digital cardholder experience; in Financial Technology, by driving the penetration of our core account processing and digital surrounds; in Merchant Acceptance, by increasing the uptake of value-added services from integrating SpendLabs with our Clover platform. We expect to see incremental usage, engagement, and services revenue on the Fiserv platform as a result. 
Before I close out the Payments segment, I would like to mention the strong growth we are seeing in our debit networks, STAR and Accel as we are winning new issuers through our ability to support all transaction type, including best-in-class fraud management and chargeback products. 
Moving to the Financial Technologies segment. The quarter was in line with our expectations, posting internal revenue growth of 5%, including an 80 basis points headwind from periodic revenue. 
I want to highlight some key achievements in the quarter that reflect our strong market position. We added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 8 on the DNA platform and 4 in the over $1 billion asset size market. 
As the smaller end of the banking industry consolidates, we're moving up the asset chains, winning share in the $1 billion to $50 billion market. One such win is SunStream business services, a service entity, which spans 12 financial institutions and provides business and technology services to farm credit associations, totaling more than $115 billion in assets. SunStream will be convert into DNA in a number of surround solutions. 
Continuing our strong momentum in the de novo bank market, we signed [ LCA ] Financial Services, a newly created -- a newly chartered bank focused on small business. While we continue to win with our digital surround solutions, Abiliti is the new paradigm in digital banking, a single retail and business online and mobile platform. 
We had our first client go live on the Abiliti platform in the second quarter with more than 100 clients signed up. We are also fully embracing openness as a strategy. 
The Fiserv Developer Studio is aimed at attracting the developer community to build innovative products using the range of APIs we expose across cards, payments, banking, small, medium and large businesses. Additionally, we are building a pre-integrated Fintech app marketplace where our financial institutions clients can acquire, test, and deploy third-party apps seamlessly, easily and quickly. 
This openness strategy creates a net new revenue opportunity within our existing client base while widening the value-added services opportunity. 
With that, let me update you on our integration efforts. Through the second quarter, we already actioned $1.1 billion -- over $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to completing a $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. With the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. 
On the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the second quarter. As of the end of the second quarter, we've already actioned $325 million in annual revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly and we expect to meet or exceed our $600 million target over the 5 years post merger. 
Revenue synergies in the quarter were driven by payments, debit network, and card sales across our 3 major client segments: FIs, corporates, and government. Additionally, as the partner of choice, we continue to see momentum in our bank merchant program. 
Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results."

If you're following along on our slides, I will cover some of the detail on each of our segments, starting with Slide 4. 
We had a very strong second quarter, thanks to our broad portfolio of products and services as well as the positioning of our assets and strong execution across the business. Total company internal revenue growth was 18% in the quarter, with growth across all segments and led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 41%. Year-to-date, total company internal revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 23%. 
Second quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 41% to $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 510 basis points to 33.9%. This margin improvement was driven by our outstanding revenue results and our continued and disciplined cost synergy execution, which produced $90 million of incremental cost synergies during the quarter as well as strong operating performance. 
First half adjusted operating income increased 28% to $2.4 billion. Adjusted operating margin through the end of June expanded 440 basis points to 32.7%. 
Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 47% to $1.37 compared to $0.93 in the prior year. Through June 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $2.54, putting us on a pace to achieve our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, a testament to the incredible resiliency of this company. 
Free cash flow in the quarter of $897 million was in line with last year, with free cash flow for the first 6 months of the year, up 4% to $1.72 billion. Free cash flow conversion was 97% to adjusted net income, including a $172 million impact from reduced net operating loss carryforwards. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion came in at 100%, and we continue to expect at least 108% free cash flow conversion for 2021. 
Now looking at our segment results. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a stellar 41% in the quarter and 23% year-to-date. Our results were driven by a strong performance of our SMB platform, Clover; our enterprise platform, Carat; and our ISV platform, Clover Connect. These results were driven by a strong global performance despite uneven economic recovery outside North America. 
The second quarter was a record quarter for Clover. In addition to a very strong 96% annualized GPV growth, this quarter was also the highest shipment volume for Clover hardware, having recently shipped our 2 millionth Clover device. 
Moving to Carat. We won 52 new global enterprise e-commerce clients on a platform in the quarter. Including existing clients, Carat won or expanded business with brands such as [ Sport Trade ], Aldi, and [ Yak Stone ]. In India, Carat won the business of a leading digital food delivery platform. 
Our ISV volume in the quarter through Clover Connect grew 122% year-over-year. And we're winning both ISVs that are new to the payments as well as competitive takeaways. 
Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 135% to $524 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up more than 12 full percentage points to 31.4%, driven by the strength in the top line. Through June 30, adjusted operating income improved 80% to $911 million, and adjusted operating margin grew 950 basis points to 29.7%. 
The Payments and Network segment posted internal revenue growth of 7% in this quarter, resulting in a year-to-date growth of 4%. Debit transactions grew a strong 31% in the quarter and this was a low double-digit sequential grower versus last quarter. 
We continue to build upon the strong momentum of transaction growth in account-to-account transfers and P2P solutions. Versus prior year, Zelle transactions in the quarter were up 94% and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 88% in the quarter. 
Our bill pay business saw a sequential improvement in growth from Q1 and is expected to continue to improve through the second half of this year. 
We continue to expect to see the full year internal revenue growth for the Payments and Network segment to be toward the upper end of the medium-term growth rate of 5% to 8%. 
Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 14% to $636 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 260 basis points to 44.6% in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 8% to $1.2 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points to 43%. The results were driven by positive momentum in our issuer business and the impact of revenue and cost synergies. 
The Financial Technology segment, internal revenue grew in line with expectations at 5% in the second quarter as continued growth in high-quality recurring revenue was partially offset by lower periodic revenue, which created an 80 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth. For the first half of the year, internal revenue growth for the Financial Technology segment is now 4%, reaching the lower end of our medium-term outlook for the segment of 4% to 6%. 
Demand for our digital banking capabilities and for our deep offering of digital solutions continues to build momentum. As Frank mentioned, we added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter. 
Total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, Mobiliti and Architect, grew 9% in the quarter. Mobile deposits in Q2 grew 12% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew 70% over last year. 
Adjusted operating income was up a strong 8% in the quarter to $273 million and up 14% year-to-date to $519 million. Adjusted operating margin in this segment increased a robust 80 basis points in the quarter to 36.2% and 300 basis points to 34.9% through the end of June, due to a combination of revenue growth, operational effectiveness benefits, and cost synergies. 
The adjusted corporate operating loss was $124 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations, up from last year, largely on higher variable compensation expenses. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.3%, increasing 80 basis points versus prior year. We also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate will be fairly consistent with 2020 rate and at the lower end of our previously forecasted range of 21% to 22%. 
During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5 million shares for $588 million, and we have more than 55 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. 
We completed 2 acquisitions in the quarter, SpendLabs, a mobile native cloud-based commercial card payments and software company; and Pineapple Payments, a leading independent sales organization focused on integrated payments. Additionally, we divested our remaining interest in the investment services business and received pretax proceeds of $466 million from the transaction. 
Total debt outstanding was $20.8 billion on June 30, and the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.3x, putting us well on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3x by the end of this year. 
We are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investments in innovative solutions, and pursuing high-value acquisitions. Importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Frank."

I'm very proud of the results we've delivered. The quality of our assets, our relentless focus on innovation, our agility, speed of new client implementation with examples like [ Caixa ], ADS, Atlanticus and Genesis put us in a great spot to serve our clients. 
Our speed to market with the enhanced Fiserv digital capabilities for banking and card management announced yesterday, along with the integration of business expense management into the Clover platform, all of which leverage the full capabilities of recent acquisitions, Ondot and SpendLabs add to our continued success. 
In addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our people and on our communities. Earlier this month, Fiserv was named by Forbes as the Best Employer for Diversity, recognizing our commitment to putting diversity at the forefront of our values and having implemented long-term initiatives to create a more inclusive environment. 
During the quarter, we published our first annual corporate social responsibility report, which is available on the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website. We also expanded our back-to-business grant program beyond the original locations that were selected in 2020. 
In May, we partnered with the New York Mets to recognize small businesses as part of our Asian, American, and Pacific Islander Heritage month. And in June, we awarded grants to businesses in Tulsa as part of the centennial observation of the Tulsa race massacre. 
None of these achievements would have been possible without our world-class talent. I thank our more than 40,000 associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders. 
And finally, before I close, I want to congratulate the Milwaukee Bucks for winning the NBA championship at Fiserv Forum last week. The Bucks, our terrific partners, and our partnership goes way beyond putting our name on their arena. Clover has been deployed throughout Fiserv Forum for food and beverage concessions, providing attendees with seamless, quick and easy transactions. They also partnered with us for several back-to-business events earlier this year. Congratulations to the entire Milwaukee Bucks organization. 
With that, operator, let's open up the line for questions."

And then two, I wanted to kind of just drill into it a little bit, given that that's above your medium-term outlook for that segment, which as per Investor Day, was 9% to 12%. Can you just highlight like what you're seeing, say, in North America versus ex-U.S.? And are there any unusual dynamics in this quarter? Or do you see that sustainable going forward? And kind of what's different about the business now than prior to the pandemic one? I believe it was running closer to about 10%."

So I would say really driven by U.S. When you see that we say U.S. and international for the quarter performed fundamentally evenly, that was a spotty evenness, meaning not every country was the same, and you could kind of map to where recoveries are happen or not. 
So I think it's all about our platform strategy and our client strategy that's driving the outcomes. And I think our team's galvanized very well around it."

So we see this as a game changer. So it's early innings. We got banks up and running on it, and we will deploy. And then you hear us talking about on top of all of that, for financial institutions. We bring in Abiliti that sits on top of all of it. 
But the most important thing to think about is our cores are strategic. The front end though is where we believe the tip of the spear and where we win to help our clients serve their clients. And I mean, you saw what we posted now, but I look forward to continuing to generate more revenue through better function we bring to clients that allow them to do more with their clients. 
And then you got an integration of a SpendLab into Clover, which allows -- these are our digital platforms. We're talking about digital platforms, one-of-a-kind digital platform. 
So -- and I think what you should take away, there's an element of this company that's digitally agile and can deliver, and you saw it on those credit conversions. I think those are good track rate speeds for those size and scope cautious unparalleled. 70 days from signing. We're boarding merchants for them every day. And then you look at us taking SpendLabs and Ondot and I think we're going to have that same effect that Clover had when we look years out from now."

I don't think it needs to be dilutive to EPS. I think we know how to make it accretive, pretty darn quick. And what I just talked about was kind of the dream of the acquisition when we put the companies together, that we could take an asset like an Ondot and spread it all the way through because of what a great bank partner we were and that we could bring it all the way from merchant to our Fintech. 
So I think you should expect us to continue to do more like that. And I think we have a skill at it, that we keep the talent, we grow the talent, and we build a bigger digital gene pool in the process."

And thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda. 
As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, fintechs and businesses, ranging from SMBs, to mid-market, to large enterprises. We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. We are also seeing real benefits from the ongoing economic recovery, especially here in the U.S. We remain optimistic and continue to invest in growth. 
Turning to our performance. We had a strong third quarter, with total company adjusted revenue up 10%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 34.2%. Adjusted EPS grew 23% to $1.47. We attained our highest quarter of actioned revenue synergies of $95 million. To date, we have achieved $420 million of actioned revenue synergies, 70% of the increased commitment of $600 million for the 5-year period following the merger. 
As we invested to accelerate growth, free cash flow came in at $572 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow was driven by a combination of the following: first, increased capital expenditure in the areas of technology, innovation hubs and the integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, the working capital increase driven by revenue growth; and finally, reduced benefit of unmet operating loss carryforwards. 
On the back of our results and the strength of our investments, we are tightening our outlook for organic revenue growth and raising the lower end of our outlook for adjusted EPS. We now expect organic constant currency growth of 11% for the full year and adjusted earnings per share between $5.55 and $5.60. This raises the lower end of our prior adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.05, a growth of 26% to 27% over last year. 
Turning to the business segments. 
Let me start with Merchant Acceptance. We continue to grow beyond the buy button by investing in world-class omnichannel capabilities, solutioning around vertical and horizontal business needs and capturing new flows. We achieved all of this throughout 3 growth platforms: Clover for Small Business, Clover Connect for ISV and Carry for enterprises. 
Driving into our performance, Merchant Acceptance led the quarter, posting organic revenue growth of 18% year-over-year, with North America and International largely in line with the segment average for the quarter. Our global Merchant locations have been growing at a healthy clip, up 10% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, driven by positive net new Merchants across all regions. 
The quarter was driven by growth in global volume and transactions of 15% and 12%, respectively. North America volume and transactions grew 14% and 9%, respectively, led by strength in travel, restaurants and petro. Excluding the impact of the loss of a large processing client through one of our JVs, North America volume and transaction growth in the quarter would have been 19% and 14%, respectively. 
Next, let's go deeper by platform, starting with Clover. EPV grew 47% year-over-year or a 39% CAGR since 2019 to $196 billion on an annualized basis. In the SMB space, we remain focused in building vertical-specific solutions, offering an integrated suite of products that help merchants generate revenue and run their business. 
As part of our vertical strategy, we entered into an agreement to acquire Bento Box, a digital marketing, e-commerce platform focused on driving growth and engagement for restaurants. This transaction will expand our Clover dining solutions and industry-leading commerce and business management capabilities, which already enable nearly 200,000 restaurants of all sizes to deliver unique and differentiating dining experience, from quick and casual to fine dining. We expect the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. 
Additionally, we continue to focus on building value-added services for the Clover platform, including Clover Capital, Clover Dining, Clover Order Ahead and Clover Inventory, as well as our unique Clover app marketplace. 
On the enterprise side, Carat, our enterprise omnichannel platform, continued its strong momentum in the third quarter, with new wins, product innovation and a gradual recovery in cross-border commerce. Global e-commerce volume grew unabated in the quarter, driven by cross-border and international growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis, as volumes recovered from the pandemic lows, with secular tailwinds expected to sustain future momentum. 
Omnichannel transactions, such as Order Ahead and Buy Online Pickup in Store, grew 35% in the quarter. We had notable e-commerce wins in the quarter, including Johnson & Johnson and Cees Entertainment. We also expanded our existing global acquiring relationship with Microsoft to be their provider for network tokens. 
In the quarter, we added PayPal and Venmo as digital wallet payout options to our global platform, submitting Carat as a leader in digital payouts, with over $10 billion processed year-to-date, an increase of 230% on a year-over-year basis. 
Additionally, we are building a new partnership with Baakt, a leading crypto and consumer wallet solution provider. Baakt will utilize Fiserv's industry-leading funds in, funds out solution, and together by serving Baakt, will develop new crypto use cases from both merchant and FI clients. 
Moving to Clover Connect. The strength of our ISV focused offering showed through the third quarter with ISV volume up 71% year-over-year. Clover Connect allows us to bring together 2 strong Fiserv assets. the world-class hardware and software platform on Clover, along with the best-in-class partner management and operational tool of copilot, which gives ISVs a unique view into all of the merchants' activities, ranging from merchant application processing to support. 
Our commitment to being the best partner for ISVs is resonating. We signed 47 new ISVs in the third quarter, bringing our total wins to 142 year-to-date. We continue signing up ISVs that are new to payments and winning against the competition. This quarter, more than half of our wins were competitive takeaways. 
Before I address our international progress, I'd like to highlight another focus area in our Merchant business, point-of-sale lending. We are leveraging our position as the operating platform for businesses small, medium and large to offer a range of buying out, pay later options. We are expanding our referral relationships while simplifying the merchant experience through integrations with our platforms like Clover. We currently have referral agreements with ZIP, Citizens Pay and Brad. We're also working with our FI clients to bring their BNPL offerings to market. For example, we are partnering with St. to offer buy now, pay later solutions on our card processing platform, Optus. Synchrony also recently announced acceptance of private label cards through Clover. 
On our Investor Day, we talked to you about our merchant acceptance growth strategy for international. We remain focused on growing our global market presence with world-class bank partners and through our direct channels, all while leveraging the strength of common platforms and connections. 
The global expansion of Clover platform into APAC, Latin America and EMEA are all currently in flight. We're on track to roll out Clover in India by the third quarter of 2022, a tremendous opportunity given the size and growth potential of the market. Clover is already in market in Argentina and is expected to launch in Brazil next year, thereby covering the 2 largest markets in Latin America. In EMEA, Clover is in market across the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland, with a further boost expected with the rollout of the Deutsche Bank JV that we announced last quarter. Among the key APAC deals completed in the quarter is an omnichannel merchant acquirer processing mandate from Bank of China for their fast-growing Macau market. 
Moving to EMEA, Fiserv partnered with Host Finance, one of the largest financial institutions in Switzerland, to provide credit card acquiring services to their Swiss merchant clients. We're starting with an initial 4,000 merchants that accept the post-finance card today, with plans to expand to the Italian merchant base of 60,000 over time. 
Fiserv is also supporting restaurant brands, owner of iconic brands, including Burger King and Popeye, as the company expands its footprint across Europe with omnichannel approach. Fiserv will provide acquiring services for Burger King in the U.K. and the Nordics and Popeyes in the U.K. 
To close on the Merchant segment. As you may recall, in April, we won a 20-year deal to become the exclusive provider of merchant acquiring services for Caixa Economica Federal, one of the largest Brazilian banks. We are pleased to report that the implementation of this mandate started at the beginning of August and is going extremely well, with 65,000 merchants onboarded as of last week. 
Moving to the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 5%. Our Payments segment consists of 3 businesses: Global Credit Processing and Output Solutions, which we call Issuer Solutions, which is 40% of the segment; Debit Processing and Debit Networks, which we call -- refer to as Card Services, also 1/3 of the segment; and the third business is comprised of digital solutions, bill pay and our prepaid business. 
Our Issuer Solutions business, which grew just below the overall Payments segment average, is seeing the benefit of a continued credit recovery, with general purpose credit gross active accounts up in the high single-digits. Note that our credit Issuer Solutions revenue is driven by a number of accounts, not credit volume. However, as credit volumes recover, the number of accounts will follow. Looking ahead, we expect growth in the business to be driven by the continued ramp of last year's notable wins, including 3 of the top 25 issuer wins, which we announced last year. 
We also recently completed PNC's conversion of BBVA's card portfolios through our platform. Our retail private label portfolio also continues to recover from its COVID lows, although at a slower pace than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. 
Within Card Services, which grew organic revenue a couple of points faster than the overall Payment segment average, we saw a strong growth in debit transactions, driving our issuance and network businesses. Looking ahead, we expect to sustain growth for this business by broadening our total addressable market. For instance,  in the quarter, our STAR debit network signed an agreement with leading U.S. consumer fintech, Chime, to become its preferred unaffiliated network for debit. We believe that aligning one of the largest fintech issuers is a testimony to the scale and technical capabilities of the STAR network and positions the network well for future growth. This was also one of our notable action synergy revenues in the quarter. 
During our Investor Day, we discussed the opportunity to offer a fully managed by Fiserv credit card issuing option to community FIs and shared that we were actively exploring this market. We are pleased to announce that we are currently piloting our agent credit program offering branded Credit Choice and will launch in Q1 2022. Credit Choice is a fully managed credit card issuing as a service solution that allows our community FIs to offer their customers an FI branded credit card experience that is fully integrated into their debit solution, but without the operational burden of running their own credit card portfolio. Credit Choice leverages our scale distribution and world-class card issuing surround solutions, such as Ondot and Spend Labs to expand into a sizable new addressable market for Fiserv where the economics per card are considerably richer than in processing. We have already seen strong early interest from clients, with hundreds of prospects in the pipeline. 
On our Q2 call, we spoke to you about our enriched mobile first consumer and business offerings powered by recent acquisitions, Ondot and Spend Labs. The early results of the launch have been very encouraging. We completed the integration of the Card Hub platform into our credit and debit processing platforms and into our mobility mobile banking platform. We are seeing tremendous demand for this integrated solution from both new prospects as well as existing Card Vale clients, whom we expect to fully migrate to the integrated Card Hub solution by the end of 2022. In addition, we expect to expand the platform to add loyalty, installment payment and dispute management, thereby establishing Card Hub as a key differentiator to drive new sales and client retention. 
For our financial institution clients, this solution is a game changer. It enhances consumer engagement with their digital banking platform, creates more fee income through greater card usage, and catapults the FI's overall digital experience into the leagues of some of the world's top banks and neobanks. 
In the third business, results are mixed. We had good growth in our digital payments activity, led by Zelle transaction growth of 75% in the quarter and the number of clients live now reaching just under 750. Prepaid growth was driven by new client wins within our Gift Solutions business. We expect growth to continue, driven by new use cases. 
Our Bill Pay business, which encompasses both the direct biller and bill pay through our financial institutions, continues to grow slower than expected. However, we're extending our bill pay capabilities beyond the financial institution channel, going live later this month as an enabler of PayPal's bill payment functionality within PayPal's new app. Additionally, we expanded our relationship with a large telecom provider to enable commercial card payments with our Built Matrix solution. 
Moving to the Financial Technology segment. The quarter was in line with our expectations, posting organic revenue growth of 4%, resulting in 4% growth year-to-date. We added 14 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 7 competitive takeaways and 2 de novo wins. Our DNA platform is seeing great success, including with larger financial institutions, as evidenced in the Valley National Bank and Dollar Bank wins, with assets over $40 billion and $10 billion, respectively. 
Ability, our modern cloud-based, API-driven digital banking platform, is seeing great momentum with 150 incremental sales in the quarter. 138 of these sales were to existing clients, which will drive our clients' digital transformation and deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds, such as Card Hub and Sale and Spend Labs. The remaining 12 were new logo sales, with half being core competitive takeaways. 
We also continue to enrich our open banking and fintech ecosystem, again, in line with the goals laid out in last year's investor conference. We launched our new development portal, which we call the Fiserv Developer Studio, towards the end of the third quarter. The Developer Studio provides rich and expansive API integrations to support banks, fintechs, merchants and enterprise clients with developer tools needed to accelerate innovation, integrations across the entire Fiserv ecosystem. Additionally, we also announced partnerships with exciting new fintechs, FutureFuel.iO and Street Shares, aimed at creating new white space opportunities in digital for both retail consumer and small business lending, respectively. 
We believe that we're extremely well positioned to continue to drive revenue in the segment higher by delivering new innovation, such as Ability, strategically acquiring and integrating attractive surrounding solutions like Ondot and SpendLabs and leveraging the power of the developer community through our developer Studio API portal or dedicated go-to-market integrations like FutureFuel.IO and Street Shares. 
Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results."

Before I begin reviewing the detailed business results, as Shub mentioned, we are aligning with the broader community and simplifying our message by clarifying our internal revenue growth metric as organic constant currency revenue. This does not change how we calculate this measure, just clarifies the terminology. It will be the same definition in calculations we've used in prior quarters. 
On Slide 11, we've included a new schedule to clearly provide an understanding of the walk from GAAP revenue to internal or organic revenue for the third quarter. This summary can be seen in more detail in the appendix of our presentation. 
Now I will cover some detail on each of our segments. If you're following along on our slides, I'm starting with Slide 4. 
We feel great about our performance for both the quarter and the first 9 months of the year. And we are well positioned to achieve strong full year financial results. 
Total company organic revenue was up 10% in the quarter, with growth across all segments, led by Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 18%. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 21%. Total company adjusted revenue also grew 10% to nearly $4 billion in the quarter. Year-to-date, total company adjusted revenue has grown 11% to $11.4 billion. 
Third quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.4 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by 130 basis points to 34.2%. This margin improvement was driven by our strong revenue results and our continued disciplined cost synergy execution, which produced $64 million of incremental cost synergies during the quarter. And we have now actioned $1.16 billion program today. 
Year-to-date, adjusted operating income increased 23% to $3.8 billion. Adjusted operating margin year-to-date expanded 330 basis points to 33.2%. 
Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 23% to $1.47 compared to $1.20 in the prior year. Through September 30, adjusted earnings per share grew 29% to $4.01, putting us on pace to achieve our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, a testament to the incredible strength and resiliency of this company. 
Free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was $2.3 billion, resulting in an 85% free cash flow conversion. This result was driven by increased capital investments related to technology, world-class facilities and the integration of newly acquired businesses, a working capital increase driven by revenue growth and a reduction in the net operating loss carryforward benefit. With these investments and strong revenue growth, we now expect free cash flow conversion to be 95% to 100% for the full year. 
Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 6. 
Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very strong 18% in the quarter and 21% year-to-date. Our revenue was driven by a combination of growth in volume and transactions. Our results were once again driven by strong performance across all 3 platforms: Clover for SMBs, Carat for large businesses and Clover Connect for ISVs. 
Clover continues to build upon the momentum and strength of our product offering as it posted a very strong 47% GPV growth year-over-year or $196 billion on an annualized basis, with growth across all of our distribution channels. 
With Carat, we won 45 new global enterprise e-commerce clients on the platform in the quarter. In addition, Carat expanded its mandate with existing high-quality brands such as Valero. Continuous lead in the high-growth online EBT space, Carat has launched more than 50 clients to online EBT in the past 12 months. 
Our ISV volume in this quarter through Clover Connect grew 71% year-over-year and up almost 150% versus the third quarter of 2019. We are winning both ISVs that are new to payments as well as competitive takeaways. 
Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 30% to $552 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points to 32.2%, driven by top line strength. Through September 30, adjusted operating income improved 57% to $1.5 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 710 basis points to 30.6%. 
Turning to Slide 7. 
The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 5%. As Frank outlined in his composition of the segment, our card services, digital payments and prepaid businesses outperformed the segment organic revenue growth rate. 
Global Issuer Solutions came in just under the segment average, while Bill Pay was a headwind. Account to account transfers and P2P solutions continue to rise with consumer demand. Zelle transactions in the quarter were up 75%, and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 65% in the quarter. The other transactions grew 11% in the quarter, a strong result in light of the tougher year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter versus the second quarter, driven by the macro impact of the reduced benefits of the stimulus. 
Given the performance year-to-date, we expect to see the Payments and Network segment's full year organic revenue rate to be within the medium-term outlook growth rate of 5% to 8%, driven by the continued ramp in new client onboarding and strong uptake of our advanced digital offering. However, this outlook is slightly tempered versus our previous expectation of approaching the higher end of 5% to 8% organic revenue growth target range. 
Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 7% to $650 million and adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points to 44.0% in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 7% to $1.9 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 110 basis points to 43.4%. The results were driven by positive momentum in our card and issuer business and the positive impact of revenue and cost synergies. 
Turning to Slide 8. 
The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew at 4% in the quarter. Year-to-date, organic revenue growth for the segment is 4%, within our medium-term outlook for this segment of 4% to 6%. 
Our digital banking capabilities and digital solution offerings continue to win in the marketplace. As Frank mentioned, we added 14 new core account processing clients in the quarter, half of which were competitive takeaways. We completed our integration of Ondot card management capabilities into our mobile banking platform and are currently in market with that offering. Mobile deposits in Q3 grew 10.5% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew nearly 60% over last year. 
Adjusted operating income was up 4% in the quarter to $275 million and up 10% year-to-date to $794 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 40 basis points in the quarter to 36.0%. However, on a 2-year basis, adjusted operating margin has increased 560 basis points versus the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating margins expanded 190 basis points to 35.3% year-to-date. 
The adjusted corporate operating loss was $121 million in the quarter, in line with last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.3%, improving 260 basis points versus prior year. And we now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 20%. 
During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing over 3 million shares for $365 million. We have more than 52 million shares remaining authorized for share repurchase. 
As Frank mentioned, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to acquire Bento Box, a digital marketing and e-commerce platform focused on driving growth and engagement for restaurants that we will integrate into Clover's dining solutions to further strengthen our omnichannel restaurant platform. We expect to close this transaction later this quarter. 
Total debt outstanding was $21 billion on September 30 and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 32 to 3.2x. 
Q3 was another demonstration of our time-tested capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment, innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Frank."

And we're extending our total addressable market with the capability that will start with restaurants, but actually could be a storefront and much larger. But all of these are nurturing good, strong startups that then will allow to thrive in our environment. And we put the capital behind them to integrate them and grow. And you hear how we bring Spend Labs along with it. So I think you should expect us to continue that and realize that -- I think we believe we have a deep skill set in integrating properties, transforming our property itself. In some cases, we're even disrupting ourselves in the process as we move from CardValet to Card Up to an integration. So you should expect us to continue to do that and be very, very thoughtful about acquisitions. But we will invest inorganically and we'll invest organically.

Because I mean, at the end of the day, I know, on a quarterly basis, obviously, working capital can move around, but the full year revenue is coming in right in line with your plan. Presumably, the diminished benefit of the NOL would have been known previously. So is this really just a function of kind of higher CapEx than you anticipated at the end of the day versus what you were thinking last quarter?"

So we're growing quite a bit faster than we originally expected overall. We are also seeing meaningful opportunities to invest for growth. So to your point, CapEx is higher in terms of spending on creating new capabilities, new products and services, as well as integrating the acquisitions that we announced earlier in the year, things like Ondot, the software development that we're investing there to not only integrate into our existing capabilities, our other products and services, but to create new capability with some of those acquisitions, led us to make the decision to continue to invest in growth and still have very good free cash flow and good cash conversion overall."

There seems to be some debate or discussion among investors about potential fintech kind of disruptive forces in the marketplace. At the same time, it seems like you guys function as somewhat of an infrastructure or enablement layer for fintechs. I mean even from the call today, you talked about Chime and Baakt and PayPal, and I know there's a slew of others. So can you talk about this tension between fintech as a competitor and a potential disruptor versus fintech as just sort of a high-growth distribution channel for the business?"

And if you think about what we do with Clover, that was opened up a community to the development community so we can be a platform for them and then a platform for our end users. So my view and our view is we're happy to do things to disrupt ourselves, like you see us doing with the Spend Labs, the Ondots and even Clover was a disruptor of ourselves. And we'll continue to use our platform to enable. And ultimately, we want to serve all communities. So if you think about things we've talked about here, Chime previously, Baakt being an enabler and one of our clients' point base, you think about us bringing PayPal into the bill payment ecosystem. We are going to use our platform to enable. And then we're going to compete heavily with our full capabilities. So our traditional clients who will get all the capabilities and continue innovation. And we will also enable those that have the capabilities that we believe our clients would use. When you think about all of that, she hear us talk about being a token provider from Microsoft. That's about bringing their authorization rates higher. So I don't really find any conflict here. We have waterfront property. We open up the waterfront property.

As you know, a large proportion, about 90% of that volume is new to Fiserv, and so that is certainly a growth driver for the company overall, and continue to expect that going forward. 
We're adding capabilities. Bento Box, as a great example, is building out some of the verticals. Across that capability, we have significant strong distribution channels. And with the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture, we have a good and very quickly growing direct channel that we didn't see us have a few years back. And so we continue to see good opportunity there. 
And in terms of the terminal dynamic, we have -- obviously, we have our own Clover devices. We also use other terminals for the other parts of our company. And we have a variety of different providers of those terminals. And no disruption to us at this point."

And thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda.As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of bank",2536,"Thank you, Shub. And thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda.
As you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, fintechs and businesses, ranging from SMBs, to mid market, to large enterprises. We help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. We are also seeing real benefits from the ongoing economic recovery, especially here in the U.S. We remain optimistic and continue to invest in growth.
Turning to our performance. We had a strong third quarter, with total company adjusted revenue up 10%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 34.2%. Adjusted EPS grew 23% to $1.47. We attained our highest quarter of actioned revenue synergies of $95 million. To date, we have achieved $420 million of actioned revenue synergies, 70% of the increased commitment of $600 million for the 5-year period following the merger.
As we invested to accelerate growth, free cash flow came in at $572 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow was driven by a combination of the following: first, increased capital expenditure in the areas of technology, innovation hubs and the integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, the working capital increase driven by revenue growth; and finally, reduced benefit of unmet operating loss carryforwards.
On the back of our results and the strength of our investments, we are tightening our outlook for organic revenue growth and raising the lower end of our outlook for adjusted EPS. We now expect organic constant currency growth of 11% for the full year and adjusted earnings per share between $5.55 and $5.60. This raises the lower end of our prior adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.05, a growth of 26% to 27% over last year.
Turning to the business segments, let me start with Merchant Acceptance. We continue to grow beyond the buy button by investing in world-class, omnichannel capabilities, solutioning around vertical and horizontal business needs and capturing new flows. We achieved all of this throughout 3 growth platforms: Clover for small business, Clover Connect for ISV and Carat for enterprises.
Driving into our performance, Merchant Acceptance led the quarter, posting organic revenue growth of 18% year-over-year, with North America and international largely in line with the segment average for the quarter. Our global merchant locations have been growing at a healthy clip, up 10% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, driven by positive net new merchants across all regions. The quarter was driven by growth in global volume and transactions of 15% and 12%, respectively. North America volume and transactions grew 14% and 9%, respectively, led by strength in travel, restaurants and petro. Excluding the impact of the loss of a large processing client through one of our JVs, North America volume and transaction growth in the quarter would have been 19% and 14%, respectively.
Next, let's go deeper by platform, starting with Clover. GPV grew 47% year-over-year or a 39% CAGR since 2019 to $196 billion on an annualized basis. In the SMB space, we remain focused in building vertical-specific solutions, offering an integrated suite of products that help merchants generate revenue and run their business. 
As part of our vertical strategy, we entered into an agreement to acquire BentoBox, a digital marketing and commerce platform focused on driving growth and engagement for restaurants. This transaction will expand our Clover dining solutions and industry-leading commerce and business management capabilities, which already enable nearly 200,000 restaurants of all sizes to deliver unique and differentiating dining experience, from quick and casual to fine dining. We expect the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.
Additionally, we continue to focus on building value-added services for the Clover platform, including Clover Capital, Clover Dining, Clover Order Ahead and Clover inventory as well as our unique Clover app marketplace.
On the enterprise side, Carat, our enterprise omnichannel platform, continued its strong momentum in the third quarter, with new wins, product innovation and a gradual recovery in cross-border commerce. Global e-commerce volume grew unabated in the quarter, driven by cross-border and international growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis as volumes recovered from the pandemic lows, with secular tailwinds expected to sustain future momentum. Omnichannel transactions, such as order ahead and buy online, pickup in store, grew 35% in the quarter. 
We had notable e-commerce wins in the quarter, including Johnson & Johnson and Caesars Entertainment. We also expanded our existing global acquiring relationship with Microsoft to be their provider for network tokens. In the quarter, we added PayPal and Venmo as digital wallet payout options to our global service platform, submitting Carat as a leader in digital payouts with over $10 billion processed year-to-date, an increase of 230% on a year-over-year basis.
Additionally, we are building a new partnership with Bakkt, a leading crypto and consumer wallet solution provider Bakkt will utilize Fiserv's industry-leading funds-in, funds-out solution. And together, Fiserv and Bakkt will develop new crypto use cases for both merchant and FI clients.
Moving to Clover Connect. The strength of our ISV focused offering showed through the third quarter with ISV volume up 71% year-over-year. Clover Connect allows us to bring together 2 strong Fiserv assets: the world-class hardware and software platform on Clover, along with the best-in-class partner management and operational tool of CoPilot, which gives ISVs a unique view into all of the merchants' activities, ranging from merchant application processing to support. 
Our commitment to being the best partner for ISVs is resonating. We signed 47 new ISVs in the third quarter, bringing our total wins to 142 year-to-date. We continue signing up ISVs that are new to payments and winning against the competition. This quarter, more than half of our wins were competitive takeaways.
Before I address our international progress, I'd like to highlight another focus area in our merchant business, point-of-sale lending. We are leveraging our position as the operating platform for businesses small, medium and large to offer a range of buy now, pay later options. We are expanding our referral relationships while simplifying the merchant experience through integrations with our platforms like Clover. We currently have referral agreements with Zip, Citizens Pay and Bread. 
We're also working with our FI clients to bring payer BNPL offerings to market. For example, we are partnering with Synchrony to offer buy now, pay later solutions on our card processing platform, Optus. Synchrony also recently announced acceptance of private label cards through Clover. 
On our Investor Day, we talked to you about our Merchant Acceptance growth strategy for international. We remain focused on growing our global market presence with world-class bank partners and through our direct channels, all while leveraging the strength of common platforms and connections.
The global expansion of Clover platform into APAC, Latin America and EMEA are all currently in flight. We're on track to roll out Clover in India by the third quarter of 2022, a tremendous opportunity given the size and growth potential of the market. Clover is already in market in Argentina and is expected to launch in Brazil next year, thereby covering the 2 largest markets in Latin America. 
In EMEA, Clover is in market across the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland, with a further boost expected with the rollout of the Deutsche Bank JV that we announced last quarter. Among the key APAC deals completed in the quarter is an omnichannel merchant acquirer processing mandate from Bank of China for their fast-growing Macau market.
Moving to EMEA, Fiserv partnered with PostFinance, one of the largest financial institutions in Switzerland, to provide credit card acquiring services to their Swiss merchant clients. We're starting with an initial 4,000 merchants that accept the PostFinance today, with plans to expand to the entire merchant base of 60,000 over time.
Fiserv is also supporting Restaurant Brands, owner of iconic brands, including Burger King and Popeyes, as the company expands its footprint across Europe with an omnichannel approach. Fiserv will provide acquiring services for Burger King in the U.K. and the Nordics and Popeyes in the U.K.
To close on the merchant segment. As you may recall, in April, we won a 20-year deal to become the exclusive provider of merchant acquiring services for Caixa Econômica Federal, one of the largest Brazilian banks. We are pleased to report that the implementation of this mandate started at the beginning of August and is going extremely well, with 65,000 merchants onboarded as of last week.
Moving to the Payments and Network segment. Organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 5%. Our Payments segment consists of 3 businesses: global credit processing and output solutions, which we call issuer solutions, which is 40% of the segment; debit processing and debit networks, which we call -- we refer to as card services, also 1/3 of the segment; and the third business is comprised of digital solutions, bill pay and our prepaid business.
Our issuer solutions business, which grew just below the overall Payments segment average, is seeing the benefit of a continued credit recovery, with general purpose credit gross active accounts up in the high single digits. Note that our credit issuer solutions revenue is driven by number of accounts, not credit volume. However, as credit volumes recover, the number of accounts will follow. Looking ahead, we expect growth in the business to be driven by the continued ramp of last year's notable wins, including 3 of the top 25 issuer wins, which we announced last year.
We also recently completed PNC's conversion of BBVA's card portfolios through our platform. Our retail private label portfolio also continues to recover from its COVID lows, although at a slower pace than we anticipated at the beginning of the year.
Within card services, which grew organic revenue a couple of points faster than the overall Payment segment average, we saw a strong growth in debit transactions driving our issuance and network businesses. Looking ahead, we expect to sustain growth for this business by broadening our total addressable market. 
For instance, in the quarter, our STAR debit network signed an agreement with leading U.S. consumer fintech, Chime, to become its preferred unaffiliated network for debit. We believe that aligning one of the largest fintech issuers is a testimony to the scale and technical capabilities of the STAR network and positions the network well for future growth. This was also one of our notable action synergy revenues in the quarter.
During our Investor Day, we discussed the opportunity to offer a fully managed by Fiserv credit card issuing option to community FIs and shared that we were actively exploring this market. We are pleased to announce that we are currently piloting our agent credit program offering, branded Credit Choice, and will launch in Q1 2022. 
Credit Choice is a fully managed credit card issuing-as-a-service solution that allows our community FIs to offer their customers an FI-branded credit card experience that is fully integrated into their debit solution, but without the operational burden of running their own credit card portfolio. Credit Choice leverages our scale distribution and world-class card issuing surround solutions, such as OnDot and SpendLabs to expand into a sizable, new, addressable market for Fiserv where the economics per card are considerably richer than in processing. We have already seen strong, early interest from clients, with hundreds of prospects in the pipeline.
On our Q2 call, we spoke to you about our rich, mobile-first consumer and business offerings powered by recent acquisitions, OnDot and SpendLabs. The early results of the launch have been very encouraging. We completed the integration of the CardHub platform into our credit and debit processing platforms and into our Mobiliti mobile banking platform. We are seeing tremendous demand for this integrated solution from both new prospects as well as existing CardValet clients, whom we expect to fully migrate to the integrated CardHub solution by the end of 2022. In addition, we expect to expand the platform to add loyalty, installment payment and dispute management, thereby establishing CardHub as a key differentiator and to drive new sales and client retention.
For our financial institution clients, this solution is a game changer. It enhances consumer engagement with their digital banking platform, creates more fee income through greater card usage, and catapults the FI's overall digital experience into the leagues of some of the world's top banks and neobanks.
In the third business, results are mixed. We had good growth in our digital payments activity, led by Zelle transaction growth of 75% in the quarter and the number of clients live now reaching just under 750. Prepaid growth was driven by new client wins within our Gift Solutions business. We expect growth to continue, driven by new use cases.
Our bill pay business, which encompasses both the direct biller and bill pay through our financial institutions, continues to grow slower than expected. However, we're extending our bill pay capabilities beyond the financial institution channel, going live later this month as an enabler of PayPal's bill payment functionality within PayPal's new app. Additionally, we expanded our relationship with a large telecom provider to enable commercial card payments with our BillMatrix solution.
Moving to the Financial Technology segment. The quarter was in line with our expectations, posting organic revenue growth of 4%, resulting in 4% growth year-to-date. We added 14 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 7 competitive takeaways and 2 de novo wins. Our DNA platform is seeing great success, including with larger financial institutions, as evidenced in the Valley National Bank and Dollar Bank wins, with assets over $40 billion and $10 billion, respectively.
Abiliti, our modern, cloud-based, API-driven digital banking platform, is seeing great momentum with 150 incremental sales in the quarter. 138 of these sales were to existing clients, which will drive our clients' digital transformation and deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds, such as CardHub, sale and SpendLabs. The remaining 12 were new logo sales, with half being core competitive takeaways. 
We also continue to enrich our open banking and fintech ecosystem, again, in line with the goals laid out in last year's investor conference. We launched our new developer portal, which we call the Fiserv developer studio, towards the end of the third quarter. The developer studio provides rich and expansive API integrations to support banks, fintechs, merchants and enterprise clients with developer tools needed to accelerate innovation, integrations across the entire Fiserv ecosystem. Additionally, we also announced partnerships with exciting new fintechs: FutureFuel.io and Streetshares, aimed at creating new white space opportunities in digital for both retail consumer and small business lending, respectively.
We believe that we're extremely well positioned to continue to drive revenue in the segment higher by delivering new innovation, such as Abiliti; strategically acquiring and integrating attractive surround solutions, like OnDot and SpendLabs; and leveraging the power of the developer community through our developer studio API portal or dedicated go-to-market integrations like FutureFuel.io and StreetShares. 
Now let me pass the discussion to Bob for more detail on our financial results."

Before I begin reviewing the detailed business results, as Shub mentioned, we are aligning with the broader community and simplifying our message by clarifying our internal revenue growth metric as organic con",1333,"Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin reviewing the detailed business results, as Shub mentioned, we are aligning with the broader community and simplifying our message by clarifying our internal revenue growth metric as organic constant currency revenue. This does not change how we calculate this measure, just clarifies the terminology. It will be the same definition in calculations we've used in prior quarters. 
On Slide 11, we've included a new schedule to clearly provide an understanding of the walk from GAAP revenue to internal or organic revenue for the third quarter. This summary can be seen in more detail in the appendix of our presentation. Now I will cover some detail on each of our segments. If you're following along on our slides, I'm starting with Slide 4. 
We feel great about our performance for both the quarter and the first 9 months of the year. And we are well positioned to achieve strong full year financial results.
Total company organic revenue was up 10% in the quarter, with growth across all segments, led by Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 18%. Year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 21%. Total company adjusted revenue also grew 10% to nearly $4 billion in the quarter. Year-to-date, total company adjusted revenue has grown 11% to $11.4 billion. 
Third quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.4 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by 130 basis points to 34.2%. This margin improvement was driven by our strong revenue results and our continued disciplined cost synergy execution, which produced $64 million of incremental cost synergies during the quarter. And we have now actioned $1.16 billion programmed today. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income increased 23% to $3.8 billion. Adjusted operating margin year-to-date expanded 330 basis points to 33.2%. 
Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 23% to $1.47 compared to $1.20 in the prior year. Through September 30, adjusted earnings per share grew 29% to $4.01, putting us on pace to achieve our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, a testament to the incredible strength and resiliency of this company.
Free cash flow for the first 9 months of the year was $2.3 billion, resulting in an 85% free cash flow conversion. This result was driven by increased capital investments related to technology, world-class facilities and the integration of newly acquired businesses; a working capital increase driven by revenue growth; and a reduction in the net operating loss carryforward benefit. With these investments and strong revenue growth, we now expect free cash flow conversion to be 95% to 100% for the full year. 
Now looking to our segment results, starting on Slide 6. Organic revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very strong 18% in the quarter and 21% year-to-date. Our revenue was driven by a combination of growth in volume and transactions. Our results were once again driven by strong performance across all 3 platforms: Clover for SMBs, Carat for large businesses and Clover Connect for ISVs. 
Clover continues to build upon the momentum and strength of our product offering as it posted a very strong 47% GPV growth year-over-year or $196 billion on an annualized basis, with growth across all of our distribution channels. 
With Carat, we won 45 new global enterprise e-commerce clients on the platform in the quarter. In addition, Carat expanded its mandate with existing high-quality brands, such as Valero. Continuous leading the high-growth, online EBT space, Carat has launched more than 50 clients to online EBT in the past 12 months. 
Our ISV volume in this quarter through Clover Connect grew 71% year-over-year and up almost 150% versus the third quarter of 2019. We are winning both ISVs that are new to payments as well as competitive takeaways. 
Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 30% to $552 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points to 32.2%, driven by top line strength. Through September 30, adjusted operating income improved 57% to $1.5 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 710 basis points to 30.6%. 
Turning to Slide 7. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 5%. As Frank outlined in his composition of the segment, our card services, digital payments and prepaid businesses outperformed the segment organic revenue growth rate. 
Global issuer solutions came in just under the segment average, while bill pay was a headwind. Account to account transfers and P2P solutions continue to rise with consumer demand. Zelle transactions in the quarter were up 75%, and the number of clients live on Zelle was up 65% in the quarter. Debit transactions grew 11% in the quarter, a strong result in light of the tougher year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter versus the second quarter, driven by the macro impact of the reduced benefits of the stimulus. 
Given the performance year-to-date, we expect to see the Payments and Network segment's full year organic revenue rate to be within the medium-term outlook growth rate of 5% to 8%, driven by the continued ramp in new client onboarding and strong uptake of our advanced digital offering. However, this outlook is slightly tempered versus our previous expectation of approaching the higher end of 5% to 8% organic revenue growth target range.
Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 7% to $650 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points to 44.0% in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 7% to $1.9 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 110 basis points to 43.4%. The results were driven by positive momentum in our card and issuer business and the positive impact of revenue and cost synergies. 
Turning to Slide 8. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew at 4% in the quarter. Year-to-date, organic revenue growth for the segment is 4%, within our medium-term outlook for this segment of 4% to 6%.
Our digital banking capabilities and digital solution offerings continue to win in the marketplace. As Frank mentioned, we added 14 new core account processing clients in the quarter, half of which were competitive takeaways. 
We completed our integration of OnDot card management capabilities into our Mobiliti mobile banking platform and are currently in market with that offering. Mobile deposits in Q3 grew 10.5% over the prior year, while self-service ATM deposits grew nearly 60% over last year. 
Adjusted operating income was up 4% in the quarter to $275 million and up 10% year-to-date to $794 million. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 40 basis points in the quarter to 36.0%. However, on a 2-year basis, adjusted operating margin has increased 560 basis points versus the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating margins expanded 190 basis points to 35.3% year-to-date. 
The adjusted corporate operating loss was $121 million in the quarter, in line with last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.3%, improving 260 basis points versus prior year. And we now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 20%. 
During the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing over 3 million shares for $365 million. We have more than 52 million shares remaining authorized for share repurchase. 
As Frank mentioned, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to acquire BentoBox, a digital marketing and e-commerce platform focused on driving growth and engagement for restaurants, that we will integrate into Clover's dining solutions to further strengthen our omnichannel restaurant platform. We expect to close this transaction later this quarter. 
Total debt outstanding was $21 billion on September 30, and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 32 to 3.2x. Q3 was another demonstration of our time-tested capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment in innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Frank."

These partnerships focus on increasing access and opportunity for aspiring women and minorities within the entrepreneurial ecosystem. 
We also expanded our Back2Business program to Detroit and the Washington, D.C.; Maryland, Virginia area as well as internationally with our entry into the U.K. Additionally, during the quarter, we also completed our CDP submission, and for the first time, published our EE0-1 filing on our Internet site.

And I think the thing that, hopefully, you see is our agility and speed and innovation. 
We talked about OnDot, and it's fully integrated beyond its initial capability and now in our mobile product and winning in the market. You see us go and look at BentoBox. And we're extending our total addressable market with the capability that will start with restaurants, but actually could be a storefront and much larger. 
But all of these are nurturing good, strong startups that then we'll allow to thrive in our environment. And we put the capital behind them to integrate them and grow. And you hear how we bring SpendLabs along with it. So I think you should expect us to continue that and realize that -- I think we believe we have a deep skill set in integrating properties, transforming our property itself. In some cases, we're even disrupting ourselves in the process as we move from CardValet to CardHub to an integration. So you should expect us to continue to do that and be very, very thoughtful about acquisitions. But we will invest inorganically and we'll invest organically. And we will invest organically in the acquisitions to allow them to thrive within our ecosystem and not to be stand-alone entities."

And as you may recall, back at our Investor Day last December, we talked about the capital to deploy over the next 5 years of more than $30 billion. 
As we enter 2022, not only will we have very strong cash flow, but we will also have capacity on the balance sheet. As EBITDA grows, the company will naturally delever. And so we'll have the capability to borrow just to maintain that historic leverage ratio. So we feel like we're very good -- positioned to be able to complete acquisitions that we feel we want to complete. It's not prohibited or constrained by capital."

There seems to be some debate or discussion among investors about potential fintech kind of disruptive forces in the marketplace. At the same time, it seems like you guys function as somewhat of an infrastructure or enablement layer for fintechs. I mean even from the call today, you talked about Chime and Baakt and PayPal, and I know there's a slew of others. So can you talk about this tension between fintech as a competitor and a potential disruptor versus fintech as just sort of a high-growth distribution channel for the business?"

And if you think about what we did with Clover, that was opened up a community to the development community, so we can be a platform for them and then a platform for our end users. 
So my view and our view is we're happy to do things to disrupt ourselves, like you see us doing with the SpendLabs, the OnDots. And even Clover was a disruptor of ourselves. And we'll continue to use our platform to enable. And ultimately, we want to serve all communities. 
So if you think about things we've talked about here, Chime previously, NYDIG, Baakt being an enabler and one of our clients' coin base. You think about us bringing PayPal into the bill payment ecosystem. We are going to use our platform to enable. And then we're going to compete heavily with our full capabilities. So our traditional clients who will get all the capabilities and continue innovation. And we will also enable those that have the capabilities that we believe our clients would use. 
When you think about all of that -- you hear us talk about being a token provider for Microsoft. That's about bringing their authorization rates higher. So I don't really find any conflict here. We have waterfront property. We open up the waterfront property. And our job is to enable commerce, and we get paid for enabling commerce."

As you know, a large proportion -- about 90% of that volume is new to Fiserv, and so that is certainly a growth driver for the company overall and continue to expect that going forward. 
We're adding capabilities. BentoBox, as a great example, is building out some of the verticals. Across that capability, we have significant, strong distribution channels. And with the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture, we have a good and very quickly growing direct channel that we didn't see us have a few years back. And so we continue to see good opportunity there. 
And in terms of the terminal dynamic, we have -- obviously, we have our own Clover devices. We also use other terminals for the other parts of our company. And we have a variety of different providers of those terminals, and no disruption to us at this point."
