As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. With that, let me turn it over to Kannan for the first question."

So maybe Spence, we could start off with you, just given the guidance and the beat during the quarter relative to guidance. Sequentially, the first quarter tends to be higher in net additions than Q4. But your guidance is lower despite the fact that you beat Q4 by a relatively large amount. And it feels like the pull-forward effect is more or less behind us. So if you could just help us walk through the thought behind the guidance and the framework that you used for that, that would be a good place to start."

So in terms of the guide, first of all, we guided to 6 million paid net adds for Q1, if you saw. And obviously, that's still a big number, especially when you think about it in context of 2020, which was, by far, a record year with 37 million paid net adds. So I know you mentioned the pull-forward. I don't think we're declaring that we're necessarily through that yet. So we think there's puts and calls every quarter. But one that's still a meaningful factor for us and the guide is thinking through how we kind of grow through that growth from 2020. So there's probably still a little bit of that pull-forward dynamic in the early parts of 2021. 
And then more broadly, Kannan, it's just so difficult in this time. I mean this is one of the more uniquely challenging times, not just for life, but that's most important, but also, obviously, in terms of trying to just forecast the growth trajectory of the business. There's just so much uncertainty right now. So it's more uncertain than we've ever seen, and we're trying to forecast through that. 
But at the same time, one thing that's maybe counterbalancing that is that what COVID has done for that is it's accelerated that big shift from linear to streaming entertainment. So the long-term growth trajectory is at least as strong as ever. There's just more short-term noise and uncertainty right now, but still very strong underlying growth metrics, and that's what you're seeing in the Q1 guide."

And I think there's been a lot of debate about what you actually meant by that 4 million to 5 million. So if you could just contextualize the guidance for Q1 more in the context of 2021. You typically do 28 million, 30 million subs in a given year. Is that framework more or less intact? Or should we read that 4 million to 5 million comment as a pull-forward into '20?"

I mean it's hard enough to project the next 90 days, let alone the next 12 months. But we feel very good about, as I said, is that longer-term growth trajectory. You've seen us, as you pointed out, the historical growth trends. Hopefully, it will be plus or minus that, but it's a bit impossible to predict. 
What we do see is that viewing is up in every region of the world. It's kind of returned from those peak COVID levels, but it's up year-over-year in all regions. Retention is better than it was a year ago. Acquisition is strong. So the underlying metrics are strong in the business, but I don't want to provide false precision on a 12-month target."

As you know there are certain countries around the world where we're just further along in our content market fit and our maturation, but we're seeing growth everywhere. I mean, even like, you pick Latin America is an example, one of our more mature markets. You look over the past few years, and we've been steadily growing about 5 million to 6 million paid net adds a year. As you mentioned, in the kind of U.S. UCAN market, we're roughly 60% penetrated, and we're still growing.

And we think that's a pretty big milestone for us. 
To the point of our capital allocation approach, the philosophy remains unchanged, which is that we're going to be disciplined stewards of the capital and try to do things that we believe are value maximizing for our shareholders. But we have turned this corner where now we can, as we talked about with $8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, projecting to be cash flow about breakeven in 2021 and then positive thereafter. We want to return excess cash to our shareholders. So we won't build up a bunch of excess cash. We'll maintain, as you say, about -- as we said in the letter, and as you mentioned, about $10 billion to $15 billion of gross debt on the balance sheet, and that's really just to maintain familiarity and access to the debt markets should we need it, but there's really not a whole lot of science beyond that. 
And then beyond, as I say, we're -- we put a premium on balance sheet flexibility. So we're going to continue to invest aggressively into the growth opportunities that we see. And that's always going to come first. But beyond that, if we have excess cash, we'll return it to shareholders through a share buyback program."

And so it gets us fired up about increasing our membership, increasing our content budget. And it's going to be great for the world that Disney and Netflix are competing show by show, movie by movie. We're very fired up about catching them in family animation, maybe eventually passing them, we'll see, a long way to go just to catch them, and maintaining our lead in general entertainment that's so stimulating, like Bridgerton, which I don't think you're going to see on Disney anytime soon.

And then on -- to your other point, I think Netflix members come to the service seeking to be entertained in a whole variety of ways. Sometimes they're looking for a movie or sometimes a TV show or animation or scripted or unscripted. And sometimes they show up and they're not really sure what they want to watch. And so we've had the opportunity to try and be innovative and try new mechanisms to sort of help our members in that particular state. So there's the linear feed is one example of that. It's still unclear how that's going to work out. So we're still looking at that one.

But there have been a couple of streaming services in Southeast Asia, which essentially were acquired by some of the Chinese Internet majors. Sony, of course, did the acquisition of Crunchyroll.

Point two, in terms of your other question around what are we interested in, it is largely around things that can help us bolster our core business, which is entertainment and specifically content assets inclusive of things like intellectual property that we can hopefully turn into great TV shows and great movies."

So in terms of the guide, first of all, we guided to 6 million paid net adds for Q1, if you saw. And obviously, that's still a big number, especially when you think about it in context of 2020, which was, by far, a record year with 37 million paid net adds. 
So I know you mentioned the pull-forward. I don't think we're declaring that we're necessarily through that yet. So we think there's puts and calls every quarter. But one that's still a meaningful factor for us in the guide is thinking through how we kind of grow through that growth from 2020. So there's probably still a little bit of that pull-forward dynamic in the early parts of 2021.
And then more broadly, Kannan, it's just so difficult in this time. I mean this is one of the more uniquely challenging times not just for life but -- that's most important but also obviously in terms of trying to just forecast the growth trajectory of the business. There's just so much uncertainty right now. So it's more uncertain than we've ever seen, and we're trying to forecast through that.
But at the same time, one thing that's maybe counterbalancing that is that what COVID has done for that is it's accelerated that big shift from linear to streaming entertainment. So the long-term growth trajectory is at least as strong as ever. There's just more short-term noise and uncertainty right now but still very strong underlying growth metrics, and that's what you're seeing in the Q1 guide."

I mean it's hard enough to project the next 90 days, let alone the next 12 months. What we feel very good about, as I said, is that longer-term growth trajectory. You've seen, as you pointed out, the historical growth trends. Hopefully, it will be plus or minus that, but it's a bit impossible to predict.
What we do see is that viewing is up in every region of the world. It's kind of returned from those peak COVID levels, but it's up year-over-year in all regions. Retention is better than it was a year ago. Acquisition is strong. So the underlying metrics are strong in the business, but I don't want to provide false precision on a 12-month target."

And we think that's a pretty big milestone for us.
To the point of our capital allocation approach, the philosophy remains unchanged, which is that we're going to be disciplined stewards of the capital and try to do things that we believe are value maximizing for our shareholders. But we have turned this corner where now we can, as we talked about with $8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, projecting to be cash flow about breakeven in 2021 and then positive thereafter. We want to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
So we won't build up a bunch of excess cash. We'll maintain, as you say, about -- as we said in the letter, and as you mentioned, about $10 billion to $15 billion of gross debt on the balance sheet. And that's really just to maintain familiarity and access to the debt markets should we need it, but there's really not a whole lot of science beyond that.
And then beyond, as I say, we're -- we put a premium on balance sheet flexibility. So we're going to continue to invest aggressively into the growth opportunities that we see. And that's always going to come first. But beyond that, if we have excess cash, we'll return it to shareholders through a share buyback program."

And then on -- to your other point, I think Netflix members come to the service seeking to be entertained in a whole variety of ways. Sometimes they're looking for a movie or sometimes a TV show or animation or scripted or unscripted. And sometimes they show up and they're not really sure what they want to watch. And so we've had the opportunity to try and be innovative and try new mechanisms to sort of help our members in that particular state. 
So there's -- the linear feed is one example of that. It's still unclear how that's going to work out. So we're still looking at that one.

So I guess when you think about these factors, I mean, there are 2 ways to think about pricing in this environment. One is when you have so much competition and consumer wallets essentially have to be spread more widely. One way to read the environment is to say that pricing power is limited. But then on the other side of it, your share of total engagement could continue to go up and the pie itself could increase. And you have more product which consumers -- basically, that wallet is coming out of somewhere else instead of television. Which of these 2 dynamics should we expect to see? In other words, should pricing power accelerate or ARPU growth accelerate in the coming years, at least in the Western markets?"

I would say our competition set we think of is extremely broad, whether you think about it as share of wallet or share of time and attention, share of entertainment, share of delight. And we feel like we have so much more room to growth and -- to grow. And really, it's exciting to now see the sort of new dimensions of value creation for our users, like bringing a foreign language show, Lupin, Casa de Papel, shows that are now becoming global hits from countries and in languages. That's never happened before. So that's super exciting to see that kind of value creation. And that's really just where we stay focused. 
So we're not trying to predict the future in that way but just stay tightly, tightly disciplined on trying to think about what's that next incremental step where we can create more value for our members, engage them, delight them, more great content, more great product experiences. And if we think we do that well, then we think our business will grow in turn."

And obviously, that's still a big number, especially when you think about it in context of 2020, which was, by far, a record year with 37 million paid net adds. 
So I know you mentioned the pull-forward. I don't think we're declaring that we're necessarily through that yet. So we think there's puts and calls every quarter. But one that's still a meaningful factor for us in the guide is thinking through how we kind of grow through that growth from 2020. So there's probably still a little bit of that pull-forward dynamic in the early parts of 2021.
And then more broadly, Kannan, it's just so difficult in this time. I mean, this is one of the more uniquely challenging times, not just for life but -- that's most important -- but also obviously in terms of trying to just forecast the growth trajectory of the business. There's just so much uncertainty right now. So it's more uncertain than we've ever seen, and we're trying to forecast through that. 
But at the same time, one thing that's maybe counterbalancing that is that what COVID has done for that is it's accelerated that big shift from linear to streaming entertainment. So the long-term growth trajectory is at least as strong as ever. There's just more short-term noise and uncertainty right now but still very strong underlying growth metrics, and that's what you're seeing in the Q1 guide."

You've seen us, as you pointed out, the historical growth trends. Hopefully, it will be plus or minus that, but it's a bit impossible to predict.
What we do see is that viewing is up in every region of the world. It's kind of returned from those peak COVID levels, but it's up year-over-year in all regions. Retention is better than it was a year ago. Acquisition is strong. So the underlying metrics are strong in the business, but I don't want to provide false precision on a 12-month target."

As you know, there are certain countries around the world where we're just further along in our content market fit and our maturation, but we're seeing growth everywhere. I mean even -- like you pick Latin America as an example, one of our more mature markets. You look over the past few years, and we've been steadily growing about 5 million to 6 million paid net adds a year.

And we think that's a pretty big milestone for us.
To the point of our capital allocation approach, the philosophy remains unchanged, which is that we're going to be disciplined stewards of the capital and try to do things that we believe are value maximizing for our shareholders. But we have turned this corner where now we can, as we talked about with $8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, projecting to be cash flow about breakeven in 2021 and then positive thereafter. We want to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
So we won't build up a bunch of excess cash. We'll maintain, as you say, about -- as we said in the letter, and as you mentioned, about $10 billion to $15 billion of gross debt on the balance sheet. And that's really just to maintain familiarity and access to the debt markets should we need it, but there's really not a whole lot of science beyond that.
And then beyond, as I say, we're -- we put a premium on balance sheet flexibility. So we're going to continue to invest aggressively into the growth opportunities that we see. And that's always going to come first. But beyond that, if we have excess cash, we'll return it to shareholders through a share buyback program."

And obviously, based on what we see there will inform how we think about how we leverage that tactic again or how do we improve on it, what other places we think it might be leverageable.
And then on -- to your other point, I think Netflix members come to the service seeking to be entertained in a whole variety of ways. Sometimes they're looking for a movie or sometimes a TV show or animation or scripted or unscripted. And sometimes they show up and they're not really sure what they want to watch. And so we've had the opportunity to try and be innovative and try new mechanisms to sort of help our members in that particular state.

So in terms of the guide, first of all, we guided to 6 million paid net adds for Q1, if you saw. And obviously, that's still a big number, especially when you think about it in context of 2020, which was, by far, a record year with 37 million paid net adds. 
So I know you mentioned the pull-forward. I don't think we're declaring that we're necessarily through that yet. So we think there's puts and calls every quarter. But one that's still a meaningful factor for us in the guide is thinking through how we kind of grow through that growth from 2020. So there's probably still a little bit of that pull-forward dynamic in the early parts of 2021.
And then more broadly, Kannan, it's just so difficult in this time. I mean, this is one of the more uniquely challenging times, not just for life but -- that's most important -- but also obviously in terms of trying to just forecast the growth trajectory of the business. There's just so much uncertainty right now. So it's more uncertain than we've ever seen, and we're trying to forecast through that. 
But at the same time, one thing that's maybe counterbalancing that is that what COVID has done for that is it's accelerated that big shift from linear to streaming entertainment. So the long-term growth trajectory is at least as strong as ever. There's just more short-term noise and uncertainty right now but still very strong underlying growth metrics, and that's what you're seeing in the Q1 guide."

And I think there's been a lot of debate about what you actually meant by that 4 million to 5 million. So if you could just contextualize the guidance for Q1 more in the context of 2021. You typically do 28 million, 30 million subs in a given year. Is that framework more or less intact? Or should we read that 4 million to 5 million comment as a pull-forward into '20?"

I mean it's hard enough to project the next 90 days, let alone the next 12 months. What we feel very good about, as I said, is that longer-term growth trajectory. You've seen us, as you pointed out, the historical growth trends. Hopefully, it will be plus or minus that, but it's a bit impossible to predict.
What we do see is that viewing is up in every region of the world. It's kind of returned from those peak COVID levels, but it's up year-over-year in all regions. Retention is better than it was a year ago. Acquisition is strong. So the underlying metrics are strong in the business, but I don't want to provide false precision on a 12-month target."

As you know, there are certain countries around the world where we're just further along in our content market fit and our maturation, but we're seeing growth everywhere. I mean even -- like you pick Latin America as an example, one of our more mature markets. You look over the past few years, and we've been steadily growing about 5 million to 6 million paid net adds a year. As you mentioned, in the kind of U.S., UCAN market, we're roughly 60% penetrated, and we're still growing.

And we think that's a pretty big milestone for us.
To the point of our capital allocation approach, the philosophy remains unchanged, which is that we're going to be disciplined stewards of the capital and try to do things that we believe are value maximizing for our shareholders. But we have turned this corner where now we can, as we talked about with $8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, projecting to be cash flow about breakeven in 2021 and then positive thereafter. We want to return excess cash to our shareholders. 
So we won't build up a bunch of excess cash. We'll maintain, as you say, about -- as we said in the letter, and as you mentioned, about $10 billion to $15 billion of gross debt on the balance sheet. And that's really just to maintain familiarity and access to the debt markets should we need it, but there's really not a whole lot of science beyond that.
And then beyond, as I say, we're -- we put a premium on balance sheet flexibility. So we're going to continue to invest aggressively into the growth opportunities that we see. And that's always going to come first. But beyond that, if we have excess cash, we'll return it to shareholders through a share buyback program."

And so it gets us fired up about increasing our membership, increasing our content budget. And it's going to be great for the world that Disney and Netflix are competing show by show, movie by movie. And we're very fired up about catching them in family animation, maybe eventually passing them, we'll see, a long way to go just to catch them, and maintaining our lead in general entertainment that's so stimulating like Bridgerton, which I don't think you're going to see on Disney anytime soon.

So StreamFest in India, I mean the primary learning, which is very evident, is that there's a lot of interest amongst consumers in India to try Netflix. We had millions of people that had access for a 48-hour period to the service. And now we go through the more difficult part of actually analyzing how that interest through this specific tactic translates into sustained incremental growth. And we're still working through the details of that. And obviously, based on what we see there will inform how we think about how we leverage that tactic again or how do we improve on it, what other places we think it might be leverageable.
And then on -- to your other point, I think Netflix members come to the service seeking to be entertained in a whole variety of ways. Sometimes they're looking for a movie or sometimes a TV show or animation or scripted or unscripted. And sometimes they show up and they're not really sure what they want to watch. And so we've had the opportunity to try and be innovative and try new mechanisms to sort of help our members in that particular state. 
So there's -- the linear feed is one example of that. It's still unclear how that's going to work out. So we're still looking at that one. But I think an even better example of that is a new feature that we've been testing and we're going to now roll out globally because it's really working for us, where our members can basically indicate to us that they just want to skip browsing entirely, click one button and we'll pick a title for them just to instantly play. And that's a great mechanism that's worked quite well for our members in that situation."

But to your point, specifically, what we're seeing is we have to find ways to improve the accessibility of the Netflix service.

But really our framework for all of that and the way we assess the moves that we make and how we expand those moves and when we test, how we evaluate those tests is really around that sort of revenue optimization piece.

But Look, so in terms of Q1 performance, it really boils down to COVID, frankly. As you know, the extraordinary events of COVID have had a big impact on the world, continue to have a big impact on the world. 
And  for us, at a minimum, creates just some short-term kind of choppiness in some of the business trends that we see in our business. So in particular, we had this huge pull forward in 2020 in terms of our subscriber additions, nearly 40 million paid net adds in 2020. And we also had a near global shutdown in production, which we've been ramping safely and at scale, through much of last year and into this year, but it did push some key title launches into the back -- kind of the back end of this year. 
So the combination of those 2 things does create some noise. It's It's super hard to obviously kind of forecast quarterly subscribers in  a typical quarter for us and particularly hard in this environment. In fact, on Page 2 of our earnings letter, we show our actuals relative to forecast, which in our guide is our internal forecast for subscribers. And  because it's our forecast, we're going to miss every quarter. 
It's just a matter of whether they're bigger or smaller misses. And you can see, over the past 5 years, our biggest kind of misses to forecast either up or down, the -- most of those big misses and the biggest ever in the past 5 quarters relative to the past 5 years, and that was these 5 quarters of COVID. So it's just a difficult time to forecast the business. 
But the key is the business remains healthy. Our engagement, our viewing per household is was up year-over-year in Q1. Our churn was down year-over-year and the business is still growing. So even at 4 million paid net adds, if you kind of take COVID out and look over the past 2 years, we've grown from 2 years ago at about 150 million members to almost 210 million now. So that's nearly 40% growth and about just under 20% over an average over each of those 2 years, which is in line with the past couple of years. 
So the business remains healthy, and that's because the long-term drivers this big transition from linear to streaming entertainment, and that remains as healthy as ever. But you do see a little kind of noise in the near term, but a lot of long-term priority."

I just say one of the things to keep in mind is that we normally -- what we have to do kind of day in and day out, week in and week out, year in and year out is deliver programming that our members love and value. And the shape of that gets determined sometimes 2, 3 years in advance. So you go into these production cycles, you're going to planning cycles. And you've got a pretty smooth release of high-profile projects and smaller kind of passion projects and all those things. 
And what happened, I guess, in the first part of this year is a lot of the projects we had hoped to come out earlier did get pushed because of the post production delays and the COVID delays in production. And we think we'll get back to much steadier state in the back half of the year and certainly in Q4, where we've got the returning seasons of some of our most popular shows like the Witcher and You and Corporate High as well as some big tempo movies that came to market a little slower than we don't, like Red Notes with the Rock and Ryan Reynolds and Gaga and Escape from Spider even with Chris Hemsworth, a big event content. 
Now all that being said, In every quarter of the year, we released more content than we did in the previous quarter -- in the previous years quarter-by-quarter and in every region is just that I think the shape of the mix of the content is become a little more uncertain. And then the long-term impacts of the COVID shutdown are also becoming a little more uncertain in that time frame in the first half of this year."

But the one thing that we really have done really have sharpened our skills on the last couple of years has been creating content from anywhere in the world and playing it all over the world. 
And the great thing about that is, the those stories that are coming from all over the world, like we saw with DuPont this year, this quarter, it was our biggest new series on Netflix in the world was DuPont from France. And the show was not like a water down French show. It was a very Fred show. And what's really been great about it is as you tell stories from around the world. Those to the more authentically local they are the more likely they are to play around the world because people recognize the authenticity of the storytelling. 
And that's something that we've been really focused on as well as continuing to offer a very big variety of content from Hollywood to the world as well. But we've got new seasons of really popular shows from around the world like Elite in Spain, Legacy Propel coming up, the Naked Director from Japan, which has been an enormous hit for us, Gift from Turkey.

And we're really seeking that sort of flexible approach to make sure that we are providing the plans with the right features and the right price points to meet those broad set of needs. 
So we're going to keep doing that. We're going to keep working on that, working on accessibility across all of the countries that we serve. But we also want to ensure that while we're doing that, that we're good at making sure that the people who are using a Netflix account who are accessing it are the ones that are authorized to do so. 
And that's what this sort of line of testing is about. It's not necessarily a new thing. We've been doing this for a while. You may see it pop up here and there in different ways, but it's sort of a the same framework that we use. I think you're familiar with and so much of how we think about continuously improving the service, which is we iteratively work. We use the tests and the test results to inform and guide how we proceed and just sort of continually try and make that better and better."

And so -- and we don't intend to build up a bunch of excess cash on the balance sheet. So We will maintain a debt level, a gross debt level in a $10 billion to $15 billion range. We paid down about $500 million, in principal in Q1. So we -- our gross debt did come down from the prior quarter. And we think that share buybacks are a way to return value to shareholders in a way that is responsible steward of capital, but also maintains a level of balance sheet flexibility for us to continue to be strategic. 
Because first and foremost, our #1 priority is to invest strategically into the growth of the business, but then, of course, return excess cash to our shareholders. So we're still maintaining a a goal of about 2 months of revenue is our kind of cash on the balance sheet. And you'll see us ease into that share buyback program. So it will start this quarter.

So outside of China, I think pay television peaked about 800 million households. 
So lots of room, and that was several years ago that it peaked lots of room to grow. So think about it as we do want to expand. So like we used to do that thing shipping DVDs. And luckily, we didn't get stuck with that. We didn't define that as the main thing. We define entertainment is the main thing. And so then we expanded into -- they had expanded us into original content. 
And first, it was original series and then films and the animation and kids and unscripted. And so bit by bit, we're adding category. So we've got a lot of work to do in terms of different types of entertainment that we'll continue to do that. A lot of work in terms of global production. So I don't think there will be a second act in the sense that you mean like AWS and Amazon shopping. 
I bet we end up with one, hopefully, gigantic, hopefully, very defensible profit pool. And then continue to improve the service for our members by doing that by expanding in category. So I wouldn't look for any big large secondary pool of profits. There'll be a bunch of supporting pools like consumer products that can be both profitable and can support the title brands.

But look, so in terms of Q1 performance, it really boils down to COVID, frankly. As you know, the extraordinary events of COVID have had a big impact on the world, continue to have a big impact on the world. And  for us, at a minimum, creates just some short-term kind of choppiness in some of the business trends that we see in our business.
So in particular, we had this huge pull forward in 2020 in terms of our subscriber additions, nearly 40 million paid net adds in 2020. And we also had a near global shutdown in production, which we've been ramping safely and at scale through much of last year and into this year but it did push some key title launches into the back -- kind of the back end of this year.
So the combination of those 2 things does create some noise. It's super hard to obviously kind of forecast quarterly subscribers in a typical quarter for us and particularly hard in this environment. In fact, on Page 2 of our earnings letter, we show our actuals relative to forecast, which in our guide is our internal forecast for subscribers. And because it's our forecast, we're going to miss every quarter. It's just a matter of whether they're bigger or smaller misses.
And you can see, over the past 5 years, our biggest kind of misses to forecast, either up or down, the -- most of those big misses and the biggest are in the past 5 quarters relative to the past 5 years, and that was these 5 quarters of COVID. So it's just a difficult time to forecast the business.
But the key is the business remains healthy. Our engagement, our viewing per household was up year-over-year in Q1. Our churn was down year-over-year, and the business is still growing. So even at 4 million paid net adds, if you kind of take COVID out and look over the past 2 years, we've grown from 2 years ago at about 150 million members to almost 210 million now. So that's nearly 40% growth and about just under 20% over an average over each of those 2 years, which is in line with the past couple of years.
So the business remains healthy, and that's because the long-term drivers, this big transition from linear to streaming entertainment, and that remains as healthy as ever. But you do see a little kind of noise in the near term, but a lot of long-term parity."

And the shape of that gets determined sometimes 2, 3 years in advance. So you go into these production cycles, you go into the planning cycles and you've got a pretty smooth release of high-profile projects and smaller kind of passion projects and all those things.
And what happened, I guess, in the first part of this year is a lot of the projects we had hoped to come out earlier did get pushed because of the post production delays and the COVID delays in production. And we think we'll get back to much steadier state in the back half of the year and certainly in Q4, where we've got the returning seasons of some of our most popular shows like The Witcher and You and Cobra Kai as well as some big tempo movies that came to market a little slower than we'd hoped, like Red Notes with The Rock and Ryan Reynolds and Gaga, and Escape From Spiderhead with Chris Hemsworth, big event content.
Now all that being said, in every quarter of the year, we released more content than we did in the previous quarter -- in the previous years quarter-by-quarter and in every region is just that I think the shape of the mix of the content is becoming a little more uncertain.

And the great thing about that is those stories that are coming from all over the world, like we saw with Lupin this year, this quarter, it was our biggest new series on Netflix in the world was Lupin from France. And the show was not like a watered-down French show. It was a very French show. And what's really been great about it is as you tell stories from around the world, those -- the more authentically local they are, the more likely they are to play around the world because people recognize the authenticity of storytelling.
And that's something that we've been really focused on as well as continuing to offer a very big variety of content from Hollywood to the world as well. But we've got new seasons of really popular shows from around the world like Elite in Spain, La Casa de Papel coming up, The Naked Director from Japan, which has been an enormous hit for us, Gift from Turkey.

And we're still working on India, and it's super exciting. And again, right now, this month, things are terrible in the COVID spike. But outside of that, we've been really producing a lot of great new content that's currently shut down.
Greg, do you want to talk about, like, Jio or any of that?"

And so our job is to really try and be innovative and push an experiment. And so whether that is pushing on the actual model in terms of, like, multi-month or sachet and sort of explore the ranges of that kind of offering.
But then also something that we've seen that is quite successful for us in pretty much all the markets we serve around the world is leveraging go-to-market partners who have existing relationships with consumers as a way to expose them to the Netflix service and then have them make it easy to pay.
And of course, the ultimate and easy to pay is it just included the sort of bundled offerings that we've been doing more and more of, and Jio is a great example of a partner we've been working with there to really bring the service to a new demographic at a very, very low price associated with low-cost mobile plans that they're offering as well as home-based IPTV plans. And those have been successful for us as well.
So it's constantly just trying to push on all those different engines and really figure out what is that right price point, the right offering and the right way that works for the local members and consumers."

But we also want to ensure that while we're doing that, that we're good at making sure that the people who are using a Netflix account, who are accessing it are the ones that are authorized to do so.
And that's what this sort of line of testing is about. It's not necessarily a new thing. We've been doing this for a while.

So we expect to be about cash flow breakeven this year and then sustainably free cash flow positive and growing thereafter.
And so -- and we don't intend to build up a bunch of excess cash on the balance sheet. So we will maintain a debt level, a gross debt level in the $10 billion to $15 billion range. We've paid down about $500 million in principal in Q1. So we -- our gross debt did come down from the prior quarter. And we think that share buybacks are a way to return value to shareholders in a way that is responsible steward of capital, but also maintains a level of balance sheet flexibility for us to continue to be strategic.
Because first and foremost, our #1 priority is to invest strategically into the growth of the business, but then, of course, return excess cash to our shareholders. So we're still maintaining a goal of about 2 months of revenue is our kind of cash on the balance sheet. And you'll see us ease into that share buyback program. So it will start this quarter. As I said, I think you'll see us ease into it. And we're authorized up to $5 billion of share repurchase, and we'll kind of get the program going this year."

So outside of China, I think pay television peaked about 800 million households. So lots of room -- and that was several years ago that it peaked, lots of room to grow.
So think about it as we do want to expand. So, like, we used to do that thing shipping DVDs and luckily, we didn't get stuck with that. We didn't define that as the main thing. We defined entertainment as the main thing. And so then we expanded into -- Ted -- I should say Ted expanded us into original content.
And first, it was original series and then films and then animation and kids and unscripted. And so bit by bit, we're adding category. So we've got a lot of work to do in terms of different types of entertainment that we'll continue to do that, a lot of work in terms of global production. So I don't think there will be a second act in the sense that you mean like an AWS and Amazon shopping.
I bet we end up with one, hopefully, gigantic, hopefully, very defensible profit pool and then continue to improve the service for our members by doing that by expanding in category. So I wouldn't look for any big, large secondary pool of profits. There'll be a bunch of supporting pools like consumer products that can be both profitable and can support the title brands.

So as I mentioned, the underlying business metrics are really healthy. The one thing we do see with COVID is we don't see the big spikes that we saw in terms of engagement or acquisition or churn that we saw in the very early days of the pandemic. But on the margin, acquisition is impacted. So for example, in Q2, when things tightened up a little bit, say, in Brazil or India, we did see some increase in acquisition. And similarly, as markets reopened, particularly in part -- in most of EMEA and the UCAN region, that did have a bit of a headwind on acquisition. And that's reflected basically in our Q3 guide as well. So similar business fundamentals that hopefully kind of starting to move a little bit further away from those market reopenings, which is why you do see some incremental growth, so a better seasonal period as well as moving a bit away from those -- those market reopenings, but not a big fundamental change and then hopefully into even more reacceleration as we get to the end of the year as we really get into the kind of heart of our kind of -- kind of strong release schedule as well as peak seasonality."

So we remain on that growth trajectory. And again, once we get into Q4, what we would expect is as we get through, hopefully, the tail end of the COVID choppiness, we get into that strong strength of slate. We get to a kind of a high seasonal period for us. We'd expect to end the year on a much more kind of normalized growth trajectory, but we kind of have to get there."

And that seems pretty unlikely. Internet streaming has been amazingly consistent, prolific. As you get new competition in, you get a validation of more reasons to get a smart TV or unlimited broadband. So I think, for at least the next several years, the growth story of streaming as a whole is very intact. And then you've got the secular competition story. Does HBO or Disney or other entry have a differential impact compared to the past? And we're not seeing that in the detail that we have for a country because they're launched in some countries and not in others. That gives us comfort. We're not seeing that in the total viewing like the Nielsen measures. And so we think mostly, all of streaming is a growth story, competing from a linear TV. And that, that will be true until say streaming is 50%, 60%, 70% of viewing. And then there's going to be a shakeout, and we want to be prepared and leaving that. But again, the next couple years, streaming is still in their early stages."

And consumer entertainment around the world is an enormous market. It has great potential for us and potentially our competitors. And so that big thesis is, again, what gets people excited. And when we're growing revenue by 19%, it's not that hard to grow 300 basis points of margin. As the revenue growth slows, it will get a little bit tougher, but we'll continue to lean into that. And so I would say it's fundamentally a story of this big secular revenue growth management team committed to growing profits and cash flows and then returning those cash flows through buybacks, which Spence got a big start on this quarter. So over to you, Spence."

And we talked on the last call that there's 800 to 900 million  either broadband or pay TV households around the world outside of China. And as we continue to improve our service and the accessibility of our service, we don't see why we can't be in all or most of those homes over time if we're doing our job. And then if you look at the range from an APAC region where we're only roughly 10% penetrated, so clearly early days, to our arguably, I guess, more tenured markets, at least like in the UCAN, where even there with some of the metrics we put in the earnings letter streaming, and Reed alluded to this is, is only about 26%, according to Nielsen, of viewing consumption. So the 60% plus is still linear consumption. And then within streaming, we're only 7 -- we're only at 7% share of of total TV. So we're only 7% of that 26%. So there's big tailwinds there in terms of that overall trend from linear to streaming entertainment. And then that plays out in the financials. So again, our profit margins over the last 5 years have grown 5x. Our absolute profit dollars have grown 20x as the business has scaled from about $100 million to $2 billion of operating income per quarter over the past 5 years. And so that will continue to scale, we think, in a healthy way because the nature of our business scales well. It's creating content from anywhere to everywhere in this very large addressable market with these big profit pools. So we think we have a long runway of growth, profitability and return of value to shareholders."

You go back to about only 8 to 10 years ago, and no one was looking to the Internet or to streaming for the highest quality content. And today, the most watched, the most talked about, the most winning television is all coming out on streaming services. And to Spence's point, you've got this enormous addressable audience, we're only in a fraction of them, and we're only getting a small percentage of their total viewing. So it's still an enormous prize, and we're still in the best position to run after it as we've kind of expanded what Netflix is to members, which is not just a show you might like, but it's the shows you like. It's the films you love."

And of course, the trick there is to find the right feature set offerings that allow us to sort of broaden that range without cannibalizing the other layers. And we really take this sort of iterative approach where we try different solutions to that sort of puzzle and then measure them based on this -- what's the net revenue that we're seeing. And so very much what we're trying to do is, as we bring in lower price plan offerings that sort of decrease average revenue per member, we also think about that from the calculus of expanding the funnel in a way that delivers total net positive revenue, and we're definitely seeing that.

And so I would say on the demand side, maybe I'll let Ted speak to the supply side, if you will, in a second.

We have been doing pretty well so far, and we'll continue to feel our way along. So to date, we have been growing at that 3 percentage points per year for over any few year period. And as Reed said, that's something that's been reasonably, I wouldn't say easy, but accomplishable for sure when we're growing in that 20% or so revenue growth per year. Now obviously, that can't last forever in terms of 3 percentage points a year. But we think we have a long runway of growth. We have some things that work to our advantage in terms of the global nature of our platform, the ability to create stories anywhere and so that they travel well not just in their market, but across countries and markets around the world. So that's a nice model for us. We have a revenue model and subscription that also scales well in kind of established larger and smaller and emerging markets, and that's great as well.

Well, sort of picking it up where Reed left off, we really see this as an extension of the core entertainment offering that we've been focused on for the last 20 years, right? So just as we've continuously expanded the nature of our offering by adding new genres, unscripted film, local language programming, animation on and on. We think we have an opportunity to add gains to that offering and deliver more entertainment value to our members through that. And similar to what you've seen in that trajectory when we've added a new genre, that's what we expect will happen with games. So this is going to be -- it's a multiyear effort. We're going to start relatively small. We'll learn, we'll grow, we refocus our investment based on what we see as just continuously improve based on what our members are telling us is working. But I'm really excited about a bunch of different ways that I think that we can provide an offering here that is differentiated from what's out there already. And the first of those is really about the IP that we create. We are in the business of making these amazing worlds and great storylines and incredible characters. And we know the fans of those stories want to go deeper. They want to engage further. They actually want to direct a little bit where their energy goes. And what's great about interactive is, first of all, you can provide universes that just provide really significant amount of time that people can engage in and explore. They can also provide a little bit of intentionality. Where do they want to explore, what characters, what parts of the world, what parts of the time line? So there's just a lot of exciting things that I think we can do in that space. And we also feel that our subscription model yields some opportunities to focus on a set of game experiences that are currently underserved by the sort of dominant monetization models and games. We don't have to think about ads. We don't have to think about in-game purchases or other monetization. We don't have to think about per-title purchases. Really, we can do what we've been doing on the movie and series side, which is just paper -- laser-focused on delivering the most entertaining game experiences that we can't. So we're finding that many game developers really like that concept and that focus and this idea of being able to put all of their creative energy into just great gameplay and not having to worry about those other considerations that they have typically had to trade off with just making compelling games. So those are some of the core things that we're excited about and think that can make this effort for us special even in the world of games."

I've always known this management team to take an incrementalist approach on these things while also having well-informed thesis on the long term and how things will play out. So if you can articulate it, what is sort of your long-term thesis on gaming? And as starting with mobile and sort of a content vertical strategy, is that sort of a starting point? Or is that an ending point? And do you see yourself as a platform over time? Do you see gamers coming to the TV to play? What is sort of the long-term thesis of what this could evolve into?"

But we think mobile is a great platform for games. Clearly, it's very mature. It's got great enabling technology tools, a great developer community. And the vast majority of our members have phones that are capable of great gameplay experiences. So it sort of checks all of those boxes. And so it will be a primary focus for us to deliver those experiences. But ultimately, we see all of the devices that we currently serve as candidates for some kind of game experience. We've actually been delivering lighter-weight interactive experiences on TVs and TV connected devices for some time. And you can call those games, you can call them interactive experiences, but obviously, they all exist on a spectrum. And we're going to keep innovating in that space. And we feel like there's a rich opportunity to continue to deliver and advance ability, to improve the quality of game experiences we can deliver across the range of devices. And then we want to -- we'll be very sort of experimental and try a lot of things in this space. A lot of what we have to do right now is just focus on learning. And you mentioned that sort of incrementalist approach. A lot of this is really to maximize the learning velocity is what we would say. So we're going to try a bunch of different games through a variety of different mechanisms to see what's really working for our members. Part of that will be games that extend our IP. We think that's a really rich, rich space. So that's very much part of our long-term thesis. But also, we'll do things where we try stand-alone games. We feel like ultimately, this -- the success of this initiative is about great games fundamentally, and those can come from a variety of different sources. Maybe someday, we'll see a game that spawns a film or a series that would be an amazing place to get to and really see the rich interplay between these sort of different forms of entertainment. We'll also do licensing because we -- just so we've done in that sort of other genre expansion. It's a great way to increase the volume of the offering that we have at the start to learn more quickly. And then as our internal production sort of scales, we can focus the energy on what we're learning in that regard. So broadly, we think, as you said, there is a big, big prize here, and our job is really to sort of be very focused and deliberate about what we're going after that maximizes the learning value, iterate that continuous improvement approach. And we feel that, that's yielded really big results for us as we followed that sort of technique and all the kind of genre expansions we've done around the service."

We see those benefits in retention. Obviously, if we're delivering more value there then members stay with us longer. We see those values and acquisition as well because if there's a great game that lots of people are talking about to their friends, their colleagues, their family, then that's a source of acquisition for us as well."

Drive To Survive expanded the audience for Formula 1 racing pretty dramatically, in both in live ticket sales and TV ratings and merchandise sales, all those things. And I think that, that can be applied as long as the storytelling is great. So what's good about this for us is that we could apply those same kind of creative excellence to the storytelling behind those sports, the personalities behind those sports, the drama that happens off camera. And fans, not only deep fans are compelled to see more, but also can bring new folks into the sport. So we think it's pretty exciting. We think it's -- we'll continue to explore it. We have this incredible document on around Naomi Osaka that's -- just came out this week. That's another example of this that can really broaden the fandom for the tennis world, particularly going into this exciting period of the Olympics."

There's not like a pure science to it, but what we viewed it as we want to maintain some level of leverage in the marketplace because we want the familiarity, excuse me, with the capital markets should -- should we need access to capital over time. So that's why we talk about that $10 billion to $15 billion of leverage. But again, there's not a perfect science. So what's most important to us in terms of our capital allocation strategy, again, is to invest strategically in the business. So that -- that is our first priority. That's what hopefully you're hearing in terms of our investment into film, into television, extension into video games and hopefully, other content categories over time in that kind of mission or objective to entertain the world. But as we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders occasionally. That's why we started the share repurchase program. We repurchased 0.5 billion of shares in this last quarter in Q2. It's not -- that there's a fixed amount that we're going to repurchase every quarter. That's really after we've satisfied all of those other strategic objectives. And then we'll kind of take it from there, but we have a 5 billion share repurchase authorization. We will maintain some debt in the capital markets, but we've significantly delevered. I think our leverage is down to about 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA, which was a bit above 5x not too long ago. And we think it's important to have the flexibility in our balance sheet to into growth while being kind of prudent and responsible with our capital allocation.

And we've said in the past that we're open to content assets that can help accelerate our growth, things like intellectual property that we can develop into the original series and movies. In addition, film and TV libraries could be interesting as well. We'll see on the gaming side. That being said, we are mindful of a couple of things. First of all, our encumbrances, for example, which if some of these content assets are heavily encumbered and limit our ability to use them on Netflix, then they are of limited value to us since our top priority is to grow the core Netflix business. 
Secondly, our opportunity costs and trade-offs. So as we evaluate M&A, we always think about if we bought company X or asset X, where Y dollars, what's the alternative use of Y dollars and which is best for the company.

And what we're seeing is what we've sort of been talking about for the last couple of quarters and that there's still a bit of choppiness to our growth. We had the kind of big pull forward in 2020 of subscriber adds.
We also had to push in production of some of our kind of key returning titles and big tent-pole new releases until the latter part of the year. But overall, the business is performing well. Our churn is actually down relative to the more comparable 2-year-ago period in 2019, Q2 of '19 before COVID. Our viewing and we've talked about in the letter, our engagement is up nearly 20% over that period. But we still feel a little bit of that drag in terms of our acquisition growth as we're kind of working through what we hope is -- we can't be sure but what we hope is the tail end of this COVID choppiness where we see on the acquisition side as markets reopen, it does slow things down a little bit."

The one thing we do see with COVID is we don't see the big spikes that we saw in terms of engagement or acquisition or churn that we saw in the very early days of the pandemic. But on the margin, acquisition is impacted.
So for example, in Q2, when things tightened up a little bit, say, in Brazil or India, we did see some increase in acquisition. And similarly, as markets reopened, particularly in part -- in most of EMEA and the UCAN region, that did have a bit of a headwind on acquisition. And that's reflected basically in our Q3 guide as well, so similar business fundamentals that hopefully kind of starting to move a little bit further away from those market reopenings, which is why you do see some incremental growth, so a better seasonal period as well as moving a bit away from those market reopenings but not a big fundamental change and then hopefully into even more reacceleration as we get to the end of the year as we really get into the kind of heart of our kind of strong release schedule as well as peak seasonality."

So we remain on that growth trajectory. And again, once we get into Q4, what we would expect is as we get through, hopefully, that tail end of the COVID choppiness, we get into that strong strength of slate.

One is does Internet streaming slowdown, and that seems pretty unlikely. Internet streaming has been amazingly consistent, prolific. As you get new competition in, you get a validation of more reasons to get a smart TV or unlimited broadband. So I think, for at least the next several years, the growth story of streaming as a whole is very intact.
And then you've got the secular competition story. Does HBO or Disney or other entry have a differential impact compared to the past? And we're not seeing that in the detail that we have per country because they're launched in some countries and not in others. That gives us comfort. We're not seeing that in the total viewing like the Nielsen measures. And so we think mostly all of streaming is a growth story competing from linear TV and that, that will be true until, say, streaming is 50%, 60%, 70% of viewing. And then there's going to be shakeout, and we want to be prepared and leading that. But again, the next couple years, streaming is still in the early stages."

And this is the Internet applied to entertainment, and consumer entertainment around the world is an enormous market. It has great potential for us and potentially our competitors. And so that big thesis is, again, what gets people excited.
And when we're growing revenue by 19%, it's not that hard to grow 300 basis points of margin. As the revenue growth slows, it'll get a little bit tougher, but we'll continue to lean into that. And so I would say it's fundamentally a story of this big secular revenue growth management team committed to growing profits and cash flows and then returning those cash flows through buybacks, which Spence got a big start on this quarter. So over to you, Spence."

And as we continue to improve our service and the accessibility of our service, we don't see why we can't be in all or most of those homes over time if we're doing our job.
And then if you look at the range from an APAC region where we're only roughly 10% penetrated, so clearly early days, to our arguably, I guess, more tenured markets at least like in the UCAN, where even there with some of the metrics we put in the earnings letter streaming, and Reed alluded to this is, is only about 26%, according to Nielsen, of viewing consumption. So the 60% plus is still linear consumption. And then within streaming, we're only 7% -- we're only at 7% share of total TV. So we're only 7% of that 26%. So there's big tailwinds there in terms of that overall trend from linear to streaming entertainment.
And then that plays out in the financials. So again, our profit margins over the last 5 years have grown 5x. Our absolute profit dollars have grown 20x as the business has scaled from about $100 million to $2 billion of operating income per quarter over the past 5 years. And so that will continue to scale, we think, in a healthy way because the nature of our business scales well. It's creating content from anywhere to everywhere in this very large addressable market with these big profit pools. So we think we have a long runway of growth, profitability and return of value to shareholders."

And today, the most watched, the most talked about, the most award-winning television is all coming out on streaming services.
And to Spence's point, you've got this enormous addressable audience. We're only in a fraction of them, and we're only getting a small percentage of their total viewing. So it's still an enormous prize, and we're still in the best position to run after it as we've kind of expanded what Netflix is to members, which is not just a show you might like, but it's the shows you like.

And of course, the trick there is to find the right feature set offerings that allow us to sort of broaden that range without cannibalizing the other layers. And we really take this sort of iterative approach where we try different solutions to that sort of puzzle and then measure them based on this -- what's the net revenue that we're seeing.
And so very much what we're trying to do is, as we bring in lower price plan offerings that sort of decrease average revenue per member, we also think about that from the calculus of expanding the funnel in a way that delivers total net positive revenue, and we're definitely seeing that.

And if we do a good job there, then ultimately, then we have the ability to go back and occasionally ask some of those members to pay a little bit more to keep that virtuous cycle going.
And so I would say on the demand side -- maybe I'll let Ted speak to the supply side, if you will, in a second. But on the demand side, really, it's just that sort of very narrow focus on are we doing a good job at adding value and continuing to deliver more to our members."

And that's what I talked about before. We have been doing pretty well so far, and we'll continue to feel our way along. So to date, we have been growing at that 3 percentage points per year for over any few year period. And as Reed said, that's something that's been reasonably, I wouldn't say easy but accomplishable for sure when we're growing in that 20% or so revenue growth per year. 
Now obviously, that can't last forever in terms of 3 percentage points a year, but we think we have a long runway of growth. We have some things that work to our advantage in terms of the global nature of our platform, the ability to create stories anywhere and so that they travel well not just in their market but across countries and markets around the world. So that's a nice model for us. We have a revenue model and subscription that also scales well in kind of established larger and smaller and emerging markets, and that's great as well.

And then there's a number of supporting elements, consumer products, various shopping where we're really trying to grow those to support the title brands to get our conversations up around each of the titles so that the Netflix service becomes must-have. So they're not a profit pool of any material size on their own, but they are helping -- the reason we're doing them is to help the subscription service grow and be more important in people's lives, so I would say really, we're a one product company with a bunch of supporting elements that help that product be an incredible satisfaction for consumers and a monetizing engine for investors."

Well, sort of picking it up where Reed left off, we really see this as an extension of the core entertainment offering that we've been focused on for the last 20 years, right? So just as we've continuously expanded the nature of our offering by adding new genres, unscripted, film, local language programming, animation, on and on, we think we have an opportunity to add gains to that offering and deliver more entertainment value to our members through that. And similar to what you've seen in that trajectory when we've added a new genre, that's what we expect will happen with games. So this is going to be -- it's a multiyear effort. We're going to start relatively small. We'll learn. We'll grow. We'll refocus our investment based on what we see as working, and we'll just continuously improve based on what our members are telling us is working.
But I'm really excited about a bunch of different ways that I think that we can provide an offering here that is differentiated from what's out there already. And the first of those is really about the IP that we create. We are in the business of making these amazing worlds and great storylines and incredible characters. And we know the fans of those stories want to go deeper. They want to engage further. They actually want to direct a little bit where their energy goes. And what's great about interactive is, first of all, you can provide universes that just provide really significant amount of time that people can engage in and explore. They can also provide a little bit of intentionality. Where do they want to explore? What characters? What parts of the world? What parts of the time lines? There's just a lot of exciting things that I think we can do in that space.
And we also feel that our subscription model yields some opportunities to focus on a set of game experiences that are currently underserved by the sort of dominant monetization models and games. We don't have to think about ads. We don't have to think about in-game purchases or other monetization. We don't have to think about per-title purchases. Really, we can do what we've been doing on the movie and series side, which is just hyper laser-focused on delivering the most entertaining game experiences that we can't. So we're finding that many game developers really like that concept and that focus and this idea of being able to put all of their creative energy into just great gameplay and not having to worry about those other considerations that they have typically had to trade off with just making compelling games. So those are some of the core things that we're excited about and think that can make this effort for us special even in the world of games."

I've always known this management team to take an incrementalist approach on these things while also having a well-informed thesis on the long term and how things will play out. So if you can articulate it, what is sort of your long-term thesis on gaming? And as -- starting with mobile and sort of a content vertical strategy, is that sort of a starting point? Or is that an ending point? And do you see yourself as a platform over time? Do you see gamers coming to the TV to play? What is sort of the long-term thesis of what this could evolve into?"

But we think mobile is a great platform for games. Clearly, it's very mature. It's got great enabling technology, tools, a great developer community, and the vast majority of our members have phones that are capable of great gameplay experiences. So it sort of checks all of those boxes.
And so it'll be a primary focus for us to deliver those experiences, but ultimately, we see all of the devices that we currently serve as candidates for some kind of game experience. We've actually been delivering lighter-weight interactive experiences on TVs and TV connected devices for some time. And you can call those games, you can call them interactive experiences, but obviously, they all exist on a spectrum.
And we're going to keep innovating in that space, and we feel like there's a rich opportunity to continue to deliver and advance the technical capability to improve the quality of game experiences we can deliver across the range of devices. And then we want to -- we'll be very sort of experimental and try a lot of things in this space. A lot of what we have to do right now is just focus on learning. And you mentioned that sort of incrementalist approach. A lot of this is really try and maximize the learning velocity is what we would say.
So we're going to try a bunch of different games through a variety of different mechanisms to see what's really working for our members. Part of that will be games that extend our IP. We think that's a really rich, rich space, so that's very much part of our long-term thesis. But also, we'll do things where we try stand-alone games. We feel like, ultimately, this -- the success of this initiative is about great games fundamentally, and those can come from a variety of different sources. Maybe someday, we'll see a game that spawns a film or a series. That would be an amazing place to get to and really see the rich interplay between these sort of different forms of entertainment.
We'll also do licensing because we -- just as we've done in that sort of other genre expansion, it's a great way to increase the volume of the offering that we have at the start to learn more quickly. And then as our internal production sort of scales, we can focus the energy on what we're learning in that regard.
So broadly, we think, as you said, there is a big, big prize here, and our job is really to sort of be very focused and deliberate about what we're going after that maximizes the learning value, iterate that continuous improvement approach. And we feel that, that's yielded really big results for us as we followed that sort of technique and all the kind of genre expansions we've done around the service."

We see those benefits in retention. Obviously, if we're delivering more value there, then members stay with us longer. We see those values in acquisition as well because if there's a great game that lots of people are talking about to their friends, their colleagues, their family, then that's a source of acquisition for us as well."

Drive To Survive expanded the audience for Formula 1 racing pretty dramatically, in both in live ticket sales and TV ratings and merchandise sales, all those things. And I think that, that can be applied as long as the storytelling is great.
So what's good about this for us is that we could apply those same kind of creative excellence to the storytelling behind those sports, the personalities behind those sports, the drama that happens off camera. And fans, not only deep fans are compelled to see more but also can bring new folks into the sport.
So we think it's pretty exciting. We think it's -- we'll continue to explore it. We have this incredible documentary on around Naomi Osaka that's -- just came out this week. That's another example of this that can really broaden the fandom for the tennis world, particularly going into this exciting period of the Olympics."

There's not like a pure science to it, but what we viewed as we want to maintain some level of leverage in the marketplace because we want the familiarity, excuse me, with the capital markets should we need access to capital over time. So that's why we talk about that $10 billion to $15 billion of leverage.
But again, there's not a perfect science. So what's most important to us in terms of our capital allocation strategy, again, is to invest strategically in the business. So that  is our first priority. That's what hopefully you're hearing in terms of our investment into film, into television, extension into video games and hopefully, other content categories over time in that kind of mission or objective to entertain the world.
But as we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders occasionally. That's why we started the share repurchase program. We repurchased 0.5 billion of shares in this last quarter in Q2. It's not -- that there's a fixed amount that we're going to repurchase every quarter. That's really after we've satisfied all of those other strategic objectives. And then we'll kind of take it from there, but we have a $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We will maintain some debt in the capital markets, but we've significantly delevered. I think our leverage is down to about 2.5x debt to EBITDA, which was a bit above 5x not too long ago. And we think it's important to have the flexibility in our balance sheet to invest into growth while being kind of prudent and responsible with our capital allocation.

In addition, film and TV libraries could be interesting as well. We'll see on the gaming side. That being said, we are mindful of a couple of things. First of all, our encumbrances, for example, which if some of these content assets are heavily encumbered and limit our ability to use them on Netflix, then they're of limited value to us since our top priority is to grow the core Netflix business.
Secondly, our opportunity costs and trade-offs.

Our interviewer this quarter is Nidhi Gupta from Fidelity. 
As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. Nidhi, you now have the green light to ask your first question."

In terms of what we saw this quarter for Q3, I guess, it really boils down to what we saw as sort of what we expected. We talked about on the last call that we hoped that we were getting towards that kind of tail end of the COVID choppiness of the pull forward of sub growth into 2020 and those production delays that we're working through as well. And that's kind of what we're seeing. 
So throughout the quarter, the business remained healthy as it had been throughout the year with churn at low levels, down prior to the comparable periods, both in 2020 and 2 years ago, pre-COVID in 2019. So retention was very healthy. And viewing was up viewing per member, maybe slightly down compared to the very COVID distorted 2020 Q3, but up healthy compared to 2019 comparable period. And then what we saw, as the quarter continued into September, we saw acceleration in our growth, which is what we had been hoping for and expecting but it was good to see as we got into the strength of our schedule. We had a couple big hits. As you know, you mentioned one with Squid Game, La Casa de Papel, the first part of Season 5, but a lot of variety and quality programming throughout the quarter with things like Never Have I Ever, and He's All That and Chestnut Man and Copenhagen at the end of the quarter. So just -- that's basically the way it played out is as we got into the strength of the schedule on top of already kind of healthy business fundamentals, we saw a bit of an uptick in growth."

The good news is we only take pricing like that, as Greg speaks to a lot, when we believe we're increasing the value to our members, and we believe we've done that. So there's -- it's a sort of a short-term slowdown in growth, but good for our business. and we're already continuing to grow through it, but it did slow us down a little bit in Latin America in Q3. And so we also talked about in the letter for Latin America and UCAN, both of those markets are bit more mature, more tenured, more penetrated than some of our other markets. So we would expect growth to be just a little bit harder to work for, but still a lot of runway for growth in both of those regions."

We can't come off the craziness of COVID and be confident of the next 2 years. So we're going to push really hard. If you think about the big picture, we're at 200-and-something million, that's pretty small compared to pay TV households, ex China. So just matching the pay TV households, plenty of room for growth. Streaming is developing at a great pace, all kinds of devices and competitors, helping that market growing. Competition, obviously, that's a factor, but the amount of scale of content and entertainment that we have. And the way we're set up, it's like Squid Game is incredible. But it's not that Ted commissioned it. The most incredible part is it's the system that Ted's built with highly distributed trade when it was one of our leaders in Korea 2 years ago that commissioned it. And so there's got to be other amazing ones like that, that even Ted or I or any of us don't even yet know about that are digesting in the Netflix content engine. So we certainly hope so, but there's no real certainty I wouldn't want to give it like management credibility of that. We want it. And if we're going to push hard into it, but I think we're all wrestling with the post COVID, how do things come back together. Spence, anything you want to add on that?"

Squid Game, as Reed pointed out, got -- was picked up a couple of years ago from the Korea team who did recognize it to be one of what they thought would be their biggest title this year. So good that they did. But I can't tell you that we had the same eyeball on it to tell you that it was going to be the biggest title in our history around the world. 
And to your point, the growth -- the [indiscernible] outside of Korea has been phenomenal and everywhere, everywhere we operate. So if you look at these numbers, they are -- the internal viewing looks a lot like a local language show in any country you look at it. It was enormously successful. 
And that's 10 years trying to sell the show. Our team recognized something that nobody else did and created an environment for that creator to make a great show. So how something can go viral is really hard to predict, but it's super powerful when it happens. And to show us to deliver the goods to be able to deliver that much viewing and you have people talk about it in such short hand that you can spoof it on Saturday Night Live because it's so in the zeitgeist, there, I said it for you. And it happens. Until we feel it when it's happening and you know when it's happening, it's a little hard to predict sometimes. Sometimes you think you've got lightning in a bottle and you're wrong. And sometimes, you think you've got a great Korean show that turns out to be lightning in the bottle for the world. 
But remember, it's -- that came from Korea, which is super phenomenal, but we've had successes not on that scale, but like that, with La Casa de Papel from Spain, with Lupin from France, with the film Blood Red Sky from Germany, from Sex Education in the U.K. where the stories of the world can increasingly come from anywhere in the world. And this is a thing that we really work on day in and day out. And the teams that are doing that around the world, the thing that they're mostly focused on is a great, great windfall when these things happen, but they're mostly focused on a bunch of shows you never heard of, like -- but that are hugely impactful in territory. Sintonia in Brazil, Chestnut Man right now in Denmark for us is an enormous success. Coming up in the quarter, a spinout version of Call My Agent from India; the Italian film, the Hand of God; new season of Luis Miguel. So these are all shows that are meant to be hugely impactful and loved in territory. And if they really catch on, they travel a lot. But they're really focused on making a difference. And around the world, non-English content viewing has grown 3x since we started in 2008 making content. So I started thinking about the impact of that and the impact of that growth and the idea that we can put new storytellers into the world from everywhere in the world, and they will pay the way TV and film has made in the future."

It's that kind of thing that happens on this -- that can happen on Netflix because we have this really engaged fan base and we have this UI that recognizes and helps them figure out how to find the show they're going to love, even if they never watch the show from Korea.

So that's 1 really key area that we're excited to explore. 
And another one is that we think that this just connects really well with the other work that we are doing. We're creating all these amazing universes and worlds and characters and storylines, and we can attach to the passion and fandom that our members have on viewing those on the video side with game experiences and allow them to go deeper and explore spaces that they wouldn't have otherwise seen on the video side. And so we really think there's a good connection and synergy there. And over time, we'll try and bring those closer together and sort of let those 2 worlds more influence each other and have a more direct connection. 
But again, that's something that is years in the making. We've really got to iteratively explore and none of us know exactly what that will look like because we'll have to sort of find our way as we go."

Well, it's a whole different muscle, right? And creating games is this alchemy of a whole variety of stuff where you have engineering and you have the design and the story and then you have sort of a data element, especially in games that are sort of living and evolve as players interact with it. So we've never done that before. And so the hard part is going to be putting that all together and really learning how to be successful at that. 
And again, back to your point previously, we've only been in the originals game for less than a decade. And we've done a pretty good job at building the capability to be better and better at that. And so our plan is to essentially follow that same trajectory and apply the same kind of approaches that we have and really be focusing as a learning organization or how do we advance those skills. 
And I think we're going to take a bunch of different approaches to try and be successful in that space, just like we did in movies and TV shows. If you think about license to partner-produce, to self-produce, there's multiple avenues that we get to, to producing incredible entertainment experiences for our members. I think we're going to take a similar approach with games, which will have multiple different approaches, including an internal game development capability. And that internal capability really allows us to sort of push the edges on what is interactive storytelling and how do we bridge that more tightly with the linear storytelling that we're doing on the video side. 
So we want to build that up. And one of the ways to sort of accelerate that process is when we find the right opportunities through acquisition, and that's what we did with Night School. And we're tremendously excited about that team in specific because they really -- the core of what they've done is to try and explore story and narrative essentially as the central game mechanic. And we think that fits really, really well with what we're trying to do. And so it's been great to get them on board and involved and to hear their thoughts and ideas. And I expect it will be a sort of a rich partnership over years to come."

And through that process, we went through the organization, our live-action TV teams, our film series teams and everybody going through saying and there was enough interest and desire to create in this universe. So we thought it would make sense for it to be -- to all reside here in Netflix, creating stories for the world from this universe with these really richly developed characters that have done great, like from James and the Giant Peach to BFG and of course, Willy Wonka and all the characters that are coming from that. We're doing an origin story series from Willy Wonka.

What I believe is that you don't need necessarily this enormous machine to create brand loyalty around its characters in kid film. We've had great success on without any of the machine, without in the machine, just being able to be a very important part of kids viewing life. So I think we've got to really focus on like we do everything else on how good is the storytelling, how good is the execution, how great is the production value, are we advancing the art of animation or the animation world, which will continue to attract the best and brightest.

In terms of what we saw this quarter for Q3, I guess, it really boils down to what we saw as sort of what we expected. We talked about on the last call that we hoped that we were getting towards that kind of tail end of the COVID choppiness, the pull-forward of sub growth into 2020 and those production delays that we're working through as well. And that's kind of what we're seeing. 
So throughout the quarter, the business remained healthy as it had been throughout the year with churn at low levels, down prior to the comparable periods, both in 2020 and 2 years ago, pre-COVID in 2019. So retention was very healthy. And viewing was up. Viewing per member, maybe slightly down compared to the very COVID-distorted 2020 Q3, but up healthy compared to 2019 comparable period. 
And then what we saw -- as the quarter continued into September, we saw acceleration in our growth, which is what we had been hoping for and expecting but it was good to see as we got into the strength of our schedule. We had a couple big hits. As you know, you mentioned one with Squid Game, La Casa de Papel, the first part of Season 5, but a lot of variety and quality programming throughout the quarter with things like Never Have I Ever, and He's All That and Chestnut Man and Copenhagen at the end of the quarter. So just -- that's basically the way it played out is as we got into the strength of the schedule on top of already kind of healthy business fundamentals, we saw a bit of an uptick in growth."

The good news is we only take pricing like that, as Greg speaks to a lot, when we believe we're increasing the value to our members. And we believe we've done that. So there's -- it's a sort of a short-term slowdown in growth, but good for our business. And we're already continuing to grow through it. 
But it did slow us down a little bit in Latin America in Q3. And so we also talked about in the letter for Latin America and UCAN, both of those markets are a bit more mature, more tenured, more penetrated than some of our other markets. So we would expect growth to be just a little bit harder to work for, but still a lot of runway for growth in both of those regions."

We can't come off the craziness of COVID and be confident of the next 2 years. So we're going to push really hard. If you think about the big picture, we're at 200-and-something million. That's pretty small compared to pay TV households, ex China. So just matching the pay TV households, plenty of room for growth. Streaming is developing at a great pace, all kinds of devices and competitors helping that market growing. 
Competition, obviously, that's a factor, but the amount of scale of content and entertainment that we have, and the way we're set up -- it's like Squid Game is incredible. But it's not that Ted commissioned it. The most incredible part is it's the system that Ted's built with a highly distributed [ business model ] when it was one of our leaders in Korea 2 years ago that commissioned it. And so there's got to be other amazing ones like that, that even Ted or I or any of us don't even yet know about that are digesting in the Netflix content engine. 
So we certainly hope so, but there's no real certainty. I wouldn't want to give it like management credibility of that. We want it, and we're going to push hard into it.

Squid Game, as Reed pointed out, got -- was picked up a couple of years ago from the Korea team who did recognize it to be one of what they thought would be their biggest title this year. So good that they did. But I can't tell you that we had the same eyeball on it to tell you that it was going to be the biggest title in our history around the world. And to your point, the growth -- the viewing outside of Korea has been phenomenal and everywhere, everywhere we operate. So if you look at these numbers, they are -- the internal viewing looks a lot like a local language show in any country you look at it. It was enormously successful. 
And that's 10 years trying to sell the show. Our team recognized something that nobody else did and created an environment for that creator to make a great show. So how something can go viral is really hard to predict, but it's super powerful when it happens, and to show us to deliver the goods to be able to deliver that much viewing and you have people talk about it in such short hand that you can spoof it on Saturday Night Live because it's so in the zeitgeist. There, I said it for you. And it happens. 
And we feel it when it's happening and you know when it's happening. It's a little hard to predict sometimes. Sometimes you think you've got lightning in a bottle and you're wrong. And sometimes, you think you've got a great Korean show that turns out to be lightning in the bottle for the world. 
But remember, it's -- that came from Korea, which is super phenomenal, but we've had successes not on that scale, but like that, with La Casa de Papel from Spain, with Lupin from France, with the film Blood Red Sky from Germany, from Sex Education in the U.K., where the stories of the world can increasingly come from anywhere in the world. And this is a thing that we really work on day in and day out. 
And the teams that are doing that around the world, the thing that they're mostly focused on is a great, great windfall when these things happen, but they're mostly focused on a bunch of shows you never heard of, like -- but that are hugely impactful in territory. Sintonia in Brazil, Chestnut Man right now in Denmark for us is an enormous success. Coming up in the quarter, a spinout version of Call My Agent! from India (sic) [ France ]; the Italian film, The Hand of God; new season of Luis Miguel. So these are all shows that are meant to be hugely impactful and loved in territory. And if they really catch on, they travel a lot. 
But they're really focused on making a difference. And around the world, non-English content viewing has grown 3x since we started in 2008 making content. So I started thinking about the impact of that and the impact of that growth and the idea that we can put new storytellers into the world from everywhere in the world, and they will dictate the way TV and film is made in the future."

So we're really just sort of checking off the first bits of that process, and that's going well. We've got a positive trajectory.

And we'll learn by basically putting stuff out there and then having our members tell us what's working and what's not. But we're excited about the idea that by taking away what we see as distractions from the core enjoyment experience associated with other models like advertisements or in-app monetization, per-title costs that we can really give our members a much easier, direct enjoyment experience with games, just like we have with TV shows and movies. 
And there's a great flip side to that coin as well, which is that our creators can really put all of their energy, everything they're excited about into making that maximal enjoyment experience for the users, the players of those games, without having to worry about those other things that they have to in other models in terms of monetization. So that's one really key area that we're excited to explore. 
And another one is that we think that this just connects really well with the other work that we are doing. We're creating all these amazing universes and worlds and characters and storylines, and we can attach to the passion and fandom that our members have on viewing those on the video side with game experiences and allow them to go deeper and explore spaces that they wouldn't have otherwise seen on the video side. And so we really think there's a good connection and synergy there. And over time, we'll try and bring those closer together and sort of let those 2 worlds more influence each other and have a more direct connection. 
But again, that's something that is years in the making. We've really got to iteratively explore, and none of us know exactly what that will look like because we'll have to sort of find our way as we go."

And creating games is this alchemy of a whole variety of stuff, where you have engineering and you have the design and the story and then you have sort of a data element, especially in games that are sort of living and evolve as players interact with it. So we've never done that before. And so the hard part is going to be putting that all together and really learning how to be successful at that. 
And again, back to your point previously, we've only been in the originals game for less than a decade. And we've done a pretty good job at building the capability to be better and better at that. And so our plan is to essentially follow that same trajectory and apply the same kind of approaches that we have and really be focusing as a learning organization on how do we advance those skills. 
And I think we're going to take a bunch of different approaches to try and be successful in that space, just like we did in movies and TV shows. If you think about license to partner-produced, to self-produced, there's multiple avenues that we get to, to producing incredible entertainment experiences for our members. I think we're going to take a similar approach with games, which will have multiple different approaches, including an internal game development capability. And that internal capability really allows us to sort of push the edges on what is interactive storytelling and how do we bridge that more tightly with the linear storytelling that we're doing on the video side. 
So we want to build that up. And one of the ways to sort of accelerate that process is when we find the right opportunities through acquisition, and that's what we did with Night School. And we're tremendously excited about that team in specific because they really -- the core of what they've done is to try and explore story and narrative essentially as the central game mechanic. And we think that fits really, really well with what we're trying to do. And so it's been great to get them on board and involved and to hear their thoughts and ideas. And I expect it will be a sort of a rich partnership over years to come."

Like from James and the Giant Peach to BFG, and of course, Willy Wonka and all the characters that are coming from that. We're doing an origin story series from Willy Wonka.

And when we talk even in the letter about the secular growth here is this transition from linear to streaming entertainment even in our most kind of mature markets like the U.S., which we show in the letter, we're at between 6% of TV share in terms of screen time.

So some of those are just earlier and higher growth, but we're growing across all those content categories, and we don't see a ceiling at least for the foreseeable future."

And one of the things I love about working here is just that unsatiable appetite for improvement. And one of the areas -- one of the biggest dimensions that we're seeing, which is, I think, really apropos to sort of what we've been talking about in this call is how we go from being really a U.S. company that has international relation -- international operations to really a truly global company. 
And we can see the opportunity there, whether it's seeing content like Squid Game or Lupin or La Casa de Papel, and we really want to just do that more and more and more. So we're working through how do we, as a company, set ourselves up to operate even more effectively in that context and do even more of what you've sort of seen with those titles. So that's a big dimension of growth for us. 
And then on the studio side, we're really excited about how do we leverage some of the -- what we have as DNA in the company around tech and things like that to try and figure out, is there a way to better serve our creators and our creative partners, give them a bigger palette, a bigger envelope to work from. And I think one of the exciting areas around this is -- again, that sort of platform, if you will, of creation, that sort of set of tools and capabilities. If we can do that well, we can sort of give that to everybody, all of our creative partners around the world, and give them sort of a bigger place to stand from and tell their story, and that's pretty exciting."

In terms of what we saw this quarter for Q3, I guess, it really boils down to what we saw as sort of what we expected.

And that's kind of what we're seeing. 
So throughout the quarter, the business remained healthy as it had been throughout the year with churn at low levels, down prior to the comparable periods, both in 2020 and 2 years ago, pre-COVID in 2019. So retention was very healthy. And viewing was up. Viewing per member, maybe slightly down compared to the very COVID-distorted 2020 Q3, but up healthy compared to 2019 comparable period. 
And then what we saw -- as the quarter continued into September, we saw acceleration in our growth, which is what we had been hoping for and expecting but it was good to see as we got into the strength of our schedule. We had a couple big hits. As you know, you mentioned one with Squid Game, La Casa de Papel, the first part of Season 5, but a lot of variety and quality programming throughout the quarter with things like Never Have I Ever, and He's All That and Chestnut Man and Copenhagen at the end of the quarter. So just -- that's basically the way it played out is as we got into the strength of the schedule on top of already kind of healthy business fundamentals, we saw a bit of an uptick in growth."

The good news is we only take pricing like that, as Greg speaks to a lot, when we believe we're increasing the value to our members. And we believe we've done that. So there's -- it's a sort of a short-term slowdown in growth, but good for our business. And we're already continuing to grow through it. 
But it did slow us down a little bit in Latin America in Q3. And so we also talked about in the letter for Latin America and UCAN, both of those markets are a bit more mature, more tenured, more penetrated than some of our other markets.

That's pretty small compared to pay TV households, ex China. So just matching the pay TV households, plenty of room for growth. Streaming is developing at a great pace, all kinds of devices and competitors helping that market growing. 
Competition, obviously, that's a factor, but the amount of scale of content and entertainment that we have, and the way we're set up -- it's like Squid Game is incredible. But it's not that Ted commissioned it. The most incredible part is it's the system that Ted's built with a highly distributed [ business model ] when it was one of our leaders in Korea 2 years ago that commissioned it. And so there's got to be other amazing ones like that, that even Ted or I or any of us don't even yet know about that are digesting in the Netflix content engine.

So if you look at these numbers, they are -- the internal viewing looks a lot like a local language show in any country you look at it. It was enormously successful. 
And that's 10 years trying to sell the show. Our team recognized something that nobody else did and created an environment for that creator to make a great show. So how something can go viral is really hard to predict, but it's super powerful when it happens, and to show us to deliver the goods to be able to deliver that much viewing and you have people talk about it in such short hand that you can spoof it on Saturday Night Live because it's so in the zeitgeist. There, I said it for you. And it happens. 
And we feel it when it's happening and you know when it's happening. It's a little hard to predict sometimes. Sometimes you think you've got lightning in a bottle and you're wrong. And sometimes, you think you've got a great Korean show that turns out to be lightning in the bottle for the world. 
But remember, it's -- that came from Korea, which is super phenomenal, but we've had successes not on that scale, but like that, with La Casa de Papel from Spain, with Lupin from France, with the film Blood Red Sky from Germany, from Sex Education in the U.K., where the stories of the world can increasingly come from anywhere in the world. And this is a thing that we really work on day in and day out. 
And the teams that are doing that around the world, the thing that they're mostly focused on is a great, great windfall when these things happen, but they're mostly focused on a bunch of shows you never heard of, like -- but that are hugely impactful in territory. Sintonia in Brazil, Chestnut Man right now in Denmark for us is an enormous success. Coming up in the quarter, a spinout version of Call My Agent! from India (sic) [ France ]; the Italian film, The Hand of God; new season of Luis Miguel. So these are all shows that are meant to be hugely impactful and loved in territory. And if they really catch on, they travel a lot. 
But they're really focused on making a difference. And around the world, non-English content viewing has grown 3x since we started in 2008 making content. So I started thinking about the impact of that and the impact of that growth and the idea that we can put new storytellers into the world from everywhere in the world, and they will dictate the way TV and film is made in the future."

It's that kind of thing that happens on this -- that can happen on Netflix because we have this really engaged fan base and we have this UI that recognizes and helps them figure out how to find the show they're going to love, even if they've never watched a show from Korea.

And I think it's important to note that, first of all, we're going to learn our way through that just as we have in the other content categories that we've served. And we'll learn by basically putting stuff out there and then having our members tell us what's working and what's not. But we're excited about the idea that by taking away what we see as distractions from the core enjoyment experience associated with other models like advertisements or in-app monetization, per-title costs that we can really give our members a much easier, direct enjoyment experience with games, just like we have with TV shows and movies. 
And there's a great flip side to that coin as well, which is that our creators can really put all of their energy, everything they're excited about into making that maximal enjoyment experience for the users, the players of those games, without having to worry about those other things that they have to in other models in terms of monetization. So that's one really key area that we're excited to explore. 
And another one is that we think that this just connects really well with the other work that we are doing. We're creating all these amazing universes and worlds and characters and storylines, and we can attach to the passion and fandom that our members have on viewing those on the video side with game experiences and allow them to go deeper and explore spaces that they wouldn't have otherwise seen on the video side. And so we really think there's a good connection and synergy there. And over time, we'll try and bring those closer together and sort of let those 2 worlds more influence each other and have a more direct connection. 
But again, that's something that is years in the making. We've really got to iteratively explore, and none of us know exactly what that will look like because we'll have to sort of find our way as we go."

And creating games is this alchemy of a whole variety of stuff, where you have engineering and you have the design and the story and then you have sort of a data element, especially in games that are sort of living and evolve as players interact with it. So we've never done that before. And so the hard part is going to be putting that all together and really learning how to be successful at that. 
And again, back to your point previously, we've only been in the originals game for less than a decade. And we've done a pretty good job at building the capability to be better and better at that. And so our plan is to essentially follow that same trajectory and apply the same kind of approaches that we have and really be focusing as a learning organization on how do we advance those skills. 
And I think we're going to take a bunch of different approaches to try and be successful in that space, just like we did in movies and TV shows. If you think about license to partner-produced, to self-produced, there's multiple avenues that we get to, to producing incredible entertainment experiences for our members. I think we're going to take a similar approach with games, which will have multiple different approaches, including an internal game development capability. And that internal capability really allows us to sort of push the edges on what is interactive storytelling and how do we bridge that more tightly with the linear storytelling that we're doing on the video side. 
So we want to build that up. And one of the ways to sort of accelerate that process is when we find the right opportunities through acquisition, and that's what we did with Night School. And we're tremendously excited about that team in specific because they really -- the core of what they've done is to try and explore story and narrative essentially as the central game mechanic. And we think that fits really, really well with what we're trying to do. And so it's been great to get them on board and involved and to hear their thoughts and ideas. And I expect it will be a sort of a rich partnership over years to come."

So the ability to do that, I think, is really -- we have it in our wheelhouse to be able to do it and to grow it big. 
I don't think even a huge success against the revenue and margins of the core business that it will look like it will make much difference in terms -- the core for us is that it gets very, very big so that it enhances the talkability and zeitgeist moments around our content and gives fans a way to express that fandom in a way that amplifies it and attracts more fans."

So with our guidance, we're guiding to roughly just a tick under 20%, 19% revenue growth for the year. Still very healthy revenue growth. I mean for -- that's on a base of roughly $30 billion of revenue. 
So if we can sustain anything around those levels, that's pretty rare air at that scale. And so we'll work hard to do that. And that comes down to what I said before. Ultimately, what we -- how we control that is -- our best control, it is to make our service better and better every day through this amazing variety and quality of content and better discovery of that content and connecting with our fans around the world. So that's where we're focused on. 
If we can do that and we can kind of manage our business in a prudent, scrappy way, we're committed to doing so. So for the next few years, at least, we're committed to making those trade-offs, growing healthy, strategically investing in the business and growing our margins at that roughly 3 percentage points per year on average on a kind of on a multiyear basis."

So no, the short of it is that we think we're still early days. And when we talk even in the letter about the secular growth here is this transition from linear to streaming entertainment even in our most kind of mature markets like the U.S., which we show in the letter, we're at between 6% of TV share in terms of screen time. And so in categories we talked about, gaming, we're literally just getting started. So who knows where that's going to take us. Animation, we talked about, we're just a few years into a long cycle. These non-English language series and films around the world, we're now producing I think in roughly 45 countries around the world. It will be more than 50 next year, but again, still early days. 
So we think we have a super long runway here to address those upwards of 1 billion pay TV households or broadband households, however you measure it, around the world. So what we look at is, are we continuing to grow in a healthy way, driving acquisition, retention, more viewing, delivering more joy to our members. 
I don't think there's a precise number there, Nidhi, other than that we have the ability, we believe, to grow across all those content categories for the foreseeable future, some more than others, right, in terms of pace of growth.

And we can see the opportunity there, whether it's seeing content like Squid Game or Lupin or La Casa de Papel, and we really want to just do that more and more and more.

But look, so in terms of Q1 performance, it really boils down to COVID, frankly. As you know, the extraordinary events of COVID have had a big impact on the world, continue to have a big impact on the world. And  for us, at a minimum, creates just some short-term kind of choppiness in some of the business trends that we see in our business.
So in particular, we had this huge pull forward in 2020 in terms of our subscriber additions, nearly 40 million paid net adds in 2020. And we also had a near global shutdown in production, which we've been ramping safely and at scale through much of last year and into this year but it did push some key title launches into the back -- kind of the back end of this year.
So the combination of those 2 things does create some noise. It's super hard to obviously kind of forecast quarterly subscribers in a typical quarter for us and particularly hard in this environment. In fact, on Page 2 of our earnings letter, we show our actuals relative to forecast, which in our guide is our internal forecast for subscribers. And because it's our forecast, we're going to miss every quarter. It's just a matter of whether they're bigger or smaller misses.
And you can see, over the past 5 years, our biggest kind of misses to forecast, either up or down, the -- most of those big misses and the biggest are in the past 5 quarters relative to the past 5 years, and that was these 5 quarters of COVID. So it's just a difficult time to forecast the business.
But the key is the business remains healthy. Our engagement, our viewing per household was up year-over-year in Q1. Our churn was down year-over-year, and the business is still growing. So even at 4 million paid net adds, if you kind of take COVID out and look over the past 2 years, we've grown from 2 years ago at about 150 million members to almost 210 million now. So that's nearly 40% growth and about just under 20% over an average over each of those 2 years, which is in line with the past couple of years.
So the business remains healthy, and that's because the long-term drivers, this big transition from linear to streaming entertainment, and that remains as healthy as ever. But you do see a little kind of noise in the near term, but a lot of long-term parity."

So I don't think there's any material effect we're going to notice about future openings and closings, again, because we've been through in many countries pretty intense surges, unfortunately."

So you go into these production cycles, you go into the planning cycles and you've got a pretty smooth release of high-profile projects and smaller kind of passion projects and all those things.
And what happened, I guess, in the first part of this year is a lot of the projects we had hoped to come out earlier did get pushed because of the post production delays and the COVID delays in production. And we think we'll get back to much steadier state in the back half of the year and certainly in Q4, where we've got the returning seasons of some of our most popular shows like The Witcher and You and Cobra Kai as well as some big tempo movies that came to market a little slower than we'd hoped, like Red Notes with The Rock and Ryan Reynolds and Gaga, and Escape From Spiderhead with Chris Hemsworth, big event content.
Now all that being said, in every quarter of the year, we released more content than we did in the previous quarter -- in the previous years quarter-by-quarter and in every region is just that I think the shape of the mix of the content is becoming a little more uncertain.

And the great thing about that is those stories that are coming from all over the world, like we saw with Lupin this year, this quarter, it was our biggest new series on Netflix in the world was Lupin from France. And the show was not like a watered-down French show. It was a very French show. And what's really been great about it is as you tell stories from around the world, those -- the more authentically local they are, the more likely they are to play around the world because people recognize the authenticity of storytelling.
And that's something that we've been really focused on as well as continuing to offer a very big variety of content from Hollywood to the world as well. But we've got new seasons of really popular shows from around the world like Elite in Spain, La Casa de Papel coming up, The Naked Director from Japan, which has been an enormous hit for us, Gift from Turkey.

So it's constantly just trying to push on all those different engines and really figure out what is that right price point, the right offering and the right way that works for the local members and consumers."

So we're going to keep doing that. We're going to keep working on that, working on accessibility across all of the countries that we serve. But we also want to ensure that while we're doing that, that we're good at making sure that the people who are using a Netflix account, who are accessing it are the ones that are authorized to do so.
And that's what this sort of line of testing is about. It's not necessarily a new thing. We've been doing this for a while.

So we expect to be about cash flow breakeven this year and then sustainably free cash flow positive and growing thereafter.
And so -- and we don't intend to build up a bunch of excess cash on the balance sheet. So we will maintain a debt level, a gross debt level in the $10 billion to $15 billion range. We've paid down about $500 million in principal in Q1. So we -- our gross debt did come down from the prior quarter. And we think that share buybacks are a way to return value to shareholders in a way that is responsible steward of capital, but also maintains a level of balance sheet flexibility for us to continue to be strategic.
Because first and foremost, our #1 priority is to invest strategically into the growth of the business, but then, of course, return excess cash to our shareholders. So we're still maintaining a goal of about 2 months of revenue is our kind of cash on the balance sheet. And you'll see us ease into that share buyback program. So it will start this quarter. As I said, I think you'll see us ease into it. And we're authorized up to $5 billion of share repurchase, and we'll kind of get the program going this year."

So outside of China, I think pay television peaked about 800 million households. So lots of room -- and that was several years ago that it peaked, lots of room to grow.
So think about it as we do want to expand. So, like, we used to do that thing shipping DVDs and luckily, we didn't get stuck with that. We didn't define that as the main thing. We defined entertainment as the main thing. And so then we expanded into -- Ted -- I should say Ted expanded us into original content.
And first, it was original series and then films and then animation and kids and unscripted. And so bit by bit, we're adding category. So we've got a lot of work to do in terms of different types of entertainment that we'll continue to do that, a lot of work in terms of global production. So I don't think there will be a second act in the sense that you mean like an AWS and Amazon shopping.
I bet we end up with one, hopefully, gigantic, hopefully, very defensible profit pool and then continue to improve the service for our members by doing that by expanding in category. So I wouldn't look for any big, large secondary pool of profits. There'll be a bunch of supporting pools like consumer products that can be both profitable and can support the title brands.

But look, so in terms of Q1 performance, it really boils down to COVID, frankly. As you know, the extraordinary events of COVID have had a big impact on the world, continue to have a big impact on the world. And  for us, at a minimum, creates just some short-term kind of choppiness in some of the business trends that we see in our business.
So in particular, we had this huge pull forward in 2020 in terms of our subscriber additions, nearly 40 million paid net adds in 2020. And we also had a near global shutdown in production, which we've been ramping safely and at scale through much of last year and into this year but it did push some key title launches into the back -- kind of the back end of this year.
So the combination of those 2 things does create some noise. It's super hard to obviously kind of forecast quarterly subscribers in a typical quarter for us and particularly hard in this environment. In fact, on Page 2 of our earnings letter, we show our actuals relative to forecast, which in our guide is our internal forecast for subscribers. And because it's our forecast, we're going to miss every quarter. It's just a matter of whether they're bigger or smaller misses.
And you can see, over the past 5 years, our biggest kind of misses to forecast, either up or down, the -- most of those big misses and the biggest are in the past 5 quarters relative to the past 5 years, and that was these 5 quarters of COVID. So it's just a difficult time to forecast the business.
But the key is the business remains healthy. Our engagement, our viewing per household was up year-over-year in Q1. Our churn was down year-over-year, and the business is still growing. So even at 4 million paid net adds, if you kind of take COVID out and look over the past 2 years, we've grown from 2 years ago at about 150 million members to almost 210 million now. So that's nearly 40% growth and about just under 20% over an average over each of those 2 years, which is in line with the past couple of years.
So the business remains healthy, and that's because the long-term drivers, this big transition from linear to streaming entertainment, and that remains as healthy as ever. But you do see a little kind of noise in the near term, but a lot of long-term parity."

So you go into these production cycles, you go into the planning cycles and you've got a pretty smooth release of high-profile projects and smaller kind of passion projects and all those things.
And what happened, I guess, in the first part of this year is a lot of the projects we had hoped to come out earlier did get pushed because of the post production delays and the COVID delays in production. And we think we'll get back to much steadier state in the back half of the year and certainly in Q4, where we've got the returning seasons of some of our most popular shows like The Witcher and You and Cobra Kai as well as some big tempo movies that came to market a little slower than we'd hoped, like Red Notes with The Rock and Ryan Reynolds and Gaga, and Escape From Spiderhead with Chris Hemsworth, big event content.
Now all that being said, in every quarter of the year, we released more content than we did in the previous quarter -- in the previous years quarter-by-quarter and in every region is just that I think the shape of the mix of the content is becoming a little more uncertain.

And the great thing about that is those stories that are coming from all over the world, like we saw with Lupin this year, this quarter, it was our biggest new series on Netflix in the world was Lupin from France. And the show was not like a watered-down French show. It was a very French show. And what's really been great about it is as you tell stories from around the world, those -- the more authentically local they are, the more likely they are to play around the world because people recognize the authenticity of storytelling.
And that's something that we've been really focused on as well as continuing to offer a very big variety of content from Hollywood to the world as well.

And that's, in part, because as the -- as we're also -- as we improve the service, as engagement is up, and churn is down, we can occasionally take price increases, as Greg mentioned. And that happened recently in Australia, New Zealand and Japan. And I think our members are clearly appreciating the value of what we're delivering them. So the business is scaling, and scaling well."

And we're still working on India, and it's super exciting. And again, right now, this month, things are terrible in the COVID spike. But outside of that, we've been really producing a lot of great new content that's currently shut down.

And so whether that is pushing on the actual model in terms of, like, multi-month or sachet and sort of explore the ranges of that kind of offering.
But then also something that we've seen that is quite successful for us in pretty much all the markets we serve around the world is leveraging go-to-market partners who have existing relationships with consumers as a way to expose them to the Netflix service and then have them make it easy to pay.
And of course, the ultimate and easy to pay is it just included the sort of bundled offerings that we've been doing more and more of, and Jio is a great example of a partner we've been working with there to really bring the service to a new demographic at a very, very low price associated with low-cost mobile plans that they're offering as well as home-based IPTV plans. And those have been successful for us as well.
So it's constantly just trying to push on all those different engines and really figure out what is that right price point, the right offering and the right way that works for the local members and consumers."

But we also want to ensure that while we're doing that, that we're good at making sure that the people who are using a Netflix account, who are accessing it are the ones that are authorized to do so.
And that's what this sort of line of testing is about. It's not necessarily a new thing. We've been doing this for a while.

So we expect to be about cash flow breakeven this year and then sustainably free cash flow positive and growing thereafter.
And so -- and we don't intend to build up a bunch of excess cash on the balance sheet. So we will maintain a debt level, a gross debt level in the $10 billion to $15 billion range. We've paid down about $500 million in principal in Q1. So we -- our gross debt did come down from the prior quarter. And we think that share buybacks are a way to return value to shareholders in a way that is responsible steward of capital, but also maintains a level of balance sheet flexibility for us to continue to be strategic.
Because first and foremost, our #1 priority is to invest strategically into the growth of the business, but then, of course, return excess cash to our shareholders. So we're still maintaining a goal of about 2 months of revenue is our kind of cash on the balance sheet. And you'll see us ease into that share buyback program. So it will start this quarter. As I said, I think you'll see us ease into it. And we're authorized up to $5 billion of share repurchase, and we'll kind of get the program going this year."

So outside of China, I think pay television peaked about 800 million households. So lots of room -- and that was several years ago that it peaked, lots of room to grow.
So think about it as we do want to expand. So, like, we used to do that thing shipping DVDs and luckily, we didn't get stuck with that. We didn't define that as the main thing. We defined entertainment as the main thing. And so then we expanded into -- Ted -- I should say Ted expanded us into original content.
And first, it was original series and then films and then animation and kids and unscripted. And so bit by bit, we're adding category. So we've got a lot of work to do in terms of different types of entertainment that we'll continue to do that, a lot of work in terms of global production. So I don't think there will be a second act in the sense that you mean like an AWS and Amazon shopping.
I bet we end up with one, hopefully, gigantic, hopefully, very defensible profit pool and then continue to improve the service for our members by doing that by expanding in category. So I wouldn't look for any big, large secondary pool of profits. There'll be a bunch of supporting pools like consumer products that can be both profitable and can support the title brands.
