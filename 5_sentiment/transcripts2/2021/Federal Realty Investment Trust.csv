We closed out 2020 just about as we thought we would, with fourth quarter FFO per share of $1.14, and the total year at $4.52 or roughly 29% of 2019's record results.
The fourth quarter and total year numbers exclude the debt prepayment charge that we took when early retiring our 22 bonds. And as miserable as 2020 was, and it was pretty measurable.
We're very clear as priorities and can see our path forward. There's no doubt that the second wave of government shutdowns in our coastal markets have ramped up around Thanksgiving last year and largely continue through today.
So there are at least some encouraging signs of some loosening of late have and continued to us in terms of rent election and the likely business failures that will come from them. Yet despite that, our growth prospects are really strong when the following 3 things happen.
One, vaccinations are delivered to a large segment of the population in our markets; number two, our coastal markets actually reopen; and number three, that consumer behavior reverts to uninhibited freedom and the spending that goes with it, behavior that we are supremely confident will happen. And while that's certainly not the environment that we're living through or operating in yet, the sheer volume of leasing and other transactions that we executed at the end of last year, 103 retail deals for 469,000 square feet, coupled with the strong leasing demand environment that is evident by the many substantive discussions we're having today and some very important management promotions and alignments have just announced, set us up extremely well for a strong post-COVID recovery as those conditions prevail. All right. So where do we go from here.
Well, as previously announced, the sale of Sunset place and 2 other shopping centers in December effectively generated $170 million of proceeds in debt relief. We put out a press release in January that you should check out for more detail if you haven't seen it.
Using that capital, along with cash on the balance sheet, we repaid $500 million of senior unsecured notes, half of which were retired early.
The result of which means that we have no public bonds maturing until June of 2023. So with little debt due in the next 2.5 years, along with nearly $800 million in cash remaining on the balance sheet  and a completely untapped $1 billion credit facility, we've got something of a war chest on hand. Should we find retail opportunities that fit our business model in '21 and '22. And make no mistake, we're actively looking, including in markets with hot job and income growth where we haven't looked before. A little more geographic diversity in our income stream carefully considered is an objective of ours.
But today, with a Trader's Day when a day Trader's mentality rather. So for one, so many quarters as an investor and analyst world, it's hard to look past short-term results, particularly those at higher multiple companies or far from immune from the economically devastating effects of government-imposed shutdowns, most notably seen in the heavily populated coastal markets.
85% of Federal's property operating income comes from California, Massachusetts, particularly Sommerville, New York, New Jersey, metropolitan Philadelphia, Maryland and Northern Virginia.
These markets have the most restricted government-imposed COVID laws in the country by far. And they make 2021 more uncertain than at some of our peers. Nothing we can do about that.
Serenity prayer comes to mind every day that I grapple with that. But those restrictions sure don't diminish the quality of the real estate that we own in these first ring suburbs of major metropolitan areas, nor the tenant demand for a spot in these properties in the future, as evidenced by the leasing volume we're doing, along with the conversations we're having with many retailers about their future real estate plans. So here's an interesting fact.
When you bifurcate our entire portfolio, between the 75% or so of essential service type shopping centers that we own. And the retail component of the 25% or so of our properties that are mixed-use or lifestyle oriented, performance varies greatly as far as percentage of rent collected or a percentage of operating income diminution from last year pre-COVID.
Predictably, it's what you would think. The mixed-use and lifestyle tenancy, heavy and restaurants, theaters, gyms and the like, has been disproportionately hurt by the shutdowns. There's no real news there. You all know that.
But the irony is that those assets represent not only some of the best real estate that Federal Realty owns. But arguably, some of the best and most desirable retail real estate in the country. That's not changing. So in a nutshell, 75% of our properties, the necessity-based ones, are performing in line or arguably better than other necessity-based REITS, despite being in government restricted coastal markets.
Think about that in and of itself, that's pretty impressive to us. The remaining 25% of our properties, the mixed-use and lifestyle ones have been disproportionately hurt  because of their merchandise mix, but represent our best, most desirable real estate and therefore, naturally have superior growth prospects, particularly for the beat and down levels they're currently performing at.
That cash -- cash flow growth formula feels like a winning 1 to us, when vaccinations are delivered to a large segment of the population in our markets, when our coastal markets reopen and when consumer behavior reverts the uninhibited freedom in the spending that goes with it. Everything we see suggests that it should be a strong 2022. We'll talk more about that in Dan's comments.
And on a celebratory note, I hope you'll join me in congratulating Jeff Berkes and our other executives who have been promoted effective with our Board meeting earlier this week. I hope you saw the press release that we just put out.
Many of you have gotten to know Jeff over the years, and I'm sure he share my appreciation for his intelligence for his real estate savvy and without question for is unimpeachable integrity. Jeff and I have been close partners for over 20 years now.
And this elevation and responsibility comes at a crucial time given the expected post-COVID retail real estate environment. We need to be as tight and productive assumingly possible. 
Now to head off the inevitable speculation, let me get it out there by saying that forming the position of company President and Chief Operating Officer, shouldn't be construed to me that I have plans of going anywhere anytime soon. I don't.
But as I've continually talked about and active upon, career development and succession planning are always top of mind at every level in our company. This new position is a great training ground. I'm sure there'll be lots of questions following our prepared remarks. So I'll cut it short today. And mind there and turn it over to Dan for his comments on the quarter before we open the lines to your questions."
271305,701217814,2206945,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone.We are generally pleased with the progress we see in our portfolio as we closed out a difficult year. While all of our centers remain open with 98% of our retail tenants opened and operating in some capacity as of Feb",1539,"Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone.
We are generally pleased with the progress we see in our portfolio as we closed out a difficult year. While all of our centers remain open with 98% of our retail tenants opened and operating in some capacity as of February 1. COVID-19 induced government restrictions continues to provide challenges to their businesses.
We reported FFO per share of $1.14, up a couple of cents from third quarter.
Now trying to assess what specifically is the direct negative impact of COVID-19 is difficult. But let me walk you through some of the drivers of our results during the quarter.
On the positive side, we continue to see and be encouraged by the resiliency of our tenant base overall as collectibility adjustments continued to shrink from $55 million in the second quarter to $29 million in the third quarter to just $19 million in the most recent. From a sequential perspective, this progress was offset by a number of items, many of which were one-timers.
$0.04 of impact from several nonrecurring items hitting G&A, $0.03 of drag from higher property level expenses that were primarily seasonal in nature, as well as $0.03 of headwinds due to the timing of fourth quarter debt capital transactions that we executed. As a result, headline progress versus the third quarter was muted.
Year-over-year, relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, we sought a direct negative net impact of COVID-19 for the quarter of $0.37 per share.
Continued improvement over the second and third quarter's direct negative COVID impact of $0.83 and $0.48, respectively. Collections continue to improve on the 72% and 85% levels, previously reported for 2Q and the [ 2Q ], respectively, and are now up to 89% for the fourth quarter. 
Solid progress despite weakness in December and January due to the second wave of government-mandated restrictions in place in the majority of our markets. As a reminder, our approach to reporting collections is very transparent, and in our view, the appropriate approach.
The denominator is comprised of all monthly bill base rent plus charges for Cameron real estate taxes and is not adjusted for deferrals and abatements. In our numerator, all deferrals and abatements are classified as uncollected.
Also note that our denominator remained fairly consistent throughout 2020 at roughly $70 million to $71 million per month. During the fourth quarter, we continued to take a tactical approach as we negotiate and work with our tenants through this unprecedented impact on our businesses. 
$36 million of deferrals were executed in total for 2020.  Of that amount, $22 million is with higher credit accrual basis tenants. Abatement agreements now totaled $37 million as additional rent concessions were provided as government restrictions impacted our tenant's ability to operate at full capacity. Abatements will continue in 2021, primarily the result of temporary percentage rent arrangements as we have made the decision to partner with many of our tenants to get to the other side of the pandemic together with the objective of longer-term benefits and stronger sustainable growth.
As we did in the first 6 months of the pandemic, we took advantage of these negotiations to improve many qualitative lease provisions in exchange for that RIN flexibility. Incremental percentage rent upside where we have abated rent, removal of development, parking and use restrictions, eliminating tenant lease termination and cotenancy rights and the deletion of below market tenant extension options.
All enhance the long-term value of our assets in exchange for these near-term concessions. Now following the surge of productivity during the third quarter, we had another solid quarter of leasing.
With almost 470,000 square feet of total retail deals, and then add in 33,000 square feet of office leasing, bringing our total to over 0.5 million square feet of fourth quarter deal signed.
Combined with third quarter, that's over 1 million square feet of leasing to close out the second half of the year. We are also very encouraged by the level of activity in the leasing pipeline.
As a result, our occupancy metrics have demonstrated surprising resiliency with our leased metrics standing at 92.2% at year-end, flat versus the third quarter statistic.
And our occupied metric remaining in the 90s at 90.2%. These models are of 200 and 30 basis points, respectively, versus year-end 2019 levels. While we still expect continued pressure on our occupancy over the next few quarters and expect to dip into the upper 80s at the trough, as we have previously discussed, and continued leasing activity at the volumes we achieved in the second half of 2020 will set ourself for more pronounced growth in 2022. We continue to see strength from the same leasing demand drivers we've talked about on prior calls. First, Urban and CBD tenants migrating to top-tier first ring suburban assets.
Top-tier tenants upgrading their real estate to the best in market open air locations; and third, new-to-market lifestyle and digitally native tenants targeting our best-in-class, open air, mixed-use and lifestyle properties. 
As Don highlighted, while our lifestyle and mixed-use oriented assets have underperformed in the COVID environment, new demand from these best-in-class lifestyle tenants has been strong, as evidenced by lease deals and openings during the pandemic to brands such as Nike Live, [ at Letta, Sephora, Warby Parker, Women Board, Serena and Lily, Ar Terex, Morry, Lovesac, Ferrite, Bluemercury, nikin Zoe, Shake Shack, Sweet Green, Leven Bakery, Sultan Straw and anchor restaurants such as Teleferic Barcelona, Ihawk Pizza, Chico, Selina.
Spanish diner and Planta ] out with 2 openings to name more than just a few, plus many more under negotiation.
Needless to say, our best-in-class mixed-use and lifestyle real estate is poised for a significant rebound in '22. Our residential portfolio has held up reasonably well during the pandemic with collection levels up towards 98%. The only exception being our 450 units at Assembly Row where the Monty is still some weakness as expected.
Average comparable leased occupancy for our 2,700 comparable residential units stood at 95.1%, down only 60 basis points from year-end 2019.
Our existing office portfolio has performed solidly during the pandemic as well, with collections averaging 97% and occupancy remaining stable. As we've discussed previously, however, lease-up of office space in our development pipeline will be slower than we had expected pre-COVID as corporate decision-makers post bone space planning needs by at least a year to 18 months.
That being said, pre-leasing at Cocowalk stands at 75%, with South Florida office demand remaining strong. At assembly, Puma is building out its new headquarters space and 55% of Lock VB on Grand Union Boulevard, and Puma, at this point, plans to move all of their employees in this summer. [indiscernible] has 63% of 909 Rose avenue spoken for. When Santana West lease-up remains speculative, however, openings are not expected until 2022. Now to a quick discussion of the balance sheet and an update on our further enhanced liquidity position.
 The fourth quarter was an active one on the capital markets front. In early October, we raised $400 million of unsecured notes in a green bond. The second half of December, we replayed $500 million of unsecured notes. In December, we sold $170 million  in assets that are blended, in place yield inside of 4%. This left us with $800 million of cash available and an undrawn $1 billion credit facility, providing $1.8 billion of total liquidity At year-end with no bonds maturing until 2023. 
With our $1.2 billion in process development pipeline continuing to be executed upon, we have just over $400 million left of that to spend.
As Don mentioned, we find ourselves today sitting with significant dry powder. With Don's and my remarks today, we hope we have conveyed to you the optimism that we have for the future of our business and the strength of our portfolio to truly thrive on the other side of the pandemic. Our ability to generate allied cash flow growth is fairly clear when, as Don said, vaccinations are delivered to a large segment of the population in our markets, those coastal markets reopen and consumer behavior reverts to uninhibited freedom and spending.
But the timing for those 3 things to occur are from clear and certainly not clear in 2021. As a result, for 2021, we are not providing formal guidance at this time.
The best we can do for you, if you need a stake in the ground, is that it's roughly going to be flat to 2020 with the first quarter of 2021 at roughly $1 per share and bill each quarter from there.
We do ironically feel significantly more confident in providing an outlook for 2022 than we do for the current year. Based upon the leasing activity and demand we see for our real estate, the strength of our essential retail portfolio, the significant upside in our mixed-use and lifestyle retail assets, the resiliency and stability of our existing residential and office  and the phasing in of POI from our $1.2 billion development pipeline in 2022, '23 and into '24.
We expect 2022 FFO per share will be in the low $5 range, representing double-digit FFO growth year-over-year. So stay tuned.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

So 2 questions here. Don, just taking with big picture. You're not alone in traditional coastal REITs. We're now exploring other markets, presumably down south to Sunbelt. But it's interesting because for the past 2 decades, there's been this whole coastal, coastal coastal and then suddenly with COVID, everyone's looking elsewhere.

And just want to better understand, is it purely just the category themselves and that's it? Or are there other dynamics at work that are driving some of these new leases that you're seeing."

But one of the single most important things to remember is companies that are struggling at this point and continue to struggle on here, I cannot say enough about the impact of the government restrictions. I mean, we're a business of contracts. And when government steps in and effectively doesn't allow the contract to be performed. It's the weirdest time I've ever been involved in. So absent that, you do have new businesses being formed with new basis.
So legacy costs of old businesses and having to be able to figure out how they're going to make money, going forward with all those legacy costs is sometimes much harder then a new business coming in. If you take a look at what some -- what's happening in the gem space, for example, you'll see new purchasers of gyms with packages of gyms at a fraction of the cost that you thought that, that gym company was worth that that Jim company was worth 12 months ago. Now when you come in with a new low basis, you've got a completely different P&L. You got a completely different business plan, different balance sheet and the ability to afford and to pay what you need to do to get some of that high-quality real estate. So it's a natural cleansing that won't just be a 2021. This is a phenomena that will take a number of years to work through. But you will see the single biggest thing from my perspective is businesses coming in with a lower cost basis to start versus their existing legacy competitors."

 important from a risk mitigation standpoint that they go for properties that they know and have a history of strong sales, whether they're highly amenitized, whether they're general essential properties because I have both on the East Coast.
They want to mitigate that risk.

Well, listen, first of all, the last part of your question first, Steve.
The -- we got plenty of development to do. And so first, are years away in terms of development product coming online.
Let me now take it to the acquisition side. So we learned a real good lesson in 2008, '09, '10. And Jeff and I were just talking about and lamenting about it last time.
And that was how in the end of the great financial crisis, there are not going to be a ton of distressed assets for us to acquire. And they weren't. They weren't at all because great assets are often not distressed and not distressed in terms of price. And so it wasn't about us going down quality and earning a lot and getting a lot of stuff, which is kind of why at this point in time.
We're looking for the best stuff around. We -- there are people willing to talk to us about that. Prices do seem to be firm, but a little bit better than they were.
Certainly pre-COVID, but those prices are not cap rate prices because what NOI are you capping as you look at. They're really great real estate prices.
And that's kind of how we're looking at potentially using some of that. What I -- I mean, the cash that's on our balance sheet is insurance. The reason there's so much of it is insurance. That's why we did it that way. We believe going forward, given what we just told you, we need less insurance.
And so accordingly, I don't have a treasure trove of transactional information that on deals that have just happened that we can really talk to you about in terms of where we're trying to go. But suffice it to say, we do believe we'll find some opportunities in the markets we want to be in, including our existing markets and 1 or 2 new ones that effectively let us get deals done in a way that will be accretive now and certainly accretive to value with more development opportunities associated with them going forward."

And I think if you look at the 8-K that we put out, we did get more conservative on a couple of those assumptions. There's still a lot to figure out yet. And again, it depends on the product. It's certainly hard to figure out on the office side today, but it's not in construction costs. It's certainly in a holding period. So you're carrying you can certainly expect it to add to a longer period of time. It's most likely in build out costs from a TI perspective, if you will, for office space there. And then -- and then in terms of rents, man, I got to tell you, it's -- you can -- it's anybody's guess to some extent, but our office and residential development, which is most of what our development is, are all in mixed-use properties that are well-established and effectively are the best product that is available coming out of COVID. 
So you shouldn't expect us drop in rents in any significant way because I don't think we'll need to do that. There may be some. There'll be some extra carry costs associated with it, maybe a little bit more TI.

But I do think there's truth to the way you phrase that question with a couple of exceptions. And the biggest exception really is in terms of small business.
And when you look at small shop and small business, and I could not tell you, you'll never talk to anybody more frustrated than I am with respect to some of the restrictions that are extremely severe on our properties, and it's not only restaurants, it's other uses also from government entities.
 And so to the extent that -- I don't know when they'll be lifted. I don't know when how long those businesses can last. I suspect stimulus is coming soon, but it's February, whatever it is, 11 or something. And we've been talking about it for months, months and months. So on the small business side, those are the people who are being hurt the most. And that's different than the big companies that are national chains. But frankly, we make our money on the small businesses that effectively turn over, become successful and can pay more rent. So I do see that being a very positive catalyst as we look out going forward. I just don't think it's right now.
And that's where -- maybe it's a good time for me to say what I say the only thing that we put out there today. And that is, in all my years, I've never been able to say that I'm more comfortable with a forecast with a view to the future, 1 year out than I am today. What I have, which is why we're not giving 2021 guidance, which is why we're effectively talking about 2022 with more specificity. That's kind of crazy in my history of kind of doing this job. But it is the way it is today. And so we thought we'd get out there and try to get both the sell-side and the buy side to realistically start  looking at least from Federal Realty's perspective, has it at our growth profile, which to us inside to our Board of Directors looks extremely positive, but certainly not in February 2021."

But we're looking at both opportunities for mixed-use development  with some kind of stabilized piece there first and then a development down the road and a more stabilized asset where we think there's some rent growth possibilities and other ways to create value."

So while I don't have an exact number, I cannot give you a line for the model with respect to how many businesses go out and what that means to the overall occupancy perspective. It is reasonable to assume that they'll be a hit. I don't think you want to put a number out there at all of what it is, but we always thought, frankly, for a year now, which I think is pretty cool. We thought that our first quarter  and maybe into the second quarter, we'll see, we'll be in the high 80s, certainly, on the small shop space. It will be. The anchors are hanging real tough."

I think that in terms of the existing tenants that we have there in our centers, what they love about the -- 2 things, let me back up.
When we have restaurants, for example, that have multiple locations, what we're seeing is because of our highly amenitized projects and our focus on not only the curbside pickup and outdoor dining and a controlled environment that we can help with. We are -- they are focusing more on getting up and operating in our centers versus other choices that they may have.
So from the existing tenant standpoint, we were seeing, frankly, a big uptick in the restaurant until we had that second wave of shutdowns again. 
So our highly amenitized projects where we can influence what's happening to help their businesses has been a critical. Tenants coming in what we're seeing. And one of the things that I want to mention is we have ability to have like a reset button, right? So the retailers are going, ""Hey, I have the ability to look potentially at some other opportunities that I never could get into before because historically, we've never had the vacancy.
Where now we have some opportunities. On the flip side, and I don't want to lose this point is that we're Federal Realty, having the ability to reset as well and look at how we want to upgrade our real estate.
So we're -- when I was saying that we have a -- we have a disproportionate activity on those higher-end lifestyle projects from a new deal standpoint, which shows the strength of oh my gosh. We now have vacancy in these centers that we never had vacancy in before, and we have a host of relevant tenants that want to get in an opportunity in these centers. So it's been positive."

We closed out 2020 just about as we thought we would, with fourth quarter FFO per share of $1.14 and the total year at $4.52 or roughly 29% off 2019's record results. The fourth quarter and total year numbers exclude the debt prepayment charge that we took when early retiring our '22 bonds. 
And as miserable as 2020 was, and it was pretty miserable, we're very clear as to our priorities and can see our path forward. There's no doubt that the second wave of government shutdowns in our coastal markets that ramped up around Thanksgiving last year and largely continues through today, though there are at least some encouraging signs of some loosening of late, have and continue to hurt us in terms of rent collection and the likely business failures that will come from them. 
Yet despite that, our growth prospects are really strong when the following 3 things happen: one, vaccinations are delivered to a large segment of the population in our markets; number two, our coastal markets actually reopen; and number three, that consumer behavior reverts to uninhibited freedom and the spending that goes with it, behavior that we are supremely confident will happen. 
And while that's certainly not the environment that we're living through or operating in yet, the sheer volume of leasing and other transactions that we executed at the end of last year, 103 retail deals for 469,000 square feet, coupled with the strong leasing demand environment that is evident by the many substantive discussions we're having today and some very important management promotions and alignments that we'd just announced set us up extremely well for a strong post-COVID recovery as those conditions prevail. 
All right. So where do we go from here? Well, as previously announced, the sale of Sunset Place and 2 other shopping centers in December effectively generated $170 million of proceeds and debt relief. We put out a press release in January that you should check out for more detail if you haven't seen it. Using that capital, along with cash on the balance sheet, we repaid $500 million of senior unsecured notes, half of which were retired early. The result of which means that we have no public bonds maturing until June of 2023. 
So with little debt due in the next 2.5 years, along with nearly $800 million in cash remaining on the balance sheet and a completely untapped $1 billion credit facility, we've got something of a war chest on hand should we find retail opportunities that fit our business model in '21 and '22. And make no mistake, we're actively looking, including in markets with hot job and income growth where we haven't looked before. A little more geographic diversity in our income stream carefully considered is an objective of ours.
But today, with a trader's day -- with a day trader's mentality, rather, so prevalent in so many corners of the investor and analyst worlds, it's hard to look past short-term results, particularly those at higher-multiple companies who are far from immune from the economically devastating effects of government-imposed shutdowns, most notably seen in the heavily populated coastal markets. Heck, 85% of Federal's property operating income comes from California; Massachusetts, particularly Somerville; New York; New Jersey; metropolitan Philadelphia; Maryland and Northern Virginia. These markets have the most restrictive government-imposed COVID laws in the country by far. And they make 2021 more uncertain than at some of our peers. Nothing we can do about that. Serenity Prayer comes to mind every day that I grapple with that. 
But those restrictions sure don't diminish the quality of the real estate that we own in these first-ring suburbs of major metropolitan areas nor the tenant demand for a spot in these properties in the future as evidenced by the leasing volume we're doing along with the conversations we're having with many retailers about their future real estate plans. 
So here's an interesting fact: when you bifurcate our entire portfolio between the 75% or so of essential service type shopping centers that we own and the retail component of the 25% or so of our properties that are mixed use or lifestyle oriented, performance varies greatly as far as percentage of rent collected or percentage of operating income diminution from last year pre-COVID. Predictably, it's what you would think. The mixed-use and lifestyle tenancy, heavy in restaurants, theaters, gyms and the like, has been disproportionately hurt by the shutdowns. There's no real news there. You all know that. But the irony is that those assets represent not only some of the best real estate that Federal Realty owns but arguably some of the best and most desirable retail real estate in the country. That's not changing. 
So in a nutshell, 75% of our properties, the necessity-based ones, are performing in line or arguably better than other necessity-based REITS despite being in government-restricted coastal markets. Think about that. In and of itself, that's pretty impressive to us. The remaining 25% of our properties, the mixed-use and lifestyle ones, have been disproportionately hurt because of their merchandise mix but represent our best, most desirable real estate and, therefore, naturally have superior growth prospects, particularly for the beaten-down levels they're currently performing at.
That cash growth -- cash flow growth formula feels like a winning one to us when vaccinations are delivered to a large segment of the population in our markets, when our coastal markets reopen and when consumer behavior reverts to uninhibited freedom and the spending that goes with it. Everything we see suggests that it should be a strong 2022. We'll talk more about that in Dan's comments.
And on a celebratory note, I hope you'll join me in congratulating Jeff Berkes and our other executives who have been promoted effective with our Board meeting earlier this week. I hope you saw the press release that we just put out. 
Many of you have gotten to know Jeff over the years, and I'm sure you share my appreciation for his intelligence, for his real estate savvy and, without question, for his unimpeachable integrity. Jeff and I have been close partners for over 20 years now. And this elevation in responsibility comes at a crucial time given the expected post-COVID retail real estate environment. We need to be as tight and productive as humanly possible. 
Now to head off the inevitable speculation, let me get it out there by saying that forming the position of Company President and Chief Operating Officer shouldn't be construed to mean that I have plans of going anywhere anytime soon. I don't. But as I've continually talked about and acted upon, career development and succession planning are always top of mind at every level in our company. This new position is a great training ground. 
I'm sure there'll be lots of questions following our prepared remarks. So I'll cut it short today, end mine there and turn it over to Dan for his comments on the quarter before we open the lines to your questions."

We are generally pleased with the progress we see in our portfolio as we closed out a difficult year. While all of our centers remain open, with 98% of our retail tenants open and operating in some capacity as of February 1, COVID-19-induced government restrictions continues to provide challenges to their businesses. We reported FFO per share of $1.14, up a couple of cents from third quarter. Now trying to assess what specifically is the direct negative impact of COVID-19 is difficult. But let me walk you through some of the drivers of our results during the quarter.
On the positive side, we continue to see and be encouraged by the resiliency of our tenant base overall as collectibility adjustments continued to shrink from $55 million in the second quarter to $29 million in the third quarter to just $19 million in the most recent. From a sequential perspective, this progress was offset by a number of items, many of which were one-timers: $0.04 of impact from several nonrecurring items hitting G&A, $0.03 of drag from higher property-level expenses that were primarily seasonal in nature as well as $0.03 of headwinds due to the timing of fourth quarter debt capital transactions that we executed. As a result, headline progress versus the third quarter was muted.
Year-over-year, relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, we saw a direct negative net impact of COVID-19 for the quarter of $0.37 per share, a continued improvement over the second and third quarter's direct negative COVID impact of $0.83 and $0.48, respectively. Collections continue to improve on the 72% and 85% levels, previously reported for 2Q and the 3Q, respectively, and are now up to 89% for the fourth quarter, solid progress despite weakness in December and January due to the second wave of government-mandated restrictions in place in the majority of our markets. 
As a reminder, our approach to reporting collections is very transparent, and in our view, the appropriate approach. The denominator is comprised of all monthly billed base rent plus charges for CAM and real estate taxes and is not adjusted for deferrals and abatements. In our numerator, all deferrals and abatements are classified as uncollected. Also note that our denominator remained fairly consistent throughout 2020 at roughly $70 million to $71 million per month. 
During the fourth quarter, we continued to take a tactical approach as we negotiate and work with our tenants through this unprecedented impact on our businesses. $36 million of deferrals were executed in total for 2020. Of that amount, $22 million is with higher credit accrual basis tenants. Abatement agreements now totaled $37 million as additional rent concessions were provided as government restrictions impacted our tenant's ability to operate at full capacity. 
Abatements will continue in 2021, primarily the result of temporary percentage rent arrangements as we have made the decision to partner with many of our tenants to get to the other side of the pandemic together with the objective of longer-term benefits and stronger sustainable growth. As we did in the first 6 months of the pandemic, we took advantage of these negotiations to improve many qualitative lease provisions in exchange for that rent flexibility. Incremental percentage rent upside where we have abated rent, removal of development, parking and use restrictions, eliminating tenant lease termination and cotenancy rights and the deletion of below-market tenant extension options all enhance the long-term value of our assets in exchange for these near-term concessions. 
Now following the surge of productivity during the third quarter, we had another solid quarter of leasing. With almost 470,000 square feet of total retail deals and then add in 33,000 square feet of office leasing, bringing our total to over 0.5 million square feet of fourth quarter deal signed, combined with third quarter, that's over 1 million square feet of leasing to close out the second half of the year. We are also very encouraged by the level of activity in the leasing pipeline. As a result, our occupancy metrics have demonstrated surprising resiliency with our leased metrics standing at 92.2% at year-end, flat versus the third quarter statistic, and our occupied metric remaining in the 90s at 90.2%. These levels are off 200 and 230 basis points, respectively, versus year-end 2019 levels. 
While we still expect continued pressure on our occupancy over the next few quarters and expect to dip into the upper 80s at the trough, as we have previously discussed, continued leasing activity at the volumes we achieved in the second half of 2020 will set us up for more pronounced growth in 2022. We continue to see strength from the same leasing demand drivers we've talked about on prior calls: first, urban and CBD tenants migrating to top-tier first-ring suburban assets; top-tier tenants upgrading their real estate to the best-in-market open-air locations; and third, new-to-market lifestyle and digitally native tenants targeting our best-in-class, open-air, mixed-use and lifestyle properties. 
As Don highlighted, while our lifestyle and mixed-use-oriented assets have underperformed in the COVID environment, new demand from these best-in-class lifestyle tenants has been strong as evidenced by lease deals and openings during the pandemic with brands such as Nike Live, Athleta, Sephora, Warby Parker, Room & Board, Serena & Lily, Arc'teryx, Vuori, Lovesac, Faherty, Bluemercury, NIC+ZOE, Shake Shack, Sweetgreen, Levain Bakery, Salt & Straw and anchor restaurants such as Telefèric Barcelona, Nighthawk Pizza, Chika, Stellina, Spanish Diner and Planta with 2 openings, to name more than just a few, plus many more under negotiation. Needless to say, our best-in-class mixed-use and lifestyle real estate is poised for a significant rebound in '22. 
Our residential portfolio has held up reasonably well during the pandemic with collection levels up towards 98%, the only exception being our 450 units at Assembly Row where [ the Montaje's ] felt some weakness as expected. Average comparable leased occupancy for our 2,700 comparable residential units stood at 95.1%, down only 60 basis points from year-end 2019.
Our existing office portfolio has performed solidly during the pandemic as well, with collections averaging 97% and occupancy remaining stable. As we've discussed previously, however, lease-up of office space in our development pipeline will be slower than we had expected pre-COVID as corporate decision-makers postpone space planning [ needs ] by at least a year to 18 months. 
That being said, preleasing at CocoWalk stands at 75%, with South Florida office demand remaining strong. At Assembly, PUMA is building out its new headquarters space in 55% of Block 5B on Grand Union Boulevard. And PUMA, at this point, plans to move all of their employees in this summer. Pike & Rose has 63% of 909 Rose Avenue is spoken for. One Santana West lease-up remains speculative, however, openings are not expected until 2022. 
Now to a quick discussion of the balance sheet and an update on our further enhanced liquidity position. The fourth quarter was an active one on the capital markets front. In early October, we raised $400 million of unsecured notes in a green bond. The second half of December, we repaid $500 million of unsecured notes. In December, we sold $170 million in assets that at a blended in-place yield inside of 4%. This left us with $800 million of cash available and an undrawn $1 billion credit facility, providing $1.8 billion of total liquidity at year-end with no bonds maturing until 2023. With our $1.2 billion in-process development pipeline continuing to be executed upon, we have just over $400 million left of that to spend. As Don mentioned, we find ourselves today sitting with significant dry powder. 
And with Don's and my remarks today, we hope we have conveyed to you the optimism that we have for the future of our business and the strength of our portfolio to truly thrive on the other side of the pandemic. Our ability to generate outsized cash flow growth is fairly clear when, as Don said, vaccinations are delivered to a large segment of the population in our markets, those coastal markets reopen and consumer behavior reverts to uninhibited freedom and spending.
But the timing for those 3 things to occur is from clear and certainly not clear in 2021. As a result, for 2021, we are not providing formal guidance at this time. The best we can do for you, if you need a stake in the ground, is that it's roughly going to be flat to 2020 with the first quarter of 2021 at roughly $1 per share and build each quarter from there.
We do ironically feel significantly more confident in providing an outlook for 2022 than we do for the current year. Based upon the leasing activity and demand we see for our real estate, the strength of our essential retail portfolio, the significant upside in our mixed-use and lifestyle retail assets, the resiliency and stability of our existing residential and office and the phasing in of POI from our $1.2 billion development pipeline in 2022, '23 and into '24, we expect 2022 FFO per share will be in the low $5 range, representing double-digit FFO growth year-over-year. So stay tuned.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

So 2 questions here. Don, just thinking big picture, you're not alone in traditional coastal REITs who are now exploring other markets, presumably down South, the Sun Belt. But it's interesting because, for the past 2 decades, there's been this whole coastal, coastal, coastal, and then suddenly with COVID, everyone's looking elsewhere. So my question is, is it really COVID or you guys have been thinking for several years now about expanding to new markets? Maybe they are down at the Sun Belt, but the COVID and what's happened was just sort of the catalyst, the expeditor."

And when you sit and you think about kind of where we are in those markets, in those first-tier suburbs, that looks really strong. 
Now when you go forward and you say, okay, where would you like to put incremental capital, it doesn't mean we still won't look in the markets that we're in that we know, but it does mean that, through COVID, it's pretty darn clear that there will be other job center growth places that were starting pre-COVID but, like almost everything, have accelerated as a result of it. So when you think about markets like Phoenix, when you think about markets more like Florida and what's happening in South Florida and a couple of others, I do think it would be wrong of us to not effectively understand the dynamics in them and to be able to act on it to the extent we get comfortable with the highest-quality stuff in those markets. You'll never see us going down quality, Alex, and that's a really important point."

And yet, at the same time, there's still tenants who are struggling, and I don't just mean like movie theater or gym but some others. So can you just sort of walk through what's happening? Why is it -- or how is it that we're seeing these spurts of new tenants forming at the same time that you're still seeing a bunch of people struggle? It just seems to be this odd paradox. I just want to better understand it. Is it purely just the categories themselves, and that's it? Or are there other dynamics at work that are driving some of these new leases that you're seeing?"

But one of the single most important things to remember is companies that are struggling at this point and continue to struggle on here, I cannot say enough about the impact of the government restrictions. I mean we're a business of contracts, and when the government steps in and effectively doesn't allow the contract to be performed -- it's the weirdest time I've ever been involved in. 
So absent that, you do have new businesses being formed with new bases. So legacy costs of old businesses and having to be able to figure out how they're going to make money going forward with all those legacy costs is sometimes much harder than a new business coming in. If you take a look at what some -- what's happening in the gym space, for example, you'll see new purchases of gyms -- with packages of gyms at a fraction of the cost that you thought that, that gym company was worth 12 months ago. Now when you come in with a new low basis, you've got a completely different P&L, you've got a completely different business plan, different balance sheet and the ability to afford and to pay what you need to do to get in some of that high-quality real estate. 
So it's a natural cleansing that won't just be in 2021. It'll -- this is a phenomenon that will take a number of years to work through. What you will see, the single biggest thing from my perspective, is businesses coming in with a lower cost basis to start versus their existing legacy competitors."

I talk to retailers all the time, and I continue to see an interest in a flight to quality. They are -- when you think about it, it's very logical, right? So a lot of the retailers coming into '21, maybe into '22, maybe they're going to make less new deals than they made before. So the deals that they make are important, from a risk mitigation standpoint, that they go for properties that they know and have a history of strong sales, whether they're highly amenitized, whether they're general essential properties, because I have both on the East Coast, they want to mitigate that risk. They want to make the right choice.

Well, listen, first of all, the last part of your question first, Steve, the -- we got plenty of development to do. And so first of all, you are years away in terms of development product coming online. 
Let me now take it to the acquisition side. So we learned a real good lesson in 2008, '09, '10. And Jeff and I were just talking about and lamenting about it last time. And that was, how is it, in the end of the great financial crisis, that there are not going to be a ton of distressed assets for us to acquire? And there weren't. There weren't at all because great assets are often not distressed and not distressed in terms of price. 
And so it wasn't about us going down quality and earning a lot and getting a lot of stuff, which is kind of why, at this point in time, we're looking for the best stuff around. We -- there are people willing to talk to us about that. Prices do seem to be firm but a little bit better than they were certainly pre-COVID. But those prices are not cap rate prices because what NOI are you capping as you look at it. They're really great real estate prices. And that's kind of how we're looking at potentially using some of that. What -- I mean the cash that's on our balance sheet is insurance. The reason there's so much of it is insurance. That's why we did it that way. We believe, going forward, given what we just told you, we need less insurance.
And so accordingly, I don't have a treasure trove of transactional information that -- on deals that have just happened that we can really talk to you about in terms of where we're trying to go. But suffice it to say, we do believe we'll find some opportunities in the markets we want to be in, including our existing markets and 1 or 2 new ones that effectively let us get deals done in a way that will be accretive now and certainly accretive to value with more development opportunities associated with them going forward."

And I think if you look at the 8-K that we put out, we did get more conservative on a couple of those assumptions. There's still a lot to figure out yet. And again, it depends on the product. It's certainly hard to figure out on the office side today. But it's not in construction costs. It's certainly in a holding period, so your carry -- you can certainly expect it to add to a longer period of time. It's most likely in build-out costs from a TI perspective, if you will, for office space there. 
And then in terms of rents -- you know, man? I got to tell you it's -- you can -- it's anybody's guess to some extent, but our office and residential development, which is most of what our development is, are all in mixed-use properties that are well established and effectively are the best product that is available coming out of COVID. So you shouldn't expect us dropping rents in any significant way because I don't think we'll need to do that. There may be some. There'll be some extra carry costs associated with it, maybe a little bit more TI. But everything we still see says that the developments that we are completing will be accretive to value and accretive to earnings."

But I do think there's truth to the way you phrased that question, with a couple of exceptions. And the biggest exception really is in terms of small business. 
And when you look at small shop and small business -- and I could not tell you -- you'll never talk to anybody more frustrated than I am with respect to some of the restrictions that are extremely severe on our properties. And it's not only restaurants. It's other uses also from government entities. And so to the extent that -- I don't know when they'll be lifted. I don't know when -- how long those businesses can last. I suspect stimulus is coming soon, but it's February, whatever it is, 11 or something. And we've been talking about it for months, months and months. 
So on the small business side, those are the people who are being hurt the most. And that's different than the big companies that are national chains. But frankly, we make our money on the small businesses that effectively turn over, become successful and can pay more rent. So I do see that being a very positive catalyst as we look out going forward. I just don't think it's right now. 
And that's where maybe it's a good time for me to say what I say that -- the silly thing that we put out there today, and that is, in all my years, I've never been able to say that I'm more comfortable with a forecast, with a view to the future, 1 year out than I am today. But I am, which is why we're not giving 2021 guidance, which is why we're effectively talking about 2022 with more specificity. That's kind of crazy in my history of kind of doing this job. But it is the way it is today. And so we thought we'd get out there and try to get both the sell side and the buy side to realistically start looking, at least from Federal Realty's perspective, at our growth profile, which to us inside, to our Board of Directors, looks extremely positive but certainly not in February 2021."

But the other point, again, kind of back to the small business comment. And yes, the longer the government closures are mandated, the harder it is for those small businesses to continue because they're depleting resources day by day as it goes through here. So while I don't have an exact number, I cannot give you a line for the model with respect to how many businesses go out and what that means to the overall occupancy perspective. It is reasonable to assume that there'll be a hit. I don't think you want to put a number out there at all of what it is, but we always thought, frankly, for a year now, which I think is pretty cool -- we thought that our first quarter and maybe into the second quarter, we'll see, we'll be in the high 80s. Certainly on the small shop space, it will be. The anchors are hanging real tough."

I think that, in terms of the existing tenants that we have there in our centers, what they love about the -- so 2 things. Let me back up. When we have restaurants, for example, that have multiple locations, what we're seeing is, because of our highly amenitized projects and our focus on not only the curbside pickup and outdoor dining and a controlled environment that we can help with, we are -- they are focusing more on getting up and operating in our centers versus other choices that they may have. So from the existing tenant standpoint, we were seeing, frankly, a big uptick in the restaurant until we had that second wave of shutdowns again. So our highly amenitized projects where we can influence what's happening to help their businesses has been critical. 
On new tenants coming in, what we're seeing -- and one of the things that I want to mention is we have ability to have like a reset button, right? So the retailers are going, hey, I have the ability to look potentially at some other opportunities that I never could get into before because, historically, we've never had the vacancy where now we have some opportunities. On the flip side, and I don't want to lose this point, is that we're -- Federal Realty having the ability to reset as well and look at how we want to upgrade our real estate. So we're -- when I was saying that we have a -- we have a disproportionate activity on those higher-end lifestyle projects from a new deal standpoint, which shows the strength of, oh my gosh, we now have vacancy in these centers that we never had vacancy in before, and we have a host of relevant tenants that want to get in an opportunity in these centers. So it's been positive."

That's never been more important. And not having a secured loan or lender to deal with dictates some of those decisions. The savvy tenants are very aware of all that, and I think all of that plays to our strength."

One of the things that we're really doing a bunch of is trying to reconfigure outdoor space and create more of it. We're using -- as part of our property improvement plans, as part of the stuff that we're doing. We're using more pergola. We're using more furniture in areas and landscaping to create those places, which restaurants are asking for. And what -- maybe we'll put you in touch, Mike, because it's a long and complicated answer, actually, to kind of the business plans of new food uses -- but put you in touch with like Stu Biel in our shop who's got the -- has got a lot of these type of properties.
 
And so while the quick service stuff that we're still doing and will continue to do is pretty much as it was but, again, even there, looking for outside seating, wherever possible, in either common areas or specific to them. It is also the sitdown restaurants. And the sitdown restaurants that have the ability to be inside and outside, I see that not to the extent it is today, but some piece of that is that comfort with eating outside to continue. That's was happening in a bigger way for us pre-COVID and, like everything else, was accelerated through the COVID process. So a big variety in terms of what's going on but definitely more of a focus on outside."

And the bottom line is there's uncertainty with it.

First quarter FFO per share of $1.17 was sequentially better than the 2020 fourth quarter of $1.14, a positive surprise for us and the result of far fewer tenant failure than anticipated during the quarter and far better cash recoveries than anticipated.

Pent-up consumer demand is real. We see it in virtually all of our properties in all of our markets despite government-imposed restrictions that still persist in our market. And when coupled with government stimulus cash is really powerful. PPP and other COVID-related programs that many of our tenants have taken advantage of has served an important role in buying time and getting both current and deferred rent paid. 
The $29 billion restaurant revitalization fund earmarked specifically for restaurants and similar places of business as part of the massive COVID relief build will undoubtedly also create a strong tailwind for that retail category. So with the [ Gen ] Act that, if authorized, will allow the small business administration to make COVID-related grants to privately owned fitness facilities. These programs, among others, are particularly good news for federal lifestyle-oriented properties, which are recovering very nicely. It's quickly become a very optimistic time in our business. 
Now As you would expect from me, a warning about over exuberance this year is in order as many retailers, particularly smalls, along with theaters and gyms are in a weakened state, And while buoyed by temporary stimulus need more growth in their sales than they're currently generating to be viable long-term businesses. Having said that, they'll certainly get the opportunity to succeed because traffic is back in large numbers across the board. 
Perhaps the greatest indication of a bright future is the continuation of exceptionally strong leasing volumes, including first quarter deals for over 0.5 million square feet of comparable space, 35% more deals than last year's largely pre-COVID first quarter for 9% more GLA, actually 24% more GLA than the average of our first quarter production over the last 5 years. By any measure, we're doing a lot of lease. The fact that it was also done at 9% higher rents than the previous tenants were paying for the same space bodes extremely well for 2022 and beyond when those deals are earnings contributors. 
The rate and volume of new deals, as opposed to renewals, was particularly impressive. 54 new deals for more than 220,000 square feet at 18% more rent than the previous tenant would pay. What's particularly encouraging to me is how broad-based our leasing continues to be. In the first quarter, we did grocery and drugstore deals with Giant, Whole Foods and CVS. We did box deals with Dick's and Bed, Bath. We did fitness deals with Crunch and Planet Fitness. We did lifestyle deals with CB2, American Eagle, Madewell, Athleta, Blue Bottle Cafe Coffee and a couple of dozen restaurant specialty service-oriented retailers, strong demand all across the board, particularly in California. 
In fact, let me take some time today to focus in on California because it really is a microcosm of our portfolio, particularly our nonessential lifestyle product and, in my opinion, a leading indicator into the future that Bethesda, Rose; Pike & Rose; the [ assembly roads ] in our portfolio, whether good or bad things always seeing from first to this huge and complex market. 
First, the governor there has previously announced that all COVID restrictions will be removed next month. This is great news. We did 50% more new deals in California in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter, which itself was strong. As you know, we're heavily invested in and around Silicon Valley in the north and in the Greater Los Angeles area in the south and are fully committed to investing in California in the future. 
Tenant demand and consumer traffic are promised anywhere in our portfolio, and 2021 should be an all-time record for us in terms of the number of new retail leases we expect to do there. It's really hard to short great real estate in California despite the headwinds. 
Let me start with San Jose and Silicon Valley, which has become a beneficiary of urban and suburban migration in San Francisco to the north. Santana Row car traffic, as measured by our parking systems, rose 69% in April compared with January and is fast approaching pre-COVID levels. Residential occupancy is back up over 95% after dipping to a COVID low point of 91% in the middle of last year. And as you may have seen late last month, Santana Row was the recipient of the first large Silicon Valley COVID office lease site as Fortune 500 cloud-led software company, NetApp, decided to relocate their headquarters to Santana Row and 700 Santana Row, the 300,000 square foot building not yet populated but previously leased to Splunk. The stated reason, to better facilitate a winning employee experience in a more connected space. In other words, state-of-the-art facilities in a fully amenitized environment that makes retaining employees and hiring great talent easier. No lost economics to us versus the Splunk deal, but 2 more years of term and a better diversified tenant base. And by the way, another candidate for additional office space at Santana as their Silicon Valley footprint grows. 
Splunk, of course, remains fully committed to Santana Row at 500 Santana. Now across the street at Santana West, our 375,000 square foot spec office building under construction remains unleased -- leased and has certainly been set back in terms of timing of lease-up with the pause in overall office leasing during COVID. But we remain, and in fact, are more optimistic about its leasing prospects than we've been since COVID and are encouraged by the office-centric back to work comments made by the Silicon Valley tone setters like Google, Amazon, Apple, Netflix [ there ]. These and others are all hiring in the South Bay and are showing a heightened desire for newly constructed office space with walkable amenities and ample [ park ]. 
In Southern California, our prime store portfolio, which caters to a largely Latino population in Los Angeles remains among the top-performing group of shopping centers among all federal centers nationwide in terms of rent collection and property operating income compared with pre-COVID levels. Big assets like Plaza Segundo and The Point are recovering nicely and serve the beach cities of Manhattan, Formosa and Redondo beaches, places which are even more attractive to live in than they were pre-COVID. 
So I guess a somewhat obvious conclusion here is that California is as big and complex economy, as any region can be. Actually bigger and more complex than most countries. And as with every major market varies greatly within the submarkets where the supply and demand characteristics of the specific real estate dictate performance. We've got some great real estate sale there. 
All right. A few other proactive comments before turning it over to Dan. While always a key part of our business plan, we've turned up the heat on the number and the stope of shopping center redevelopments and repositionings that are or about to be underway. A combined capital budget in excess of $75 million over 17 projects aimed at ensuring relevant best-in-class community-centric centers in a post-COVID environment. More gathering areas, more outdoor seating, more designated curbside pickup spots, better landscaping, covered walkways, you get the idea. Everything aimed at ensuring our properties are the consolidators and they're given submarket. 
In terms of our developments, we're really looking forward to showing off the new CocoWalk when investors are back to traveling regularly. Today, tenants continue to open where the retail space is 98% and office space 82% underleased or executed LOI. The initial market acceptance of this revitalized center at Coconut Grove has been phenomenal and should only get better over the next 12 months as more and more retailers open their doors. 
Heading north to Darien, Connecticut, we're very bullish about our mixed-use neighborhood that's well under construction here, especially given its perfect location for a hybrid New York City work model. For those of you who live near or are familiar with our project, you should start to be able to get a sense of what that mixed-use development is going to feel like as construction and leasing move forward as anticipated. 
Office leasing activity has picked up markedly this past quarter at 909 Rose -- Pike & Rose where 75% of both POI and GLA at a 219,000 square foot office building is either under lease or executed LOI. Not only activity but dealmaking feels so much more productive than it did just a few weeks ago. 
In an Assembly Row, PUMA is just a couple of months away from opening their new U.S. headquarters and welcoming employees back to work. And we'll begin to market our -- and separately, we'll begin to market our residential project there in earnest this month. Like the [ Cocowalk ] and Pike & Rose, office leasing activity has picked up here, too, not to the same extent. The Boston metropolitan area is poised for recovery, but clearly lagged behind by what feels like several weeks or a month. 
Okay, from developments and redevelopment to acquisitions. We closed on our first acquisition in 2021 last week in the form of Chesterbrook shopping center, the affluent First Ring DC suburb of McLean, Virginia. We paid $26 million in initial [ 5 cap ] for an 80% controlling interest in this 83% leased Safeway anchored center and with a market repositioning plan and under market in-place rents, we expect strong short-term growth and significant value add. 
We're also under contract in our due diligence period, several other acquisitions that, absent negative surprises, will close later in the year. I'm not ready to talk further about them at this point, but more to come here over the next few months. 
Okay. That's about all I have for my prepared remarks today. Let me turn it over to Dan, and we'll be happy to entertain your questions after that."
271305,709906352,2271419,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Good afternoon, everyone. Good evening. To echo Don's initial comments, we have been the beneficiary of the broad-based recovery that the entire open-air retail real estate industry has experienced in the firs",1281,"Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Good afternoon, everyone. Good evening. 
To echo Don's initial comments, we have been the beneficiary of the broad-based recovery that the entire open-air retail real estate industry has experienced in the first quarter. We significantly outperformed the quarter, reporting FFO per share of $1.17, up 3% sequentially from 4Q and well ahead of our internal expectations. 
We went from the dark days of December and January where government-mandated shutdowns in our markets impacted over 90% of Federal's assets. And we experienced weaker consumer traffic and collections than prior months. To 90 days later, we are after another round of PPP supporting our tenants, successful vaccine rollout and a reopening of our markets all make things seem somewhat sustainable. 
Given this increased stability, we were able to beat our internal forecast by higher revenues and POI broadly from higher collections than forecast both in the current period and from prior periods as well. Less fallout from small shop tenants than expected, higher term fees and percentage rent and forecast offset by higher property level expenses, primarily due to snow. 
Positive trend in COVID-19 collectibility reserves continues as we had just $14.8 million in the quarter, down 20% sequentially versus 4Q. We expect that progress to continue over the course of the year. $10 million of that amount is driven by our strategic decision to be more accommodative with our tenants. More on that in a moment. 
We continued to improve on collections, achieving 90% for the quarter, steady progress despite weakness in January due to the aforementioned shutdowns. Our strategic decision to be more accommodative to our tenants differentiates us from many of our peers. In our disclosure, you'll see negotiated abatements in the form of temporary percentage rent and other arrangements, totaling $10 million or about 5% of billed rent for the quarter. That accounts for roughly 50% of our uncollected rent. Those agreements are scheduled to burn off over the balance of the year and into 2022. 
Combined collections, deferrals and abatements totaled 96%, leaving about 4% of our billed monthly rents unresolved relative to the steady-state pre-COVID 1% to 2% loan. 
Another area where we outperformed our forecast is occupancy. Our tenants have demonstrated surprising resiliency for a combination of better-than-expected renewal activity and fewer tenant values. Our leased occupancy metric stands at 91.8% at quarter end, and our occupied metric dipped below 90% to 89.5%, both stronger levels than we predicted to start the year. Our leased-to-occupied spread has increased 230 basis points and represents roughly $20 million of PR upside in the future. 
Given the strong pace of leasing activity, my gut tells me that spread should grow in the coming quarters. While we still expect continued pressure on our occupancy over the next quarter or 2, We do not expect the trough to be as deep as previously feared as continued leasing activity at the items we have achieved over the last 3 quarters, plus our strong forward leasing pipeline should set us up for a more pronounced growth in '22. 
Now to the balance sheet and an update on liquidity. We ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion of total available capital comprised of $780 million of cash and an undrawn $1 billion revolver. We amended our term loan in April, pushing the maturity out to 2024 for the option to extend through 2026. We reduced the spread from 135 to 80 basis points over LIBOR and paid down the loan balance to leave $300 million outstanding. 
We completed the sale For $20 million of our Grand Park Plaza land parcel for a regionally based townhome developer. Please note that we do have a participation interest here, which could provide some additional upside given the strength in the suburban DC housing market. 
We have further solidified our well-laddered maturity schedule with only $125 million of debt maturing between now and mid-2023, all which is secured and is earmarked for repayment from cash on hand. This will increase our unencumbered pool to 92% of EBITDA. 
And lastly, as we have done programmatically every year since 2011, we sold common equity through our ATM program, $124 million at a blended share price of $105 in start of the year. Our remaining to spend on our $1.2 billion in-process development pipeline stands at just over $360 million. As we have throughout the past year, we sit with significant dry pattern. 
Now on to guidance for '21 and '22. Now please keep in mind before I start that there is still a high degree of uncertainty in our forecast given the continued impact of the pandemic on our business. 
But with that being said, we are providing 2021 guidance in a range of $4.54 to $4.70 per share. Despite a strong first quarter, some of that outperformance is not expected to be recurring. Let me be a bit more helpful. Think of 2Q roughly flat to 1Q at $1.15 to $1.20 per share. 
Now the second half of the year will be negatively impacted primarily from the delivery of our large residential project at Assembly Row due to the negative POI during lease-up as well as reduced capitalized interest. As a result, figure the third quarter at roughly $110 million to $115 million in the fourth quarter back towards the first half's run rate of $115 million to $120 million, which gets you to the midpoint of our range at $4.62 per share, a $0.10 increase for the 2021 guidepost we provided on last quarter's call. 
Assumptions behind this guidance. Comparable growth of roughly 2% as we expect some choppiness over the next quarter or 2, and we do not expect to have term fees in 2021 at the same levels of 2020 or 2019, which were both north of [ $14 ] million. Please note that comparable growth as a metric continues to have limited utility in this environment. 
Collectibility metrics should improve over the course of the year, but will not return to pre-COVID levels until some time in '22. As discussed, we expect lower occupancy levels in the next quarter or 2 before stabilizing later in the year, but remain optimistic that it will not be as bad as previously viewed. Targeting a trough and 88% range for occupied percentage with a lease percentage remaining above 90%. 
G&A will average roughly $11 million to $12 million in the quarter. On the capital side, we project spend on development and redevelopment of roughly $350 million to $400 million. The contributions from our large development projects will be modestly negative in 2021 as POI from Cocowalk's lease-up will be more than offset by bringing online the Phase IIIs for both Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, including the aforementioned resi building, which, as I mentioned, are initially dilutive during lease-up. 
We project another $150 million of opportunistic equity issuance on our ATM over the course of the year and is our custom, this guidance assumes no acquisitions or dispositions over the balance of '21. We will adjust those as we go. However, our recently acquired Chesterbrook shopping center, demographically strong McLean, Virginia is included in these numbers. 
For 2022, we are providing a range of $5.05 to $5.25, which represents double-digit FFO growth in 2022. This is being driven by lower COVID-19 collection challenges as deferrals are repaid and abatement agreements earn off, the expectation of growing occupancy levels back into the low 90s and  stronger contributions from our development pipeline as leasing activity more meaningfully translates to POI. More detail on 2022 as we get further into the year. 
And with that, operator, Please open up the line for questions."

It's -- there's a number of things that have become really clear COVID, from my perspective. And that is the migration that is so talked about is largely from the city to the first ring suburbs. And so when I sit, I see what is happening in the places that we're at, I know that we're going to continue to invest in those places for all the reasons that we felt good about them for all those years. 
So the first thing is, you should feel -- you should understand that Federal is very committed to the markets that we're in for future acquisitions. The second is -- it's an interesting concept. I've talked in the past about Arizona. I've talked in the past about south and west acquisitions. But you know what that's mostly about is the reality that for stuff that we want, and that will not change, it is the high-quality stuff that has for leasing and redevelopment potential. 
We need a few more ponds to fish in, if you will, because we are in just 7 or 8 markets. And it is pretty clear that markets like Phoenix and Scottsdale, markets potentially like Dallas, maybe Atlanta, we'll see, certainly, South Florida have the similar characteristics to those markets that have worked real well for us. 
So the stuff that we've got tied up that I can't give you too much on, I can tell you one of those assets are in the existing markets that we're in, one of those markets is a new one in terms of the Southwest, as you might imagine. So I hope we get both of them over the transom there. 
But really what that's about is when you invested in Federal, You invest in Federal to look for those markets with high barriers to entry, lots of jobs, great education that includes the ones we're in. And yes, it includes a few new ones, potentially over the next several years. So try and think about it that way."

And as you think about it, the conversations about rents has to be talked about in the same conversation as productivity. When you think about what the occupancy cost is for a particular retailer, retailer is looking to make money and create value. And that's going to be very dependent upon what it is that they do in top line, either on-site or in their total business as well as the cost structure throughout the whole business. 
So I know what I just said is obvious, but it feels like we sometimes so focus on the absolute rent number, we don't focus on the business that effectively is there that is creating value for that particular company, owners and shareholders. 
So from a rent perspective, I can tell you, I feel pretty darn good that we will actually have enhanced demand. We have seen enhanced demand at our properties. Now that doesn't mean you won't make accommodations, if you will, during COVID. We certainly will and have demonstrated that we'll do that probably to a greater extent than others are willing to do that. But that's only because we have great faith in our properties going forward. 
So we're always going to try to get the best economic deal that we can that works for that particular tenant. The key is to find the right tenants, to find those tenants that are those that can do the volumes and those that cannot just pay the highest rents, that can do the volumes to create the synergies within a shopping center that make the whole effectively impacted by each of the parks. 
So that's not a -- I don't know how to answer your question in terms of is it so bad if rentes rolled out. I don't think about it that way. We think about it as from a shopping center perspective, how do we make the overall total sales of that shopping center go up. And -- because if that happens, whether, again, it's online or a combination of online or in-store, if that happens, rent is a byproduct of that. It's not the leading indicator. 
So when you go for a lead indicator, it feels to me like you're competing in a business based on being the cheapest guy. That's not a business I want to have anything to do with running. That's no fun. I've got to be able to be the guy that you want to come to because you can make the most money. And if all you're looking at is cheap rents to be able to do that, I think it's pretty myopic."

I would not candy coat that one bit.

Now hopefully, those tenants will be able to pay that full rent and continue to do that. We know that certainly, we've got development projects that are being delivered. Of course, when you deliver a big residential building there's dilution associated with it. I mean we all know that. That's how it works on your way to creating a bunch of value there. 
We know that the volume of leasing that we've already done and rolling into what income stream that's going to produce is pretty predictable.

I mean, there is -- we tried to put out a range there as best we see it today based on those things going away, the accommodations going away, the developments coming on, their impact, positive or negative, associated with it and the leasing that is being done, those 3 primary things. 
And we get comfortable that for that period of time, we should be in that range. Lots of things can go wrong from there, and a few things could go right. So you're right. I mean, let me tell you, we're going to do all we can to blow through those numbers. But please don't take that as a de facto given that, that can happen because I don't have that much of a crystal ball. And I don't know if that's helpful or not, but just the way you characterized it didn't suggest the way I feel."

It's actually going to be -- what we're focused on is on '22, we've got primary drivers being the 2 big buildings at Assembly. They will begin to contribute in 2022, but will not fully contribute until 2023. 
Cocowalk should begin to stabilize in 2022. And we did a fully -- a full run rate at some point over the course of the year, as should, at some point, the building here at Pike & Rose. I think that there should be probably contribution in and around an additional 10 million of additional incremental relative to '21 contribution over the course of the year. 
But Katy, your question is dead right. The -- if you think about us delivering -- Assembly is an easy one to understand, right? We're going to deliver this year a big residential building. The pace of lease-up, how you get through 500 units is going to determine, in some respects, how quickly the dilution burns off when you start being accretive, what kind of rents we're getting, et cetera. And there's a lot of question around how that's going to work. 
I don't know that we're going to be doing 20 to 30 units, say, a month or we're going to be able to do 40 or 45 units a month and at what rent. So if you kind of roll that through a model, you've got a -- just from that big project, you've certainly got range. But our range for 2022 is way beyond that. It really has to include some basic assumptions on lease-up of the portfolio. 
As you know, as Dan said, we'll be at 88% or 89% later this year. We've got to get that back up to 92% or 93%. The pace by which that happens is going to very much determine that. But I do feel great, frankly, about the -- not only the direction that we're headed but because of the volume that we're doing and the [ rate ] of the progress we're making on the development that while we can't be precise with respect to exactly how that income stream is going to come on, we certainly know what the direction of it is. 
And within a range that I actually think is pretty tight, given the fact that we're  9 to 20 -- 18 months out, I think it's pretty tight. And so all of those things considering, I think we got a pretty good -- can give you more visibility than we've been able to give you since the beginning of the pandemic."

He'll say it's only telling half the story and yell at me. 
We would -- we sit there and debate how important California is as a market today and where it's going to be tomorrow. What are we really seeing with respect to leasing demand? Is that changing? Is the state -- is everybody moving to Texas? How is this all really playing out. And we really came down to this very good understanding that the headlines are far more exaggerated than effectively the supply and demand characteristics of the markets that we're in that we can certainly talk about with knowledge because we're out there doing those leases. 
And as a result, the ability to find other places where we would like to continue to invest. We do have another one that we're looking at really, really closely in Southern California that I hope we can get over to pull over the transom because I think the long-term opportunity is amazing. 
So I wanted to go through that really as a headline buster, if you will. And I do think it's a great microcosm of -- and a predictor of what you will see as the Massachusetts economy opens back up. It is interesting. If you look at weather, so as you head north, you can say, okay, Pike & Rose is behind Florida, but ahead of Boston. Austin is behind Pike & Rose, and we can see where it's going relative to California. The warmer it gets, the nicer the weather, by far, seems to be the biggest predictor of traffic levels and sales."

I mean, the greatest -- the best part of residential, and I'm sure you hear it on every residential call, is the same thing as the worst part of residential for 1-year leases. A little bit less, a little bit more. 
So it's not like you build something in a great market, but at the long time and you're stuck in purgatory forever, as happens on the retail side and certainly happens in  the office side. 
And so I know today, it is, as we've talked about as you've [ indicated ] here, it is our toughest market from a residential perspective, to be able to make progress. And that is where we're opening up a new project. So there is less predictability in terms of that timing and where we go. I do believe we'll be where we said we'd be as upon stabilization, even if that stabilization is later than obviously, than it would have been pre-COVID. We'll have to see, we'll have to play that out. 
In terms of investing in residential in other places. Sure, we will. I still feel -- I feel very good about that at our mixed-use properties. Again, not stand-alone, but where they are at our mixed-use properties. The real question there is what are we going to do -- are we going to be able to make the number of work with construction prices, which are absolutely, at this point in time, out of control. And whether that is a long-term phenomena or a short-term phenomena is to be seen. Clearly, supply chain of materials has been completely disrupted in the last year globally, and that impacts prices. So we have to see where that will go. 
But at Bala Cynwyd, for example, in our shopping center there outside of Philadelphia and Lower Merion Township, we're leasing up our small project, and we really want to do a small project there as a precursor to see what kind of demand we would have for a larger project that would include residential on the Lord & Taylor site that is there. One of the best pieces of the land in all -- in the whole Federal portfolio. And I am extremely bullish on what has the initial demand on -- even during COVID of the small project that we did there. And on the township and the design process of what we're building. 
So it comes at -- we're an economic company. It comes down to can we make money? And can we add value to the extent we can with  residential in our existing properties, we will still do that."

I'd love either Jeff or Wendy to add on to my point, but -- to my comments. But a couple of things, Craig. The thing that keeps striking me throughout this process is how broad-based the leasing has been. I've been looking for places to say, okay, here's a category that is very active right now. And this other category is not doing deals. I'm not seeing that. I'm seeing this broad-based. 
Now what I know is the number of deals that you're seeing at some of like the essential -- sorry, the nonessential, the lifestyle type projects are particularly good. And I think that's a factor or a notion of, there's a -- I believe there is a groundswell that is becoming more and more accepted that these first-tier suburbs with places that are -- that can be more than just your shopping center that are effectively an integral part of your life are a place to be. 
So what we're really trying to do and seen some really good success there is getting new leases from tenants that have been not -- are new to market and we've seen that in a large way at Santana, I know Jeff can talk more about that. We've seen that in a huge way on the Pike & Rose, Village at Sherlington, First Row suburbs outside of Washington, D.C. for new food concepts. Certainly, for some gym concepts that have been newly capitalized along the way and even apparel. 
So this is about as broad as it's been. We certainly have grocery deals in there, a CVS deal in there along the way. But it's -- I'm most excited to tell you the truth, not about the boxes. The boxes are fine, and they've got a lot of leverage and they're the national companies that will pay the rent and isn't that exciting? It's really exciting when you're killed by COVID, not particularly exciting going forward. And there's not a lot of growth in it. It is kind of what it is. I'm excited by the small shop potentials at consolidating places that are either mixed use or dominant in the dominant shopping centers in their markets because that's where I think there'll be value to add significantly over the next few years. Jeff or Wendy? Craig always asks the best questions."

So I appreciate it. Very true, broad-based is what certainly we're seeing all over the east not just at lifestyle centers, certainly, but our community centers, our neighborhood centers, our power centers. 
As Don said, we maintain a strong, steady and healthy level of anchor activity, which has been very good and supportive and kind of continuous. The spike had been on the smaller shops, all the way from the mom-and-pops from Taco Bambas which is a coveted taco player in Northern Virginia that just signed a deal with us in Congressional in Rockville, to Athleta, to Room & Board, to American Eagle to Gregory's Coffee who's joining us in Long Island. So new names. 
In addition, where we had strong tenants like a Starbucks, we're doing several deals with them where they're taking their focus on these first-ring suburbs and they're investing and we're investing in creating some opportunities for them that would also maintain and provide a drive-through. 
So that's kind of what we've done for the quarter. In conjunction with that, what I'm also pretty excited about is what I see in the pipeline. And that is, again, broad-based all the way across our property formats and robust. So not just in renewals, but in net new deals. So I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing lately."

So really encouraged not only by what we've accomplished so far in, let's call it, the last 3 quarters or so coming -- as we started to come out of COVID. But if you look at the pipeline of deals that are being negotiated right now, that's very strong. I couldn't be happier about that."

And again, I kind of think the straight line that took you from January to April, It's heavily weather-dependent, too. I mean, look, the issue is if you say, what do I worry about? I mean the government stimulus has clearly been helpful. There will be more to come. That's clearly helpful. 
But for businesses to be long term viable, those government restrictions have to go away and those businesses have to see if they can survive long term. That, to me, is still a question mark, right? You can't have a business that's 25% open, paying rent because the stimulus is allowing them to pay rent. But the stimulus goes away, you've got -- you can't make any money at 25% or 50%. 
So it's really -- that's what is yet to be seen. The encouraging side of that drag, and it's happened all the way through. It's the traffic that has come out has been impressive. And so these people have the opportunity to buy and to eat and to spend, I believe they will. At least those retailers will not have much of an excuse if those folks are there and the government restrictions were gone to be able to make money in their businesses."

And on the second piece with regards to the cash, look, we're trying to keep a -- we've got spend that we're expecting this year. We've got some opportunities from an acquisition perspective in the quarter. We had $800 million and an undrawn line of credit. I mean, we have plenty of dry powder.

So the way we look at it, first of all, gosh, you're never going to convince me that merchandising is not among the most important things to do in a retail environment. We all know that even after the pandemic, there's too much -- there' too many choices for places to shop out there. We've got to be the one of choice if we're going to have any possibility of pushing rents, which we want to do. 
And so what we're -- so Just like the $75 million that we're spending on redevelopment projects, which are all about much more than new rooms and parking lots. These are about places to hang so that you can be there in the morning, at night or long-term periods or short-term periods to use this as part of your life. If you do that, then we -- the biggest part of that is getting the right tenants that let you have that type of lifestyle. What we've seen is great demand from a very wide variety of tenants like that. I think Jeff Berkes has talked about them. 
Now when you're talking about restaurants, is the credit great in a restaurant? No. Is the fact that 110,000 restaurants in the country went away during COVID a positive? Yes. Because supply/demand is reaching a much better balance in that very important category for the type of assets that we have. And I -- frankly, we're doubling down on restaurants. I love it. I love the idea of being the consolidator to have a place where those key gathering places have those choices. 
And when you go out and spend your time, I think you would agree. You may worry about who's going to fill a [ P.O. box ] if that business doesn't work 3 years from now, 5 years from now. But I think we've proven -- I think the country has proven that restaurants, outdoor dining is here to stay and effectively making -- we've got the places for that particular group. We also have the places, and we've been seeing it in terms of those digitally native brands that want only a few places to make sure that their brand is appropriately reflected. 
We've gotten more than our fair share of that, certainly at the Road property. So I think it's -- going back to where we started, there's a lot of -- it's not that there's a lot of choice, if you will, for any particular tenant. It is that the best tenants do seem to be coming, and we get a shot at them. And if we get a shot at them, we got a shot at creating the best place. And that's how we can push rents and create value. 
So from my perspective, very encouraged by what we've seen over the last 9 months, frankly, in terms of our places and demand at our places."

One thing that's different about this crisis than 2009-2010 and even if you dial back to the tech bubble bursting in Silicon Valley, right, when we're delivering first phase of Santana Row is there is a ridiculous amount of capital on the sidelines. And whether it's money to fund new restaurants or new restaurant concepts, it certainly wasn't around when we delivered Santana Row back in the day, which is why we had to invest in those restaurants ourselves. 
We're seeing this time just completely different availability of capital for new business and new business formation, particularly in the restaurant category. We're also seeing it in the fitness, and I would call it the healthcare and wellness segment, where we've seen a few new concepts come that are very well backed, very well financially backed. And a couple of fitness operators that didn't have legacy issues for whatever reason, that have invested a ridiculous amount of equity, capital in the fitness sector. And really a lot different from that perspective than prior downturns. 
So we're not relaxing our credit quality standards at all. And quite frankly, we haven't needed to."

As it relates to other tenants going forward, new coming in, It depends on the center and it depends on the concept. We sometimes don't mind, depending upon the capital allocation if it's very limited or 0 where we can make an opportunity for a tenant, they can try us, we can try them and see how that marriage works. And we maintain control over the shopping center. So that can oftentimes be a win-win. 
So it really depends. I'm sounding like I'm not answering you, but it really depends on the operator. And it also depends what we're seeing more today than we've seen in the past is if we had choices, right? If we have choices between  2 great operators, and that happens, it's happening more often than not now. So all those factors come into play as we continue to kind of emerge post-COVID."

Good afternoon, everybody. Good morning. What a difference a couple of months makes. The natural positive annual sentiment of spring, fall and winter, coupled with the productive team rolled out, stimulus money and end-in-sight mentality, it",1774,"Thanks, Leah. Good afternoon, everybody. Good morning. What a difference a couple of months makes. The natural positive annual sentiment of spring, fall and winter, coupled with the productive team rolled out, stimulus money and end-in-sight mentality, it's really got a long way in validating our optimism for a strong 2022 and 2023. 
First quarter FFO per share of $1.17 was sequentially better than the 2020 fourth quarter of $1.14, a positive surprise for us and the result of far fewer tenant failure than anticipated during the quarter and far better cash recoveries than anticipated. As a result, we're confident enough to update our 2022 earnings guidance and provide some clarity on the next 3 quarters of 2021. Dan will cover that in a few minutes. 
Pent-up consumer demand is real. We see it in virtually all of our properties in all of our markets despite government-imposed restrictions that still persist in our market. And when coupled with government stimulus cash, it's really powerful. PPP and other COVID-related programs that many of our tenants have taken advantage of has served an important role in buying time and getting both current and deferred rent paid. 
The $29 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund, earmarked specifically for restaurants and similar places of business, as part of the massive COVID relief build will undoubtedly also create a strong tailwind for that retail category. So with the GYMS Act that, if authorized, will allow the Small Business Administration to make COVID-related grants to privately owned fitness facilities. These programs, among others, are particularly good news for Federal's lifestyle-oriented properties, which are recovering very nicely. It's quickly become a very optimistic time in our business. 
Now as you would expect from me, a warning about over exuberance this year is in order as many retailers, particularly [ small owners ], along with theaters and gyms are in a weakened state. And while buoyed by temporary stimulus, need more growth in their sales than they're currently generating to be viable long-term businesses. Having said that, they'll certainly get the opportunity to succeed because traffic is back in large numbers across the board. 
Perhaps the greatest indication of a bright future is the continuation of exceptionally strong leasing volumes, including first quarter deals for over 0.5 million square feet of comparable space, 35% more deals than last year's largely pre-COVID first quarter for 9% more GLA, actually 24% more GLA than the average of our first quarter production over the last 5 years. By any measure, we're doing a lot of leases. The fact that it was also done at 9% higher rents than the previous tenants were paying for the same space bodes extremely well for 2022 and beyond when those deals are earnings contributors. 
The rate and volume of new deals as opposed to renewals was particularly impressive. 54 new deals for more than 220,000 square feet at 18% more rent than the previous tenant would pay. What's particularly encouraging to me is how broad-based our leasing continues to be. In the first quarter, we did grocery and drugstore deals with Giant, Whole Foods and CVS. We did box deals with Dick's and Bed, Bath. We did fitness deals with Crunch and Planet Fitness. We did lifestyle deals with CB2, American Eagle, Madewell, Athleta, Blue Bottle Cafe Coffee (sic) [ Blue Bottle Coffee ] and a couple of dozen restaurant specialty service-oriented retailers. Strong demand all across the board, particularly in California. 
In fact, let me take some time today to focus in on California because it really is a microcosm of our portfolio, particularly our nonessential lifestyle product and, in my opinion, a leading indicator into the future of the Bethesda Rows, the Pike & Roses, the Assembly Rows in our portfolio. Whether good or bad, things always seem to come first to this huge and complex market. 
First, the governor there has previously announced that all COVID restrictions will be removed next month. This is great news. We did 50% more new deals in California in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter, which itself was strong. As you know, we're heavily invested in and around Silicon Valley in the north and in the Greater Los Angeles area in the south and are fully committed to investing in California in the future. 
Tenant demand and consumer traffic are among the [ highest ] anywhere in our portfolio, and 2021 should be an all-time record for us in terms of the number of new retail leases we expect to do there. It's really hard to short great real estate in California despite the headwinds. 
Let me start with San Jose and Silicon Valley, which has become a beneficiary of urban and suburban migration in San Francisco to the north. Santana Row car traffic, as measured by our parking systems, rose 69% in April compared with January and is fast approaching pre-COVID levels. Residential occupancy is back up over 95% after dipping to a COVID low point of 91% in the middle of last year. 
And as you may have seen late last month, Santana Row was the recipient of the first large Silicon Valley COVID era office lease site as Fortune 500 cloud-led software company, NetApp, decided to relocate their headquarters to Santana Row in 700 Santana Row, the 300,000 square foot building not yet populated but previously leased to Splunk. The stated reason: to better facilitate a winning employee experience in a more connected space. In other words, state-of-the-art facilities in a fully amenitized environment that makes retaining employees and hiring great talent easier. No lost economics to us versus the Splunk deal, but 2 more years of term and a better diversified tenant base. And by the way, another candidate for additional office space at Santana as their Silicon Valley footprint grows. Splunk, of course, remains fully committed to Santana Row at 500 Santana Row. 
Now across the street at Santana West, our 375,000 square foot spec office building under construction, remains unleased -- leased and has certainly been set back in terms of timing of lease-up with the pause in overall office leasing during COVID. But we remain, and in fact, are more optimistic about its leasing prospects than we've been since COVID hit and are encouraged by the office-centric back-to-work comments made by the Silicon Valley tone setters like Google, Amazon, Apple, Netflix [ there ]. These and others are all hiring in the South Bay and are showing a heightened desire for newly constructed office space with walkable amenities and ample park. 
In Southern California, our Primestor portfolio, which caters to a largely Latino population in Los Angeles, remains among the top-performing group of shopping centers among all Federal centers nationwide in terms of rent collection and property operating income compared with pre-COVID levels. Big assets like Plaza El Segundo and The Point are recovering nicely and serve the beach cities of Manhattan, Formosa and Redondo Beaches, places which are even more attractive to live in than they were pre-COVID. 
So I guess a somewhat obvious conclusion here is that California is as big and complex an economy as any region can be, actually bigger and more complex than most countries. And as with every major market, varies greatly within the submarkets where the supply and demand characteristics of the specific real estate dictate performance. We've got some great real estate sale there. 
All right. A few other proactive comments before turning it over to Dan. While always a key part of our business plan, we've turned up the heat on the number and the scope of shopping center redevelopments and repositionings that are or about to be underway. A combined capital budget in excess of $75 million over 17 projects aimed at ensuring relevant best-in-class community-centric centers in a post-COVID environment. More gathering areas, more outdoor seating, more designated curbside pickup spots, better landscaping, covered walkways, you get the idea. Everything aimed at ensuring our properties are the consolidators in their given submarket. 
In terms of our developments, we're really looking forward to showing off the new CocoWalk when investors are back to traveling regularly. Today, tenants continue to open where the retail space is 98% and office space 82%, underleased or executed LOI. The initial market acceptance of this revitalized center at Coconut Grove has been phenomenal and should only get better over the next 12 months as more and more retailers open their doors. 
Heading north to Darien, Connecticut, we're very bullish about our mixed-use neighborhood that's well under construction here, especially given its perfect location for a hybrid New York City work model. For those of you who live near or are familiar with our project, you should start to be able to get a sense of what that mixed-use development is going to feel like as construction and leasing move forward as anticipated. 
Office leasing activity has picked up markedly this past quarter at 909 Rose -- Pike & Rose, where 75% of both POI and GLA at a 219,000 square foot office building is either under lease or executed LOI. Not only activity, but dealmaking feels so much more productive than it did just a few weeks ago. 
In Assembly Row, PUMA is just a couple of months away from opening their new U.S. headquarters and welcoming employees back to work. And we'll begin to market our -- and separately, we'll begin to market our residential project there in earnest this month. Like the [ CocoWalk ] Pike & Rose, office leasing activity has picked up here, too, but not to the same extent. The Boston Metropolitan area is poised for recovery, but clearly lagged behind the others by what feels like several weeks or a month. 
Okay. From developments and redevelopments to acquisitions. We closed on our first acquisition in 2021 last week in the form of Chesterbrook Shopping Center in the affluent first ring DC suburb of McLean, Virginia. We paid $26 million in initial [ 5 cap ] for an 80% controlling interest in this 83% leased Safeway-anchored center and with a market repositioning plan and up under market in-place rents, we expect strong short-term growth and significant value add. 
We're also under contract and in our due diligence period for several other acquisitions that, absent negative surprises, will close later in the year. I'm not ready to talk further about them at this point, but more to come here over the next few months. 
Okay. That's about all I have for my prepared remarks today. Let me turn it over to Dan, and we'll be happy to entertain your questions after that."
271305,709906352,2271556,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thank you, Don, and good morning -- good afternoon, everyone. Good evening. To echo Don's initial comments, we have been the beneficiary of the broad-based recovery that the entire open-air retail real estate industry has experienced in the first quarte",1277,"Thank you, Don, and good morning -- good afternoon, everyone. Good evening. 
To echo Don's initial comments, we have been the beneficiary of the broad-based recovery that the entire open-air retail real estate industry has experienced in the first quarter. We significantly outperformed the quarter, reporting FFO per share of $1.17, up 3% sequentially from 4Q and well ahead of our internal expectations. 
We went from the dark days of December and January, where government-mandated shutdowns in our markets impacted over 90% of Federal's assets and we experienced weaker consumer traffic and collections than prior months, to 90 days later, where, after another round of PPP supporting our tenants, successful vaccine rollout and a reopening of our markets, all make things seem somewhat sustainable. Given this increased stability, we were able to beat our internal forecast by higher revenues and POI, broadly from higher collections than forecast both in the current period and from prior periods as well; less fallout from small shop tenants than expected; higher term fees and percentage rent and forecast, offset by higher property level expenses, primarily due to snow. 
Positive trend in COVID-19 collectability reserves continues as we had just $14.8 million in the quarter, down 20% sequentially versus 4Q. We expect that progress to continue over the course of the year. $10 million of that amount is driven by our strategic decision to be more accommodative with our tenants. More on that in a moment. 
We continue to improve on collections, achieving 90% for the quarter, steady progress despite weakness in January due to the aforementioned shutdowns. Our strategic decision to be more accommodative to our tenants differentiates us from many of our peers. In our disclosure, you'll see negotiated abatements in the form of temporary percentage rent and other arrangements, totaling $10 million or about 5% of billed rent for the quarter. That accounts for roughly 50% of our uncollected rent. Those agreements are scheduled to burn off over the balance of the year and into 2022. 
Combined collections, deferrals and abatements totaled 96%, leaving about 4% of our billed monthly rents unresolved relative to the steady-state pre-COVID 1% to 2% low. 
Another area where we outperformed our forecast is occupancy. Our tenants have demonstrated surprising resiliency for a combination of better-than-expected renewal activity and fewer tenant failures. Our leased occupancy metric stands at 91.8% at quarter end, and our occupied metric dipped below 90% to 89.5%, both stronger levels than we predicted to start the year. Our leased-to-occupied spread has increased 230 basis points and represents roughly $20 million of PR upside in the future. But given the strong pace of leasing activity, my gut tells me that spread should grow in the coming quarters. 
While we still expect continued pressure on our occupancy over the next quarter or 2, we do not expect the trough to be as deep as previously feared as continued leasing activity and volumes we have achieved over the last 3 quarters, plus our strong forward leasing pipeline should set us up for a more pronounced growth in '22. 
Now to the balance sheet and an update on liquidity. We ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion of total available capital comprised of $780 million of cash and an undrawn $1 billion revolver. We amended our term loan in April, pushing the maturity out to 2024 with the option to extend through 2026. We reduced the spread from 135 to 80 basis points over LIBOR and paid down the loan balance to leave $300 million outstanding. 
We completed the sale for $20 million of our Grand Park Plaza land parcel to a regionally based townhome developer. Please note that we do have a participation interest here, which could provide some additional upside given the strength in the suburban DC housing market. 
We have further solidified our well-laddered maturity schedule with only $125 million of debt maturing between now and mid-2023, all which is secured and is earmarked for repayment from cash on hand. This will increase our unencumbered pool to 92% of EBITDA. 
And lastly, as we have done programmatically every year since 2011, we sold common equity through our ATM program, $124 million at a blended share price of $105 in start of the year. Our remaining to spend on our $1.2 billion in-process development pipeline stands at just over $360 million. As we have throughout the past year, we sit with significant dry powder. 
Now on to guidance for '21 and '22. Now please keep in mind before I start that there is still a high degree of uncertainty in our forecast given the continued impact of the pandemic on our business. But with that being said, we are providing 2021 guidance in a range of $4.54 to $4.70 per share. Despite a strong first quarter, some of that outperformance is not expected to be recurring. 
Let me be a bit more helpful. Think of 2Q roughly flat to 1Q at $1.15 to $1.20 per share. Now the second half of the year will be negatively impacted primarily from the delivery of our large residential project at Assembly Row due to the negative POI during lease-up as well as reduced capitalized interest. As a result, [ figure ] the third quarter at roughly $1.10 to $1.15, and the fourth quarter back towards the first half's run rate of $1.15 to $1.20, which gets you to the midpoint of our range at $4.62 per share, a $0.10 increase from the 2021 guidepost we provided on last quarter's call. 
Assumptions behind this guidance. Comparable growth of roughly 2% as we expect some choppiness over the next quarter or 2, and we do not expect to have term fees in 2021 at the same levels of 2020 or 2019, which were both north of $14 million. Please note that comparable growth as a metric continues to have limited utility in this environment. 
Collectability metrics should improve over the course of the year, but will not return to pre-COVID levels until sometime in '22. As discussed, we expect lower occupancy levels in the next quarter or 2 before stabilizing later in the year, but remain optimistic that it will not be as bad as previously viewed. Targeting a trough at 88% range for occupied percentage with a leased percentage remaining above 90%. 
G&A will average roughly $11 million to $12 million in the quarter. On the capital side, we project spend on development and redevelopment of roughly $350 million to $400 million. The contributions from our large development projects will be modestly negative in 2021 as POI from CocoWalk's lease-up will be more than offset by bringing online the Phase IIIs for both Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, including the aforementioned resi building, which, as I mentioned, are initially dilutive during lease-up. 
We project another $150 million of opportunistic equity issuance on our ATM over the course of the year, and as our custom, this guidance assumes no acquisitions or dispositions over the balance of '21. We will adjust those as we go. However, our recently acquired Chesterbrook shopping center, demographically strong McLean, Virginia is included in these numbers. 
For 2022, we are providing a range of $5.05 to $5.25, which represents close to double-digit FFO growth in 2022. This is being driven by lower COVID-19 collection challenges as deferrals are repaid and abatement agreements earn off, the expectation of growing occupancy levels back into the low 90s and stronger contributions from our development pipeline as leasing activity more meaningfully translates to POI. More detail on 2022 as we get further into the year. 
And with that, operator, Please open up the line for questions."

It's -- there's a number of things that have become really clear during COVID, from my perspective. And that is the migration that is so talked about is largely from the city to the first ring suburbs. And so when I sit, I see what is happening in the places that we're at, I know that we're going to continue to invest in those places for all the reasons that we felt good about them for all those years. 
So the first thing is, you should feel -- you should understand that Federal is very committed to the markets that we're in for future acquisitions. The second is -- it's an interesting concept. I've talked in the past about Arizona. I've talked in the past about South and West acquisitions. But you know what that's mostly about is the reality that for stuff that we want, and that will not change, it is the high-quality stuff that has leasing and redevelopment potential. 
We need a few more ponds to fish in, if you will, because we are in just 7 or 8 markets. And it is pretty clear that markets like Phoenix and Scottsdale, markets potentially like Dallas, maybe Atlanta, we'll see, certainly, South Florida have the similar characteristics as those markets that have worked real well for us. 
So the stuff that we've got tied up that I can't give you too much on, I can tell you one of those assets are in the existing markets that we're in, one of those markets is a new one in terms of the Southwest, as you might imagine. So I hope we get both of them over the transom there. 
But really what that's about is when you invested in Federal, you invest in Federal to look for those markets with high barriers to entry, lots of jobs, great education. That includes the ones we're in, and yes, it includes a few new ones, potentially over the next several years. So try and think about it that way."

Would rent slowing a bit lower actually be that bad of a thing given the significant spread to peers and, of course, acknowledging the quality?

271305,709906352,2271556,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Well, it's a great question, Derek.

And as you think about it, the conversations about rents has to be talked about in the same conversation as productivity. When you think about what the occupancy cost is for a particular retailer, that retailer is looking to make money and create value. And that's going to be very dependent upon what it is that they do in top line, either on-site or in their total business as well as the cost structure throughout the whole business. 
So I know what I just said is obvious, but it feels like we sometimes so focus on the absolute rent number, we don't focus on the business that effectively is there that is creating value for that particular company's owners and shareholders. 
So from a rent perspective, I can tell you, I feel pretty darn good that we will actually have enhanced demand. We have seen enhanced demand at our properties. Now that doesn't mean you won't make accommodations, if you will, during COVID. We certainly will and have demonstrated that we'll do that, probably to a greater extent than others are willing to do that. But that's only because we have great faith in our properties going forward. 
So we're always going to try to get the best economic deal that we can that works for that particular tenant. The key is to find the right tenants, to find those tenants that are those that can do the volumes and those that cannot just pay the highest rents, that can do the volumes to create the synergies within a shopping center that make the whole, effectively, impacted by each of the parts. 
So that's not a -- I don't know how to answer your question in terms of is it so bad if rents rolled down. I don't think about it that way. We think about it as from a shopping center perspective, how do we make the overall total sales of that shopping center go up. And -- because if that happens, whether, again, it's online or a combination of online or in-store, if that happens, rent is a byproduct of that. It's not the leading indicator. 
So when you go for the leading indicator, it feels to me like you're competing in a business based on being the cheapest guy. That's not a business I want to have anything to do with money. That's no fun. I've got to be able to be the guy that you want to come to because you can make the most money. And if all you're looking at is cheap rents to be able to do that, I think it's pretty myopic."

I bet you, most people who have either been to a restaurant, not even restaurants, to a store, and kind of seen the understaffing that persists right now and, in some cases, quality of the labor force, it's a problem. I would not candy coat that one bit. Now it's good to be the landlord effectively because we're talking about commitments for the long term, and I do not expect this to be persistent in terms of being able to find it.

Now hopefully, those tenants will be able to pay that full rent and continue to do that. We know that certainly, we've got development projects that are being delivered. Of course, when you deliver a big residential building, there's dilution associated with it. I mean we all know that. That's how it works on your way to creating a bunch of value there. 
We know that the volume of leasing that we've already done and rolling into what income stream that's going to produce is pretty predictable. And so kind of like I said on the last call, Alex, '22 for us is, in many respects, more predictable than it is in '21 for any particular period. And I think that, that still hangs out there.

It's actually going to be -- what we're focused on is on '22, we've got primary drivers being the 2 big buildings at Assembly. They will begin to contribute in 2022, but will not fully contribute until 2023. 
CocoWalk should begin to stabilize in 2022. And we did a fully -- a full run rate at some point over the course of the year, as should, at some point, the building here at Pike & Rose. I think that there should be probably contribution in and around an additional $10 million of additional incremental relative to '21 contribution over the course of the year. 
But Katy, your question is dead right. The -- if you think about us delivering -- Assembly is an easy one to understand, right? We're going to deliver this year a big residential building. The pace of lease-up, how you get through 500 units, is going to determine, in some respects, how quickly the dilution burns off when you start being accretive, what kind of rents we're getting, et cetera. And there's a lot of question around how that's going to work. 
I don't know that we're going to be doing 20 to 30 units, say, a month or we're going to be able to do 40 or 45 units a month and at what rent. So if you kind of roll that through a model, you've got a -- just from that big project, you've certainly got range. But our range for 2022 is way beyond that. It really has to include some basic assumptions on lease-up of the portfolio. 
As you know, as Dan said, we'll be at 88% or 89% later this year. We've got to get that back up to 92% or 93%. The pace by which that happens is going to very much determine that. But I do feel great, frankly, about the -- not only the direction that we're headed but because of the volume that we're doing and because of the progress we're making on the development, that while we can't be precise with respect to exactly how that income stream is going to come on, we certainly know what the direction of it is. And within a range that I actually think is pretty tight, given the fact that we're 9 to 20 -- 18 months out, I think it's pretty tight. 
And so all of those things considering, I think we got a pretty good -- can give you more visibility than we've been able to give you since the beginning of the pandemic."

He'll say it's only telling half the story and yell at me. 
We would -- we sit there and debate how important California is as a market today and where it's going to be tomorrow. What are we really seeing with respect to leasing demand? Is that changing? Is the state -- is everybody moving to Texas? How is this all really playing out? And we really came down to this very good understanding that the headlines are far more exaggerated than effectively the supply and demand characteristics of the markets that we're in that we can certainly talk about with knowledge because we're out there doing those leases. And as a result, the ability to find other places where we would like to continue to invest. 
We do have another one that we're looking at really, really closely in Southern California that I hope we can get over to pull over the transom because I think the long-term opportunity is amazing. 
So I wanted to go through that really as a headline buster, if you will. And I do think it's a great microcosm of -- and a predictor of what you will see as the Massachusetts economy opens back up. It is interesting. If you look at weather, so as you head north, you can say, okay, Pike & Rose is behind Florida, but ahead of Boston. Boston is behind Pike & Rose, and we can see where it's going relative to California. The warmer it gets, the nicer the weather, by far, it seems to be the biggest predictor of traffic levels and sales. 
Thank you, Michael. And we are friends."

The stabilized yield, I don't feel differently about. Might it take another year to get there? Sure. I mean, the greatest -- the best part of residential, and I'm sure you hear it on every residential call, is that it's the same thing as the worst part of residential for 1-year leases. A little bit less, a little bit more. 
So it's not like you build something in a great market but at the wrong time and you're stuck in purgatory forever. That happens on the retail side and certainly happens in the office side. 
And so I know today, it is, as we've talked about and as we've intimated here, it is our toughest market, from a residential perspective, to be able to make progress in. And that is where we're opening up a new project. So if there is less predictability in terms of that timing and where we go, I do believe we'll be where we said we'd be as -- upon stabilization, even if that stabilization is later than obviously, than it would have been pre-COVID. We'll have to see, we'll have to play that out. 
In terms of investing in residential in other places. Sure, we will. I still feel -- I feel very good about that at our mixed-use properties. Again, not stand-alone, but where they are at our mixed-use properties. The real question there is what are we going to do -- are we going to be able to make the numbers work with construction prices, which are absolutely, at this point in time, out of control. And whether that is a long-term phenomena or a short-term phenomena is to be seen. Clearly, supply chain of materials has been completely disrupted in the last year globally, and that impacts prices. So we have to see where that will go. 
But at Bala Cynwyd, for example, in our shopping center there outside of Philadelphia and Lower Merion Township, we're leasing up our small project, and we really want to do a small project there as a precursor to see what kind of demand we would have for a larger project that would include residential on the Lord & Taylor site that is there. One of the best pieces of the land in all -- in the whole Federal portfolio. And I am extremely bullish on what has the initial demand on -- even during COVID, of the small project that we did there, and on the township and the design process of what we're building. 
So it comes that -- we're an economic company. It comes down to can we make money? And can we add value? To the extent we can with residential in our existing properties, we will still do that."

I'd love either Jeff or Wendy to add on to my point, but -- to my comments. But a couple of things, Craig. The thing that keeps striking me throughout this process is how broad-based the leasing has been. I've been looking for places to say, okay, here's a category that is very active right now. And this other category is not doing deals. I'm not seeing that. I'm seeing this broad-based. 
Now what I know is the number of deals that you're seeing had some of the likely essential -- sorry, the nonessential, the lifestyle-type projects are particularly good. And I think that's a factor or a notion of, there's a -- I believe there is a groundswell that is becoming more and more accepted, that in these first-tier suburbs with places that are -- that can be more than just your shopping center that are effectively an integral part of your life are a place to be. 
So what we're really trying to do, and seen some really good success there, is we're getting new leases from tenants that have been not -- are new to market and we've seen that in a large way at Santana, I know Jeff can talk more about that. We've seen that in a huge way on the Pike & Rose, Village at Sherlington, First Row suburbs outside of Washington, D.C. for new food concepts. Certainly, for some gym concepts that have been newly capitalized along the way and even apparel. 
So this is about as broad as it's been. We certainly have grocery deals in there, a CVS deal in there along the way. But it's -- I'm most excited, to tell you the truth, not about the boxes. The boxes are fine, and they've got a lot of leverage and they're the national companies that will pay the rent and isn't that exciting? It's really exciting when you're killed by COVID, not particularly exciting going forward. And there's not a lot of growth in it. It is kind of what it is. 
I'm excited by the small shop potentials at consolidating places that are either mixed use or dominant -- in the dominant shopping centers in their markets because that's where I think there'll be value to add significantly over the next few years. Jeff or Wendy? Craig always asks the best questions."

So I appreciate it. Very true, broad-based is what certainly we're seeing all over the east not just at the lifestyle centers, certainly, but our community centers, our neighborhood centers, our power centers. 
As Don said, we maintain a strong, steady and healthy level of anchor activity, which has been very good and supportive and kind of continuous. The spike had been on the smaller shops, and all the way from the mom-and-pops from Taco Bamba, which is a coveted taco player in Northern Virginia that just signed a deal with us in Congressional in Rockville, to Athleta, to Room & Board, to American Eagle to Gregorys Coffee who's joining us in Long Island. So new names. 
In addition, where we had strong tenants like a Starbucks, we're doing several deals with them where they're taking their focus on these first ring suburbs and they're investing and we're investing in creating some opportunities for them that would also maintain and provide a drive-through. 
So that's kind of what we've done for the quarter. In conjunction with that, what I'm also pretty excited about is what I see in the pipeline. And that is, again, broad-based all the way across our property formats and robust. So not just in renewals, but in net new deals. So I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing lately."

I mean the government stimulus has clearly been helpful. There will be more to come. That's clearly helpful. 
But for businesses to be long term viable, those government restrictions have to go away and those businesses have to see if they can survive long term. That, to me, is still a question mark, right? You can't have a business that's 25% open, paying rent because the stimulus is allowing them to pay rent. But the stimulus goes away, you've got -- you can't make any money at 25% or 50%. 
So it's really -- that's what is yet to be seen. The encouraging side of that, Craig, and it's happened all the way through, is the traffic that has come out has been impressive.

So the way we look at it, first of all, gosh, you're never going to convince me that merchandising is not among the most important things to do in a retail environment. We all know that even after the pandemic, there's too much -- there' too many choices for places to shop out there. We've got to be the one of choice if we're going to have any possibility of pushing rents, which we want to do. 
And so what we're -- so just like the $75 million that we're spending on redevelopment projects, which are all about much more than new rooms and parking lots, these are about places to hang so that you can be there in the morning, at night or long-term periods or short-term periods, to use this as part of your life. If you do that, then we -- the biggest part of that is getting the right tenants that let you have that type of lifestyle. What we've seen is great demand from a very wide variety of tenants like that. I think Jeff Berkes has talked about them. 
Now when you're talking about restaurants, is the credit great in a restaurant? No. Is the fact that 110,000 restaurants in the country went away during COVID a positive? Yes. Because supply and demand is reaching a much better balance in that very important category for the type of assets that we have. And I -- frankly, we're doubling down on restaurants. I love it. I love the idea of being the consolidator to have a place where those key gathering places have those choices. 
And when you go out and spend your time, I think you would agree. You may worry about who's going to fill a [ P.O. box ] if that business doesn't work 3 years from now, 5 years from now. But I think we've proven -- I think the country has proven that restaurants, outdoor dining is here to stay and effectively making -- we've got the places for that particular group. We also have the places, and we've been seeing it in terms of those digitally native brands that want only a few places to make sure that their brand is appropriately reflected. 
We've gotten more than our fair share of that, certainly at the Row property. So I think it's -- going back to where we started, there's a lot of -- it's not that there's a lot of choice, if you will, for any particular tenant. It is that the best tenants do seem to be coming, and we get a shot at them. And if we get a shot at them, we got a shot at creating the best place. And that's how we can push rents and create value. 
So from my perspective, very encouraged by what we've seen over the last 9 months, frankly, in terms of our places and demand at our places."

One thing that's different about this crisis than 2009-2010 and even if you dial back to the tech bubble bursting in Silicon Valley, right, when we're delivering first phase of Santana Row is there is a ridiculous amount of capital on the sidelines. And whether it's money to fund new restaurants or new restaurant concepts, it certainly wasn't around when we delivered Santana Row back in the day, which is why we had to invest in those restaurants ourselves. 
We're seeing this time just completely different availability of capital for new business and new business formation, particularly in the restaurant category. We're also seeing it in the fitness, and I would call it the healthcare and wellness segment, where we've seen a few new concepts come that are very well backed, very well financially backed. And a couple of fitness operators that didn't have legacy issues for whatever reason, that have invested a ridiculous amount of equity capital in the fitness sector. And really, a lot different, from that perspective, than prior downturns.

As it relates to other tenants going forward, new coming in, it depends on the center and it depends on the concept. We sometimes don't mind, depending upon the capital allocation, if it's very limited or 0, where we can make an opportunity for a tenant, they can try us, we can try them and see how that marriage works. And we maintain control over the shopping center. So that can oftentimes be a win-win. 
So it really depends. I'm sounding like I'm not answering you, but it really depends on the operator. And it also depends what we're seeing -- more today than we've seen in the past, is if we had choices, right? If we have choices between 2 great operators, and that happens, it's happening more often than not now. So all those factors come into play as we continue to kind of emerge post-COVID."

Good afternoon, everybody. Good morning. What a difference a couple of months makes. The natural positive annual sentiment of spring, fall and winter, coupled with the productive team rolled out, stimulus money and end-in-sight mentality, it",1774,"Thanks, Leah. Good afternoon, everybody. Good morning. What a difference a couple of months makes. The natural positive annual sentiment of spring, fall and winter, coupled with the productive team rolled out, stimulus money and end-in-sight mentality, it's really got a long way in validating our optimism for a strong 2022 and 2023. 
First quarter FFO per share of $1.17 was sequentially better than the 2020 fourth quarter of $1.14, a positive surprise for us and the result of far fewer tenant failure than anticipated during the quarter and far better cash recoveries than anticipated. As a result, we're confident enough to update our 2022 earnings guidance and provide some clarity on the next 3 quarters of 2021. Dan will cover that in a few minutes. 
Pent-up consumer demand is real. We see it in virtually all of our properties in all of our markets despite government-imposed restrictions that still persist in our market. And when coupled with government stimulus cash, it's really powerful. PPP and other COVID-related programs that many of our tenants have taken advantage of has served an important role in buying time and getting both current and deferred rent paid. 
The $29 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund, earmarked specifically for restaurants and similar places of business, as part of the massive COVID relief build will undoubtedly also create a strong tailwind for that retail category. So with the GYMS Act that, if authorized, will allow the Small Business Administration to make COVID-related grants to privately owned fitness facilities. These programs, among others, are particularly good news for Federal's lifestyle-oriented properties, which are recovering very nicely. It's quickly become a very optimistic time in our business. 
Now as you would expect from me, a warning about over exuberance this year is in order as many retailers, particularly [ those malls ], along with theaters and gyms are in a weakened state. And while buoyed by temporary stimulus, need more growth in their sales than they're currently generating to be viable long-term businesses. Having said that, they'll certainly get the opportunity to succeed because traffic is back in large numbers across the board. 
Perhaps the greatest indication of a bright future is the continuation of exceptionally strong leasing volumes, including first quarter deals for over 0.5 million square feet of comparable space, 35% more deals than last year's largely pre-COVID first quarter for 9% more GLA, actually 24% more GLA than the average of our first quarter production over the last 5 years. By any measure, we're doing a lot of leases. The fact that it was also done at 9% higher rents than the previous tenants were paying for the same space bodes extremely well for 2022 and beyond when those deals are earnings contributors. 
The rate and volume of new deals as opposed to renewals was particularly impressive. 54 new deals for more than 220,000 square feet at 18% more rent than the previous tenant would pay. What's particularly encouraging to me is how broad-based our leasing continues to be. In the first quarter, we did grocery and drugstore deals with Giant, Whole Foods and CVS. We did box deals with Dick's and Bed, Bath. We did fitness deals with Crunch and Planet Fitness. We did lifestyle deals with CB2, American Eagle, Madewell, Athleta, Blue Bottle Cafe Coffee (sic) [ Blue Bottle Coffee ] and a couple of dozen restaurant specialty service-oriented retailers. Strong demand all across the board, particularly in California. 
In fact, let me take some time today to focus in on California because it really is a microcosm of our portfolio, particularly our nonessential lifestyle product and, in my opinion, a leading indicator into the future of the Bethesda Rows, the Pike & Roses, the Assembly Rows in our portfolio. Whether good or bad, things always seem to come first to this huge and complex market. 
First, the governor there has previously announced that all COVID restrictions will be removed next month. This is great news. We did 50% more new deals in California in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter, which itself was strong. As you know, we're heavily invested in and around Silicon Valley in the north and in the Greater Los Angeles area in the south and are fully committed to investing in California in the future. 
Tenant demand and consumer traffic are among the [ highest ] anywhere in our portfolio, and 2021 should be an all-time record for us in terms of the number of new retail leases we expect to do there. It's really hard to short great real estate in California despite the headwinds. 
Let me start with San Jose and Silicon Valley, which has become a beneficiary of urban and suburban migration in San Francisco to the north. Santana Row car traffic, as measured by our parking systems, rose 69% in April compared with January and is fast approaching pre-COVID levels. Residential occupancy is back up over 95% after dipping to a COVID low point of 91% in the middle of last year. 
And as you may have seen late last month, Santana Row was the recipient of the first large Silicon Valley COVID era office lease site as Fortune 500 cloud-led software company, NetApp, decided to relocate their headquarters to Santana Row in 700 Santana Row, the 300,000 square foot building not yet populated but previously leased to Splunk. The stated reason: to better facilitate a winning employee experience in a more connected space. In other words, state-of-the-art facilities in a fully amenitized environment that makes retaining employees and hiring great talent easier. No lost economics to us versus the Splunk deal, but 2 more years of term and a better diversified tenant base. And by the way, another candidate for additional office space at Santana as their Silicon Valley footprint grows. Splunk, of course, remains fully committed to Santana Row at 500 Santana Row. 
Now across the street at Santana West, our 375,000 square foot spec office building under construction, remains unleased -- leased and has certainly been set back in terms of timing of lease-up with the pause in overall office leasing during COVID. But we remain, and in fact, are more optimistic about its leasing prospects than we've been since COVID hit and are encouraged by the office-centric back-to-work comments made by the Silicon Valley tone setters like Google, Amazon, Apple, Netflix [ setters ]. These and others are all hiring in the South Bay and are showing a heightened desire for newly constructed office space with walkable amenities and ample park. 
In Southern California, our Primestor portfolio, which caters to a largely Latino population in Los Angeles, remains among the top-performing group of shopping centers among all Federal centers nationwide in terms of rent collection and property operating income compared with pre-COVID levels. Big assets like Plaza El Segundo and The Point are recovering nicely and serve the beach cities of Manhattan, Formosa and Redondo Beaches, places which are even more attractive to live in than they were pre-COVID. 
So I guess a somewhat obvious conclusion here is that California is as big and complex an economy as any region can be, actually bigger and more complex than most countries. And as with every major market, varies greatly within the submarkets where the supply and demand characteristics of the specific real estate dictate performance. We've got some great real estate sale there. 
All right. A few other proactive comments before turning it over to Dan. While always a key part of our business plan, we've turned up the heat on the number and the scope of shopping center redevelopments and repositionings that are or about to be underway. A combined capital budget in excess of $75 million over 17 projects aimed at ensuring relevant best-in-class community-centric centers in a post-COVID environment. More gathering areas, more outdoor seating, more designated curbside pickup spots, better landscaping, covered walkways, you get the idea. Everything aimed at ensuring our properties are the consolidators in their given submarket. 
In terms of our developments, we're really looking forward to showing off the new CocoWalk when investors are back to traveling regularly. Today, tenants continue to open where the retail space is 98% and office space 82%, underleased or executed LOI. The initial market acceptance of this revitalized center at Coconut Grove has been phenomenal and should only get better over the next 12 months as more and more retailers open their doors. 
Heading north to Darien, Connecticut, we're very bullish about our mixed-use neighborhood that's well under construction here, especially given its perfect location for a hybrid New York City work model. For those of you who live near or are familiar with our project, you should start to be able to get a sense of what that mixed-use development is going to feel like as construction and leasing move forward as anticipated. 
Office leasing activity has picked up markedly this past quarter at 909 Rose -- Pike & Rose, where 75% of both POI and GLA at a 219,000 square foot office building is either under lease or executed LOI. Not only activity, but dealmaking feels so much more productive than it did just a few weeks ago. 
In Assembly Row, PUMA is just a couple of months away from opening their new U.S. headquarters and welcoming employees back to work. And we'll begin to market our -- and separately, we'll begin to market our residential project there in earnest this month. Like the [ CocoWalk ] Pike & Rose, office leasing activity has picked up here, too, but not to the same extent. The Boston Metropolitan area is poised for recovery, but clearly lagged behind the others by what feels like several weeks or a month. 
Okay. From developments and redevelopments to acquisitions. We closed on our first acquisition in 2021 last week in the form of Chesterbrook Shopping Center in the affluent first ring DC suburb of McLean, Virginia. We paid $26 million in initial [ 5 cap ] for an 80% controlling interest in this 83% leased Safeway-anchored center and with a market repositioning plan and up under market in-place rents, we expect strong short-term growth and significant value add. 
We're also under contract and in our due diligence period for several other acquisitions that, absent negative surprises, will close later in the year. I'm not ready to talk further about them at this point, but more to come here over the next few months. 
Okay. That's about all I have for my prepared remarks today. Let me turn it over to Dan, and we'll be happy to entertain your questions after that."
271305,709906352,2291318,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thank you, Don, and good morning -- good afternoon, everyone.

To echo Don's initial comments, we have been the beneficiary of the broad-based recovery that the entire open-air retail real estate industry has experienced in the first quarte",1277,"Thank you, Don, and good morning -- good afternoon, everyone. Good evening. 
To echo Don's initial comments, we have been the beneficiary of the broad-based recovery that the entire open-air retail real estate industry has experienced in the first quarter. We significantly outperformed the quarter, reporting FFO per share of $1.17, up 3% sequentially from 4Q and well ahead of our internal expectations. 
We went from the dark days of December and January, where government-mandated shutdowns in our markets impacted over 90% of Federal's assets and we experienced weaker consumer traffic and collections than prior months, to 90 days later, where, after another round of PPP supporting our tenants, successful vaccine rollout and a reopening of our markets, all make things seem somewhat sustainable. Given this increased stability, we were able to beat our internal forecast by higher revenues and POI, broadly from higher collections than forecast both in the current period and from prior periods as well; less fallout from small shop tenants than expected; higher term fees and percentage rent and forecast, offset by higher property level expenses, primarily due to snow. 
Positive trend in COVID-19 collectability reserves continues as we had just $14.8 million in the quarter, down 20% sequentially versus 4Q. We expect that progress to continue over the course of the year. $10 million of that amount is driven by our strategic decision to be more accommodative with our tenants. More on that in a moment. 
We continue to improve on collections, achieving 90% for the quarter, steady progress despite weakness in January due to the aforementioned shutdowns. Our strategic decision to be more accommodative to our tenants differentiates us from many of our peers. In our disclosure, you'll see negotiated abatements in the form of temporary percentage rent and other arrangements, totaling $10 million or about 5% of billed rent for the quarter. That accounts for roughly 50% of our uncollected rent. Those agreements are scheduled to burn off over the balance of the year and into 2022. 
Combined collections, deferrals and abatements totaled 96%, leaving about 4% of our billed monthly rents unresolved relative to the steady-state pre-COVID 1% to 2% low. 
Another area where we outperformed our forecast is occupancy. Our tenants have demonstrated surprising resiliency for a combination of better-than-expected renewal activity and fewer tenant failures. Our leased occupancy metric stands at 91.8% at quarter end, and our occupied metric dipped below 90% to 89.5%, both stronger levels than we predicted to start the year. Our leased-to-occupied spread has increased 230 basis points and represents roughly $20 million of PR upside in the future. But given the strong pace of leasing activity, my gut tells me that spread should grow in the coming quarters. 
While we still expect continued pressure on our occupancy over the next quarter or 2, we do not expect the trough to be as deep as previously feared as continued leasing activity and volumes we have achieved over the last 3 quarters, plus our strong forward leasing pipeline should set us up for a more pronounced growth in '22. 
Now to the balance sheet and an update on liquidity. We ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion of total available capital comprised of $780 million of cash and an undrawn $1 billion revolver. We amended our term loan in April, pushing the maturity out to 2024 with the option to extend through 2026. We reduced the spread from 135 to 80 basis points over LIBOR and paid down the loan balance to leave $300 million outstanding. 
We completed the sale for $20 million of our Grand Park Plaza land parcel to a regionally based townhome developer. Please note that we do have a participation interest here, which could provide some additional upside given the strength in the suburban DC housing market. 
We have further solidified our well-laddered maturity schedule with only $125 million of debt maturing between now and mid-2023, all which is secured and is earmarked for repayment from cash on hand. This will increase our unencumbered pool to 92% of EBITDA. 
And lastly, as we have done programmatically every year since 2011, we sold common equity through our ATM program, $124 million at a blended share price of $105 in start of the year. Our remaining to spend on our $1.2 billion in-process development pipeline stands at just over $360 million. As we have throughout the past year, we sit with significant dry powder. 
Now on to guidance for '21 and '22. Now please keep in mind before I start that there is still a high degree of uncertainty in our forecast given the continued impact of the pandemic on our business. But with that being said, we are providing 2021 guidance in a range of $4.54 to $4.70 per share. Despite a strong first quarter, some of that outperformance is not expected to be recurring. 
Let me be a bit more helpful. Think of 2Q roughly flat to 1Q at $1.15 to $1.20 per share. Now the second half of the year will be negatively impacted primarily from the delivery of our large residential project at Assembly Row due to the negative POI during lease-up as well as reduced capitalized interest. As a result, [ figure ] the third quarter at roughly $1.10 to $1.15, and the fourth quarter back towards the first half's run rate of $1.15 to $1.20, which gets you to the midpoint of our range at $4.62 per share, a $0.10 increase from the 2021 guidepost we provided on last quarter's call. 
Assumptions behind this guidance. Comparable growth of roughly 2% as we expect some choppiness over the next quarter or 2, and we do not expect to have term fees in 2021 at the same levels of 2020 or 2019, which were both north of $14 million. Please note that comparable growth as a metric continues to have limited utility in this environment. 
Collectability metrics should improve over the course of the year, but will not return to pre-COVID levels until sometime in '22. As discussed, we expect lower occupancy levels in the next quarter or 2 before stabilizing later in the year, but remain optimistic that it will not be as bad as previously viewed. Targeting a trough at 88% range for occupied percentage with a leased percentage remaining above 90%. 
G&A will average roughly $11 million to $12 million in the quarter. On the capital side, we project spend on development and redevelopment of roughly $350 million to $400 million. The contributions from our large development projects will be modestly negative in 2021 as POI from CocoWalk's lease-up will be more than offset by bringing online the Phase IIIs for both Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, including the aforementioned resi building, which, as I mentioned, are initially dilutive during lease-up. 
We project another $150 million of opportunistic equity issuance on our ATM over the course of the year, and as our custom, this guidance assumes no acquisitions or dispositions over the balance of '21. We will adjust those as we go. However, our recently acquired Chesterbrook shopping center, demographically strong McLean, Virginia is included in these numbers. 
For 2022, we are providing a range of $5.05 to $5.25, which represents close to double-digit FFO growth in 2022. This is being driven by lower COVID-19 collection challenges as deferrals are repaid and abatement agreements earn off, the expectation of growing occupancy levels back into the low 90s and stronger contributions from our development pipeline as leasing activity more meaningfully translates to POI. More detail on 2022 as we get further into the year. 
And with that, operator, Please open up the line for questions."

It's -- there's a number of things that have become really clear during COVID, from my perspective. And that is the migration that is so talked about is largely from the city to the first ring suburbs. And so when I sit, I see what is happening in the places that we're at, I know that we're going to continue to invest in those places for all the reasons that we felt good about them for all those years. 
So the first thing is, you should feel -- you should understand that Federal is very committed to the markets that we're in for future acquisitions. The second is -- it's an interesting concept. I've talked in the past about Arizona. I've talked in the past about South and West acquisitions. But you know what that's mostly about is the reality that for stuff that we want, and that will not change, it is the high-quality stuff that has leasing and redevelopment potential. 
We need a few more ponds to fish in, if you will, because we are in just 7 or 8 markets. And it is pretty clear that markets like Phoenix and Scottsdale, markets potentially like Dallas, maybe Atlanta, we'll see, certainly, South Florida have the similar characteristics as those markets that have worked real well for us. 
So the stuff that we've got tied up that I can't give you too much on, I can tell you one of those assets are in the existing markets that we're in, one of those markets is a new one in terms of the Southwest, as you might imagine. So I hope we get both of them over the transom there. 
But really what that's about is when you invested in Federal, you invest in Federal to look for those markets with high barriers to entry, lots of jobs, great education. That includes the ones we're in, and yes, it includes a few new ones, potentially over the next several years. So try and think about it that way."

Would rent slowing a bit lower actually be that bad of a thing given the significant spread to peers and, of course, acknowledging the quality? So I guess the question is, how do you look at balancing occupancy and rent growth in this emerging post-COVID environment?"
271305,709906352,2291318,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Well, it's a great question, Derek.

And as you think about it, the conversations about rents has to be talked about in the same conversation as productivity. When you think about what the occupancy cost is for a particular retailer, that retailer is looking to make money and create value. And that's going to be very dependent upon what it is that they do in top line, either on-site or in their total business as well as the cost structure throughout the whole business. 
So I know what I just said is obvious, but it feels like we sometimes so focus on the absolute rent number, we don't focus on the business that effectively is there that is creating value for that particular company's owners and shareholders. 
So from a rent perspective, I can tell you, I feel pretty darn good that we will actually have enhanced demand. We have seen enhanced demand at our properties. Now that doesn't mean you won't make accommodations, if you will, during COVID. We certainly will and have demonstrated that we'll do that, probably to a greater extent than others are willing to do that. But that's only because we have great faith in our properties going forward. 
So we're always going to try to get the best economic deal that we can that works for that particular tenant. The key is to find the right tenants, to find those tenants that are those that can do the volumes and those that cannot just pay the highest rents, that can do the volumes to create the synergies within a shopping center that make the whole, effectively, impacted by each of the parts. 
So that's not a -- I don't know how to answer your question in terms of is it so bad if rents rolled down. I don't think about it that way. We think about it as from a shopping center perspective, how do we make the overall total sales of that shopping center go up. And -- because if that happens, whether, again, it's online or a combination of online or in-store, if that happens, rent is a byproduct of that. It's not the leading indicator. 
So when you go for the leading indicator, it feels to me like you're competing in a business based on being the cheapest guy. That's not a business I want to have anything to do with money. That's no fun. I've got to be able to be the guy that you want to come to because you can make the most money. And if all you're looking at is cheap rents to be able to do that, I think it's pretty myopic."

But I don't need to know that as a landlord because it's not particularly germane to me as a landlord in the short period during COVID. But it's absolutely impacting. 
I bet you, most people who have either been to a restaurant, not even restaurants, to a store, and kind of seen the understaffing that persists right now and, in some cases, quality of the labor force, it's a problem. I would not candy coat that one bit. Now it's good to be the landlord effectively because we're talking about commitments for the long term, and I do not expect this to be persistent in terms of being able to find it. 
But right now, with unemployment where it is, with the state of mind that kind of -- the country has been in during this, I absolutely believe that there are numerous businesses, not just restaurants, that are struggling to find qualified help."

We've got lots of accommodative deals that will be burning off. We know that when they burn off, they will return to rent. Now hopefully, those tenants will be able to pay that full rent and continue to do that. We know that certainly, we've got development projects that are being delivered. Of course, when you deliver a big residential building, there's dilution associated with it. I mean we all know that. That's how it works on your way to creating a bunch of value there. 
We know that the volume of leasing that we've already done and rolling into what income stream that's going to produce is pretty predictable. And so kind of like I said on the last call, Alex, '22 for us is, in many respects, more predictable than it is in '21 for any particular period. And I think that, that still hangs out there. 
Now to the -- again, here comes the bridge from those comments to -- and therefore, we need to flow through the numbers of 2022 that we've laid out, I don't know how to get there.

And we get comfortable that for that period of time, we should be in that range. 
Lots of things can go wrong from there, and a few things could go right. So you're right. I mean, let me tell you, we're going be doing all we can to blow through those numbers.

It's actually going to be -- what we're focused on is on '22, we've got primary drivers being the 2 big buildings at Assembly. They will begin to contribute in 2022, but will not fully contribute until 2023. 
CocoWalk should begin to stabilize in 2022. And we did a fully -- a full run rate at some point over the course of the year, as should, at some point, the building here at Pike & Rose. I think that there should be probably contribution in and around an additional $10 million of additional incremental relative to '21 contribution over the course of the year. 
But Katy, your question is dead right. The -- if you think about us delivering -- Assembly is an easy one to understand, right? We're going to deliver this year a big residential building. The pace of lease-up, how you get through 500 units, is going to determine, in some respects, how quickly the dilution burns off when you start being accretive, what kind of rents we're getting, et cetera. And there's a lot of question around how that's going to work. 
I don't know that we're going to be doing 20 to 30 units, say, a month or we're going to be able to do 40 or 45 units a month and at what rent. So if you kind of roll that through a model, you've got a -- just from that big project, you've certainly got range. But our range for 2022 is way beyond that. It really has to include some basic assumptions on lease-up of the portfolio. 
As you know, as Dan said, we'll be at 88% or 89% later this year. We've got to get that back up to 92% or 93%. The pace by which that happens is going to very much determine that. But I do feel great, frankly, about the -- not only the direction that we're headed but because of the volume that we're doing and because of the progress we're making on the development, that while we can't be precise with respect to exactly how that income stream is going to come on, we certainly know what the direction of it is. And within a range that I actually think is pretty tight, given the fact that we're 9 to 20 -- 18 months out, I think it's pretty tight. 
And so all of those things considering, I think we got a pretty good -- can give you more visibility than we've been able to give you since the beginning of the pandemic."

But you know why we brought that up, and I spent so much time on that? So Berkes and I have been going back and forth on -- I'll send out an article to him that I read. He'll say it's only telling half the story and yell at me. 
We would -- we sit there and debate how important California is as a market today and where it's going to be tomorrow. What are we really seeing with respect to leasing demand? Is that changing? Is the state -- is everybody moving to Texas? How is this all really playing out? And we really came down to this very good understanding that the headlines are far more exaggerated than effectively the supply and demand characteristics of the markets that we're in that we can certainly talk about with knowledge because we're out there doing those leases. And as a result, the ability to find other places where we would like to continue to invest. 
We do have another one that we're looking at really, really closely in Southern California that I hope we can get over to pull over the transom because I think the long-term opportunity is amazing. 
So I wanted to go through that really as a headline buster, if you will. And I do think it's a great microcosm of -- and a predictor of what you will see as the Massachusetts economy opens back up. It is interesting. If you look at weather, so as you head north, you can say, okay, Pike & Rose is behind Florida, but ahead of Boston. Boston is behind Pike & Rose, and we can see where it's going relative to California. The warmer it gets, the nicer the weather, by far, it seems to be the biggest predictor of traffic levels and sales. 
Thank you, Michael. And we are friends."

The stabilized yield, I don't feel differently about. Might it take another year to get there? Sure. I mean, the greatest -- the best part of residential, and I'm sure you hear it on every residential call, is that it's the same thing as the worst part of residential for 1-year leases. A little bit less, a little bit more. 
So it's not like you build something in a great market but at the wrong time and you're stuck in purgatory forever. That happens on the retail side and certainly happens in the office side. 
And so I know today, it is, as we've talked about and as we've intimated here, it is our toughest market, from a residential perspective, to be able to make progress in. And that is where we're opening up a new project. So if there is less predictability in terms of that timing and where we go, I do believe we'll be where we said we'd be as -- upon stabilization, even if that stabilization is later than obviously, than it would have been pre-COVID. We'll have to see, we'll have to play that out. 
In terms of investing in residential in other places. Sure, we will. I still feel -- I feel very good about that at our mixed-use properties. Again, not stand-alone, but where they are at our mixed-use properties. The real question there is what are we going to do -- are we going to be able to make the numbers work with construction prices, which are absolutely, at this point in time, out of control. And whether that is a long-term phenomena or a short-term phenomena is to be seen. Clearly, supply chain of materials has been completely disrupted in the last year globally, and that impacts prices. So we have to see where that will go. 
But at Bala Cynwyd, for example, in our shopping center there outside of Philadelphia and Lower Merion Township, we're leasing up our small project, and we really want to do a small project there as a precursor to see what kind of demand we would have for a larger project that would include residential on the Lord & Taylor site that is there. One of the best pieces of the land in all -- in the whole Federal portfolio. And I am extremely bullish on what has the initial demand on -- even during COVID, of the small project that we did there, and on the township and the design process of what we're building. 
So it comes that -- we're an economic company. It comes down to can we make money? And can we add value? To the extent we can with residential in our existing properties, we will still do that."

I'd love either Jeff or Wendy to add on to my point, but -- to my comments. But a couple of things, Craig. The thing that keeps striking me throughout this process is how broad-based the leasing has been. I've been looking for places to say, okay, here's a category that is very active right now. And this other category is not doing deals. I'm not seeing that. I'm seeing this broad-based. 
Now what I know is the number of deals that you're seeing had some of the likely essential -- sorry, the nonessential, the lifestyle-type projects are particularly good. And I think that's a factor or a notion of, there's a -- I believe there is a groundswell that is becoming more and more accepted, that in these first-tier suburbs with places that are -- that can be more than just your shopping center that are effectively an integral part of your life are a place to be. 
So what we're really trying to do, and seen some really good success there, is we're getting new leases from tenants that have been not -- are new to market and we've seen that in a large way at Santana, I know Jeff can talk more about that. We've seen that in a huge way on the Pike & Rose, Village at Sherlington, First Row suburbs outside of Washington, D.C. for new food concepts. Certainly, for some gym concepts that have been newly capitalized along the way and even apparel. 
So this is about as broad as it's been. We certainly have grocery deals in there, a CVS deal in there along the way. But it's -- I'm most excited, to tell you the truth, not about the boxes. The boxes are fine, and they've got a lot of leverage and they're the national companies that will pay the rent and isn't that exciting? It's really exciting when you're killed by COVID, not particularly exciting going forward. And there's not a lot of growth in it. It is kind of what it is. 
I'm excited by the small shop potentials at consolidating places that are either mixed use or dominant -- in the dominant shopping centers in their markets because that's where I think there'll be value to add significantly over the next few years. Jeff or Wendy? Craig always asks the best questions."

And Craig, I appreciate the question because truth be told, with the amount of activity that we've had this quarter and what's bubbling up, I was a little eager to jump in, in terms of leasing. So I appreciate it. Very true, broad-based is what certainly we're seeing all over the east not just at the lifestyle centers, certainly, but our community centers, our neighborhood centers, our power centers. 
As Don said, we maintain a strong, steady and healthy level of anchor activity, which has been very good and supportive and kind of continuous. The spike had been on the smaller shops, and all the way from the mom-and-pops from Taco Bamba, which is a coveted taco player in Northern Virginia that just signed a deal with us in Congressional in Rockville, to Athleta, to Room & Board, to American Eagle to Gregorys Coffee who's joining us in Long Island. So new names. 
In addition, where we had strong tenants like a Starbucks, we're doing several deals with them where they're taking their focus on these first ring suburbs and they're investing and we're investing in creating some opportunities for them that would also maintain and provide a drive-through. 
So that's kind of what we've done for the quarter. In conjunction with that, what I'm also pretty excited about is what I see in the pipeline. And that is, again, broad-based all the way across our property formats and robust. So not just in renewals, but in net new deals. So I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing lately."

And again, I kind of think the straight line that took you from January to April, it's heavily weather-dependent, too. I mean, look, the issue is if you say, what do I worry about? I mean the government stimulus has clearly been helpful. There will be more to come. That's clearly helpful. 
But for businesses to be long term viable, those government restrictions have to go away and those businesses have to see if they can survive long term. That, to me, is still a question mark, right? You can't have a business that's 25% open, paying rent because the stimulus is allowing them to pay rent. But the stimulus goes away, you've got -- you can't make any money at 25% or 50%. 
So it's really -- that's what is yet to be seen. The encouraging side of that, Craig, and it's happened all the way through, is the traffic that has come out has been impressive. And so if these people have the opportunity to buy and to eat and to spend, I believe they will.

But longer term, I would expect to see better growth from the 25% nonessential part of the company than I would the 75%. But the 75% is critical to not only the stability of the company, but some level of growth so that the remaining 25 kind of takes that and builds on. That's how we look at it and see it over the next, let's say, 3 years. I don't know, Jeff or Wendy, if you want to add anything to that."

And on the second piece with regards to the cash, look, we're trying to keep a -- we've got spend that we're expecting this year. We've got some opportunities from an acquisition perspective in the quarter. We had $800 million and an undrawn line of credit. I mean, we have plenty of dry powder.

So the way we look at it, first of all, gosh, you're never going to convince me that merchandising is not among the most important things to do in a retail environment. We all know that even after the pandemic, there's too much -- there' too many choices for places to shop out there. We've got to be the one of choice if we're going to have any possibility of pushing rents, which we want to do. 
And so what we're -- so just like the $75 million that we're spending on redevelopment projects, which are all about much more than new rooms and parking lots, these are about places to hang so that you can be there in the morning, at night or long-term periods or short-term periods, to use this as part of your life. If you do that, then we -- the biggest part of that is getting the right tenants that let you have that type of lifestyle. What we've seen is great demand from a very wide variety of tenants like that. I think Jeff Berkes has talked about them. 
Now when you're talking about restaurants, is the credit great in a restaurant? No. Is the fact that 110,000 restaurants in the country went away during COVID a positive? Yes. Because supply and demand is reaching a much better balance in that very important category for the type of assets that we have. And I -- frankly, we're doubling down on restaurants. I love it. I love the idea of being the consolidator to have a place where those key gathering places have those choices. 
And when you go out and spend your time, I think you would agree. You may worry about who's going to fill a [ P.O. box ] if that business doesn't work 3 years from now, 5 years from now. But I think we've proven -- I think the country has proven that restaurants, outdoor dining is here to stay and effectively making -- we've got the places for that particular group. We also have the places, and we've been seeing it in terms of those digitally native brands that want only a few places to make sure that their brand is appropriately reflected. 
We've gotten more than our fair share of that, certainly at the Row property. So I think it's -- going back to where we started, there's a lot of -- it's not that there's a lot of choice, if you will, for any particular tenant. It is that the best tenants do seem to be coming, and we get a shot at them. And if we get a shot at them, we got a shot at creating the best place. And that's how we can push rents and create value. 
So from my perspective, very encouraged by what we've seen over the last 9 months, frankly, in terms of our places and demand at our places."

One thing that's different about this crisis than 2009-2010 and even if you dial back to the tech bubble bursting in Silicon Valley, right, when we're delivering first phase of Santana Row is there is a ridiculous amount of capital on the sidelines. And whether it's money to fund new restaurants or new restaurant concepts, it certainly wasn't around when we delivered Santana Row back in the day, which is why we had to invest in those restaurants ourselves. 
We're seeing this time just completely different availability of capital for new business and new business formation, particularly in the restaurant category. We're also seeing it in the fitness, and I would call it the healthcare and wellness segment, where we've seen a few new concepts come that are very well backed, very well financially backed. And a couple of fitness operators that didn't have legacy issues for whatever reason, that have invested a ridiculous amount of equity capital in the fitness sector. And really, a lot different, from that perspective, than prior downturns. 
So we're not relaxing our credit quality standards at all. And quite frankly, we haven't needed to."

As it relates to other tenants going forward, new coming in, it depends on the center and it depends on the concept. We sometimes don't mind, depending upon the capital allocation, if it's very limited or 0, where we can make an opportunity for a tenant, they can try us, we can try them and see how that marriage works. And we maintain control over the shopping center. So that can oftentimes be a win-win. 
So it really depends. I'm sounding like I'm not answering you, but it really depends on the operator. And it also depends what we're seeing -- more today than we've seen in the past, is if we had choices, right? If we have choices between 2 great operators, and that happens, it's happening more often than not now. So all those factors come into play as we continue to kind of emerge post-COVID."

271305,1673721097,2363396,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Well, thank you, Leah, and good afternoon, everybody. To quote Seinfeld's Frank Costanza, ""We're back baby,"" and it seems to me we're the real estate of choice. Let me just cut to the chase here and summarize where we are in 5 of these points. We killed i",1613,"Well, thank you, Leah, and good afternoon, everybody. To quote Seinfeld's Frank Costanza, ""We're back baby,"" and it seems to me we're the real estate of choice. Let me just cut to the chase here and summarize where we are in 5 of these points. We killed it in the second quarter at $1.41. We raised our 2021 total year guidance by over 10% at the midpoint. We raised our '22 guidance, the only retail real estate company to get '22 guidance, by the way, by 5% at the midpoint. We covered our dividend on a cash basis in the second quarter and raised it again for the 54th consecutive year. We had record leasing volume, more than we've ever done in any quarter in our 60-year history. 
So we'll put more meat on the bone for each of those points and others, but that's where this company is as we sit here in the first week of August of 2021, and we're feeling great about our market position. At $1.41 a share, we exceeded even our most optimistic internal forecast by $0.20 a share and we're up 83% over last year's worst COVID-impacted quarter, of course, was the second quarter. In a nutshell, we didn't anticipate the bounce back in nearly all facets of our business to be so fast and so strong, and we didn't anticipate some of the onetime deals that we were working on to be executed so quickly. 
We talked about the pent-up demand on the last call in the form of strong traffic and leasing demand, and that has continued unabated ever since, no pun intended. The quarterly financial impact of that optimistic consumer meant that we, one, collected more rent in the second quarter from prior periods than we thought; two, we had significantly less unpaid rent in the quarter than we thought; three, we had fewer tenant failures than we thought; and four, we have far higher percentage rent from COVID-modified deals than we thought. And as I said, we covered our dividend on an operating cash basis in the second quarter, way ahead of our expectations. 
Of course, all that means that we'll significantly raise 2021 earnings guidance and raise 2022 earnings guidance as well. As we've said all along, visibility toward '22 earnings was ironically better than 2021. That has proven to be the case, and Dan will talk you through guidance details in a few minutes. 
And while this quarter's earnings were as strong as they were, in large part, because of the collection of big rent dollars, both past and present, the real story here is the unprecedented amount of leasing that was done and what it means for the value of our real estate into the future. Our properties are in demand across the board. We did 124 comparable deals in the quarter, more than we've ever done in any quarter in our 60-year history for 558,000 square feet at an average rent of $37.34 per foot, 8% more rent than the deals they replaced. We signed another 9 noncomparable deals, mostly in our new developments at an average rent of $44.71 per foot. That's 570,000 square feet of space leased in 1 quarter alone, 25% more than our pre-COVID quarterly average. 
You might remember that we did almost as much last quarter 2. So when you put the 2 quarters together, the production in the first half of 2021 is both staggering and unprecedented cost. Big kudos here to our leasing, our legal, our support teams, nearly 1.1 million square feet at an average rent of $37 a foot, 8% more than the previous leases, growing through annual rent bumps over the next 8-plus years. 
That's really just the tip of the iceberg here. Another really interesting consideration is the breakdown of all that leasing between deals to renew tenants and deals with new tenants. Traditionally, 2/3 of the deals we do in any 1 period hovers around 2/3 renewals and 1/3 new tenants. Well, not in these post-COVID 6 months. It's actually nearly flipped, roughly 40% renewals and 60% new tenants. 
So what does that mean? And why is that important? Well, first, it means that we lost a heck of a lot of tenants during COVID. And since it costs more to put a new tenant in the space rather than renew an existing tenant, our current tenant capital is higher. On the face of it, that seems like bad news, but you got to dig deeper. Because what it also means is that our properties are in high demand from today's relevant and well-capitalized restaurants and retailers that are all trying to improve their sales productivity post-COVID through better real estate locations. We've always been picker than most in terms of the tenants we choose to merchandise our centers. When you couple that with the execution of the broad post-COVID property improvement plans that we've talked about over the last several quarters, that higher capital outlay will result significantly higher asset value tomorrow. 
I mean think about it in a post-COVID world. Major market's first-tier high-quality suburban shopping centers with more than a smattering of new post-COVID relevant tenants doing business in revitalized shopping centers and mixed-use properties focused more on outdoor seating, on a curbside pickup, on covered walkways and improved placemaking than ever before. Places that are more fresh, more dominant, more relevant in a myriad of ways in the communities they serve for years and years to come. The value of our real estate, net of capital, is going up, and the prospects appear to be better than they were before COVID. 
Also, consider that at quarter end, our portfolio was 92.7% leased, yet only 89.6% occupied. That 310 basis point spread, or nearly 780,000 square feet of space representing roughly $30 million in rent, is the largest spread we've had since 2005. You might remember how 2006 and 2007 turned out, which obviously bodes well for the future, assuming inevitable tenant fallout occurs at historical levels. And by the way, just 3 years ago, we were [ 95% ] 
Okay. Onward. I hope this also the major acquisition announcement that we made in the press release on June 7 that laid out the 4 deals that we closed during the quarter. Overall, we have an 80% interest in the combined income stream, Grossmont Shopping Center in Greater San Diego, Camelback Colonade and Hilton Village in Greater Phoenix and Chesterbrook Shopping Center in McLean, Virginia. Gross asset value of $407 million for 1.7 million square feet on 125 acres of land in prime locations in these markets, and we strongly believe that pricing today would far exceed what we negotiated in the middle of COVID. 
A presentation that we put out ahead of NAREIT and our investor NAREIT investor meetings in June focused on these acquisitions in depth, including a very unique potential redevelopment opportunity at Grossmont since we control virtually the entire 63-acre parcel from a tenant perspective in less than 5 years from now. Separately, we have another deal under contract currently that we hope to close on in the quarter -- this quarter. 
On the development side, residential and office leasing activity is also picking up on both coasts. It's really gratifying to see Pike & Rose quickly maturing, coming into its own and becoming the go-to place for lots of things in the region. In Montgomery County, Maryland, a county that's not doing a lot of office leasing these days, our Phase 3 office building, 909 Rose, is 77% leased with another 11% under executed LOIs. So nearly 90% committed at the point at rents in line with pro forma. That's strong in this office environment with mostly 2022 rent starts there. 
Third quarter up at Assembly Rows and now we received our certificate of occupancy for the retail portion and half of the units in [ Marcella, ] the 500-unit residential building that's part of the Phase 3 development. Tenants began moving in, in July and initial leasing pace is exceeding our expectations. 145 units are already currently leased at rates that approximate our lease-up underwriting and that seemed to be getting stronger with each week that passes. Assembly Rows is the mixed-use project in our portfolio that got hurt the most during COVID and took the longest to begin to bounce back, but now feels like it's recovering as fast as the others. 
Office leasing in the Puma-anchored building is also picking up with serious negotiations underway for the first time in over a year for a large portion of the remaining space. Nothing tangible yet but a good sign nonetheless. Similar situation in San Jose with our 375,000 square foot spec office building under construction and nearing completion remains on lease at the time being. At CocoWalk in Miami, all about getting tenants open as we're fully leased on the retail side and mostly leased on the office side. Tenant openings will continue through the remainder of this year. We look forward to hosting an investor tour in Coconut Grove early next March. More to come on that. 
In Darienne, Connecticut, construction and leasing are moving forward on time and on budget with the newly built Walgreens opening during the second quarter ahead of schedule. That's important because it makes way for the remainder of the demolition of the old shopping center and started a residential over retail component of the project. Goods happening up there, too. 
Let me pause there. stop. That's about only half of the prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Dan, and we'll be happy to entertain your questions after that."
271305,1673721097,2363396,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thank you, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. The unexpectedly strong results of $1.41 per share in the quarter, not only blew way 2020's year-over-year comparison, but was a 20-plus percent sequential gain over first [ 2 ] quarter and more than 20% abo",1415,"Thank you, Don, and good afternoon, everyone. 
The unexpectedly strong results of $1.41 per share in the quarter, not only blew way 2020's year-over-year comparison, but was a 20-plus percent sequential gain over first [ 2 ] quarter and more than 20% above our forecast and consensus. 
Given the big beat for the quarter, let me take a little time to put some color around the broad categories of outperformance that Don outlined. $0.13 of outperformance was driven by collection-related items. $0.06 of upside was from improved operations, with $0.05 for one-timers that were above our forecast, which collectively totaled the $0.24 beat versus our previous quarterly guidance. 
First, some detail on the $0.13 of upside from collection. Rent collection for the quarter, net of percentage rent, was almost 200 basis points ahead of expectations. Prior period rent collection was $7 million versus $4 million in our forecast. Our percentage rent for the quarter was almost $3 million above forecast, highlighting the strength in consumer traffic across the portfolio. 
Second, the $0.06 of operational outperformance was driven by our occupancy essentially staying flat, which was roughly 50 to 100 basis points better than we had expected. And improved hotel parking and specialty leasing revenues all exceeded forecast. 
The third category of $0.05 of onetime items above forecast were attributable to term fees, bankruptcy payments, loan reserve reversals and other miscellaneous payments all collectively exceeded our expectations. Please note that we do not expect the $1.41 to be the run rate for the balance of the year. Even $0.09 of the results are not expected to be recurring. And as Don mentioned, we are in the midst of delivering 500 units of residential at Assembly Row, which will be dilutive over the next few quarters, amongst other items, but we'll address that later when we get to guidance. 
Let's take some time and revisit collections. Our collectibility impact was more than cut in half to $6.4 million versus the $14.8 million we had in the first quarter on the strength of prior and current period collections, net of abatements. Rent collection in the quarter surged to 94% or 4% from the 90% level as reported on our first quarter call. With abatement and deferral agreements totaling 4% of billed rent, our unresolved rent now stands at just 2%. Of the $39 million of deferral agreements negotiated to date, $17 million have been repaid, representing about 90% of the scheduled deferral payments. The remaining repayments of $22 million are set to be paid back over the next few years. 
Elections for cash basis tenants improved substantially to roughly 80% for the quarter, up from 66% in the first quarter, a very strong signal. For occupancy, the continued pressure that we expected during the second quarter never really materialized as our tenants remain resilient. With the record-breaking leasing volumes across the portfolio, economic occupancy should steadily climb higher from this point driven by 310 basis points of spread between leased and occupied. that is embedded within the portfolio. 
Other strong leasing metrics to note, our small shop leased occupancy grew almost 200 basis points to 85.7% from 83.8%, a huge movement of that metric in a single quarter. And with respect to our lifestyle-oriented retail assets, whose performance was hardest hit during COVID, the spread between leased and occupied has grown to 440 basis points, driven by strong tenant demand and signaling a sustainable acceleration in this segment's recovery. 
Comparable property growth rebounded in a big way for the quarter, up 39%, an unprecedented result and obviously a record for Federal. But also no better evidence of the lack of relevance for this metric in the current environment, whether it's positive or negative. 
Now let me move over to guidance. We increased our guidance for both 2021 and 2022, taking 2021 up over 10% from a prior range of $4.54 to $4.70, up to a new range of $5.05 to $5.15 per share. This implies 13% year-over-year growth versus 2020 at the midpoint. And we are taking 2022 up 5% from a prior range of $5.05 to $5.25 to a new range of $5.30 to $5.50. 
Let's review some of the assumptions behind the improved outlook. For 2021, as I mentioned, the $1.41 per share results for the second quarter will not be a run rate for the balance of the year. As I mentioned, $0.09 of that 2Q results is onetime in nature. Term fees and bankruptcy-related income will not recur at the same level, and note that we have very few term fees in the pipeline currently. 
While current period collections should continue to climb modestly higher, prior period collections are forecasted to trail off for the remainder of the year. Also consider the previously mentioned dilution, roughly $0.03 per quarter from the residential and assembly and other developments that we'll be delivering in the second half. We also expect increased G&A and property level expenses of $0.02 per quarter as the cost of doing business has increased post COVID. However, we do expect accretion from the second quarter acquisitions of roughly $0.02 per quarter. So this revised guidance implies an increase in our FFO forecast for the second half of the year of '21 of almost 10%. 
For 2022, the improvement in outlook is driven by: One, a faster return to pre-COVID collection levels; two, a stronger occupancy due to the record leasing activity we've seen; three, a full year contribution for Grossmont, Chesterbrook and Phoenix; and then continued improvements and contributions from our development pipeline, although we continue to await tangible leasing at Santana West. It [ feels ] like that will not contribute to FFO until 2023. 
Also note that there is a level of pragmatism in these numbers. By all reports, the COVID variants are keeping the virus with us longer than we would like. And we are still anticipating some level of tenant fallout as PPP money and other government subsidies fall away and impact selected tenants' ability to operate profitably. And lastly, getting rents started on our record levels of new leasing activity will be a paramount focus for the operating teams here at Federal. 
Please note there is no benefit assumed in our guidance in either year from switching tenants back from a cash basis to accrual basis account. 
Finally, let's move to the balance sheet and an update on liquidity and leverage. On the heels of deploying over $325 million on acquisitions and over $100 million on new process development during the quarter, we continue to have ample total available liquidity of $1.3 billion, comprised of $300 million of cash and an undrawn $1 billion revolver. With $125 million of mortgage debt scheduled to be paid over the next 90 days, we will then have no maturing debt until 2023. 
And lastly, we continue to be opportunistic selling tactical amounts of common equity through our ATM program. We sold $140 million at a blended share price of about $117.50 for the quarter and a forward sales agreement in order to manage our liquidity over the next year. Our remaining spend on our $1.2 billion in-process development pipeline is down to $270 million with an additional $60 million remaining on our product improvement initiatives across the portfolio. 
Given the surge in our EBITDA, our leverage metrics returned to significantly stronger levels as well. Pro forma for our 2Q acquisitions and $175 million of forward equity under contract, our run rate for net debt to EBITDA is down to 6.2x. Our fixed charge coverage is back up to 3.7x. And our total liquidity [ lines ] pro forma to $1.5 [ billion ]. Our targeted leverage ratios remain in the mid-5x for net debt-to-EBITDA and above 4x for fixed charge coverage. 
Now before we get to Q&A, let me quickly mention in the wake of covering the dividend this quarter from AFFO, yesterday, our Board declared an increased quarterly dividend per share of $1.07, given the surge in traffic across the asset base, the resilience and quality of our sector-leading real estate portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the sound forward-looking decision-making and management, maintaining the dividend through another challenging economic cycle now looks like. This should provide federal shareholders with further peace of mind that with an investment in FRT comes a reliable, uninterrupted steady, stable stream of current income as part of their total return. 
And with that, operator, please open up the line for questions."

What I'm really kind of intrigued about and really speaks to the strength of the real estate is the kind of retailers who maybe have a little bit more of a conservative expansion program and they're selectively choosing best-in-class locations across the country doing very small increments of growth that really differentiate your property types.

That's been done in the first building and the building we're standing in an 909 Rows. Could there be enough demand here to effectively start another building in time? It's possible. So we're talking about that, looking at that. Could we find a big enough tenant that, that anchor is? I don't know, all that stuff is the kind of thought process that we go through in each of these big projects. 
Do we want to start a brand-new ground-up in the next year? I said no, we don't. We frankly have plenty to do on the existing ones that we have. And when you look at the acquisition trade-off, if you will, versus development, I think there was a window. And I think we jumped through that window during COVID, where that difference was really attractive and pointed you toward acquisitions. 
That's changed a little bit now. It's still early in the recovery. So we'll have to see how that plays out. But with us, it's not about turning 1, stick it on and the other one all, it's about adjusting based on what it is that we find. So I hope that's helpful in terms of where we'll be going forward.

But the -- when you see all the leasing that we've done, and it goes back a little bit to Craig's point, a lot of it has been small shop. And the small shop stuff tends to happen quicker effectively than the anchors. So that stuff should be starting to help us later in 2021 and a lot 2022. The anchors have a longer tail. And so there, you should see more benefit coming in '22 and even a few as far out as '23 there. But they are more focused towards -- or more weighted toward those small shop deals that do go faster. 
Now look, the difference between, obviously, new deals versus renewals, renewals are there right now and keep that income stream going. The new stuff that's coming in is in a lot of places, too, part and parcel of kind of our property improvement plans and our redevelopment plans. So as a result, you'll really see a really upgraded portfolio over the next few years as a result of this. 
And with regard to guidance, what's embedded there is, I think, some modest continued improvement through the end of the year. We should get back up above 90% occupied by year-end, and then probably over the course of -- 92% to get into probably somewhere above 92%.

If you took our portfolio today, and you said, all right, historically, this company has certainly been a 95% leased portfolio, and you took all of the capital that we've spent in development projects and to date, the acquisitions that have been made, et cetera, and other capital that's not yet producing income, and you simply said, ""All right. Finish up. Let's get this thing leased back up to 95%, whenever that happens. Let's do all that development with tenants full."" We'd be over $7 a share.

So with respect to where we are now, I'm going to say the same thing to you. We've done the best we can to kind of lay out where we are, lay out the probabilities of hitting our numbers. I don't know what Delta does. I don't know what the situation -- where the situation goes in the country, the way we are -- the way we move things through. But I do know when you sit and you look at our forecasting and what it is that we see happening, we are clearly improving faster than we thought we were before. 
Will that happen again? I don't know. Maybe I got to get you in here to do the forecast for the company. But that's -- I don't have a good answer beyond that for you."

So I mean that's the point is I think I've answered my own question, but you've answered it. 
So the next question is, as far as the new -- the -- you said that 60% of the people coming in to your portfolio are new tenants, are those simply relocations from other centers? Are they new to market? Are they tenants looking to expand? Like just a little bit more color on what that new demand is."

The new demand is very broad-based. It's all of the things that you said and more. And frankly, Wendy kind of touched it when she was talking about some of these tenants who are well-capitalized tenants that are -- they're not volume guys. They're not trying to do 250, 300 stores, 500 stores, et cetera. They are selectively picking locations to have brick-and-mortar outfits that supplement their online businesses, et cetera. 
We're getting our fair -- more than our fair share of those type of tenants. That's a real positive thing. They're new to market in a lot of cases. They're effective. They're newly capitalized in a lot of cases. 
One of the things that is most important here to think through is that obviously, COVID cleaned out weaker tenants, and they did that earlier. That's the April and May and June, July of 2020. And you know that list by heart. The notion though of what happened over the next year and who you want to have in your centers, particularly if you're spending $10 million and $12 million and $8 million on a center for a property improvement plan, you want new blood in the retail because you can't just have a nice place to sit outside the same old tenants that were pre-COVID and average or are average now because of their sales. 
So you're seeing -- we've said it from the beginning that the demand is broad-based and the demand is largely tenants trying to improve the real estate locations that they're in. Why? Because they're trying to improve the sales. That it is that they do, which is why they can pay the rents that we charge. It's all about that relationship."

Yes, we are likely to increase. We are successful with an acquisition, we'll bump guidance slightly from that perspective. But it's all the reason -- all the outperformance we had, we're expecting term fees. We had $3.4 million net in the quarter versus $1.8 million net last year.

In terms of the -- and in both of those quarters, there were still deals, obviously, that were rolled down. There were other deals that were rolled up in a more significant way. That's basically what happens in most quarters. There is a mixture of those 2 things. The probability that it will stay in those single-digit numbers is highest. That's where we're most comfortable effectively in kind of running -- pushing rents and seeing what we can do in any 1 period.

And Wendy, please feel free to add or anybody that wants that. I mean, look, there is -- if you're just be a retailer for a minute, be a restaurant for a minute and have gone through what just happened in this country over the last 18 months. And frankly, what was happening, the pressures that were on you for the 3 and 4, 5 years before that. And so here you are now, in many cases, recapitalize, in many cases, with a different level of competition than you had before. And you're in a position where you can reset. And effectively, that's what's happening. If you've got the chance -- I mean, [indiscernible] can tell you, man, if you sit on Rockville Pike in 1 of the 4 or 5 shopping centers that all aim for different parts of the consumer on Rockville Pipe that we own, there have been tenants that have been trying to get on the Pike for years and years in the right type of -- the right type of centers. We've been over 95% leased for a Rockville Pipe for much, if not all, of that time, except for the last 15 months. There is an opportunity that has not been here. So there's an opportunity to improve your real estate in a very, very well-located, first-tie suburb of major cities, and you've got a landlord who is openly and anxiously improving those shopping centers for a post-COVID environment, why would you not choose to go there? Where would you choose to go instead? Because at the end of the day, it's not about the rent. It's about the profit there. And effectively, higher sales, better margins, a more affluent customer in better real estate with a landlord that's investing side-by-side with you, seems to -- and you're in there with a new balance sheet, seems to be a pretty smart choice for a lot of tenants, including and especially those small shop tenants that Craig Schmidt was referring to before and that Wendy went through in detail. 
So I hope that's helpful. That's what we see happening in the markets that we're in, at the properties that we're in. That's why the investment in the properties, to be post-COVID investments are so important to a retailer. They've got to be partners with their landlord."

And that is a complex thing to do. In a lot of ways, it takes some time. So that's part of what you're hearing from those tenants also is the lead time to be able to lock up space for a true post-COVID environment."

And the same applies to Assembly Row. 
Now at Pike & Rose, are we anywhere near being able to answer your specific questions in terms of the economics on it, whether it's viable, does it make any sense? No, we're not. We're in that early exploratory phase, but we're in the early exploratory phase because we believe there are assumptions potentially there. I've got nothing more to say about that at this point other than the entitlements in this -- on this 27 acres could certainly be used for that use and similarly at Assembly Row.

But that -- it was so strong in all of them, that, that we had to -- we just feel really good about talking about it. 
The only thing I would say is during that period of time, this second quarter, weather had a lot to do with it. So Boston felt like it was a few weeks behind New York, which felt like it was a few weeks behind Washington, D.C., et cetera. That's the -- as that weather changed and as those restrictions came off, holy cap, was there pent-up demand. 
And that has -- that's continued. It's interesting. We're talking a little bit -- I'm going off on a little bit of tangent, but you gave me an opportunity, so I'll do it. When you think about the Delta variant itself and what's going to happen with respect to it. Obviously, we don't know. But we do know a few things. The open-air format is fantastic. And in the markets where we're at, which has been a big disadvantage as they all closed down in 2020, these are markets where the vaccine rates are among the highest in the country. They are also the markets, and this is important, where mask wearing is accepted. There's not a stigma to it otherwise. So the notion, like we see a lot of people wearing masks at our shopping centers and our properties, but they're shopping just fine because they're comfortable with that. 
So I don't know how it's going to play out, but I do like the fact that really in these markets, both East and West Coast, that the vaccine rates are among the highest in the country because I think that's an important thing for the long term of this mess we're in."

And what that means with them is care about who they're merchandising next to care about whether they're investing in the properties to effectively attract customers with a place-making perspective, a curbside pickup. And I mean curbside pickup, I cannot tell you how many tenants ask about it. Whether they use it or not, that's another question. But it's a critical thing to figure out whether the landlord is in it with them in trying to make them successful as businesses. If you're a private company that is undercapitalized, and I've got to make that distinction because the well-capitalized private company, and there's a bunch of them that you and I know that are not disadvantaged at all, and then darn good at what they do. But if you are a private company who is undercapitalized and trying to kind of milk the cash flow from the existing shopping center, I think you're in a serious disadvantage post COVID.

Let me just cut to the chase here and summarize where we are in 5 of these points. We killed it in the second quarter at $1.41. We raised our 2021 total year guidance by over 10% at the midpoint. We raised our '22 guidance, the only retail real estate company to give '22 guidance, by the way, by 5% at the midpoint. We covered our dividend on a cash basis in the second quarter and raised it again for the 54th consecutive year. We had record leasing volume, more than we've ever done in any quarter in our 60-year history.
So we'll put more meat on the bone for each of those points and others, but that's where this company is as we sit here in the first week of August of 2021, and we're feeling great about our market position. At $1.41 a share, we exceeded even our most optimistic internal forecast by $0.20 a share and we're up 83% over last year's worst COVID-impacted quarter, of course, was the second quarter. In a nutshell, we didn't anticipate the bounce back in nearly all facets of our business to be so fast and so strong, and we didn't anticipate some of the onetime deals that we were working on to be executed so quickly.
We talked about the pent-up demand on the last call in the form of strong traffic and leasing demand, and that has continued unabated ever since, no pun intended. The quarterly financial impact of that optimistic consumer meant that we, one, collected more rent in the second quarter from prior periods than we thought; two, we had significantly less unpaid rent in the quarter than we thought; three, we had fewer tenant failures than we thought; and four, we have far higher percentage rent from COVID-modified deals than we thought. And as I said, we covered our dividend on an operating cash basis in the second quarter way ahead of our expectations.
Of course, all that means that we'll significantly raise 2021 earnings guidance and raise 2022 earnings guidance as well. As we've said all along, visibility toward '22 earnings was ironically better than 2021. That has proven to be the case, and Dan will talk you through guidance details in a few minutes.
And while this quarter's earnings were as strong as they were, in large part, because of the collection of big rent dollars, both past and present, the real story here is the unprecedented amount of leasing that was done and what it means for the value of our real estate into the future. Our properties are in demand across the board. We did 124 comparable deals in the quarter, more than we've ever done in any quarter in our 60-year history, for 558,000 square feet at an average rent of $37.34 per foot, 8% more rent than the deals they replaced. We signed another 9 noncomparable deals, mostly in our new developments at an average rent of $44.71 per foot. That's 570,000 square feet of space leased in 1 quarter alone, 25% more than our pre-COVID quarterly average.
You might remember that we did almost as much last quarter, too. So when you put the 2 quarters together, the production in the first half of 2021 is both staggering and unprecedented for us. Big kudos here to our leasing, our legal, our support teams, nearly 1.1 million square feet at an average rent of $37 a foot, 8% more than the previous leases, growing through annual rent bumps over the next 8-plus years.
That's really just the tip of the iceberg here. Another really interesting consideration is the breakdown of all that leasing between deals to renew tenants and deals with new tenants. Traditionally, 2/3 of the deals we do in any 1 period hovers around 2/3 renewals and 1/3 new tenants. Well, not in these post-COVID 6 months. It's actually nearly flipped, roughly 40% renewals and 60% new tenants.
So what does that mean? And why is that important? Well, first, it means that we lost a heck of a lot of tenants during COVID. And since it costs more to put a new tenant in the space rather than renew an existing tenant, our current tenant capital is higher. On the face of it, that seems like bad news, but you got to dig deeper. Because what it also means is that our properties are in high demand from today's relevant and well-capitalized restaurants and retailers that are all trying to improve their sales productivity post-COVID through better real estate locations. We've always been pickier than most in terms of the tenants we choose to merchandise our centers. When you couple that with the execution of the broad post-COVID property improvement plans that we've talked about over the last several quarters, that higher capital outlay will result significantly higher asset value tomorrow.
I mean think about it in a post-COVID world. Major market's first-tier high-quality suburban shopping centers with more than a smattering of new post-COVID relevant tenants doing business in revitalized shopping centers and mixed-use properties focused more on outdoor seating, on curbside pickup, on covered walkways and improve placemaking than ever before. Places that are more fresh, more dominant, more relevant in a myriad of ways in the communities they serve for years and years to come. The value of our real estate, net of capital, is going up, and the prospects appear to be better than they were before COVID.
Also, consider that at quarter end, our portfolio was 92.7% leased, yet only 89.6% occupied. That 310 basis point spread, or nearly 780,000 square feet of space representing roughly $30 million in rent, is the largest spread we've had since 2005. You might remember how 2006 and 2007 turned out, which obviously bodes well for the future, assuming inevitable tenant fallout occurs at historical levels. And by the way, just 3 years ago, we were 95% leased.
Okay. Onward. I hope you saw also the major acquisition announcement that we made in the press release on June 7 that laid out the 4 deals that we closed during the quarter. Overall, we have an 80% interest in the combined income stream, Grossmont Shopping Center in Greater San Diego, Camelback Colonnade and Hilton Village in Greater Phoenix and Chesterbrook Shopping Center in McLean, Virginia. Gross asset value of $407 million for 1.7 million square feet on 125 acres of land in prime locations in these markets, and we strongly believe that pricing today would far exceed what we negotiated in the middle of COVID.
A presentation that we put out ahead of NAREIT and our investor -- NAREIT investor meetings in June focused on these acquisitions in depth, including the very unique potential redevelopment opportunity at Grossmont since we control virtually the entire 63-acre parcel from a tenant perspective in less than 5 years from now. Separately, we have another deal under contract currently that we hope to close on in the quarter -- this quarter.
On the development side, residential and office leasing activity is also picking up on both coasts. It's really gratifying to see Pike & Rose quickly maturing, coming into its own and becoming the go-to place for lots of things in the region. In Montgomery County, Maryland, a county that's not doing a lot of office leasing these days, our Phase 3 office building, 909 Rose, is 77% leased with another 11% under executed LOIs. So nearly 90% committed at the point at rents in line with pro forma. That's strong in this office environment with mostly 2022 rent starts there.
Big quarter up at Assembly Row in that we received our certificate of occupancy for the retail portion and half of the units in Miscela, the 500-unit residential building that's part of the Phase 3 development. Tenants began moving in, in July, and initial leasing pace is exceeding our expectations. 145 units are already currently leased at rates that approximate our lease-up underwriting, and that seemed to be getting stronger with each week that passes. Assembly Row is the mixed-use project in our portfolio that got hurt the most during COVID and took the longest to begin to bounce back, but now it feels like it's recovering as fast as the others.
Office leasing in the PUMA-anchored building is also picking up, with serious negotiations underway for the first time in over a year for a large portion of the remaining space. Nothing tangible yet but a good sign, nonetheless. Similar situation in San Jose with our 375,000 square foot spec office building under construction and nearing completion, remains unleased for the time being. And at CocoWalk in Miami, it's all about getting tenants open as we're fully leased on the retail side and mostly leased on the office side. Tenant openings will continue through the remainder of this year. We look forward to hosting an investor tour in Coconut Grove early next March. More to come on that.
In Darien, Connecticut, construction and leasing are moving forward on time and on budget with the newly built Walgreens opening during the second quarter ahead of schedule. That's important because it makes way for the remainder of the demolition of the old shopping center and start of the residential over retail component of the project. Good stuff happening up there, too.
Let me pause there, stop. That's about all I have for the prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Dan, and we'll be happy to entertain your questions after that."

The unexpectedly strong results of $1.41 per share in the quarter, not only blew way 2020's year-over-year comparison, but was a 20-plus percent sequential gain over first quarter and more than 20% above our forecast and consensus.
Given the big beat for the quarter, let me take a little time to put some color around the broad categories of outperformance that Don outlined. $0.13 of outperformance was driven by collection-related items. $0.06 of upside was from improved operations, with $0.05 from one-timers that were above our forecast, which collectively totaled the $0.24 beat versus our previous quarterly guidance.
First, some detail on the $0.13 of upside from collection. Rent collection for the quarter, net of percentage rent, was almost 200 basis points ahead of expectations. Prior period rent collection was $7 million versus $4 million in our forecast. Our percentage rent for the quarter was almost $3 million above forecast, highlighting the strength in consumer traffic across the portfolio.
Second, the $0.06 of operational outperformance was driven by our occupancy essentially staying flat, which was roughly 50 to 100 basis points better than we had expected. And improved hotel parking and specialty leasing revenues all exceeded forecast.
The third category of $0.05 of onetime items above forecast were attributable to term fees, bankruptcy payments, loan reserve reversals and other miscellaneous payments all collectively exceeded our expectations. Please note that we do not expect the $1.41 to be the run rate for the balance of the year. Even $0.09 of the results are not expected to be recurring. And as Don mentioned, we are in the midst of delivering 500 units of residential at Assembly Row, which will be dilutive over the next few quarters, amongst other items, but we'll address that later when we get to guidance.
Let's take some time and revisit collections. Our collectability's impact was more than cut in half to $6.4 million versus the $14.8 million we had in the first quarter on the strength of prior and current period collections, net of abatements. Rent collection in the quarter surged to 94% or 4% from the 90% level as reported on our first quarter call. With abatements and deferral agreements totaling 4% of billed rent, our unresolved rent now stands at just 2%. Of the $39 million of deferral agreements negotiated to date, $17 million have been repaid, representing about 90% of the scheduled deferral payments. The remaining repayments of $22 million are set to be paid back over the next few years.
Elections for cash basis tenants improved substantially to roughly 80% for the quarter, up from 66% in the first quarter, a very strong signal. For occupancy, the continued pressure that we expected during the second quarter never really materialized as our tenants remained resilient. With the record-breaking leasing volumes across the portfolio, economic occupancy should steadily climb higher from this point driven by 310 basis points of spread between leased and occupied that is embedded within the portfolio.
Other strong leasing metrics to note, our small shop leased occupancy grew almost 200 basis points to 85.7% from 83.8%, a huge movement for that metric in a single quarter. And with respect to our lifestyle-oriented retail assets, whose performance was hardest hit during COVID, the spread between leased and occupied has grown to 440 basis points, driven by strong tenant demand and signaling a sustainable acceleration in this segment's recovery.
Comparable property growth rebounded in a big way for the quarter, up 39%, an unprecedented result and obviously, a record for Federal. But also no better evidence of a lack of relevance for this metric in the current environment, whether it's positive or negative.
Now let me move to guidance. We increased our guidance for both 2021 and 2022, taking 2021 up over 10% from a prior range of $4.54 to $4.70, up to a new range of $5.05 to $5.15 per share. This implies 13% year-over-year growth versus 2020 at the midpoint. And we are taking 2022 up 5% from a prior range of $5.05 to $5.25 to a new range of $5.30 to $5.50.
Let's review some of the assumptions behind the improved outlook. For 2021, as I mentioned, the $1.41 per share results for the second quarter will not be a run rate for the balance of the year. As I mentioned, $0.09 of that 2Q results is onetime in nature. Term fees and bankruptcy-related income will not recur at the same level, and note that we have very few term fees in the pipeline currently.
While current period collections should continue to climb modestly higher, prior period collections are forecasted to trail off for the remainder of the year. Also consider the previously mentioned dilution, roughly $0.03 per quarter from the residential at Assembly and other developments that we'll be delivering in the second half. We also expect increased G&A and property level expenses of $0.02 per quarter as the cost of doing business has increased post COVID. However, we do expect accretion from the second quarter acquisitions of roughly $0.02 per quarter. So this revised guidance implies an increase in our FFO forecast for the second half of the year of '21 of almost 10%.
For 2022, the improvement in outlook is driven by: One, a faster return to pre-COVID collection levels; two, a stronger occupancy due to the record leasing activity we've seen; three, a full year contribution for Grossmont, Chesterbrook and Phoenix; and then continued improvements and contributions from our development pipeline, although we continue to await tangible leasing at Santana West. It feels like that will not contribute to FFO until 2023.
Also note that there is a level of pragmatism in these numbers. By all reports, the COVID variants are keeping the virus with us longer than we would like. And we are still anticipating some level of tenant fallout as PPP money and other government subsidies fall away in impact-selected tenants' ability to operate profitably. And lastly, getting rents started on our record levels of new leasing activity will be a paramount focus for the operating teams here at Federal.
Please note there is no benefit assumed in our guidance in either year from switching tenants back from a cash basis to accrual basis account.
Finally, let's move to the balance sheet and an update on liquidity and leverage. On the heels of deploying over $325 million on acquisitions and over $100 million on new process development during the quarter, we continue to have ample total available liquidity of $1.3 billion, comprised of $300 million of cash and an undrawn $1 billion revolver. With $125 million of mortgage debt scheduled to be paid over the next 90 days, we will then have no maturing debt until 2023.
And lastly, we continue to be opportunistic selling tactical amounts of common equity through our ATM program. We sold $140 million at a blended share price of about $117.50 for the quarter and a forward sales agreement in order to manage our liquidity over the next year. Our remaining spend on our $1.2 billion in-process development pipeline is down to $270 million with an additional $60 million remaining on our product improvement initiatives across the portfolio.
Given the surge in our EBITDA, our leverage metrics returned to significantly stronger levels as well. Pro forma for our 2Q acquisitions and $175 million of forward equity under contract, our run rate for net debt to EBITDA is down to 6.2x. Our fixed charge coverage is back up to 3.7x. And our total liquidity climbs pro forma to $1.5 billion. Our targeted leverage ratios remain in the mid-5x for net debt-to-EBITDA and above 4x for fixed charge coverage.
Now before we get to Q&A, let me quickly mention that in the wake of covering the dividend this quarter from AFFO, yesterday, our Board declared an increased quarterly dividend per share of $1.07. Given the surge in traffic across the asset base, the resilience and quality of our sector-leading real estate portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the sound forward-looking decision-making and management, maintaining the dividend through another challenging economic cycle now looks likely. This should provide Federal shareholders with further peace of mind that with an investment in FRT comes a reliable, uninterrupted, steady, stable stream of current income as part of their total return.
And with that, operator, please open up the line for questions."

A lot of demand for our properties. Very broad-based between all of our property levels, and we continue to do deals with those best-in-class partners who have always been on our small shop side, whether it's Nike or Athleta, Starbucks, Ulta, to name a few.
What I'm really kind of intrigued about and really speaks to the strength of the real estate is the kind of retailers who maybe have a little bit more of a conservative expansion program, and they're selectively choosing best-in-class locations across the country doing very small increments of growth that really differentiate your property types.

When you look at a place like Pike & Rose, for example, this is a property that we're really, really happy with the office leasing that's been done in the first building, in the building we're standing in an 909 Rose. Could there be enough demand here to effectively start another building in time? It's possible. So we're talking about that, looking at that. Could we find a big-enough tenant that could anchor it? I don't know, all that stuff is the kind of thought process that we go through in each of these big projects.
Do we want to start a brand-new ground-up in the next year? I said no, we don't. We frankly have plenty to do on the existing ones that we have. And when you look at the acquisition trade-off, if you will, versus development, I think there was a window. And I think we jumped through that window during COVID where that difference was really attractive and pointed you toward acquisitions.
That's changed a little bit now. It's still early in the recovery. So we'll have to see how that plays out. But with us, it's not about turning one stick at on and the other one off, it's about adjusting based on what it is that we find. So I hope that's helpful in terms of where we'll be going forward.

If you took our portfolio today, and you said, all right, historically, this company has certainly been a 95% leased portfolio, and you took all of the capital that we've spent in development projects to date and acquisitions that have been made, et cetera, and other capital that's not yet producing income, and you simply said, ""All right. Finish up. Let's get this thing leased back up to 95%, whenever that happens. Let's get all that development with tenants full."" We'd be over $7 a share.

We've certainly been hit by COVID, obviously, delayed in terms of -- and certainly in the markets and the asset types that we have all the way through even more so.

So I mean that's the point is I think I've answered my own question, but you've answered it.
So the next question is, as far as the new -- the -- you said that 60% of the people coming in to your portfolio are new tenants. Are those simply relocations from other centers? Are they new to market? Are they tenants looking to expand? Like, just a little bit more color on what that new demand is."

The new demand is very broad-based. It's all of the things that you said and more. And frankly, Wendy kind of touched it when she was talking about some of these tenants who are well-capitalized tenants that are not -- they're not volume guys. They're not trying to do 250, 300 stores, 500 stores, et cetera. They are selectively picking locations to have brick-and-mortar outfits that supplement their online businesses, et cetera. We're getting our fair -- more than our fair share of those type of tenants. That's a real positive thing. They're new to market in a lot of cases. They're effective. They're newly capitalized in a lot of cases.
One of the things that is most important here to think through is that obviously, COVID cleaned out weaker tenants, and they did that earlier. That's the April and May and June and July of 2020. And you know that list by heart. The notion though of what happened over the next year and who you want to have in your centers, particularly if you're spending $10 million and $12 million and $8 million on a center for a property improvement plan, you want new blood in the retail because you can't just have a nice place to sit outside the same old tenants that were pre-COVID and average or are average now because of their sales.
So you're seeing -- we've said it from the beginning that the demand is broad-based and the demand is largely tenants trying to improve the real estate locations that they're in. Why? Because they're trying to improve the sales that it is that they do, which is why they can pay the rents that we charge. It's all about that relationship."

Yes, we are likely to increase -- we are successful with an acquisition, we'll bump guidance slightly from that perspective. But it's all the reason -- all the outperformance we had. We're expecting term fees. We had $3.4 million net in the quarter versus $1.8 million net last year. We're not expecting -- we're expecting maybe $1 million this quarter.

In terms of the -- and in both of those quarters, there were still deals, obviously, that were rolled down. There were other deals that were rolled up in a more significant way. That's basically what happens in most quarters. There is a mixture of those 2 things. The probability that it will stay in those single-digit numbers is highest. That's where we're most comfortable effectively in kind of running -- pushing rents and seeing what we can do in any one period.
And again, that it definitely, definitely depends on the mix of any particular quarter, which you don't get in a bigger company.

And Wendy, please feel free to add or Jeff, anybody that wants that. I mean, look, there is -- if you're -- just be a retailer for a minute, be a restaurant for a minute and have gone through what just happened in this country over the last 18 months. And frankly, what was happening, the pressures that were on you for the 3 and 4, 5 years before that.
And so here you are now, in many cases, recapitalized; in many cases, with a different level of competition than you had before. And you're in a position where you can reset. And effectively, that's what's happening. If you've got the chance -- I mean, Wendy can tell you, man, if you sit on Rockville Pike in 1 of the 4 or 5 shopping centers that all aim for different parts of the consumer on Rockville Pike that we own, there have been tenants that have been trying to get on to Pike for years and years in the right type of -- the right type of centers.
We've been over 95% leased for Rockville Pike for much, if not all, of that time, except for the last 15 months. There is an opportunity that has not been here. So there's an opportunity to improve your real estate in a very, very well-located first-tier suburb of major cities, and you've got a landlord who is openly and anxiously improving those shopping centers for a post-COVID environment, why would you not choose to go there? Where would you choose to go instead?
Because at the end of the day, it's not about the rent. It's about the profit there. And effectively, higher sales, better margins, a more affluent customer, in better real estate, with a landlord that's investing side-by-side with you seems to be -- and you're in there with a new balance sheet, seems to be a pretty smart choice for a lot of tenants, including and especially those small shop tenants that Craig Schmidt was referring to before and that Wendy went through in detail.
So I hope that's helpful. That's what we see happening in the markets that we're in, at the properties that we're in. That's why the investment in the properties to be post-COVID investments are so important to a retailer. They've got to be partners with their landlord."

And then kind of alongside that is also your ABR under cash basis, looks like it went up, call it, $10 million quarter-to-quarter. Is that predominantly new deals? Or are those legacy leases moved to cash? Just give me a hand on that?"

And the same applies to Assembly Row.
Now at Pike & Rose, are we anywhere near being able to answer your specific questions in terms of the economics on it, whether it's viable, does it make any sense? No, we're not. We're in that early exploratory phase, but we're in the early exploratory phase because we believe there is something potentially there.

But that -- it was so strong in all of them, that we had to -- we just feel really good about talking about it.
The only thing I would say is during that period of time, this second quarter, weather had a lot to do with it. So Boston felt like it was a few weeks behind New York, which felt like it was a few weeks behind Washington, D.C., et cetera. That's the -- as that weather changed and as those restrictions came off, holy cow, was there pent-up demand. And that has -- that's continued.
It's interesting. We're talking a little bit -- I'm going off on a little bit of tangent, but you gave me an opportunity, so I'll do it. When you think about the Delta variant itself and what's going to happen with respect to it. Obviously, we don't know. But we do know a few things. The open-air format is fantastic. And in the markets where we're at, which has been a big disadvantage as they all closed down in 2020, these are markets where the vaccine rates are among the highest in the country.
They're also the markets, and this is important, where mask wearing is accepted. There's not a stigma to it otherwise. So the notion, like, we see a lot of people wearing masks at our shopping centers and our properties, but they're shopping just fine because they're comfortable with that. So I don't know how it's going to play out, but I do like the fact that, really, in these markets, both East and West Coast, that the vaccine rates are among the highest in the country because I think that's an important thing for the long term of this mess we're in."

I mean -- and it kind of ties back to what I was saying before in terms of retailers making longer-term investments. They're trying to set themselves up for the next decade post COVID, and they want to be with landlords who are with them. And what that means with them is care about who they're merchandising next to, care about whether they're investing in the properties to effectively attract customers with a placemaking perspective, a curbside pickup.
And I mean curbside pickup, I cannot tell you how many tenants ask about it. Whether they use it or not, that's another question. But it's a critical thing to figure out whether the landlord is in it with them in trying to make them successful as businesses. If you're a private company that is undercapitalized, and I've got to make that distinction because a well-capitalized private company, and there's a bunch of them that you and I know that are not disadvantaged at all, and then darn good at what they do.
But if you are a private company who is undercapitalized and trying to kind of milk the cash flow from the existing shopping center, I think you're in a serious disadvantage post-COVID. And so that -- depending upon the marketplace, who's in the marketplace, who's willing to invest or not.

But it's not -- no, I don't -- I don't see it being extra deals, if you will, that are going to wind up with closeouts in the old places down the road in any significant way. At least I don't see it that way. I don't know, Wendy's shaking her head."

We like those because we will come in and put in the capital in a great location and show virtually immediate results in leasing or very strong results in the short term in leasing.

To quote Seinfeld's Frank Constanza, ""We're back baby,"" and it seems to me we're the real estate of choice. Let me just cut to the chase here and summarize where we are in 5 of these points. We killed",1617,"Well, thank you, Leah, and good afternoon, everybody. To quote Seinfeld's Frank Constanza, ""We're back baby,"" and it seems to me we're the real estate of choice. Let me just cut to the chase here and summarize where we are in 5 of these points. We killed it in the second quarter at $1.41. We raised our 2021 total year guidance by over 10% at the midpoint. We raised our '22 guidance, the only retail real estate company to give '22 guidance, by the way, by 5% at the midpoint. We covered our dividend on a cash basis in the second quarter and raised it again for the 54th consecutive year. We had record leasing volume, more than we've ever done in any quarter in our 60-year history.
So we'll put more meat on the bone for each of those points and others, but that's where this company is as we sit here in the first week of August of 2021, and we're feeling great about our market position. At $1.41 a share, we exceeded even our most optimistic internal forecast by $0.20 a share and we're up 83% over last year's worst COVID-impacted quarter, of course, was the second quarter. In a nutshell, we didn't anticipate the bounce back in nearly all facets of our business to be so fast and so strong, and we didn't anticipate some of the onetime deals that we were working on to be executed so quickly.
We talked about the pent-up demand on the last call in the form of strong traffic and leasing demand, and that has continued unabated ever since, no pun intended. The quarterly financial impact of that optimistic consumer meant that we, one, collected more rent in the second quarter from prior periods than we thought; two, we had significantly less unpaid rent in the quarter than we thought; three, we had fewer tenant failures than we thought; and four, we have far higher percentage rent from COVID-modified deals than we thought. And as I said, we covered our dividend on an operating cash basis in the second quarter way ahead of our expectations.
Of course, all that means that we'll significantly raise 2021 earnings guidance and raise 2022 earnings guidance as well. As we've said all along, visibility toward '22 earnings was ironically better than 2021. That has proven to be the case, and Dan will talk you through guidance details in a few minutes.
And while this quarter's earnings were as strong as they were, in large part, because of the collection of big rent dollars, both past and present, the real story here is the unprecedented amount of leasing that was done and what it means for the value of our real estate into the future. Our properties are in demand across the board. We did 124 comparable deals in the quarter, more than we've ever done in any quarter in our 60-year history, for 558,000 square feet at an average rent of $37.34 per foot, 8% more rent than the deals they replaced. We signed another 9 noncomparable deals, mostly in our new developments at an average rent of $44.71 per foot. That's 570,000 square feet of space leased in 1 quarter alone, 25% more than our pre-COVID quarterly average.
You might remember that we did almost as much last quarter, too. So when you put the 2 quarters together, the production in the first half of 2021 is both staggering and unprecedented for us. Big kudos here to our leasing, our legal, our support teams, nearly 1.1 million square feet at an average rent of $37 a foot, 8% more than the previous leases, growing through annual rent bumps over the next 8-plus years.
That's really just the tip of the iceberg here. Another really interesting consideration is the breakdown of all that leasing between deals to renew tenants and deals with new tenants. Traditionally, 2/3 of the deals we do in any 1 period hovers around 2/3 renewals and 1/3 new tenants. Well, not in these post-COVID 6 months. It's actually nearly flipped, roughly 40% renewals and 60% new tenants.
So what does that mean? And why is that important? Well, first, it means that we lost a heck of a lot of tenants during COVID. And since it costs more to put a new tenant in the space rather than renew an existing tenant, our current tenant capital is higher. On the face of it, that seems like bad news, but you got to dig deeper. Because what it also means is that our properties are in high demand from today's relevant and well-capitalized restaurants and retailers that are all trying to improve their sales productivity post-COVID through better real estate locations. We've always been pickier than most in terms of the tenants we choose to merchandise our centers. When you couple that with the execution of the broad post-COVID property improvement plans that we've talked about over the last several quarters, that higher capital outlay will result significantly higher asset value tomorrow.
I mean think about it in a post-COVID world. Major market's first-tier high-quality suburban shopping centers with more than a smattering of new post-COVID relevant tenants doing business in revitalized shopping centers and mixed-use properties focused more on outdoor seating, on curbside pickup, on covered walkways and improve placemaking than ever before. Places that are more fresh, more dominant, more relevant in a myriad of ways in the communities they serve for years and years to come. The value of our real estate, net of capital, is going up, and the prospects appear to be better than they were before COVID.
Also, consider that at quarter end, our portfolio was 92.7% leased, yet only 89.6% occupied. That 310 basis point spread, or nearly 780,000 square feet of space representing roughly $30 million in rent, is the largest spread we've had since 2005. You might remember how 2006 and 2007 turned out, which obviously bodes well for the future, assuming inevitable tenant fallout occurs at historical levels. And by the way, just 3 years ago, we were 95% leased.
Okay. Onward. I hope you saw also the major acquisition announcement that we made in the press release on June 7 that laid out the 4 deals that we closed during the quarter. Overall, we have an 80% interest in the combined income stream, Grossmont Shopping Center in Greater San Diego, Camelback Colonnade and Hilton Village in Greater Phoenix and Chesterbrook Shopping Center in McLean, Virginia. Gross asset value of $407 million for 1.7 million square feet on 125 acres of land in prime locations in these markets, and we strongly believe that pricing today would far exceed what we negotiated in the middle of COVID.
A presentation that we put out ahead of NAREIT and our investor -- NAREIT investor meetings in June focused on these acquisitions in depth, including the very unique potential redevelopment opportunity at Grossmont since we control virtually the entire 63-acre parcel from a tenant perspective in less than 5 years from now. Separately, we have another deal under contract currently that we hope to close on in the quarter -- this quarter.
On the development side, residential and office leasing activity is also picking up on both coasts. It's really gratifying to see Pike & Rose quickly maturing, coming into its own and becoming the go-to place for lots of things in the region. In Montgomery County, Maryland, a county that's not doing a lot of office leasing these days, our Phase 3 office building, 909 Rose, is 77% leased with another 11% under executed LOIs. So nearly 90% committed at the point at rents in line with pro forma. That's strong in this office environment with mostly 2022 rent starts there.
Big quarter up at Assembly Row in that we received our certificate of occupancy for the retail portion and half of the units in Miscela, the 500-unit residential building that's part of the Phase 3 development. Tenants began moving in, in July, and initial leasing pace is exceeding our expectations. 145 units are already currently leased at rates that approximate our lease-up underwriting, and that seemed to be getting stronger with each week that passes. Assembly Row is the mixed-use project in our portfolio that got hurt the most during COVID and took the longest to begin to bounce back, but now it feels like it's recovering as fast as the others.
Office leasing in the PUMA-anchored building is also picking up, with serious negotiations underway for the first time in over a year for a large portion of the remaining space. Nothing tangible yet but a good sign, nonetheless. Similar situation in San Jose with our 375,000 square foot spec office building under construction and nearing completion, remains unleased for the time being. And at CocoWalk in Miami, it's all about getting tenants open as we're fully leased on the retail side and mostly leased on the office side. Tenant openings will continue through the remainder of this year. We look forward to hosting an investor tour in Coconut Grove early next March. More to come on that.
In Darien, Connecticut, construction and leasing are moving forward on time and on budget with the newly built Walgreens opening during the second quarter ahead of schedule. That's important because it makes way for the remainder of the demolition of the old shopping center and start of the residential over retail component of the project. Good stuff happening up there, too.
Let me pause there, stop. That's about all I have for the prepared comments. I'll turn it over to Dan, and we'll be happy to entertain your questions after that."

The unexpectedly strong results of $1.41 per share in the quarter, not only blew way 2020's year-over-year comparison, but was a 20-plus percent sequential gain over first quarter and more than 20% above our forecast and consensus.
Given the big beat for the quarter, let me take a little time to put some color around the broad categories of outperformance that Don outlined. $0.13 of outperformance was driven by collection-related items. $0.06 of upside was from improved operations, with $0.05 from one-timers that were above our forecast, which collectively totaled the $0.24 beat versus our previous quarterly guidance.
First, some detail on the $0.13 of upside from collection. Rent collection for the quarter, net of percentage rent, was almost 200 basis points ahead of expectations. Prior period rent collection was $7 million versus $4 million in our forecast. Our percentage rent for the quarter was almost $3 million above forecast, highlighting the strength in consumer traffic across the portfolio.
Second, the $0.06 of operational outperformance was driven by our occupancy essentially staying flat, which was roughly 50 to 100 basis points better than we had expected. And improved hotel parking and specialty leasing revenues all exceeded forecast.
The third category of $0.05 of onetime items above forecast were attributable to term fees, bankruptcy payments, loan reserve reversals and other miscellaneous payments all collectively exceeded our expectations. Please note that we do not expect the $1.41 to be the run rate for the balance of the year. Even $0.09 of the results are not expected to be recurring. And as Don mentioned, we are in the midst of delivering 500 units of residential at Assembly Row, which will be dilutive over the next few quarters, amongst other items, but we'll address that later when we get to guidance.
Let's take some time and revisit collections. Our collectability's impact was more than cut in half to $6.4 million versus the $14.8 million we had in the first quarter on the strength of prior and current period collections, net of abatements. Rent collection in the quarter surged to 94% or 4% from the 90% level as reported on our first quarter call. With abatements and deferral agreements totaling 4% of billed rent, our unresolved rent now stands at just 2%. Of the $39 million of deferral agreements negotiated to date, $17 million have been repaid, representing about 90% of the scheduled deferral payments. The remaining repayments of $22 million are set to be paid back over the next few years.
Elections for cash basis tenants improved substantially to roughly 80% for the quarter, up from 66% in the first quarter, a very strong signal. For occupancy, the continued pressure that we expected during the second quarter never really materialized as our tenants remained resilient. With the record-breaking leasing volumes across the portfolio, economic occupancy should steadily climb higher from this point driven by 310 basis points of spread between leased and occupied that is embedded within the portfolio.
Other strong leasing metrics to note, our small shop leased occupancy grew almost 200 basis points to 85.7% from 83.8%, a huge movement for that metric in a single quarter. And with respect to our lifestyle-oriented retail assets, whose performance was hardest hit during COVID, the spread between leased and occupied has grown to 440 basis points, driven by strong tenant demand and signaling a sustainable acceleration in this segment's recovery.
Comparable property growth rebounded in a big way for the quarter, up 39%, an unprecedented result and obviously, a record for Federal. But also no better evidence of a lack of relevance for this metric in the current environment, whether it's positive or negative.
Now let me move to guidance. We increased our guidance for both 2021 and 2022, taking 2021 up over 10% from a prior range of $4.54 to $4.70, up to a new range of $5.05 to $5.15 per share. This implies 13% year-over-year growth versus 2020 at the midpoint. And we are taking 2022 up 5% from a prior range of $5.05 to $5.25 to a new range of $5.30 to $5.50.
Let's review some of the assumptions behind the improved outlook. For 2021, as I mentioned, the $1.41 per share results for the second quarter will not be a run rate for the balance of the year. As I mentioned, $0.09 of that 2Q results is onetime in nature. Term fees and bankruptcy-related income will not recur at the same level, and note that we have very few term fees in the pipeline currently.
While current period collections should continue to climb modestly higher, prior period collections are forecasted to trail off for the remainder of the year. Also consider the previously mentioned dilution, roughly $0.03 per quarter from the residential at Assembly and other developments that we'll be delivering in the second half. We also expect increased G&A and property level expenses of $0.02 per quarter as the cost of doing business has increased post COVID. However, we do expect accretion from the second quarter acquisitions of roughly $0.02 per quarter. So this revised guidance implies an increase in our FFO forecast for the second half of the year of '21 of almost 10%.
For 2022, the improvement in outlook is driven by: One, a faster return to pre-COVID collection levels; two, a stronger occupancy due to the record leasing activity we've seen; three, a full year contribution for Grossmont, Chesterbrook and Phoenix; and then continued improvements and contributions from our development pipeline, although we continue to await tangible leasing at Santana West. It feels like that will not contribute to FFO until 2023.
Also note that there is a level of pragmatism in these numbers. By all reports, the COVID variants are keeping the virus with us longer than we would like. And we are still anticipating some level of tenant fallout as PPP money and other government subsidies fall away in impact-selected tenants' ability to operate profitably. And lastly, getting rents started on our record levels of new leasing activity will be a paramount focus for the operating teams here at Federal.
Please note there is no benefit assumed in our guidance in either year from switching tenants back from a cash basis to accrual basis account.
Finally, let's move to the balance sheet and an update on liquidity and leverage. On the heels of deploying over $325 million on acquisitions and over $100 million on new process development during the quarter, we continue to have ample total available liquidity of $1.3 billion, comprised of $300 million of cash and an undrawn $1 billion revolver. With $125 million of mortgage debt scheduled to be paid over the next 90 days, we will then have no maturing debt until 2023.
And lastly, we continue to be opportunistic selling tactical amounts of common equity through our ATM program. We sold $140 million at a blended share price of about $117.50 for the quarter and a forward sales agreement in order to manage our liquidity over the next year. Our remaining spend on our $1.2 billion in-process development pipeline is down to $270 million with an additional $60 million remaining on our product improvement initiatives across the portfolio.
Given the surge in our EBITDA, our leverage metrics returned to significantly stronger levels as well. Pro forma for our 2Q acquisitions and $175 million of forward equity under contract, our run rate for net debt to EBITDA is down to 6.2x. Our fixed charge coverage is back up to 3.7x. And our total liquidity climbs pro forma to $1.5 billion. Our targeted leverage ratios remain in the mid-5x for net debt-to-EBITDA and above 4x for fixed charge coverage.
Now before we get to Q&A, let me quickly mention that in the wake of covering the dividend this quarter from AFFO, yesterday, our Board declared an increased quarterly dividend per share of $1.07. Given the surge in traffic across the asset base, the resilience and quality of our sector-leading real estate portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the sound forward-looking decision-making and management, maintaining the dividend through another challenging economic cycle now looks likely. This should provide Federal shareholders with further peace of mind that with an investment in FRT comes a reliable, uninterrupted, steady, stable stream of current income as part of their total return.
And with that, operator, please open up the line for questions."

A lot of demand for our properties. Very broad-based between all of our property levels, and we continue to do deals with those best-in-class partners who have always been on our small shop side, whether it's Nike or Athleta, Starbucks, Ulta, to name a few.
What I'm really kind of intrigued about and really speaks to the strength of the real estate is the kind of retailers who maybe have a little bit more of a conservative expansion program, and they're selectively choosing best-in-class locations across the country doing very small increments of growth that really differentiate your property types.

When you look at a place like Pike & Rose, for example, this is a property that we're really, really happy with the office leasing that's been done in the first building, in the building we're standing in an 909 Rose. Could there be enough demand here to effectively start another building in time? It's possible. So we're talking about that, looking at that. Could we find a big-enough tenant that could anchor it? I don't know, all that stuff is the kind of thought process that we go through in each of these big projects.
Do we want to start a brand-new ground-up in the next year? I said no, we don't. We frankly have plenty to do on the existing ones that we have. And when you look at the acquisition trade-off, if you will, versus development, I think there was a window. And I think we jumped through that window during COVID where that difference was really attractive and pointed you toward acquisitions.
That's changed a little bit now. It's still early in the recovery. So we'll have to see how that plays out. But with us, it's not about turning one stick at on and the other one off, it's about adjusting based on what it is that we find. So I hope that's helpful in terms of where we'll be going forward.

We're getting our fair -- more than our fair share of those type of tenants. That's a real positive thing. They're new to market in a lot of cases. They're effective. They're newly capitalized in a lot of cases.
One of the things that is most important here to think through is that obviously, COVID cleaned out weaker tenants, and they did that earlier. That's the April and May and June and July of 2020. And you know that list by heart. The notion though of what happened over the next year and who you want to have in your centers, particularly if you're spending $10 million and $12 million and $8 million on a center for a property improvement plan, you want new blood in the retail because you can't just have a nice place to sit outside the same old tenants that were pre-COVID and average or are average now because of their sales.
So you're seeing -- we've said it from the beginning that the demand is broad-based and the demand is largely tenants trying to improve the real estate locations that they're in. Why? Because they're trying to improve the sales that it is that they do, which is why they can pay the rents that we charge. It's all about that relationship."

Yes, we are likely to increase -- we are successful with an acquisition, we'll bump guidance slightly from that perspective. But it's all the reason -- all the outperformance we had. We're expecting term fees. We had $3.4 million net in the quarter versus $1.8 million net last year. We're not expecting -- we're expecting maybe $1 million this quarter.

And so in any particular quarter, there's always going to be rather significant variation. I laughed a little bit when you said there was a decrease in the second quarter to first quarter.

In terms of the -- and in both of those quarters, there were still deals, obviously, that were rolled down. There were other deals that were rolled up in a more significant way. That's basically what happens in most quarters. There is a mixture of those 2 things. The probability that it will stay in those single-digit numbers is highest. That's where we're most comfortable effectively in kind of running -- pushing rents and seeing what we can do in any one period.
And again, that it definitely, definitely depends on the mix of any particular quarter, which you don't get in a bigger company.

And Wendy, please feel free to add or Jeff, anybody that wants that. I mean, look, there is -- if you're -- just be a retailer for a minute, be a restaurant for a minute and have gone through what just happened in this country over the last 18 months. And frankly, what was happening, the pressures that were on you for the 3 and 4, 5 years before that.
And so here you are now, in many cases, recapitalized; in many cases, with a different level of competition than you had before. And you're in a position where you can reset. And effectively, that's what's happening. If you've got the chance -- I mean, Wendy can tell you, man, if you sit on Rockville Pike in 1 of the 4 or 5 shopping centers that all aim for different parts of the consumer on Rockville Pike that we own, there have been tenants that have been trying to get on to Pike for years and years in the right type of -- the right type of centers.
We've been over 95% leased for Rockville Pike for much, if not all, of that time, except for the last 15 months. There is an opportunity that has not been here. So there's an opportunity to improve your real estate in a very, very well-located first-tier suburb of major cities, and you've got a landlord who is openly and anxiously improving those shopping centers for a post-COVID environment, why would you not choose to go there? Where would you choose to go instead?
Because at the end of the day, it's not about the rent. It's about the profit there. And effectively, higher sales, better margins, a more affluent customer, in better real estate, with a landlord that's investing side-by-side with you seems to be -- and you're in there with a new balance sheet, seems to be a pretty smart choice for a lot of tenants, including and especially those small shop tenants that Craig Schmidt was referring to before and that Wendy went through in detail.
So I hope that's helpful. That's what we see happening in the markets that we're in, at the properties that we're in. That's why the investment in the properties to be post-COVID investments are so important to a retailer. They've got to be partners with their landlord."

And the same applies to Assembly Row.
Now at Pike & Rose, are we anywhere near being able to answer your specific questions in terms of the economics on it, whether it's viable, does it make any sense? No, we're not. We're in that early exploratory phase, but we're in the early exploratory phase because we believe there is something potentially there. I've got nothing more to say about that at this point other than the entitlements in this -- on this 27 acres could certainly be used for that use and similarly, at Assembly Row.

But that -- it was so strong in all of them, that we had to -- we just feel really good about talking about it.
The only thing I would say is during that period of time, this second quarter, weather had a lot to do with it. So Boston felt like it was a few weeks behind New York, which felt like it was a few weeks behind Washington, D.C., et cetera. That's the -- as that weather changed and as those restrictions came off, holy cow, was there pent-up demand. And that has -- that's continued.
It's interesting. We're talking a little bit -- I'm going off on a little bit of tangent, but you gave me an opportunity, so I'll do it. When you think about the Delta variant itself and what's going to happen with respect to it. Obviously, we don't know. But we do know a few things. The open-air format is fantastic. And in the markets where we're at, which has been a big disadvantage as they all closed down in 2020, these are markets where the vaccine rates are among the highest in the country.
They're also the markets, and this is important, where mask wearing is accepted. There's not a stigma to it otherwise. So the notion, like, we see a lot of people wearing masks at our shopping centers and our properties, but they're shopping just fine because they're comfortable with that. So I don't know how it's going to play out, but I do like the fact that, really, in these markets, both East and West Coast, that the vaccine rates are among the highest in the country because I think that's an important thing for the long term of this mess we're in."

I mean -- and it kind of ties back to what I was saying before in terms of retailers making longer-term investments. They're trying to set themselves up for the next decade post COVID, and they want to be with landlords who are with them. And what that means with them is care about who they're merchandising next to, care about whether they're investing in the properties to effectively attract customers with a placemaking perspective, a curbside pickup.
And I mean curbside pickup, I cannot tell you how many tenants ask about it. Whether they use it or not, that's another question. But it's a critical thing to figure out whether the landlord is in it with them in trying to make them successful as businesses. If you're a private company that is undercapitalized, and I've got to make that distinction because a well-capitalized private company, and there's a bunch of them that you and I know that are not disadvantaged at all, and then darn good at what they do.
But if you are a private company who is undercapitalized and trying to kind of milk the cash flow from the existing shopping center, I think you're in a serious disadvantage post-COVID.

We like those because we will come in and put in the capital in a great location and show virtually immediate results in leasing or very strong results in the short term in leasing.

So we still want to be able to do all of those on our big projects. We're working those numbers all the time. Construction costs seem to have stabilized a little bit at this point in time. I think that's a general good sign. We do need to get comfortable with where rents are and whether we're able to make some money. I think I said earlier in the remarks that there are a number of opportunities, potentially at Pike & Rose or Assembly, that we see now.
I can't wait to be telling you that there's other opportunities at Santana Row once we get that big building lease, which I would love to be able to tell you but I'm not ready to do that yet.

As Leah just gave birth to her second child last week a boy named Weston. [indiscernible] baby are doing great. If you do get the chance, please reach out by e-mail congratulate her. 
So my prepared remarks today are going to sound a lot like last quarter because the recovery continues unabated and ahead of schedule. The momentum that we took into the second quarter carried through and in fact, strengthened in the third quarter most evidently on the office leasing demand side at our mixed-use properties. Let me just cut to the chase here and summarize where we are in 5 easy points. For one, we killed it in the third quarter at $1.51 a share. Secondly, we raised our 2021 total year guidance by over 7% at the midpoint. Thirdly, we raised our '22 guidance, the only shopping center real estate companies to give '22 guidance so far by the way, similarly by over 6% at the midpoint, and Dan is going to talk about 2023 and 2024 also. We executed 119 retail leases for 430,000 feet of comparable space at 7% higher cash basis rents than the leases they replace. And we ended up the quarter with our office product fully leased up at [indiscernible] 89% leased are under executed LOI at Pike & Rose, 88% leased are under executed LOI at Assembly Row. [indiscernible] even having some consequential discussions with full building users at Santana West. And then after the quarter, you might have seen last week that we signed a 105,000 square foot deal with Choice Hotels to be the lead tenant in the next phase at Pike & Rose. Have some serious office leasing progress for any 3-month period. Never mind 1 for which decision-makers are still unsure of their future office space needs. 
[indiscernible] a lot about media-rich new construction in our markets. We'll put more meat on the bone for each of those points and others, that's where this company is as we sit here in the first week of November 2021. We're feeling great about our market position. With FFO at $1.51 per share, we exceeded even our most optimistic internal forecasts or up 35% over last year's recovering third quarter. We did anticipate the bounce back in nearly all facets of our business to be so fast and so strong even with the effects of the Delta variant surge. The quarterly positive impact of the faster recovery meant that we collected more rent in the third quarter from prior periods than we anticipated, $8 million collected versus a few million forecast. We had significantly less unpaid rent in the quarter than we anticipated. We collected 96% of what was due. 
We have far fewer tenant failures than we anticipated. And at $4.9 million, we had far higher percentage rent from COVID modified and unmodified leases than we had anticipated. We also have less dilution from our new residential construction in Assembly Row because our lease-up is well ahead of schedule at this point, nearly half the new residential building is already leased. Even the 3 hotels in our mixed-use properties are performing better than we thought that they would be at this point with occupancy at all 3 back into the mid-60s and better. And of course, we more than covered our dividend on an operating cash basis in the third quarter as we did last quarter. 
As a reminder, that's the dividend that was never cut during COVID. So all that means that we'll significantly raise earnings guidance and take a peak in the out years, too. As we've said all along, visibility to our 2022 earnings was ironically better than 2021. That's proven to be the case. Dan will talk about in details in a few minutes. So on the retail leasing side, we continue to see strong demand across the board and see that continuing for the foreseeable future. Over the last 4 quarters, we've done 442 comparable deals for nearly 2 million square feet, not counting another couple of hundred thousand feet for noncomparable new development. To put that into context, that's 27% more deal volume, 25% more square footage than the annual average over the last decade, a decade that itself was very strong for us from a retail leasing standpoint. 
We've been saying all along, demand for Federal Realty properties that's not the issue. They are in high demand from today's relevant and well-capitalized restaurants and retailers that are all trying to improve their sales productivity post-COVID through better real estate locations. We've always been pickier than most in terms of the tenants we choose to curate our centers. When you couple that with the execution of the broad post-COVID property improvement plans that we talked about over the last several quarters, that higher capital outlay today will result in significantly higher asset value tomorrow. Places that are more fresh, more dominant, more relevant and a myriad of ways in the communities they serve for years and years to come. The value of our real estate net of capital is going up. and the prospects appear to be better than they were before COVID. 
But a signed lease does not equal a rent star and the well-publicized supply chain issues affecting most U.S. businesses will have to be managed softly and definitely in the next 18 months to move all those tenants from signed lease commitments to build out operating stores in the shortest possible time frame at a reasonable cost. Whether we're talking about a shortage of rooftop air conditioning units or production shortages for kitchen equipment from overseas or materials stuck on boats way and offload, supply chain issues are broad and to some extent, unpredictable. As a company, we're all over, and we have been for months. Early ordering, stockpiling, problem-solving and leveraging long-standing relationships are all tools that we're using to mitigate buildout delays. 
At quarter's end, our portfolio was 92.8% leased and 90.2% occupied, both improvements over last quarter and the quarter before that. In a long way from being 95% leased, which we were just 3 years ago. The earnings upside from not only getting rent started in all the leasing we've done to date, but the continuation of occupancy gains at historic levels may be higher over the next couple of years, provides a visible and low-risk window into strong future growth. And that's before considering the inevitable earnings growth coming from the lease-up of our $1 billion-plus development and redevelopment pipeline, the costs of which are largely locked in, and our very active acquisition program also will add to that. 
By the way, we did close on the $34 million acquisition of Twinbrooke Shopping Center in Fairfax, Virginia and another off-market transaction during the third quarter. the fifth deal that we closed in 2021 and the second in Northern Virginia. Very excited about the remerchandising and rent upside at this underinvested shopping center staple in the middle of Fairfax County. I've got to believe that the visibility of this company's bottom line earnings growth coming out of COVID is on a risk-adjusted basis, 1 of the, if not the, most transparent in the sector. That's about all I have for my prepared comments. Let me turn it over to Dan, who will be happy to entertain your questions after that."

Good afternoon, everyone. Feels really good to be here discussing another quarter where we blew way expectations, $1.51 per share of FFO represented a 7% sequential gain over a strong second quarter, 35% above 3Q last year and was $0.23 above our expectations, which represents an 18% beat. As Don highlighted, the outperformance was broad-based with upsiming from continued progress on collections, occupancy and leasing gains, better-than-forecasted contributions from hotel, parking and percentage rent, faster lease-up at our developments and another accretive off-market transactions. While collections climbed higher to 96% in the current period, up from 94% last quarter, plus another $8 million of prior period collection, leasing is what continues to command center stage for yet another quarter at Federal. 
Momentum that started during the second half of 2020 continues with a fifth consecutive quarter of well above average leasing volumes across the portfolio. We saw our occupied percentage surged 60 basis points in the quarter from 89.6% to 90.2%. Other strong leasing metrics to note, our small shop leased occupancy metric continued its climb upwards as it grew another 40 basis points to 86.1%, coming on top of the nearly 200 basis point gain in the second quarter. Overall, small shop is up 260 basis points year-over-year. 
Leasing momentum continues to be driven by strength in our lifestyle portfolio as we sign leases with such relevant tenants of tomorrow, names such as Allbirds, Jenny Kane, American Giant, Herman Miller, Teleton, Loss lab, Purple, another Parity location, another light Nike location, our fourth this year, and restaurants such as Softline, Moto, [indiscernible], Pro Berho, Gregory's Coffee and Van Luen. Just to name a few. Some of these names you may not be familiar with, but trust me, you will. Office leasing continues to be a bright spot with 224,000 square feet of leases signed during the quarter and subsequent to quarter end, including the investment-grade rated Choice hotel deals that Don highlighted. 
Comparable property growth, again, while not particularly relevant this year, continued its resurgence, up 16%. Please note for those that keep track as we expected, term fees in the quarter were down significantly to $500,000 versus $6.1 million in the third quarter of last year, a headwind of a minus 4.2%. Without it, our comparable metric would have been 20%. Our remaining spend on our $1.2 billion in-process development pipeline stands another $250 million with another $50 million remaining in our property improvement initiatives across the portfolio. You may have noticed that we added a new project to our redevelopment schedule in our 8-K a complete repositioning of Huntington Shopping Center on the island, an $80 million project, which will transform a physically obsolete power center on a great piece of land into a remerchandise Whole Foods anchored center. 
The project is expected to achieve an incremental yield of 7%. Now on to the balance sheet and an update on liquidity and leverage. For the $125 million of mortgage debt having been repaid over the last 60 days, we have no debt maturing until mid-2023. We continue to be opportunistic selling tactical amounts of common equity for our ATM program under forward sales agreements. And as a result, we maintain ample available liquidity of $1.45 billion as of quarter end, comprised of our undrawn $1 billion revolver, roughly $180 million of cash and $270 million of equity to be issued under forward agreements. 
Additionally, our leverage metrics continue to show marked improvement. Pro forma for our 2021 acquisitions and forward equity under contract, our run rate for net debt to EBITDA is down to 6.0x. Pro forma for leases signed yet not open, the figure is 5.8x. Fixed charge coverage is back up to 3.9x. Our targeted leverage ratios remain in the low to mid 5x for net debt to EBITDA and above 4x for fixed charge coverage. We are almost there. Finally, let's turn to guidance. Given the strong recovery we are experiencing in 2021, we will be meaningfully increasing guidance again for both this year and 2022. And taking 2021 up 7.4% from a prior range of $5.05 to $5.15 to $5.45 to $5.50 per share. This implies 21% year-over-year growth versus 2020 at the midpoint and are taking 2022 up 6.5% from a prior range of $5.30 to $5.50 for a revised range of $5.65 to $5.85 per share. And while it may be premature, preliminary targets from our model, show FFO growth in 2023 and 2024 in the 5% to 10% range. The drivers behind the improved outlook for 2021. First, a significantly stronger third quarter than previously expected. And this should continue in the fourth quarter as we increase our fourth quarter estimate to $1.36 to $1.41 per share, a 10% improvement versus previous guidance but down from this quarter. 
While we again collected more rent than expected from prior periods in the third quarter, we don't expect that to repeat. Repairs and maintenance, demo and other expenses were all expected at elevated levels as we continue to drive the quality of our existing portfolio and G&A will be higher in the fourth quarter as well given higher compensation expense. In addition, we forecast issuing $150 million to $200 million of common equity under our forward agreements before year-end. For 2022, the improvement in outlook is driven by strength across all facets of our business, stronger occupancy growth driven by the continued momentum in leasing activity, contributions from our in-process $1.2 billion development pipeline, a full year contribution for all of our 2021 acquisitions and higher collections as we return to pre-COVID levels. 
Let me try to add some color to each of these areas to provide greater transparency to a multiyear path of outsized growth. The first driver of growth, occupancy and leasing, which I would like to break into 2 components. First, what deals are already executed. With physical occupancy at 90.2% and our lease rate at 92.8%, our sign on open spread was 260 basis points for our in-place portfolio. This represents roughly $25 million of incremental total rent. The second component, what leasing demand will drive going forward. Given the strength of our leasing pipeline, getting back to 95% leased, a level we were at just 3 years ago is certainly achievable. If you look at our current pipeline of new leasing activity for currently unoccupied space, this could add another approximately 115 basis points to the current lease percentage for $12 million of total rent upside when executed. 
Please note, for every 100 basis points of occupancy gain, we see roughly $10 million adjustable total rent on average. The third driver of growth, our development pipeline. That $1.2 billion of spend will throw off just over $10 million of POI in 2021 or about 1%. With a stabilized projected yield in the mid- to low 6% range, it should produce $70 million to $75 million of POI when stabilized. This $60 million to $65 million of incremental POI should begin to deliver more fully in 2022, but will also be a meaningful driver of POI growth in 2023 and 2024. 
Please note, as we did before COVID, next quarter we plan to reinclude in our 8-K supplement the disclosure detailing the ramp-up of POI for each of the projects in our pipeline. The fourth driver of growth in 2022 acquisitions. As Don mentioned, the closing of Twin Shopping Center, our fifth out market deal of the year brings our consolidated investment of $440 million or $360 million on a pro rata basis. With a blended going-in yield of 5.5% plus a full year of contribution, these purchases are very accretive. 
Lastly, collections. Current period collections for 2021 are forecasted to finish at 95% on average for the entire year. We are expecting that to be higher in 2022 with pre-COVID levels returning in 2023. This is expected to more than offset any fall-off in prior rent collection next year. Keep in mind, for every 100 basis points of collection percentage improvement, it represents almost $9 million annually. Please note that similar to last quarter, there is no benefit assumed to our guidance in either 2021 or 2022 from switching tenants from cash, back to accrual basis accounting. 
The combination of these primary drivers of growth supplemented by forecasted upside in other parts of our business such as parking, tell investments, a percentage rent gives us a clear and transparent path of growth, not only in 2022 but beyond into 2023 and '24. We couldn't be happier with our market position and expect to have sector-leading FFO growth over the next few years. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for questions."

They could see the consumers shopping at your properties what has gone on now that it's supercharged? Is it just merely that these tenants don't have the threat of the online shopping? I mean, it's just been incredible. And I know I've asked this question before, but the pace of demand across retail this quarter is just mind blowing. And it just really begs the question for these really retailers really just holding back before. Or is it really fleshing out of the bad credit that's allowed you guys to have better space to rent to people who are willing to pay higher rents?"

Well, first of all, Alex, it's good to know that you're very predictable in terms of the first part of your statement. So we had a question.

Well, first of all, Alex, it's good to know that you're very predictable in terms of the first part of your statement. So we had a question. But the -- in terms of the bigger -- in terms of the question you're asking, it's a whole bunch of things. It's not just 1 thing. But certainly, the notion of the amount of time that a lot of people certainly in our markets have had not been out and have been at home and have restrictions one way or the other. You've got to tell you, as you know, that gets old. And so I think you're seeing a revised rejuvenized if you will, love for socialization. I can tell you, any restaurant, certainly in New York, that you would say you would be -- you can't even get a reservation. And we're seeing that same thing throughout our properties. 
So people want to be out. Tenants are upgrading their space. And having the ability -- and obviously, I'm talking our portfolio primarily, but having the ability to get into better real estate in a portfolio that was as low as 89% -- 89-some-odd percent leased. That's as rare as a Gastrofi. And so the ability to actually have a chance to operate, it's a huge truck as we've been talking about all the way through. So from a consumer perspective, you've certainly got the demand from a real estate perspective and a tenant perspective, you certainly have the demand. And then the other side of it is -- and this surprised me. You can call it sandbagging or what, whatever. But it surprised me that we have not lost more tenants over the past 6 or 8 months in 2021. 
The notion of tenants holding on to their properties and finding a way to make it through and not wanting to lose their superior positions from real estate was greater than we expected. So the combination of not losing them, having availability from the 89% coming back up and the strong consumer demand. You put those 3 things together, and I think you've got the bulk of the answer to your question. And we, as I say, we don't see a change to that. at this point, it's continuing strong and an unabated way."

So for us, first of all, just to get it all in perspective, right, there is assembly row with office, Heiken Rose with office potential opportunities and it's Santana Row. In all 3 markets, the demand is there. The Santana West is a different kettle of fish because it's 1 big building that we're looking for 1 big tenant to take the whole thing. At Assembly, the -- what has happened to the building that was Puma and just Boma forever has been astonishing in the past period of time. there, you may see us able to announce another building next year. We're working it hard right now. But to your point, that is -- that demand could mean that there's a faster route to the next building. In terms of Pike & Rose, we certainly didn't expect to be announcing another office building here. As you know, building we just moved into, we were the only tenants in here on August 10, 2020. So the notion that this building is 90% or 89% whatever percent leased and our conversations with choice who originally started about this building was such that we could not accommodate them. So that we needed if we wanted to do that deal to start another building, it's astonishing. 
And I don't think this is even handed throughout the country. Obviously, there's a whole question of what happens to office space as in terms of needs going forward over the next decade. But I know if you're in an amenity-rich environments with new buildings in places like where you are, I know you're in the cat work set because I'm seeing it in terms of the deals we're doing. So 1, maybe 2 buildings over the next year."

But it -- but your point is important. It is a -- it has to be a very proactive and creative way to deal with something that is, in some respects, uncontrollable. So we'll see how that plays out. So far, so good. on the costs, really good thing that the biggest piece of our development pipeline is already locked in. And is -- even as I sit here in 909 Rose, our office building here. This building was built with 2018 money. And even though there's been a delay that's taken longer to effectively get it leased up. Now that it has, those deals are really good deals on 2018 money. And so this will work out just fine same way at Santana, same way up an Assembly. On the new stuff we got a lock in early best we can, lock in price escalation. We got leverage buying power with bulk purchases. We have to solve source-alternate suppliers it's all part of a very proactive and tightly controlled development organization. I think we're really good at it."

What -- So from our perspective, we don't say no to something at a 4 or say yes to something at a 6 based on that cap rate. We are looking at where we can create value in that real estate and honestly looking at IRR -- with IRR assumptions. So to the extent our IRR is over and above 150 basis points of our cost of capital as we define it. We like that deal, sometimes 100 basis points over, sometimes 200 basis points over.

I think 1 thing to comment on is that our occupied percentage grew 60 basis points. I don't think we had any impact. We got rent started -- and it was, I think, a strong quarter for that in terms of getting tenants in, getting them rent paying. And that's kind of been flow from quarter-to-quarter.

And then as I think we've talked about in the past, there were -- there have been some of our COVID deals effectively traded out fixed rent for a low break point of percentage rent so that we were sharing the recovery, if you will, with the prospective tenant. The recovery has been stronger. And so rosatidrant on those COVID adjusted deals were higher. So I think when we have $4.9 million in the quarter. When you think about $5 million, will it be $5 million [indiscernible] for $20 million for the year? No, it won't. This was -- it was a really good quarter, and some of those deals in percentage rent will convert back to fixed rent deals.

Cleaning them up and doing a better job on leasing, including in 1 case, potentially having a better grocery anchor. There is some densification opportunities at a couple of the properties for sure. And then gross bond is a little bit of a blank slate that we need to think through and figure out what we're going to do with all the leases of that property coming up in [ '25 ], and we're in that process. 
The goal there is to narrow the options by the end of the year and have some clear direction at some point in '22, but we're not quite there yet. But as you know, our view is always buy the best piece of land we can buy in terms of location and population density incomes, road network, all that good stuff. And then put on that piece of land, what the market demands and generate as much rent as possible. And that's why we bought those deals.

But if you worked here and you try to figure out where you want to put capital incrementally to create the most value time and time again, it will come down to the big 3 because we're not close to being done. 
And so the notion of adding incremental buildings to Santana Row, Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, just kills the comparison with starting another mixed-use property that will take 2 decades to do. So it always comes down to capital allocation and where your alternatives are and what the smartest they do is. And that I think the mistake that some investors and analysts make are underestimating, the level of growth and capital that is still yet to come at the big 3, some 10, 15 in the case of Santana 20 years later."

But it's been pretty consistent and equally consistent is, obviously, the ones we're talking to are putting a very high value on the amenity-based environment and buildings that are brand new. And so when you put those 2 things together, are not getting, frankly, the rent pressure partly because I think it's -- the total rent that they're paying is not more than they were paying before because they're taking less space. 
And so interestingly, the biggest component of where they're going, and almost all have some kind of a hybrid work model associated with it that partly allows them to take less space. But they're unyielding with respect to what amenity-based means and the, frankly, newness of the building."

So being concentrated in the market is important. So certainly, now that we're in the Greater Phoenix metropolitan area, we're going to want to grow in greater Phoenix and get that same concentration that we have in our other target markets. So expect to see that. I think we mentioned on some prior calls that we are looking at a couple of new markets, doing our research, making sure we're identifying where in those markets we want to be in. We're working on deals in those markets, whether they happen or not, I don't know, it's too soon to say. But don't be surprised if we take another couple of markets to be in.

And the best example we have that just happened is effectively what's going on in Phoenix. 
I mean we are talking -- the inbound questions, along with our own work in Phoenix has quadrupled from what it would have been when if we had just bought 1 or 2 very small properties. By owning Camelback Colonnade, work player it's well known and what -- you can't underestimate how that can lead to more work. And certainly, on the retailer side. And on the operational side, you get your obvious efficiencies and disproportionate level of play. We've seen that in Washington, D.C. and suburban Maryland forever. We're now starting to see it in Northern Virginia because we've made such a play there. There's no doubt in my mind that concentration is a really big plus in this business and no more so than on the acquisition side."

And to the extent we can get the economics to make some sense. And obviously, construction costs are the biggest hurdle in that. But given what's happened to the adjacent properties, it's really clear to us that the assembly site in Somerville is going to be a life sciences site at some point, whether it's just the adjacencies or whether it includes us, will depend on whether we can make the numbers work or not.

If you do get the chance, please reach out by e-mail to congratulate her. 
So my prepared remarks today are going to sound a lot like last quarter because the recovery continues unabated and ahead of schedule. The momentum that we took into the second quarter carried through and in fact, strengthened in the third quarter, most evidently on the office leasing demand side at our mixed-use properties. 
Let me just cut to the chase here and summarize where we are in 5 easy points. For one, we killed it in the third quarter at $1.51 a share. Secondly, we raised our 2021 total year guidance by over 7% at the midpoint. Thirdly, we raised our '22 guidance, the only shopping center real estate company to get '22 guidance so far by the way, similarly by over 6% at the midpoint, and Dan is going to talk about 2023 and 2024 also. We executed 119 retail leases for 430,000 feet of comparable space at 7% higher cash basis rents than the leases they replace. And we ended up the quarter with our office product fully leased up at CocoWalk, 89% leased or under-executed LOI at Pike & Rose, 88% leased or under-executed LOI at Assembly Row. Heck, we're even having some consequential discussions with full building users at Santana West. And then after the quarter, you might have seen last week that we signed a 105,000 square foot deal with Choice Hotels to be the lead tenant in the next phase at Pike & Rose. That's some serious office leasing progress for any 3-month period, never mind one in which decision-makers are still unsure of their future office space needs. Sure says a lot about amenity-rich new construction in our markets. We'll put more meat on the bone for each of those points and others. That's where this company is as we sit here in the first week of November 2021. 
We're feeling great about our market position. With FFO at $1.51 per share, we exceeded even our most optimistic internal forecasts or up 35% over last year's recovering third quarter. We did anticipate the bounce back in nearly all facets of our business to be so fast and so strong even with the effects of the Delta variant surge. The quarterly positive impact of the faster recovery meant that we collected more rent in the third quarter from prior periods than we anticipated, $8 million collected versus a few million forecast. We had significantly less unpaid rent in the quarter than we anticipated. We collected 96% of what was due. 
We had far fewer tenant failures than we anticipated. And at $4.9 million, we had far higher percentage rent from COVID modified and unmodified leases than we had anticipated. We also have less dilution from our new residential construction in Assembly Row because our lease-up is well ahead of schedule at this point; nearly half the new residential building is already leased. Heck, even the 3 hotels in our mixed-use properties are performing better than we thought that they would be at this point with occupancy at all 3 back into the mid-60s and better. And of course, we more than covered our dividend on an operating cash basis in the third quarter as we did last quarter. As a reminder, that's the dividend that was never cut during COVID. 
So all that means that we'll significantly raise earnings guidance and take a peek at the out years, too. As we've said all along, visibility to our 2022 earnings was ironically better than 2021. That's proven to be the case. Dan will talk through guidance details in a few minutes. 
So on the retail leasing side, we continue to see strong demand across the board and see that continuing for the foreseeable future. Over the last 4 quarters, we've done 442 comparable deals for nearly 2 million square feet, not counting another couple of hundred thousand feet for noncomparable new development. To put that into context, that's 27% more deal volume, 25% more square footage than the annual average over the last decade, a decade that itself was very strong for us from a retail leasing standpoint. 
We've been saying all along, demand for Federal Realty properties, that's not the issue. They are in high demand from today's relevant and well-capitalized restaurants and retailers that are all trying to improve their sales productivity post-COVID through better real estate locations. We've always been pickier than most in terms of the tenants we choose to curate our centers. When you couple that with the execution of the broad post-COVID property improvement plans that we talked about over the last several quarters, that higher capital outlay today will result in significantly higher asset value tomorrow. Places that are more fresh, more dominant, more relevant in a myriad of ways in the communities they serve for years and years to come. The value of our real estate net of capital is going up and the prospects appear to be better than they were before COVID. 
But a signed lease does not equal a rent star and the well-publicized supply chain issues affecting most U.S. businesses will have to be managed softly and deftly in the next 18 months to move all those tenants from signed lease commitments to build out operating stores in the shortest possible time frame at a reasonable cost. Whether we're talking about a shortage of rooftop air conditioning units or production shortages for kitchen equipment from overseas or materials stuck on boats way in offload, supply chain issues are broad and to some extent, unpredictable. As a company, we're all over it, and we have been for months. Early ordering, stockpiling, problem-solving and leveraging long-standing relationships are all tools that we're using to mitigate buildout delays. 
At quarter's end, our portfolio was 92.8% leased and 90.2% occupied, both improvements over last quarter and the quarter before that. A long way from being 95% leased, which we were just 3 years ago. The earnings upside from not only getting rent started in all the leasing we've done to date, but the continuation of occupancy gains at historic levels may be higher over the next couple of years, provides a visible and low-risk window into strong future growth. And that's before considering the inevitable earnings growth coming from the lease-up of our $1 billion-plus development and redevelopment pipeline, the costs of which are largely locked in, and our very active acquisition program also will add to that. 
By the way, we did close on the $34 million acquisition of Twinbrooke Shopping Center in Fairfax, Virginia and another off-market transaction during the third quarter, marking the fifth deal that we closed in 2021 and the second in Northern Virginia. Very excited about the remerchandising and rent upside at this underinvested shopping center staple in the middle of Fairfax County. I've got to believe that the visibility of this company's bottom line earnings growth coming out of COVID is, on a risk-adjusted basis, one of the, if not the, most transparent in the sector. 
That's about all I have for my prepared comments. Let me turn it over to Dan, who will be happy to entertain your questions after that."
271305,1681654717,2426658,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thank you, Don.

Good afternoon, everyone. Feels really good to be here discussing another quarter where we blew away expectations. $1.51 per share of FFO represented a 7% sequential gain over a strong second quarter, 35% above 3Q last year and was $0.23 above our expectations, which represents an 18% beat. As Don highlighted, the outperformance was broad-based with upside coming from continued progress on collections, occupancy and leasing gains, better-than-forecasted contributions from hotel, parking and percentage rent, faster lease-up at our developments and another accretive off-market transaction. While collections climbed higher to 96% in the current period, up from 94% last quarter, plus another $8 million of prior period collection, leasing is what continues to command center stage for yet another quarter at Federal. Momentum that started during the second half of 2020 continues with a fifth consecutive quarter of well above average leasing volumes across the portfolio. We saw our occupied percentage surge 60 basis points in the quarter from 89.6% to 90.2%. 
Other strong leasing metrics to note, our small shop leased occupancy metric continued its climb upwards as it grew another 40 basis points to 86.1%, coming on top of the nearly 200 basis point gain in the second quarter. Overall, small shop is up 260 basis points year-over-year. 
Leasing momentum continues to be driven by strength in our lifestyle portfolio as we sign leases with such relevant tenants of tomorrow, names such as Allbirds, Jenni Kayne, American Giant, Herman Miller, Peleton, Glosslab, Purple, another Faherty location, another light Nike location, our fourth this year, and restaurants such as Salt Line, Molto, Sprezzatura, Astro Beer Hall, Gregorys Coffee and Van Leeuwen, just to name a few. Some of these names you may not be familiar with, but trust me, you will. 
Office leasing continues to be a bright spot with 224,000 square feet of leases signed during the quarter and subsequent to quarter end, including the investment-grade rated Choice Hotel deals that Don highlighted. 
Comparable property growth, again, while not particularly relevant this year, continued its resurgence, up 16%. Please note for those that keep track as we expected, term fees in the quarter were down significantly to $500,000 versus $6.1 million in the third quarter of last year, a headwind of a minus 4.2%. Without it, our comparable metric would have been 20%. 
Our remaining spend on our $1.2 billion in-process development pipeline stands at $250 million with another $50 million remaining in our property improvement initiatives across the portfolio. You may have noticed that we added a new project to our redevelopment schedule in our 8-K, a complete repositioning of Huntington Shopping Center on Long Island, an $80 million project which will transform a physically obsolete power center on a great piece of land into a remerchandised Whole Foods anchored center. The project is expected to achieve an incremental yield of 7%. 
Now on to the balance sheet and an update on liquidity and leverage. For the $125 million of mortgage debt having been repaid over the last 60 days, we have no debt maturing until mid-2023. We continue to be opportunistic selling tactical amounts of common equity for our ATM program under forward sales agreements. And as a result, we maintain ample available liquidity of $1.45 billion as of quarter end, comprised of our undrawn $1 billion revolver, roughly $180 million of cash and $270 million of equity to be issued under forward agreements. 
Additionally, our leverage metrics continue to show marked improvement. Pro forma for our 2021 acquisitions and forward equity under contract, our run rate for net debt to EBITDA is down to 6.0x. Pro forma for leases signed yet not open, the figure is 5.8x. Fixed charge coverage is back up to 3.9x. Our targeted leverage ratios remain in the low to mid 5x for net debt to EBITDA and above 4x for fixed charge coverage. We are almost there. 
Finally, let's turn to guidance. Given the strong recovery we are experiencing in 2021, we will be meaningfully increasing guidance again for both this year and 2022, taking 2021 up 7.4% from a prior range of $5.05 to $5.15 to $5.45 to $5.50 per share. This implies 21% year-over-year growth versus 2020 at the midpoint and are taking 2022 up 6.5% from a prior range of $5.30 to $5.50 for a revised range of $5.65 to $5.85 per share. And while it may be premature, preliminary targets from our model show FFO growth in 2023 and 2024 in the 5% to 10% range. 
The drivers behind improved outlook for 2021. First, a significantly stronger third quarter than previously expected. And this should continue in the fourth quarter as we increase our fourth quarter estimate to $1.36 to $1.41 per share, a 10% improvement versus previous guidance but down from this quarter. 
While we again collected more rent than expected from prior periods in the third quarter, we don't expect that to repeat. Repairs and maintenance, demo and other expenses were all expected at elevated levels as we continue to drive the quality of our existing portfolio and G&A will be higher in the fourth quarter as well, given higher compensation expense. In addition, we forecast issuing $150 million to $200 million of common equity under our forward agreements before year-end. For 2022, the improvement in outlook is driven by strength across all facets of our business, stronger occupancy growth driven by the continued momentum in leasing activity, contributions from our in-process $1.2 billion development pipeline, a full year contribution for all of our 2021 acquisitions and higher collections as we return to pre-COVID levels. 
Let me try to add some color to each of these areas to provide greater transparency to a multiyear path of outsized growth. The first driver of growth, occupancy and leasing, which I would like to break into 2 components. First, what deals are already executed. With physical occupancy at 90.2% and our lease rate at 92.8%, our sign not open spread was 260 basis points for our in-place portfolio. This represents roughly $25 million of incremental total rent. The second component, what leasing demand will drive going forward. Given the strength of our leasing pipeline, getting back to 95% leased, a level we were at just 3 years ago is certainly achievable. If you look at our current pipeline of new leasing activity for currently unoccupied space, this could add another approximately 115 basis points to the current lease percentage for $12 million of total rent upside when executed. Please note, for every 100 basis points of occupancy gain, we see roughly $10 million at adjustable total rent on average. 
The third driver of growth, our development pipeline. That $1.2 billion of spend will throw off just over $10 million of POI in 2021 or about 1%. With a stabilized projected yield in the mid- to low 6% range, it should produce $70 million to $75 million of POI when stabilized. This $60 million to $65 million of incremental POI should begin to deliver more fully in 2022, but will also be a meaningful driver of POI growth in 2023 and 2024. Please note, as we did before COVID, next quarter we plan to re-include in our 8-K supplement the disclosure detailing the ramp-up of POI for each of the projects in our pipeline. 
The fourth driver of growth in 2022, acquisitions. As Don mentioned, the closing of Twinbrooke Shopping Center, our fifth off-market deal of the year, brings our consolidated investment of $440 million with $360 million on a pro rata basis. With a blended going-in yield of 5.5% plus a full year of contribution, these purchases are very accretive. 
Lastly, collections. Current period collections for 2021 are forecasted to finish at 95% on average for the entire year. We are expecting that to be higher in 2022 with pre-COVID levels returning in 2023. This is expected to more than offset any fall-off in prior rent collection next year. Keep in mind, for every 100 basis points of collection percentage improvement, it represents almost $9 million annually. Please note that similar to last quarter, there is no benefit assumed to our guidance in either 2021 or 2022 from switching tenants from cash back to accrual basis accounting. 
The combination of these primary drivers of growth supplemented by forecasted upside in other parts of our business such as parking, sale investments and percentage rent gives us a clear and transparent path of growth, not only in 2022 but beyond into 2023 and '24. We couldn't be happier with our market position and expect to have sector-leading FFO growth over the next few years. 
And with that, operator, please open the line for questions."

So one, great to see that you already are putting out '23 and '24 guidance. So I mean I guess, it's going to be the standard thing you're going to sandbag those.

So I mean I guess, it's going to be the standard thing you're going to sandbag those. And next quarter, we'll see those numbers raise as well. But the bigger question here, Don, is what is actually going on at the properties at the operations everywhere that the recovery is so strong and the tenant demand is so strong, meaning a number of years ago, tenants were still coming to your centers taking space. They could see the consumers shopping at your properties. What has gone on now that it's supercharged? Is it just merely that these tenants don't have the threat of the online shopping? I mean it's just been incredible. And I know I've asked this question before, but the pace of demand across retail this quarter is just mind blowing. And it just really begs the question, were these really -- retailers really just holding back before? Or is it really fleshing out of the bad credit that's allowed you guys to have better space to rent to people who are willing to pay higher rents?"

Well, first of all, Alex, it's good to know that you're very predictable in terms of the first part of your statement. So without a question. But the -- in terms of the bigger -- in terms of the question you're asking, it's a whole bunch of things. I",387,"Yes. Well, first of all, Alex, it's good to know that you're very predictable in terms of the first part of your statement. So without a question. But the -- in terms of the bigger -- in terms of the question you're asking, it's a whole bunch of things. It's not just 1 thing. But certainly, the notion of the amount of time that a lot of people, certainly in our markets, have not been out and have been at home and have restrictions one way or the other. I've got to tell you, as you know, that gets old. And so I think you're seeing a revised, a rejuvenized if you will, love for socialization. I can tell you, any restaurant, certainly in New York, that you would say you would be -- you can't even get a reservation. And we're seeing that same thing throughout our properties. 
So people want to be out. Tenants are upgrading their space. And having the ability -- obviously, I'm talking our portfolio primarily, but having the ability to get into better real estate in a portfolio that was as low as 89% -- 89-some-odd percent leased. That's as rare as it gets [ for that ]. And so the ability to actually have a chance to upgrade, it's a huge truck as we've been talking about all the way through. So from a consumer perspective, you've certainly got the demand. From a real estate perspective and a tenant perspective, you certainly have the demand. And then the other side of it is -- and this surprised me. You can call it sandbagging or what, whatever. But it surprised me that we have not lost more tenants over the past 6 or 8 months in 2021. 
The notion of tenants holding on to their properties and finding a way to make it through and not wanting to lose their superior positions in real estate was greater than we expected. So the combination of not losing them, having availability from the 89% coming back up and the strong consumer demand. You put those 3 things together, and I think you've got the bulk of the answer to your question. And we, as I say, we don't see a change to that. At this point, it's continuing strong in an unabated way."

So for us, first of all, just to get it all in perspective, right, there is Assembly Row with office, Pike & Rose with office potential opportunities and it's Santana Row. In all 3 markets, the demand is there. The Santana West is a different kettle of fish because it's 1 big building that we're looking for 1 big tenant to take the whole thing. At Assembly, the -- what has happened to the building that was Puma and just Puma forever has been astonishing in the past period of time. There, you may see us able to announce another building next year. We're working it hard right now. But to your point, that is -- that demand could mean that there's a faster route to the next building. In terms of Pike & Rose, we certainly didn't expect to be announcing another office building here. As you know, building we just moved into, we were the only tenants in here on August 10, 2020. So the notion that this building is 90% or 89%, whatever it is, percent leased and our conversations with Choice, who originally started about this building, was such that we could not accommodate them. So that we needed if we wanted to do that deal to start another building, it's astonishing. 
And I don't think this is even handed throughout the country. Obviously, there's a whole question of what happens to office space as -- in terms of needs going forward over the next decade. But I know if you're in an amenity-rich environments with new buildings in places like we are, I know you're in the catbird seat because I'm seeing it in terms of the deals we're doing. So 1, maybe 2 buildings over the next year."

And so those 3 still are not back to where they're going to be and where we want them at all. So yes, there's outside growth at those properties because as -- I mean the office leasing is just 1 component of what we're seeing. And then you can imagine what it's doing to the retail side in terms of the leasing that's coming to fill space that hadn't been there before. So that growth will continue and will take all of 2022 and probably into 2023 where you'll continue to see that outsized growth from those 3 properties. They're special properties, man. That is where people want to be. It's also, as you can imagine, where people want to live. And so I think we're like 97% leased at our -- at the residential component of those assets. 
Certainly, we have some restrictions in the jurisdictions that they're in on the ability to increase rents in the case of Montgomery County and evict in the case of Somerville, Massachusetts.

I think we will be issuing -- we plan to be issuing about $150 million to $200 million of equity in the quarter, which will put some drag.

And then in terms of cadence of occupancy. I think next year -- by year-end, we should see continued growth in our occupancy percentage from the 90.2% where it is today, probably somewhere between 90.5% and 91% in that range.

And so when you take a -- you go from lease to actually getting a tenant open, we had better be proactive, and we have been extremely proactive about whether it be allowing for a larger lead time, whether it be moving ahead with work ineffectively before everything is all tied up. 
A big one, and Wendy mentioned this all the time, and that's how I know it must be pervasive, is using our relationships with our tenants to be able to divide up work for who has the best leverage in a situation to get the appropriate supplies or to trade some things out has been really effective. So I am certainly not expecting us to have significant delays throughout the year. There will certainly be examples where we do. There will be other examples where we'll beat it. But it -- but your point is important. It is a -- it has to be a very proactive and creative way to deal with something that is, in some respects, uncontrollable. So we'll see how that plays out. So far, so good. 
On the costs, really good thing that the biggest piece of our development pipeline is already locked in. And is -- even as I sit here in 909 Rose, our office building here, this building was built with 2018 money. And even though there's been a delay that's taken longer to effectively get it leased up, now that it has, those deals are really good deals on 2018 money. And so this will work out just fine. Same way at Santana, same way up an Assembly. On the new stuff, we got a lock in early best we can, lock in price escalation. We got a leverage buying power with bulk purchases. We have to solve source-alternate suppliers. It's all part of a very proactive and tightly controlled development organization. I think we're really good at it."

What -- so from our perspective, we don't say no to something at a 4 or say yes to something at a 6 based on that cap rate. We are looking at where we can create value in that real estate and honestly looking at IRR -- with IRR assumptions.

We took some space back. There were some issues that came up this quarter that put a little bit of a damper on our lease percentage momentum. But we would expect, given the leasing activity that we have and the leasing activity in unoccupied space that we see, we should see that should resume to a better than 10 basis point increase that you saw this quarter. 
I think one thing to comment on is that our occupied percentage grew 60 basis points. I don't think we had any impact. We got rent started and it was, I think, a strong quarter for that in terms of getting tenants in, getting them rent paying. And that's going to ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter.

The recovery has been stronger. And so percentage rent on those COVID-adjusted deals were higher. So I think, what did we have, $4.9 million in the quarter? When you think about $5 million, will it be $5 million times 4, $20 million for the year? No, it won't. This was -- it was a really good quarter, and some of those deals in percentage rent will convert back to fixed rent deals.

Cleaning them up and doing a better job on leasing, including in 1 case, potentially having a better grocery anchor. There is some densification opportunities at a couple of the properties for sure. And then gross bond is a little bit of a blank slate that we need to think through and figure out what we're going to do with all the leases of that property coming up in '25, and we're in that process. 
The goal there is to narrow the options by the end of the year and have some clear direction at some point in '22, but we're not quite there yet. But as you know, our view is always buy the best piece of land we can buy in terms of location and population density incomes, road network, all that good stuff. And then put on that piece of land what the market demands and generate as much rent as possible. And that's why we bought those deals. They all have those characteristics, and it's a little bit different at each one, but that's what we'll be doing."

And so I don't want to say that price breaker is not important. It's really important.

What is the likelihood of adding a fourth project to your big 3?

And when you look at the big 3, it's funny because we've been doing the big 3 for so long, everybody looks and says, ""Well, okay, what's the next one?"" But if you worked here and you try to figure out where you want to put capital incrementally to create the most value, time and time again, it will come down to the big 3 because we're not close to being done. 
And so the notion of adding incremental buildings to Santana Row, Pike & Rose and Assembly Row just kills the comparison with starting another mixed-use property that will take 2 decades to do. So it always comes down to capital allocation and where your alternatives are and what the smartest they do is. And that I think the mistake that some investors and analysts make are underestimating the level of growth and capital that is still yet to come at the big 3, some 10, 15, in the case of Santana, 20 years later."

And we are -- obviously have taken a much stronger position with them. We are not in COVID as an economy anywhere near the extent we were, obviously. And so to the extent those businesses can't survive in the existing business and going forward, maybe they don't belong here. And so we're taking a harder line on that side with respect to the balance. We certainly expect to get paid and will. So I'm not -- I don't -- the difference between 96% and 99%, 3%. I don't know whether it's 1/2 and 1/2 of those choices or 2/3 and 1/3, but it's something like that."

Your, there, Joe has put out some revised and updated plans for what he wants to see at Assembly. I guess, how close could we be to that next phase and incorporating the power center into sort of a larger project? And I know you talked about the big ,3, the fits that keep on giving. It feels like this is closer now, but I want to sort of get your sense of where things stand."

I don't think that the power center conversion to Assembly Row 9.0 or whatever it would be at that point is imminent. So I don't want you to think about it that way. It is obvious when you sit and you think about a long-term highest and best use of any piece of property, given what's happened at Assembly Row. And eventually, one day, there should be intensification on the power center site. But it is, it is years and years away. I don't -- heck, you won't pay me for 23, for Pete's sakes. Never mind whatever that's going to happen at that asset. But forgetting about that, look at the rest of Assembly Row. Look at the space between Partners Healthcare and our existing property and what happens to that, and it is -- we are looking very hard at life sciences sale, as you can imagine. 
And to the extent we can get the economics to make some sense. And obviously, construction costs are the biggest hurdle in that. But given what's happened to the adjacent properties, it's really clear to us that the assembly site in Somerville is going to be a life sciences site at some point, whether it's just the adjacencies or whether it includes us, will depend on whether we can make the numbers work or not. But that you should -- that is far more imminent certainly than the power center site."

I worry about everything going forward all the time. In this case, though, the thing that gives me confidence, and it's a lot of confidence, is I am sure that what we own and where it is, is really valuable. And so it's kind of like the office side. If -- we may be over-officed in this country now. right? We talked about being over retailed forever. We may be over-officed. But Federal Realty isn't because where we have that office and what is being built in terms of that office, if there's any office at all, it's going to be -- that demand is going to be at places like this that we own. I feel the same way on the retail. And so where you hear confidence for me, you don't hear confidence that everything is great in the world and is going to stay great in the world. I just know on a relative basis whatever is happening, we've got the right products. And that's where my confidence comes from."
