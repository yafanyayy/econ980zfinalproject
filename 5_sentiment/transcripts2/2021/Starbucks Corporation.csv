As I reflect on this past year, clearly, we have all been through a lot, a lot of trying times and a lot of change. And at a time when society and all of humanity are a bit fragile, I am optimistic because this year holds tremendous promise for healing. I believe Starbucks can play an important role in that healing process, bringing people together to feel connected, supporting our communities in a positive and responsible way and advancing a more equitable and inclusive world. 
It was just 1 year ago this week that we temporarily closed stores across China to protect our partners and customers from the coronavirus. We quickly realized the need to establish a set of principles for navigating this virus to operate safely in a global pandemic and then shared our principles and store protocols with every market around the world. That approach has served us well. And I'm proud to say today, our business in China recovered in Q1 in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to achieve full sales recovery of our U.S. business by the end of Q2. 
This journey has not been linear. And because we have operationalized our ability to monitor events in real time and adapt to the changing conditions store by store, our recovery continues to track slightly ahead of our expectations. 
Since the start of this pandemic, while being guided by our 3 fundamental principles, our 400,000 Starbucks partners around the world have been well equipped with tools, resources and support to enable quick decision making at the store level. The agility with which our partners navigated an unprecedentedly complex global situation, while caring for each other and for our customers, leaves me as confident as ever about Starbucks' long-term outlook. 
Last month, when we met for our biannual investor conference, we talked about Starbucks resilience. There were 3 takeaways from that discussion that I want to iterate as we share this quarter's results. First, our growth at scale agenda that we established almost 3 years ago has sharpened our focus, enabled disciplined execution, enhanced our ability to allocate capital to its highest and best uses and unleashed a growth mindset throughout Starbucks. Second, our speed and agility have enabled us to rapidly adapt to changing consumer behaviors and strengthened our competitive position. And third, we have an innovation agenda for our customer experience and for store transformation that positions us well for future growth. 
Now I want to share with you results from Q1 that reinforce our belief that Starbucks is stronger and more resilient than ever. Let me begin in the U.S. Our first quarter comparable store sales of minus 5% in the U.S. improved from the prior quarter's minus 9%. Even with pandemic-related business disruption in the latter half of the quarter, it significantly reduced our ability to offer in-store seating. With over 60% of our U.S. company-operated stores offering limited seating as we entered our fiscal Q1, comparable store sales improved in October, building on the momentum we saw in the prior quarter. When COVID-19 cases began to surge mid-quarter, we adjusted our operations to grab and go, in alignment with our principles and in support of regulatory requirements across a number of states. We rapidly adapted and ended the quarter with approximately 40% of our U.S. stores offering limited seating. 
Underpinned by our powerful innovation agenda, our phenomenal Green Apron partners delivered a very strong holiday performance in Q1, building positive momentum on our path to full U.S. comp recovery. Importantly, in Q1, we laid a solid foundation for achieving our fiscal 2021 goals by further advancing the 3 business driving initiatives fundamental to our Growth at Scale agenda, elevating the customer experience, driving relevant beverage innovation and expanding digital customer engagement. 
I will now share some notable highlights from Q1 and our traffic-driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021, starting with elevating the customer experience. We believe that many of our customers have adapted to their work- or study-from-home realities. Their Starbucks visit has evolved from the stop on the way to a destination, to being the destination worth leaving home for because it is safe, familiar and convenient. The work we have done to increase throughput in drive-through, expand our digital reach, enable curbside pickup and expand delivery capabilities was evident in Q1. U.S. stores with drive-throughs saw a slight improvement in out-the-windows times and delivered positive comps throughout Q1. They drove over half of net sales in Q1, increasing more than 10% from pre-pandemic levels. These results give us confidence that our targeted initiatives to unlock capacity and enhance the customer experience at our drive-through locations are boosting our business recovery while strengthening our foundation for future growth. 
Our industry-leading mobile app continues to be an important tool for us to elevate the customer experience as a safe, convenient and personalized way to order Starbucks. This quarter, mobile orders represented 25% of U.S. company-operated transactions in Q1, up from 17% before the pandemic, providing clear evidence that our initiatives are resonating with customers. We continue to see average ticket meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels, driven by group order, a combination of increased beverage attach, premium beverage mix, increased customization and upsizing and an all-time high food attachment all drove U.S. ticket growth of approximately 19% in Q1. 
In addition, our seasonal holiday beverage lineup, combined with our creative holiday marketing, created excitement amongst our Green Apron partners and drew customers into our stores. This year, we kicked off holiday with familiar beverages, such as Peppermint Mocha and of course, Starbucks Joyful Holiday Cups, a 23-year ritual. Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew's tremendous success in last quarter's lineup provided a strong prelude to the December return of the new holiday favorite, Irish Cream Cold Brew. Our cold beverages continued to resonate with customers, led by Iced White Chocolate Mocha, Iced Chai Latte and Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, with all 3 delivering positive year-on-year growth. 
Food outperformed our expectations in Q1, driven by strength in breakfast wraps, the Impossible Breakfast Sandwich and holiday bakery items, such as the Snowman Cookie and of course, my grandson's favorite, Cake Pops. 
Finally, we saw accelerated growth of digital customer relationships and customer engagement, a key highlight of the quarter. Following our successful launch of Stars For everyone in Q4, Starbucks Rewards achieved phenomenal results in Q1, providing a strong foundation for growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards member base, to whom we directly communicate and provide personalized offers, increased by 2.5 million members in Q1 to a record 21.8 million. Now this result surpassed our pre-COVID member base, representing a 15% increase relative to the same quarter in prior year. I'm also happy to say that this holiday season, Starbucks Card activations, the cornerstone of our holiday gift program, exceeded our expectations. Starbucks cards are a customer favorite for holiday gifting and are widely available through our stores and other distribution channels, including digitally. The success of Starbucks Cards illustrates the strong emotional bonds that we've created with customers and the relevance of the Starbucks Experience, even in the current environment. 
As the number of active Starbucks Rewards members grew during the quarter, so did their engagement. Rewards customers contributed 50% of U.S. company-operated sales in Q1, up from 43% last year before the onset of COVID-19 and up from 47% in the prior quarter, demonstrating our loyal customers' resilience and affinity for Starbucks. Any way you look at it, our first quarter results were quite strong in the U.S., particularly considering the headwind we faced from the current surge in COVID infections. 
I'll now move on to China, our second lead growth market. Building on the positive momentum from the past 2 quarters, the China leadership team delivered another great quarter, which is a testament to our ability to rapidly adapt to changing conditions, while focusing on the customer experience, new beverage innovation and continued expansion of digital customer relationships, just as we continue to do in the U.S. We delivered an impressive positive 5% comparable store sales growth in Q1. But what is most remarkable about our recovery in China is the rapid reacceleration of new store development, which is our #1 driver of growth in that market. 
I'm pleased to share that in Q1, we opened almost 160 stores and crossed the 4,800 store milestone. That equates to 13% growth in net new stores over the last 12 months, which is particularly impressive considering that we suspended new store development activities for a couple of months at the onset of the pandemic in China. We entered 15 new cities in the quarter, and stores in these cities are off to a strong start with customer traffic outperforming that of new stores in other cities in China. The performance of these new stores underscores our continued confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for Starbucks in China. 
We continue to dramatically expand digital customer relationships in China through the Starbucks Rewards program, as evidenced by the number of 90-day active Rewards members growing to 15.4 million in Q1, a record increase of 51% versus the prior year and 14% over the previous quarter. In addition, we achieved record sales for this year's Double 11 campaign which grew by 86% versus last year. And we also set a single day retail sales record on our Starbucks Rewards members night. Member engagement campaigns and additional functionalities launched through our Starbucks app and mini apps boosted member engagement and frequency throughout the quarter. In fact, with Starbucks Now Mobile Order and Pay services available across 99% of our store base and with Starbucks Delivers in 85% of our store base in China, mobile order sales mix hit a record 30% of the company's China sales, up from 26% in the last quarter, with 14% driven by Starbucks Delivers and 16% from Starbucks Now. 
Rewards customer engagement continues to grow as mobile ordering has more than doubled in China over the past year. Starbucks remains Chinese consumers' first choice in the away-from-home coffee category and is the most talked about coffee brand on social media in China. The brand is stronger than ever in our fastest-growing market. 
And finally, a few comments on our Channel Development business. The strategic value of our Channel Development segment in the current environment is clear. The availability of Starbucks products through multiple channels has secured Starbucks' leadership position in the category, acting as a brand amplifier for our specialty coffee retail business. The demand we saw last quarter in Starbucks at-home coffee remained high, boosting our share of the coffee market outside of specialty retail. In the U.S., Starbucks' share of total packaged coffee grew significantly in the quarter, with dollar sales up nearly 14%, nearly twice the category average. The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle has been a powerful partnership. And I'm proud to say that for the first time ever, we finished calendar year 2020 as the #1 coffee brand across the entire coffee category. Think about it. Starbucks is now the #1 coffee brand ahead of all premium and mainstream choices. 
In addition, consumption of our U.S. ready-to-drink coffee products, in partnership with PepsiCo, grew 18% in the quarter. The introduction of ready-to-drink Nitro Cold Brew, which was the #1 innovation in the category last year, exceeded sales expectations. Unsurprisingly, our foodservice business continues to be impacted in the current environment with softness in workplace coffee consumption as well as business and leisure travel, which was partially offset by overall strength in our at-home coffee and ready-to-drink businesses. 
With Nestle, we entered 4 new markets in the quarter, bringing Starbucks at-home coffee presence through the Global Coffee Alliance to 66 markets in just over 2 years. Overall, we are proud of our alliance with Nestle, and pleased with the accelerated global expansion of the Starbucks brand through our channels business. 
Now before I hand the call over to Pat, I want to close by sharing a perspective and recognizing my Starbucks partners. Throughout this year, Starbucks will celebrate our 50th anniversary as a company. And in that 50 years, since 1971, the most important ingredient that has created this iconic company are the Starbucks partners who share a powerful connection to our mission, a mission grounded in human experience and brought to life through our values and company culture. It is those same Starbucks partners who are navigating a global pandemic, caring for one another, creating welcoming experiences for our customers, showing up in our communities, bringing new ideas and accelerating innovation and rapidly adapting to our new reality every step of the way, showing the compassion and courage necessary to transform into this new version of Starbucks, a company that is more resilient, stronger than ever and fully committed to a bright future full of adventure, growth and positive impact on those we touch. And as markets around the world worked tirelessly to vaccinate billions of people, we are prepared for what can only be described as the great human reconnection where people once again connect with others face to face, to heal, to belong, to reflect, to share and to celebrate, to celebrate what it means to be part of humanity. And to Starbucks Partners, we are here for that great human reconnection where our third place environment once again brings people together, if even for a brief moment to uplift our customers with a smile, a personal connection, a handcrafted beverage and a place where all are welcome. Starbucks was built for this moment. And to my Starbucks Partners around the world, we all know that our purpose goes far beyond the pursuit of profit. This is our moment, and I am proud to be your partner. I'm grateful for everything you do for Starbucks, for each other, for our customers and for the communities we are all a part of. I am optimistic about our shared future. And I want to say thank you. 
Now before he walks you through our Q1 results, I want to close by sharing my sincere gratitude for Pat Grismer. He has helped lead us through unprecedented change and transformative growth at an amazing pace in his time with Starbucks. And he has played an instrumental role in unlocking considerable shareholder value over the past 2 years. I appreciate Pat's partnership with the entire leadership team at Starbucks and the lasting legacy he's leaving. Pat, as you prepare to retire, I want to thank you and wish you the very best in your next chapter. You leave the company in the great hands of a 16-year partner, Rachel Ruggeri, who is incredibly well positioned to assume the mantle of Starbucks' Chief Financial Officer on February 1. Having worked closely together for many years, I look forward to partnering with you, Rachel, as you lead our finance function and contribute as a valuable partner on our executive leadership team. 
Further, as you all may have seen today, Roz has accepted an incredible opportunity as Chief Executive Officer at another publicly traded company. She will be leaving Starbucks at the end of February, and her next role is expected to be disclosed in the days ahead. In the meantime, I want to share that we're very excited for her and are grateful for her many contributions over the years in leading our operations across the America. Roz, on behalf of the entire leadership team, I want to thank you for your leadership and wish you every success in your new role. Congratulations. 
With these shifts, I am immensely proud to have a very strong bench of Starbucks veterans who represent the next generation of leadership for our company. Rachel Ruggeri succeeding Pat as CFO; and as we flatten the organization, Rossann Williams, President of our North America Retail business; and Brady Brewer, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, will now be reporting directly to me, taking on what had previously been responsibilities of our Chief Operating Officer. Combined, these 3 talented leaders have more than 45 years of Starbucks experience, and we will not miss a beat. 
Rachel, Rossann and Brady, building on your passion, authenticity and many years of success at Starbucks, I am excited about our next phase of Starbucks growth together. I'd like to thank all of my partners for their support as we are well positioned for the future. 
And now with that, I will turn the call over to Pat. Pat?"

As Kevin shared, we are very pleased with our start to fiscal '21 with meaningful sequential improvements in quarterly financial results despite ongoing business disruption from the pandemic, again demonstrating the new level of resilience that we have introduced into the business during these unprecedented times. 
Starbucks reported global revenue of $6.7 billion in Q1, down 5% from the prior year. Q1 EPS was higher than the guidance range we provided on our last earnings call, primarily driven by better-than-expected margin recovery. Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.53 declined from $0.74 in the prior year but outperformed our guidance range as it also benefited from lower-than-expected restructuring and impairment costs, as I will discuss in greater detail later. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, down from $0.79 in the prior year, primarily due to the lingering impact of the pandemic. 
I will first take you through our Q1 fiscal '21 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. I will then share some perspective on our outlook for Q2 and the full fiscal year. 
Our Americas segment delivered revenue of $4.7 billion in Q1, 6% lower than the prior year, primarily due to a 6% decline in comparable store sales as well as lower product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees as a result of the pandemic. As Kevin mentioned, in the U.S., we saw continued sequential improvement in quarterly comparable store sales from minus 9% in the prior quarter to minus 5% in Q1. As we entered Q1, October improved modestly to minus 3% from minus 4% in September. Then as the quarter progressed, U.S. comparable store sales were minus 4% and minus 8% in November and December, respectively, primarily due to pandemic-related operating restrictions across several states, which impacted customer mobility. As Kevin also noted, approximately 40% of our U.S. company-operated store base was offering limited seating at the end of the quarter, down from more than 60% at the beginning of the quarter. So we are quite pleased with our comparable store sales performance in Q1 in light of these increasing restrictions. 
Americas' Q1 non-GAAP operating margin contracted 320 basis points from the prior year to 18.8%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, including sales deleverage and additional costs incurred as well as growth in retail partner wages and benefits. These impacts were partially offset by improved labor efficiency, driven in part by order consolidation and sales mix shift as well as pricing. Notably, this represented a significant improvement from the previous quarter's non-GAAP operating margin of 16.7%. 
Moving on to international. The international segment delivered revenue of $1.7 billion in Q1. Excluding a 5% favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the segment's revenue in the quarter was flat relative to the prior year, reflecting 8% net new store growth over the past 12 months, offset by lower product sales to, and royalties from, our international licensees as well as a 3% decline in comparable store sales, primarily due to COVID-19, inclusive of a 3% VAT benefit. 
In China, comparable store sales grew 5% in Q1, including VAT favorability of nearly 5 percentage points or slightly positive when excluding the impact of VAT for the quarter. In line with our previous outlook, we substantially recovered our sales in China by the end of calendar 2020, even when excluding the temporary VAT benefit, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand in our fastest-growing market. In December, China's comparable store sales were up 4% or only slightly negative when excluding the nearly 5 percentage point VAT exemption benefit for the month, an improvement from both October and November when excluding each month's VAT exemption benefit and setting aside the mid-Autumn festival seasonal shift that benefited October. 
International's non-GAAP operating margin declined by 100 basis points to 20.4%, mainly due to sales deleverage as a result of the pandemic, partially offset by improved labor efficiency. Much like the Americas, this represented a very significant improvement from the previous quarter's non-GAAP operating margin of 16.3%.
On to Channel Development. Revenue was $371 million in Q1, a decline of 25% from the prior year, primarily due to a 22% unfavorable impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business. When excluding the impact of these transition-related activities, Channel Development's revenue declined by 3% in Q1, mainly driven by the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the segment's foodservice business, partially offset by growth in our ready-to-drink business. The segment's non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 48.7% in Q1 from 36.6% in the prior year. Normalizing for the 840 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 370 basis points in Q1, driven primarily by the strength of our ready-to-drink business. 
Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin was 15.5% in Q1, down from 18.2% year-over-year, but a substantial improvement from 13.2% in Q4. Unsurprisingly, much of the year-over-year reduction in our operating margin for Q1 was due to sales deleverage attributable to COVID-19 as well as growth in wages and benefits, partially offset by store labor efficiencies and pricing in the Americas. 
Moving on to our guidance for fiscal '21 and starting with GAAP EPS. In Q1, GAAP EPS was $0.16 higher than the upper end of our guidance range, primarily reflecting lower-than-expected restructuring costs related to our trade area transformation initiative. This upside was attributable to 2 things: First, a shift in the timing of store closures to future quarters; and second, a reduction in average restructuring cost per closed store. As we expect these lower restructuring costs to sustain, we are raising our full year fiscal '21 GAAP EPS guidance by $0.08 from a range of $2.34 to $2.54, to a new range of $2.42 to $2.62, both inclusive of approximately $0.10 for the 53rd week. 
Now moving to non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our strong start to the year, combined with a tailwind from foreign currency translation as evidenced in our Q1 results, provides optimism that we have the potential to exceed our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance, barring, of course, any new significant and sustained waves of COVID-19 infections and any major economic disruptions. However, given where we are at in our fiscal year with 3 quarters to go and considering that we're continuing to see volatility from the pandemic, we believe it is prudent to provide a comprehensive guidance update with our second quarter earnings report, by which time we'll have much better visibility to full year results. 
Therefore, setting aside the updated fiscal '21 GAAP EPS guidance I just mentioned, we reaffirm all other full year fiscal '21 guidance for now, including non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.90, again inclusive of approximately $0.10 for the extra week. We will, however, provide guidance for selected Q2 metrics given our better visibility to near-term trends, which provide further evidence of recovery in line with our overall expectations. In the U.S., we expect to report a comparable store sales decline of approximately 2% for the month of January, representing a marked improvement from December's 8% decline. Then as we lap material adverse COVID-19 impacts in the month of March, we expect U.S. comparable store sales growth of approximately 5% to 10% for the second quarter. This is consistent with our previous outlook that we would achieve full sales recovery in our U.S. business by the end of Q2 with a 2-quarter lag beyond that before we expect to see full margin recovery. 
In China, we are seeing another wave of COVID-19 infections in selected provinces and a corresponding impact to customer mobility and store operating protocols. In addition, we started to lap material adverse COVID-19 impacts last week, and this will continue through the remainder of Q2. Combining these 2 items, we expect to report a comparable store sales decline of approximately 7% for the month of January and comparable store sales growth of nearly 100% for the second quarter, reflecting very significant lapping effects in the months of February and March. On a 2-year basis, that would equate to roughly flat compound growth in the second quarter as we move through the 1-year anniversary of COVID-related store closures and return to our long-term growth algorithm in China. 
From an EPS perspective in Q2, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.36 to $0.41 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.45 to $0.50. These estimates reflect the comparable store sales growth estimates that I just provided as well as the normal margin seasonality we see in our business comparing Q2 to our holiday-driven Q1. To be clear, except for GAAP EPS, the rest of our full year fiscal '21 guidance metrics are unchanged from what we communicated with our Q4 fiscal '20 quarterly earnings report. This includes our expectation that our retail operating segments will deliver significant margin improvement on a non-GAAP basis as fiscal '21 progresses, yielding meaningfully higher EPS in the third and fourth quarters than the first 2 quarters of the year. 
To summarize, we are delighted with the pace of business recovery in Q1 and the momentum that it provides for fiscal '21. Our China market has substantially recovered, although it is experiencing recent volatility. And our U.S. business is on track to fully recover in the current quarter as we previously communicated. As a result, we remain confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of our growth model. I want to express my appreciation to our Green Apron partners for the critical role that they continue to play in our overall business recovery.
Before I conclude, I would like to thank Kevin and the Starbucks team. It has been an honor to be a Starbucks partner, and I am proud of what we have accomplished as a team to unlock considerable shareholder value over the past 2 years. I am thrilled to pass the CFO baton to Rachel Ruggeri, a key member of our senior finance team.

I think that's a function of how vaccinations unfold in different markets around the world and how quickly people get back to more normal foot traffic patterns and more normal work and school patterns. 
And let me just ask if, Roz, if you want to add any additional perspective on that as it relates to the U.S."

Kevin mentioned the higher beverage attach, the higher food attach. There's also the shift to cold beverages. And what we see in cold beverages is a couple of things. If you think about the decline in transactions that we've seen in our central business districts in our metro markets, those areas carry single beverages. And they were higher-than-average brewed coffee, and those grew really at a lower range in our ticket options. So what we're doing in beverage innovation is replacing that with cold beverages and replacing that with plant-based. And so that's why we're seeing this improved food attach. And so we feel confident that those kinds of innovations are going to keep that ticket higher than what we've seen in the past."

But there will be, as customer behavior normalizes some reversal of some of that margin benefit. But it's important to highlight some of the other ongoing initiatives underway in our store operations to build new levels of productivity, whether the deployment of handheld POS to improve throughput at the drive-through and how we believe that will not only increase our capacity but deliver some margin enhancements, or what we're doing to deploy new equipment, both new espresso machines as well as new ovens that help us to reduce transaction times out the window, or just ongoing operational engineering work to ensure that our operating routines as we've adopted new protocols continue to achieve higher levels of efficiency in terms of how we deploy our labor. So there are a number of other activities underway that will drive new levels of productivity and unlock further margin benefit even as some of the sales activity normalizes and with that reverses some of the margin benefit that we've seen here recently."

So we have quite a bit of work happening around our service experience and everything that we're seeing around the drive-through. We have so many of our stores in the drive-through position right now. 
First of all, let me speak about our future real estate. When we looked at our most productive model, it is the drive-through. So in our go-forward position, you'll see an increased number of drive-throughs that we're building in the central United States and across the southeast and the southwest. So drive-through, in terms of numbers, will grow. 
Also, too, there are 3 main approaches that we have to enhance the drive-through productivity. First of all is to optimize the current state. And that's looking at our operations standards, and that's the focus on driving our increase out the window times. And so that's reinforcing all of our processes in store, making sure that our baristas can operate efficiently, and that's the ongoing work that we will do. The second piece is we're developing and testing some drive-through forward solutions, and that includes our handheld POS which, right now, we have about 300 drive-through stores with handheld POS, and we'll have 500 of those stores by the end of February. And so we're also adding to that the tech improvement to make orders more easily managed through our consolidation in handoff. We call that our bump bar replacement. And then in addition, we're also targeting the renovation of 150 drive-through-constrained stores that have either issues in terms of meeting the new productivity model from an engine design or removing the pastry case and getting things situated on a single point-of-sale and other solutions. And then there's a final piece, the future drive-through concepts, and those are things like drive-thru-only stores that have no seating, very small units, the side-by-side drive-through lanes that we are bringing on to the footprint. So it's -- we've got considerable work in this area to unlock the full potential for drive-through."

That's the first question. 
And then secondly, if I can sneak it in, considering that the transactions, which are down, offset obviously by -- via by ticket, labor hours presumably are down at the store. Do you have a sense of how variable labor should be? In other words, if transactions increase by 10%, is there a type of percent that you would think labor hours should increase as we kind of think about rebuilding the models for the out years?"

And this -- and Deep Brew is our work that allows us to apply AI to our equipment and the processes in the store, and that's improving productivity within the store.

And that's particularly important as we expect continued sales recovery and then back into growth in the back half of the year. And even as we continue to make significant new investments the P&L in order to unlock future growth opportunity, we fully expect very meaningful sales leverage that comes with what we target as an approximate 50% flow through on those variable sales, and that includes what we derive by way of leverage on fixed labor. So there is a variable labor component that is embedded in that calculation. But importantly, it acknowledges that there is a fair portion of our total cost structure inclusive of labor that is fixed in terms of how we operate these stores. So as we recover sales and further build from that point, we anticipate margin expansion as a consequence of sales leverage that helps to offset the impact of the additional investments we're making to unlock future growth."

Thanks for the question, Sara. Clearly, we're very proud of the work the team in China has done to navigate the COVID situation and the current surge that we're seeing in the market to basically substantially recover and in line with our expectations for the quarter and deliver a 5% comp, a top line growth rate of 15% and an acceleration of new stores to 160 in the quarter. It's really remarkable given the current environment that we're operating in. We continue to be very optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity and the continued recovery that is going to take place throughout this fiscal year. Our new stores continue to perform very well. As I said, we opened 160 stores, 13% growth over the last 12 months. And that includes a time period where we slowed down or halted all store growth as we navigated the COVID crisis beginning last year at this time. We're seeing really strong performance and uptick with the Starbucks Now expansion. We're open in 24 cities -- I'm sorry, opened 24 stores in 9 different cities in the quarter, and we have a total of 40 stores, and we'll continue to expand that concept. 
And then the last piece beyond the store piece is the acceleration of digital and the digital footprint. And Kevin hit on this a little bit in his comments, but this is also fueling the growth during the pandemic as we navigate. Our 90-day actives increased to 15.4 million members. That's a 56% increase over the previous year. And that's 14% increase over the previous quarter, which is great. And then clearly, mobile order sales mix at 30% with MOP at 16% and deliver at 14% is strong growth. So our total mobile order sales are now 2x what they were last year at this time. So clearly, we have put in place a model that has been able to navigate the pandemic environment, and we feel very optimistic in delivering the guidance that path put forward of achieving 100% -- 100% comp for the second quarter and relatively flat growth on a 2-year basis for the market."

And Sara, to build on what John has said, to put into perspective how we're thinking about comp growth in China long term. You may recall at our December 2018 investor conference, we guided China comp growth of 1% to 3%. In recent quarters, we had delivered in the low single digits. And we acknowledged at the time that as a consequence of a more tempered pace of growth in the broader economy, intensified competition and the sales transfer that comes from an aggressive pace of new unit development, that 1% to 3% was a reasonable expectation. Fast forward to our Investor Day just a couple of months ago, where we updated that to a new range of 2% to 4%. 
I would say in relation to the factors I mentioned, no material change to the economy, competition or sales transfer. But importantly, as John mentioned, significant improvements in our digital capability and how that has all resonated with our customers in China, which underpins our confidence in raising that long-term comp guidance range for China to this 2% to 4%, which we believe is quite powerful in the context of very aggressive unit development given the strong appeal of our brand and the outstanding unit level economics that deliver superior returns for us in China."

My question is on the labor side of things, which seems to be very topical and happy to hear you guys talk about ongoing efficiencies. But when people talk about labor lately, it seems like there's a lot of opposing forces. Obviously, you have the national minimum wage potentially going up on one [indiscernible] then you have the elevated unemployment, which historically implies ample labor and therefore, managing your cost better. So just wondering if you can provide any thoughts in terms of your labor cost and maybe employee availability outlook. I know you guys are an employer of choice, but your ability to offset the pressure, whether it through cost saves, technology, menu pricing, how you kind of think about those offsetting forces from a labor cost perspective?"

But fundamentally, look, we believe in investing in our partners. It is our Green Apron partners who create that experience for our customers. And so we know when we invest in our partners and put them in the position to do the best job they can in serving our customers that our customer connection scores go up and our traffic goes up and our sales go up. There's a direct correlation between investment in partners, customer connection scores and traffic increase. And I think that's the first thing to note. So that's why you saw us make a fairly significant increase in wage and benefits here in the U.S. as we went into this fiscal year. 
Second, then we find ways to help offset some of that in 2 ways. Number one is just productivity and throughput. We have a 20,000 square foot Tryer Center. We call it our Tryer Center. And think of it as a Silicon Valley incubation lab right downstairs here in Seattle. And we have some of the world's best, human-centered design engineers that work down there with our partners to find ways to help them improve that productivity. Oftentimes, it has to do with the store layout. Oftentimes, it has to do with the equipment, what kinds of ovens, what's the -- how can we make things easier for partners to do their jobs. And so that helps offset some of that increase in wage. And then the other is automating administrative tasks, things that -- whether it's -- we've got Deep Brew helping automate inventory management stores, helping reduce the amount of time that partners have to count inventory and fill out forms, and now technology is playing a role doing that. 
Other examples, our Mastrena 2 machines that we're putting in our stores have -- are instrumented with Internet of Things sensors in them. And those sensors, every shot of espresso, it sends telemetry data back to our data center. And through machine learning, we can predict when one of our Mastrena machines needs to be maintained or needs to be cleaned or calibrated. And by doing that, we prevent the situation where perhaps a partner comes to open the store in the morning and warning them when one of the Mastrena machines is down. So technology to automate administrative tasks that help provide the best environment for our partners to do what they do best, which is handcrafted beverages and connecting with our customers, and then the way that we get productivity by just thinking about the human-centered design experience we create for partners in the stores, that helps to offset the increase. 
And Pat, I hand to you to help add a little bit more numerics around that."

More recently at our Investor Day, we raised that to a range of 4% to 5%, and that is entirely the result of our confidence in the returns that we will get on these investments, led by investments in our partners, but also significant investments in our digital platforms and what that does to unlock the full sales potential of a Starbucks brand, yielding significant sales leverage that not only pays for these investments, but enables what we continue to expect by way of modest annual margin expansion, which is a fundamental part of our ability to convert revenue growth long term of 8% to 10%, to operating income growth of 9% to 11%. 
So as Kevin mentioned, all of these things work together, investment, combined with productivity, to combine further with sales leverage, to land the ongoing margin expansion that forms a fundamental part of our overall earnings growth model."

Kevin, a question for you following the announcements that Roz and Pat will be departed in the coming weeks. While the business will be in the very capable hands of partners that have been with Starbucks for over 15 years, where are you going to be leaning in the near term to help ensure continuity in the recovery?"

Certainly, with -- on the CFO side, Rachel has been a long-term Starbucks partner in our finance organization and supporting the Americas. She is fully up to speed on Starbucks and all things related to driving this business. And so great confidence there. 
In Roz's organization, as I flatten the organization, I'm going to take Rossann Williams and Brady Brewer direct to me. Rossann has been running our U.S. North American business now for over 2 years, doing a great job on that. And Brady is our Chief Marketing Officer. 
So certainly, I think that stability of leaders running North America and the stability of Rachel and her knowledge of the Americas and stepping into the global CFO role gives me great confidence. 
And I'll say this. We've got a very strong bench of talent in Starbucks. And what you're seeing is the next generation of leadership stepping into these roles. And I've got great confidence in them. So certainly, I'm going to continue to do what I do, which is we work as a leadership team. We work together as a team based on trust, transparency and teamwork. And these leaders, Rossann and Brady have been on the executive leadership team now for over a year. Rachel will join us on the leadership team, but we won't miss a beat. 
And very grateful to both Pat and Roz for their contribution, because not only did they contribute, but they also built great successors in their roles, and I'm very grateful."

So we were very pleased with our Q1 result with non-GAAP EPS exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by approximately $0.08. Picking that apart, about $0.05 of that favorability was driven by our business segment performance, including better-than-expected margins in both the Americas and International. Another $0.02 we'd attribute to favorable foreign currency translation. And the remaining $0.01 attributable to a lower-than-expected tax rate, which is driven by unplanned discrete tax benefits. 
As to the business performance, we do expect that momentum to sustain balance of the year. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we believe that it is possible that we can deliver full year results ahead of the guidance we've given. However, when you consider where we're at in our fiscal year with 3 quarters to go and when you also consider the continued volatility in the operating environment, it's prudent to hold at this stage. And that's what we've chosen to do. We've decided to hold our full year non-GAAP guidance. Until we close Q2 and have half the year under our belt, we will then have much better visibility to the back half of the year and can make a more considered call on what guidance update may be appropriate at that point in time. But we are very encouraged by what we've seen thus far. Even with the recent volatility we've seen in China, we could not be more delighted with the accelerated recovery we've seen in our U.S. business going from a minus 8% comp in December to a minus 2% comp in January, well on our way to achieving the full sales recovery that we outlooked for the U.S. business by the end of our second quarter, fully expecting the quarter to come in at 5% to 10% sales growth. That's comparable sales growth for our U.S. business. 
So when you add it all up, there's every reason to be optimistic It's just a matter of prudence, again, given where we're at in our year and the fact that the pandemic is still impacting our business in different ways, but we're really pleased with the resilience we've built into our business, and that's reflected in our results."

For Kevin and Roz, I think, you talked about the strength in food and the higher food attach. I think generally, food has been a pretty strong contributor to sales and comp for the last several years now. But it's all like maybe food has been a little bit deemphasized over the last couple of years given the increased focus on beverage.  Wondering if you could -- based on what you've seen recently in the last few quarters, specifically this last quarter, does it change -- and maybe how you're thinking about customer behaviors changing going forward, does it change at all how you're thinking about the food opportunity going forward from here, whether it's anything different on innovation, potential partnerships or just leaning in a bit more on that opportunity?"

Let me share our perspective, and then Roz, I will hand you to add a bit more from the U.S. perspective. But Dennis, strategically, we are a beverage-first company. We are in the business of handcrafted beverages, personalized for each and every customer around coffee and tea. And it's that experience we create around handcrafted beverages. And that's why we amplify -- we talk about our innovation, it's around customer experience, it's around relevant new beverage innovation, and it's around digital customer relationships. And by focusing and understanding that we are a beverage-first company, that what we do is create that experience around those handcrafted beverages, has been very important in the growth that we've been driving. And so we talk about that a lot. We focus on that a lot because that is, at the end of the day, what is a significant differentiator for Starbucks. 
Now we then attach food. And so I'm not saying food is not important, but we're very clear strategically, the most important thing is to be on the front foot and innovate and drive those relevant beverage platforms and then differentiate through the fact that our Starbucks partners in our stores handcraft those beverages personally for each and every customer, and then we attach food. 
Now when we attach food, our R&D teams have been very thoughtful about how to have the food menu be relevant to the dayparts and to the beverages that we sell. And they've done a phenomenal job with that over the years. And if I were to say, what is the -- probably the most dominant shift in consumer behavior is this whole shift to plant-based. And that is a shift both in beverage and in food. On the beverage side, this is why we've introduced all the alternative milks, whether it's almond milk, soy milk, oat milk. All of that's important. And then on the food side, you see what we've done with things like the Impossible Sausage Breakfast Sandwich, and you're seeing more and more plant-based proteins in our food menu. And in fact, we have one Starbucks store here in the Seattle area that we've gone to 100% plant-based food menu. We use that as sort of a test area when we innovate, create things here in our support center, the Tryer Center, we test in that store. So if I think about both beverage and food, the #1 trend that I would highlight there is just the consumer shift and consumer preferences around plant-based.  
And Roz, let me hand it to you, you might have some additional numbers and color to add to that. But I think at a macro level, those are the 2 most important points, I think, Dennis."

What this is also allowing us to do is to make great coffee as well because now we're learning how to match and pour coffee with great food and beverage items so that we bring together both a food and beverage combination. So the work ahead of us, by no means, minimize this food. Actually, we see it as a golden opportunity for us to just further expand our presence and create quality food attach items to go along with great coffee."

So there has been a bit of a delay relative to what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. And that's entirely a function of how thoughtfully the team is continuing to refine the store closure plans based on how we read the impacts we're seeing from stores as they are closed in terms of both sales transfer and margin with a view to continue to optimize as we go. But we're as committed to that program now as we were at the start of the year and even back to June when we first announced it and then subsequently expanded the program. 
As to the margin impact, we continue to expect about a 40 basis point improvement to our consolidated margin or our enterprise margin on a full year basis. So even with a slight delay to some of the closure activity, we continue to expect meaningful margin expansion as a result of this initiative."

First off, the daypart impact, we're really seeing an uptick in the morning daypart. But pretty much the recovery is taking place across all dayparts consistently. But from a digital Mobile Order and Pay perspective, we are seeing an uptick on the morning side. 
In terms of the ticket as it relates to digital, we are seeing ticket consistent with what we've seen previously. Generally, in China, our ticket runs a bit higher than the U.S. under normal circumstances. That is because of group ordering. And I would say our ticket is living up to that, living up to that historical performance. 
The other aspect that we're seeing is social gifting. And social gifting is a big piece of digital in China. We've introduced that as part of the Rewards program, and we're seeing a nice uptick of that as well. So very pleased with the progress the team is making there.

A lot of it will depend on how consumers increasingly migrate to those alternative milks, not just in our business but broadly in a way that supports increased production, which should over time reduce the cost. And then we have the opportunity to reevaluate whether at some stage, it makes sense to change our pricing practices.

As I reflect on this past year, clearly, we have all been through a lot, a lot of trying times and a lot of change. And at a time when society and all of humanity are a bit fragile, I am optimistic because this year holds tremendous promise for healing. I believe Starbucks can play an important role in that healing process, bringing people together to feel connected, supporting our communities in a positive and responsible way and advancing a more equitable and inclusive world.  
It was just 1 year ago this week that we temporarily closed stores across China to protect our partners and customers from the coronavirus. We quickly realized the need to establish a set of principles for navigating this virus to operate safely in a global pandemic and then shared our principles and store protocols with every market around the world. That approach has served us well. And I'm proud to say today, our business in China recovered in Q1 in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to achieve full sales recovery of our U.S. business by the end of Q2.  
This journey has not been linear. And because we have operationalized our ability to monitor events in real time and adapt to the changing conditions store by store, our recovery continues to track slightly ahead of our expectations. Since the start of this pandemic, while being guided by our 3 fundamental principles, our 400,000 Starbucks partners around the world have been well equipped with tools, resources and support to enable quick decision-making at the store level. The agility with which our partners navigated an unprecedentedly complex global situation, while caring for each other and for our customers, leaves me as confident as ever about Starbucks' long-term outlook.  
Last month, when we met for our biennial investor conference, we talked about Starbucks' resilience. There were 3 takeaways from that discussion that I want to iterate as we share this quarter's results. First, our Growth at Scale agenda that we established almost 3 years ago has sharpened our focus, enabled disciplined execution, enhanced our ability to allocate capital to its highest and best uses and unleashed a growth mindset throughout Starbucks. Second, our speed and agility have enabled us to rapidly adapt to changing consumer behaviors and strengthened our competitive position. And third, we have an innovation agenda for our customer experience and for store transformation that positions us well for future growth.  
Now I want to share with you results from Q1 that reinforce our belief that Starbucks is stronger and more resilient than ever. Let me begin in the U.S. Our first quarter comparable store sales of minus 5% in the U.S. improved from the prior quarter's minus 9%. Even with pandemic-related business disruption in the latter half of the quarter with significantly reduced our ability to offer in-store seating, with over 60% of our U.S. company-operated stores offering limited seating as we entered our fiscal Q1, comparable store sales improved in October, building on the momentum we saw in the prior quarter. When COVID-19 cases began to surge mid-quarter, we adjusted our operations to grab and go, in alignment with our principles and in support of regulatory requirements across a number of states. We rapidly adapted and ended the quarter with approximately 40% of our U.S. stores offering limited seating.  
Underpinned by our powerful innovation agenda, our phenomenal Green Apron partners delivered a very strong holiday performance in Q1, building positive momentum on our path to full U.S. comp recovery. Importantly, in Q1, we laid a solid foundation for achieving our fiscal 2021 goals by further advancing the 3 business-driving initiatives fundamental to our Growth at Scale agenda: elevating the customer experience; driving relevant beverage innovation; and expanding digital customer engagement.  
I will now share some notable highlights from Q1 and our traffic-driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021, starting with elevating the customer experience. We believe that many of our customers have adapted to their work- or study-from-home realities. Their Starbucks visit has evolved from the stop on the way to a destination to being the destination worth leaving home for because it is safe, familiar and convenient. 
The work we have done to increase throughput in drive-through, expand our digital reach, enable curbside pickup and expand delivery capabilities was evident in Q1. U.S. stores with drive-throughs saw a slight improvement in out-the-window times and delivered positive comps throughout Q1. They drove over half of net sales in Q1, increasing more than 10% from pre-pandemic levels. These results give us confidence that our targeted initiatives to unlock capacity and enhance the customer experience at our drive-through locations are boosting our business recovery while strengthening our foundation for future growth.  
Our industry-leading mobile app continues to be an important tool for us to elevate the customer experience as a safe, convenient and personalized way to order Starbucks. This quarter, mobile orders represented 25% of U.S. company-operated transactions in Q1, up from 17% before the pandemic, providing clear evidence that our initiatives are resonating with customers. We continue to see average ticket meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels, driven by group order. A combination of increased beverage attach, premium beverage mix, increased customization and upsizing, and an all-time high food attachment all drove U.S. ticket growth of approximately 19% in Q1.  
In addition, our seasonal holiday beverage lineup, combined with our creative holiday marketing, created excitement amongst our Green Apron partners and drew customers into our stores. This year, we kicked off holiday with familiar beverages, such as Peppermint Mocha and, of course, Starbucks joyful holiday cups, a 23-year ritual. Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew's tremendous success in last quarter's lineup provided a strong prelude to the December return of the new holiday favorite, Irish Cream Cold Brew. Our cold beverages continued to resonate with customers, led by Iced White Chocolate Mocha, Iced Chai Latte and Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, with all 3 delivering positive year-on-year growth.  
Food outperformed our expectations in Q1, driven by strength in breakfast wraps, the Impossible Breakfast Sandwich, and holiday bakery items such as the Snowman Cookie and, of course, my grandson's favorite, cake pops.  
Finally, we saw accelerated growth of digital customer relationships and customer engagement, a key highlight of the quarter. Following our successful launch of Stars for Everyone in Q4, Starbucks Rewards achieved phenomenal results in Q1, providing a strong foundation for growth in fiscal 2021 and beyond. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards member base, to whom we directly communicate and provide personalized offers, increased by 2.5 million members in Q1 to a record 21.8 million. Now this result surpassed our pre-COVID member base, representing a 15% increase relative to the same quarter in prior year. 
I'm also happy to say that this holiday season, Starbucks Card activations, the cornerstone of our holiday gift program, exceeded our expectations. Starbucks Cards are a customer favorite for holiday gifting and are widely available through our stores and other distribution channels, including digitally. The success of Starbucks Cards illustrates the strong emotional bonds that we've created with customers and the relevance of the Starbucks Experience even in the current environment.  
As the number of active Starbucks Rewards members grew during the quarter, so did their engagement. Rewards customers contributed 50% of U.S. company-operated sales in Q1, up from 43% last year before the onset of COVID-19 and up from 47% in the prior quarter, demonstrating our loyal customers' resilience and affinity for Starbucks. Any way you look at it, our first quarter results were quite strong in the U.S., particularly considering the headwind we faced from the current surge in COVID infections.  
I will now move on to China, our second lead growth market. Building on the positive momentum from the past 2 quarters, the China leadership team delivered another great quarter, which is a testament to our ability to rapidly adapt to changing conditions while focusing on the customer experience, new beverage innovation and continued expansion of digital customer relationships, just as we continue to do in the U.S. We delivered an impressive positive 5% comparable store sales growth in Q1, but what is most remarkable about our recovery in China is the rapid reacceleration of new store development, which is our #1 driver of growth in that market.  
I'm pleased to share that in Q1, we opened almost 160 stores and crossed the 4,800 store milestone. That equates to 13% growth in net new stores over the last 12 months, which is particularly impressive considering that we suspended new store development activities for a couple of months at the onset of the pandemic in China. We entered 15 new cities in the quarter, and stores in these cities are off to a strong start with customer traffic outperforming that of new stores in other cities in China. The performance of these new stores underscores our continued confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for Starbucks in China.  
We continue to dramatically expand digital customer relationships in China through the Starbucks Rewards program, as evidenced by the number of 90-day active Rewards members growing to 15.4 million in Q1, a record increase of 51% versus the prior year and 14% over the previous quarter. In addition, we achieved record sales for this year's Double 11 campaign, which grew by 86% versus last year. And we also set a single-day retail sales record on our Starbucks Rewards members night. 
Member engagement campaigns and additional functionalities launched through our Starbucks app and mini-apps boosted member engagement and frequency throughout the quarter. In fact, with Starbucks Now Mobile Order & Pay services available across 99% of our store base and with Starbucks Delivers in 85% of our store base in China, mobile order sales mix hit a record 30% of the company's China sales, up from 26% in the last quarter, with 14% driven by Starbucks Delivers and 16% from Starbucks Now. Rewards customer engagement continues to grow as mobile ordering has more than doubled in China over the past year. Starbucks remains Chinese consumers' first choice in the away-from-home coffee category and is the most talked-about coffee brand on social media in China. The brand is stronger than ever in our fastest-growing market.  
And finally, a few comments on our Channel Development business. The strategic value of our Channel Development segment in the current environment is clear. The availability of Starbucks products through multiple channels has secured Starbucks' leadership position in the category, acting as a brand amplifier for our specialty coffee retail business. The demand we saw last quarter in Starbucks at-home coffee remained high, boosting our share of the coffee market outside of specialty retail. In the U.S., Starbucks' share of total packaged coffee grew significantly in the quarter, with dollar sales up nearly 14%, nearly twice the category average. 
The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé has been a powerful partnership. And I'm proud to say that for the first time ever, we finished calendar year 2020 as the #1 coffee brand across the entire coffee category. Think about it. Starbucks is now the #1 coffee brand ahead of all premium and mainstream choices. 
In addition, consumption of our U.S. ready-to-drink coffee products, in partnership with PepsiCo, grew 18% in the quarter. The introduction of ready-to-drink Nitro Cold Brew, which was the #1 innovation in the category last year, exceeded sales expectations. Unsurprisingly, our foodservice business continues to be impacted in the current environment with softness in workplace coffee consumption as well as business and leisure travel, which was partially offset by overall strength in our at-home coffee and ready-to-drink businesses.  
With Nestlé, we entered 4 new markets in the quarter, bringing Starbucks at-home coffee presence through the Global Coffee Alliance to 66 markets in just over 2 years. Overall, we are proud of our alliance with Nestlé and pleased with the accelerated global expansion of the Starbucks brand through our channels business.  
Now before I hand the call over to Pat, I want to close by sharing a perspective and recognizing my Starbucks partners. Throughout this year, Starbucks will celebrate our 50th anniversary as a company. And in that 50 years since 1971, the most important ingredient that has created this iconic company are the Starbucks partners who share a powerful connection to our mission, a mission grounded in human experience and brought to life through our values and company culture. It is those same Starbucks partners who are navigating a global pandemic, caring for one another, creating welcoming experiences for our customers, showing up in our communities, bringing new ideas and accelerating innovation and rapidly adapting to our new reality every step of the way, showing the compassion and courage necessary to transform into this new version of Starbucks, a company that is more resilient, stronger than ever and fully committed to a bright future full of adventure, growth and positive impact on those we touch. 
And as markets around the world work tirelessly to vaccinate billions of people, we are prepared for what can only be described as the great human reconnection where people once again connect with others face to face, to heal, to belong, to reflect, to share and to celebrate, to celebrate what it means to be part of humanity. And as Starbucks partners, we are here for that great human reconnection where our third place environment once again brings people together if even for a brief moment to uplift our customers with a smile, a personal connection, a handcrafted beverage and a place where all are welcome. Starbucks was built for this moment. 
And to my Starbucks partners around the world, we all know that our purpose goes far beyond the pursuit of profit. This is our moment, and I am proud to be your partner and grateful for everything you do for Starbucks, for each other, for our customers and for the communities we are all a part of. I am optimistic about our shared future, and I want to say thank you.  
Now before he walks you through our Q1 results, I want to close by sharing my sincere gratitude for Pat Grismer. He has helped lead us through unprecedented change and transformative growth at an amazing pace in his time with Starbucks, and he has played an instrumental role in unlocking considerable shareholder value over the past 2 years. I appreciate Pat's partnership with the entire leadership team at Starbucks and the lasting legacy he's leaving. Pat, as you prepare to retire, I want to thank you and wish you the very best in your next chapter. You leave the company in the great hands of a 16-year partner, Rachel Ruggeri, who is incredibly well positioned to assume the mantle of Starbucks' Chief Financial Officer on February 1. Having worked closely together for many years, I look forward to partnering with you, Rachel, as you lead our finance function and contribute as a valuable partner on our executive leadership team.  
Further, as you all may have seen today, Roz has accepted an incredible opportunity as chief executive officer at another publicly traded company. She will be leaving Starbucks at the end of February, and her next role is expected to be disclosed in the days ahead. In the meantime, I want to share that we're very excited for her and are grateful for her many contributions over the years in leading our operations across the Americas. Roz, on behalf of the entire leadership team, I want to thank you for your leadership and wish you every success in your new role. Congratulations.  
With these shifts, I am immensely proud to have a very strong bench of Starbucks veterans who represent the next generation of leadership for our company. Rachel Ruggeri succeeding Pat as CFO; and as we flatten the organization, Rossann Williams, President of our North America Retail business; and Brady Brewer, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, will now be reporting directly to me, taking on what have previously been responsibilities of our Chief Operating Officer. Combined, these 3 talented leaders have more than 45 years of Starbucks experience, and we will not miss a beat. Rachel, Rossann and Brady, building on your passion, authenticity and many years of success at Starbucks, I am excited about our next phase of Starbucks growth together. I'd like to thank all of my partners for their support as we are well positioned for the future.  
And now with that, I will turn the call over to Pat. Pat?"

As Kevin shared, we are very pleased with our start to fiscal '21 with meaningful sequential improvements in quarterly financial results despite ongoing business disruption from the pandemic, again demonstra",1708,"Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Kevin shared, we are very pleased with our start to fiscal '21 with meaningful sequential improvements in quarterly financial results despite ongoing business disruption from the pandemic, again demonstrating the new level of resilience that we have introduced into the business during these unprecedented times.  
Starbucks reported global revenue of $6.7 billion in Q1, down 5% from the prior year. Q1 EPS was higher than the guidance range we provided on our last earnings call, primarily driven by better-than-expected margin recovery. Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.53 declined from $0.74 in the prior year but outperformed our guidance range as it also benefited from lower-than-expected restructuring and impairment costs, as I will discuss in greater detail later. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, down from $0.79 in the prior year primarily due to the lingering impact of the pandemic.  
I will first take you through our Q1 fiscal '21 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. I will then share some perspective on our outlook for Q2 and the full fiscal year.  
Our Americas segment delivered revenue of $4.7 billion in Q1, 6% lower than the prior year primarily due to a 6% decline in comparable store sales as well as lower product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees as a result of the pandemic. As Kevin mentioned, in the U.S., we saw continued sequential improvement in quarterly comparable store sales from minus 9% in the prior quarter to minus 5% in Q1. As we entered Q1, October improved modestly to minus 3% from minus 4% in September. Then as the quarter progressed, U.S. comparable store sales were minus 4% and minus 8% in November and December, respectively, primarily due to pandemic-related operating restrictions across several states, which impacted customer mobility. As Kevin also noted, approximately 40% of our U.S. company-operated store base was offering limited seating at the end of the quarter, down from more than 60% at the beginning of the quarter. So we are quite pleased with our comparable store sales performance in Q1 in light of these increasing restrictions.  
Americas Q1 non-GAAP operating margin contracted 320 basis points from the prior year to 18.8% primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, including sales deleverage and additional costs incurred as well as growth in retail partner wages and benefits. These impacts were partially offset by improved labor efficiency, driven in part by order consolidation and sales mix shift as well as pricing. Notably, this represented a significant improvement from the previous quarter's non-GAAP operating margin of 16.7%.  
Moving on to International. The International segment delivered revenue of $1.7 billion in Q1. Excluding a 5% favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the segment's revenue in the quarter was flat relative to the prior year, reflecting 8% net new store growth over the past 12 months, offset by lower product sales to, and royalties from, our international licensees as well as a 3% decline in comparable store sales primarily due to COVID-19, inclusive of a 3% VAT benefit.  
In China, comparable store sales grew 5% in Q1, including VAT favorability of nearly 5 percentage points or slightly positive when excluding the impact of VAT for the quarter. In line with our previous outlook, we substantially recovered our sales in China by the end of calendar 2020, even when excluding the temporary VAT benefit, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand in our fastest-growing market. In December, China's comparable store sales were up 4% or only slightly negative when excluding the nearly 5 percentage point VAT exemption benefit for the month, an improvement from both October and November when excluding each month's VAT exemption benefit and setting aside the mid-Autumn festival seasonal shift that benefited October.  
International's non-GAAP operating margin declined by 100 basis points to 20.4% mainly due to sales deleverage as a result of the pandemic, partially offset by improved labor efficiency. Much like the Americas, this represented a very significant improvement from the previous quarter's non-GAAP operating margin of 16.3%. 
On to Channel Development. Revenue was $371 million in Q1, a decline of 25% from the prior year primarily due to a 22% unfavorable impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business. When excluding the impact of these transition-related activities, Channel Development's revenue declined by 3% in Q1, mainly driven by the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the segment's foodservice business, partially offset by growth in our ready-to-drink business. 
The segment's non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 48.7% in Q1 from 36.6% in the prior year. Normalizing for the 840 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 370 basis points in Q1, driven primarily by the strength of our ready-to-drink business. Finally, at a consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin was 15.5% in Q1, down from 18.2% year-over-year but a substantial improvement from 13.2% in Q4. Unsurprisingly, much of the year-over-year reduction in our operating margin for Q1 was due to sales deleverage attributable to COVID-19 as well as growth in wages and benefits, partially offset by store labor efficiencies and pricing in the Americas.  
Moving on to our guidance for fiscal '21 and starting with GAAP EPS. In Q1, GAAP EPS was $0.16 higher than the upper end of our guidance range, primarily reflecting lower-than-expected restructuring costs related to our trade area transformation initiative. This upside was attributable to 2 things: first, a shift in the timing of store closures to future quarters; and second, a reduction in average restructuring cost per closed store. As we expect these lower restructuring costs to sustain, we are raising our full year fiscal '21 GAAP EPS guidance by $0.08 from a range of $2.34 to $2.54, to a new range of $2.42 to $2.62, both inclusive of approximately $0.10 for the 53rd week.  
Now moving to non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our strong start to the year, combined with a tailwind from foreign currency translation as evidenced in our Q1 results, provides optimism that we have the potential to exceed our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance, barring, of course, any new significant and sustained waves of COVID-19 infections and any major economic disruptions. However, given where we are at in our fiscal year with 3 quarters to go and considering that we're continuing to see volatility from the pandemic, we believe it is prudent to provide a comprehensive guidance update with our second quarter earnings report, by which time we'll have much better visibility to full year results. 
Therefore, setting aside the updated fiscal '21 GAAP EPS guidance I just mentioned, we reaffirm all other full year fiscal '21 guidance for now, including non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.70 to $2.90, again inclusive of approximately $0.10 for the extra week. We will, however, provide guidance for selected Q2 metrics given our better visibility to near-term trends, which provide further evidence of recovery in line with our overall expectations. 
In the U.S., we expect to report a comparable store sales decline of approximately 2% for the month of January, representing a marked improvement from December's 8% decline. Then as we lap material adverse COVID-19 impacts in the month of March, we expect U.S. comparable store sales growth of approximately 5% to 10% for the second quarter. This is consistent with our previous outlook that we would achieve full sales recovery in our U.S. business by the end of Q2 with a 2-quarter lag beyond that before we expect to see full margin recovery.  
In China, we are seeing another wave of COVID-19 infections in selected provinces and a corresponding impact to customer mobility and store operating protocols. In addition, we started to lap material adverse COVID-19 impacts last week, and this will continue through the remainder of Q2. Combining these 2 items, we expect to report a comparable store sales decline of approximately 7% for the month of January and comparable store sales growth of nearly 100% for the second quarter, reflecting very significant lapping effects in the months of February and March. On a 2-year basis, that would equate to roughly flat compound growth in the second quarter as we move through the 1-year anniversary of COVID-related store closures and return to our long-term growth algorithm in China.  
From an EPS perspective in Q2, we are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.36 to $0.41 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.45 to $0.50. These estimates reflect the comparable store sales growth estimates that I just provided as well as the normal margin seasonality we see in our business comparing Q2 to our holiday-driven Q1. To be clear, except for GAAP EPS, the rest of our full year fiscal '21 guidance metrics are unchanged from what we communicated with our Q4 fiscal '20 quarterly earnings report. This includes our expectation that our retail operating segments will deliver significant margin improvement on a non-GAAP basis as fiscal '21 progresses, yielding meaningfully higher EPS in the third and fourth quarters than the first 2 quarters of the year. 
To summarize, we are delighted with the pace of business recovery in Q1 and the momentum that it provides for fiscal '21. Our China market has substantially recovered, although it is experiencing recent volatility. And our U.S. business is on track to fully recover in the current quarter as we previously communicated. As a result, we remain confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of our growth model. I want to express my appreciation to our Green Apron partners for the critical role that they continue to play in our overall business recovery.
Before I conclude, I would like to thank Kevin and the Starbucks team. It has been an honor to be a Starbucks partner, and I am proud of what we have accomplished as a team to unlock considerable shareholder value over the past 2 years. I am thrilled to pass the CFO baton to Rachel Ruggeri, a key member of our senior finance team. Rachel and I have been partnering to ensure a smooth transition, and I would like to invite her to share a few words on this call. Thank you. Rachel?"

First of all, a big reason for the increase in ticket is group ordering. And certainly, as we have grab and go and customers are looking for safe, familiar, convenient experiences, customers are coming in and they're purchasing multiple beverages, multiple food items for larger groups than in the past, which is why traffic is down and ticket is up. 
That said, I think as we start reopening seating in our stores, as vaccinations continue to propagate around the world, we're going to see that normalize, but I do think there's going to be a long-term positive impact on ticket. I do think through this period, I think customers have gotten very used to more premium beverages, more -- higher degree of food attach. And I think -- I don't -- I actually think ticket will make -- will come out of this higher than it was when we went into it while transactions recovered. Now how long that takes? I think that's a function of how vaccinations unfold in different markets around the world and how quickly people get back to more normal foot traffic patterns and more normal work and school patterns. 
And let me just ask if -- Roz, if you want to add any additional perspective on that as it relates to the U.S."

If you think about the decline in transactions that we've seen in our central business districts, in our metro markets, those areas carry single beverages and they were higher-than-average brewed coffee. And those grew really at a lower range in our ticket options. So what we're doing in beverage innovation is replacing that with cold beverages and replacing that with plant-based. And so that's why we're seeing this improved food attach. And so we feel confident that those kinds of innovations are going to keep that ticket higher than what we've seen in the past."

But there will be, as customer behavior normalizes, some reversal of some of that margin benefit. 
But it's important to highlight some of the other ongoing initiatives underway in our store operations to build new levels of productivity, whether the deployment of handheld POS to improve throughput at the drive-through and how we believe that will not only increase our capacity but deliver some margin enhancements, or what we're doing to deploy new equipment, both new espresso machines as well as new ovens that help us to reduce transaction times out the window, or just ongoing operational engineering work to ensure that our operating routines as we've adopted new protocols continue to achieve higher levels of efficiency in terms of how we deploy our labor. So there are a number of other activities underway that will drive new levels of productivity and unlock further margin benefit even as some of the sales activity normalizes and, with that, reverses some of the margin benefit that we've seen here recently."

So drive-through, in terms of numbers, will grow. 
Also, too, there are 3 main approaches that we have to enhance the drive-through productivity. First of all is to optimize the current state. And that's looking at our operation standards, and that's the focus on driving our increased out-the-window times. And so that's reinforcing all of our processes in store, making sure that our baristas can operate efficiently, and that's the ongoing work that we will do. 
The second piece is we're developing and testing some drive-through forward solutions, and that includes our handheld POS which, right now, we have about 300 drive-through stores with handheld POS, and we'll have 500 of those stores by the end of February. And so we're also adding to that the tech improvement to make orders more easily managed through our consolidation and handoff. We call that our bump bar replacement. And then in addition, we're also targeting the renovation of 150 drive-through-constrained stores that have either issues in terms of meeting the new productivity model from an engine design or removing the pastry case and getting things situated on a single point of sale and other solutions. 
And then there's a final piece, the future drive-through concepts, and those are things like drive-through-only stores that have no seating, very small units, the side-by-side drive-through lanes that we are bringing on to the footprint. So it's -- we've got considerable work in this area to unlock the full potential for drive-through."

In terms of opportunities for the 40% of stores that do not have drive-through but do have seating, that maybe the possibility of a drive-through even on a relocation isn't even possible within the trade area, could you highlight some of the things that you can do to increase throughput overall consumer usage, whether on a late-COVID basis or even a post-COVID basis to make that cohort of stores more productive? That's the first question. 
And then secondly, if I can sneak it in, considering that the transactions which are down, offset obviously by -- via by ticket, labor hours presumably are down at the store. Do you have a sense of how variable labor should be? In other words, if transactions increase by 10%, is there a type of percent that you would think labor hours should increase as we kind of think about rebuilding the models for the out-years?"

And this -- and Deep Brew is our work that allows us to apply AI to our equipment and the processes in the store, and that's improving productivity within the store. So there's considerable work that's happening in our cafe-seated stores. And you'll see those things roll out over the next several quarters here. Pat?"

And that's particularly important as we expect continued sales recovery and then back into growth in the back half of the year. And even as we continue to make significant new investments in the level of P&L in order to unlock future growth opportunity, we fully expect very meaningful sales leverage that comes with what we target as an approximate 50% flow-through on those variable sales, and that includes what we derive by way of leverage on fixed labor. So there is a variable labor component that is embedded in that calculation. But importantly, it acknowledges that there is a fair portion of our total cost structure inclusive of labor that is fixed in terms of how we operate these stores. So as we recover sales and further build from that point, we anticipate margin expansion as a consequence of sales leverage that helps to offset the impact of the additional investments we're making to unlock future growth."

Thanks for the question, Sara. Clearly, we're very proud of the work the team in China has done to navigate the COVID situation and the current surge that we're seeing in the market to basically substantially recover and -- in line with our expectations for the quarter and deliver a 5% comp, a top line growth rate of 15% and an acceleration of new stores to 160 in the quarter. It's really remarkable given the current environment that we're operating in. 
We continue to be very optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity and the continued recovery that is going to take place throughout this fiscal year. Our new stores continue to perform very well. As I said, we opened 160 stores, 13% growth over the last 12 months. And that includes a time period where we slowed down or halted all store growth as we navigated the COVID crisis beginning last year at this time. We're seeing really strong performance and uptick with the Starbucks Now expansion. We're open in 24 cities -- I'm sorry, opened 24 stores in 9 different cities in the quarter, and we have a total of 40 stores, and we'll continue to expand that concept. 
And then the last piece beyond the store piece is the acceleration of digital and the digital footprint. And Kevin hit on this a little bit in his comments, but this is also fueling the growth during the pandemic as we navigate. Our 90-day actives increased to 15.4 million members. That's 56% increase over the previous year, and that's 14% increase over the previous quarter, which is great. And then clearly, mobile order sales mix at 30% with MOP at 16% and deliver at 14% is strong growth. So our total mobile order sales are now 2x what they were last year at this time. So clearly, we have put in place a model that has been able to navigate the pandemic environment, and we feel very optimistic in delivering the guidance that Pat put forward of achieving 100% comp for the second quarter and relatively flat growth on a 2-year basis for the market."

And Sara, to build on what John has said, to put into perspective how we're thinking about comp growth in China long term, you may recall at our December 2018 investor conference, we guided China comp growth of 1% to 3%.

And we acknowledged at the time that as a consequence of a more tempered pace of growth in the broader economy, intensified competition and the sales transfer that comes from an aggressive pace of new unit development, that 1% to 3% was a reasonable expectation. Fast forward to our Investor Day just a couple of months ago where we updated that to a new range of 2% to 4%. 
I would say in relation to the factors I mentioned, no material change to the economy, competition or sales transfer. But importantly, as John mentioned, significant improvements in our digital capability and how that has all resonated with our customers in China, which underpins our confidence in raising that long-term comp guidance range for China to this 2% to 4%, which we believe is quite powerful in the context of very aggressive unit development given the strong appeal of our brand and the outstanding unit-level economics that deliver superior returns for us in China."

My question is on the labor side of things, which seems to be very topical. I'm happy to hear you guys talk about ongoing efficiencies. But when people talk about labor lately, it seems like there's a lot of opposing forces. Obviously, you have the national minimum wage potentially going up on one 
[Audio Gap] 
but then you have the elevated unemployment, which historically implies ample labor and, therefore, managing your cost better. So just wondering if you can provide any thoughts in terms of your labor cost and maybe employee availability outlook. I know you guys are an employer of choice, but your ability to offset the pressure, whether it's through cost saves, technology, menu pricing, how you kind of think about those offsetting forces from a labor cost perspective."

But fundamentally, look, we believe in investing in our partners. It is our Green Apron partners who create that experience for our customers. And so we know when we invest in our partners and put them in the position to do the best job they can in serving our customers that our customer connection scores go up and our traffic goes up and our sales go up. There's a direct correlation between investment in partners, customer connection scores and traffic increase. And I think that's the first thing to note. So -- and that's why you saw us make a fairly significant increase in wage and benefits here in the U.S. as we went into this fiscal year. 
Second, then we find ways to help offset some of that in 2 ways. Number one is just productivity and throughput. We have a 20,000 square foot Tryer Center. We call it our Tryer Center. And think of it as a Silicon Valley incubation lab right downstairs here in Seattle. And we have some of the world's best, human-centered design engineers that work down there with our partners to find ways to help them improve that productivity. Oftentimes, it has to do with the store layout. Oftentimes, it has to do with the equipment, what kinds of ovens, what's the -- how can we make things easier for partners to do their jobs. And so that helps offset some of that increase in wage. And then the other is automating administrative tasks, things that -- whether it's -- we've got Deep Brew helping automate inventory management stores, helping reduce the amount of time that partners have to count inventory and fill out forms, and now technology is playing a role doing that. 
Other examples. Our Mastrena 2 machines that we're putting in our stores have -- are instrumented with Internet of Things sensors in them. And those sensors, every shot of espresso, it sends telemetry data back to our data center. And through machine learning, we can predict when one of our Mastrena machines needs to be maintained or needs to be cleaned or calibrated. And by doing that, we prevent the situation where perhaps a partner comes to open the store in the morning and one of the Mastrena machines is down. So technology to automate administrative tasks that help provide the best environment for our partners to do what they do best, which is handcrafted beverages and connecting with our customers, and then the way that we get productivity by just thinking about the human-centered design experience we create for partners in the stores, that helps to offset the increase. 
And Pat, I'll hand to you to help add a little bit more numerics around that."

What I would add is that much the same way I talked about China is how we're thinking about the U.S. in relation to improved comps on the back of investments we're making in the brand with investments in our store partners being a critically important investment. And to put that in numerical terms, a couple of years ago when we guided at our Investor Day at the time, a 3% to 4% comp expectation for our U.S. business. More recently at our Investor Day, we raised that to a range of 4% to 5%, and that is entirely the result of our confidence in the returns that we will get on these investments, led by investments in our partners but also significant investments in our digital platforms and what that does to unlock the full sales potential of a Starbucks brand, yielding significant sales leverage that not only pays for these investments but enables what we continue to expect by way of modest annual margin expansion, which is a fundamental part of our ability to convert revenue growth, long term, of 8% to 10% to operating income growth of 9% to 11%. 
So as Kevin mentioned, all of these things work together, investment combined with productivity to combine further with sales leverage to land the ongoing margin expansion that forms a fundamental part of our overall earnings growth model."

So we were very pleased with our Q1 result with non-GAAP EPS exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by approximately $0.08. Picking that apart, about $0.05 of that favorability was driven by our business segment performance, including better-than-expected margins in both the Americas and International. Another $0.02, we'd attribute to favorable foreign currency translation and the remaining $0.01 attributable to a lower-than-expected tax rate, which is driven by unplanned, discrete tax benefits. 
As to the business performance, we do expect that momentum to sustain balance of the year. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we believe that it is possible that we can deliver full year results ahead of the guidance we've given. However, when you consider where we're at in our fiscal year with 3 quarters to go and when you also consider the continued volatility in the operating environment, it's prudent to hold at this stage. And that's what we've chosen to do. We've decided to hold our full year non-GAAP guidance until we close Q2 and have half the year under our belt. We will then have much better visibility to the back half of the year and can make a more considered call on what guidance update may be appropriate at that point in time. 
But we are very encouraged by what we've seen thus far. Even with the recent volatility we've seen in China, we could not be more delighted with the accelerated recovery we've seen in our U.S. business going from a minus 8% comp in December to a minus 2% comp in January, well on our way to achieving the full sales recovery that we outlooked for the U.S. business by the end of our second quarter, fully expecting the quarter to come in at 5% to 10% sales growth. That's comparable sales growth for our U.S. business. 
So when you add it all up, there's every reason to be optimistic. It's just a matter of prudence, again, given where we're at in our year and the fact that the pandemic is still impacting our business in different ways, but we're really pleased with the resilience we've built into our business, and that's reflected in our results."

Let me share our perspective, and then Roz, I'll hand you to add a bit more from the U.S. perspective. But Dennis, strategically, we are a beverage-first company. We are in the business of handcrafted beverages, personalized for each and every customer around coffee and tea. And it's that experience we create around handcrafted beverages. And that's why we amplify -- we talk about our innovation. It's around customer experience, it's around relevant new beverage innovation, and it's around digital customer relationships. And by focusing and understanding that we are a beverage-first company that what we do is create that experience around those handcrafted beverages has been very important in the growth that we've been driving. And so we talk about that a lot. We focus on that a lot because that is, at the end of the day, what is a significant differentiator for Starbucks. 
Now we then attach food. And so I'm not saying food is not important, but we're very clear strategically, the most important thing is to be on the front foot and innovate and drive those relevant beverage platforms and then differentiate through the fact that our Starbucks partners in our stores handcraft those beverages personally for each and every customer, and then we attach food. 
Now when we attach food, our R&D teams have been very thoughtful about how to have the food menu be relevant to the dayparts and to the beverages that we sell. And they've done a phenomenal job with that over the years. And if I were to say what is the -- probably the most dominant shift in consumer behavior is this whole shift to plant-based. And that is a shift both in beverage and in food. On the beverage side, this is why we've introduced all the alternative milks, whether it's almond milk, soy milk, oat milk. All of that's important. And then on the food side, you see what we've done with things like the Impossible Sausage Breakfast Sandwich, and you're seeing more and more plant-based proteins in our food menu. And in fact, we have one Starbucks store here in the Seattle area that we've gone to 100% plant-based food menu. We use that as sort of a test area when we innovate, create things here in our support center, the Tryer Center. We test in that store. So if I think about both beverage and food, the #1 trend that I would highlight there is just the consumer shift and consumer preferences around plant-based.  
And Roz, let me hand it to you. You might have some additional numbers and color to add to that. But I think at a macro level, those are the 2 most important points, I think, Dennis."

And so Kevin, I think you hit it pretty strong there in terms of us really aligning with customer preference. I will say that the work that our team has been doing around our digital platform and getting to know our customers better than we've ever known them before, we're understanding how their preferences are trending. What this is also allowing us to do is to make great coffee as well because now we're learning how to match and pair coffee with great food and beverage items so that we bring together both a food and beverage combination. So the work ahead of us by no means minimizes food. Actually, we see it as a golden opportunity for us to just further expand our presence and create quality food attach items to go along with great coffee."

And then my question is on the China loyalty members and the platform. Obviously, very impressive growth here.

Perhaps differently, you're seeing either daypart changes or ticket growth. And I know, obviously, COVID might be muddying the visibility here in exactly understanding what the trends are.

So John, with respect to trade area transformation progress, as of the end of Q1, we had completed approximately 1/3 of the store closures included in our trade area transformation initiative and expect to complete the majority of remaining closures by the end of this fiscal year as originally planned. So there has been a bit of a delay relative to what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, and that's entirely a function of how thoughtfully the team is continuing to refine the store closure plans based on how we read the impacts we're seeing from stores as they are closed in terms of both sales transfer and margin with a view to continue to optimize as we go. But we're as committed to that program now as we were at the start of the year and even back to June when we first announced it and then subsequently expanded the program. 
As to the margin impact, we continue to expect about a 40 basis point improvement to our consolidated margin or our enterprise margin on a full year basis. So even with a slight delay to some of the closure activity, we continue to expect meaningful margin expansion as a result of this initiative."

In terms of the ticket as it relates to digital, we are seeing ticket consistent with what we've seen previously. Generally, in China, our ticket runs a bit higher than the U.S. under normal circumstances. That is because of group ordering. And I would say our ticket is living up to that, living up to that historical performance. 
The other aspect that we're seeing is social gifting. And social gifting is a big piece of digital in China. We've introduced that as part of the Rewards program, and we're seeing a nice uptick of that as well. So very pleased with the progress the team is making there, and we're going to continue to invest and double down on our digital footprint in China."

I would say much longer term, it remains to be seen. A lot of it will depend on how consumers increasingly migrate to those alternative milks not just in our business but broadly in a way that supports increased production, which should, over time, reduce the cost. And then we have the opportunity to reevaluate whether at some stage it makes sense to change our pricing practices.

I want to begin this call by recognizing the impressive momentum in our business, evidenced over this past year and further amplified by the Q2 results we released today.

I want to begin this call by recognizing the impressive momentum in our business, evidenced over this past year and further amplified by the Q2 results we released today. While the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, this momentum is giving us confidence to raise our full year guidance as Rachel will outline later. 
Starbucks is as well positioned as it has ever been as global events have driven us to instill a new level of agility and speed into the business. With our Growth at Scale agenda in place well before the global pandemic emerged, we quickly set principles and established store protocols to guide us globally. We monitored events in real time and quickly adapted to changing conditions on a store-by-store basis around the world, working to provide safe, familiar and convenient experiences for our partners and customers. 
Many of us have lived this past year feeling isolated, protecting ourselves and our families from COVID-19. We now share a powerful craving for human connection, a desire to socialize and feel part of the community and the need to be with others and heal. And with vaccination programs underway and, in turn, consumer mobility, we have begun to see what we describe as the great human reconnection. This is evidenced by our Q2 sales in the U.S., which fully recovered in the quarter as we had previously communicated and the forward momentum across our business around the world as the COVID-19 vaccine distribution progresses at varying rates. 
It is no secret that consumer behaviors were disrupted as a result of the pandemic. We recognized shifts and behaviors early, and our understanding of those behaviors will guide our strategy well beyond the pandemic as we believe many of these behaviors are here to stay. Our ability to move with speed and agility and to be out in front of these shifts has helped further differentiate Starbucks, positioning us well for the future. 
I had previously outlined the 5 most notable consumer behaviors we are laser-focused on, which I will share with you again today. First, customers crave human connection. They've been longing to be together again face-to-face, feeling part of a community. This is human nature and has always been central to the Starbucks Experience. 
Second, they are looking for convenient, personalized experiences that effortlessly fit their lifestyle. Third, customers appreciate consistency, knowing what to expect at each visit. Fourth, customers seek out high-quality offerings that support the well-being of the planet and society. And finally, customers are increasingly looking to support brands with strong values, values that are demonstrated by actions. 
Not only have we been adapting to and benefiting from these consumer behaviors, but we also see a clear opportunity to further modernize and reinforce our leadership position, leveraging our strength in technology and predictive analytics as well as the continued transformation of our store portfolio, offering experiences that will drive greater customer loyalty in ways only Starbucks can do. 
When we spoke with you last quarter, markets were in the initial stages of gaining access to COVID-19 vaccines. And we were seeing very early signs of friends and families celebrating being together again to heal from a year filled with economic and social hardship that has challenged our overall well-being. Certainly, not all markets are moving at the same speed in terms of vaccine distribution, but we know that this is the key that enables all of us to once again be together as part of humanity. And there is no global brand better positioned than Starbucks. Founded 50 years ago, Starbucks was built for this moment. 
Now I want to share with you results from Q2 that reinforce my optimism for our long-term outlook. Let me begin in the U.S. Building on our very strong Q1 holiday results, our second quarter comparable store sales returned to strong positive growth and a meaningful improvement from last quarter's minus 5%. In Q2, comparable store sales rose to an impressive 9%, at the high end of our 5% to 10% guidance range for the quarter. Once again, the credit for this remarkable resilience and recovery goes to our phenomenal Green Apron partners who delivered another quarter of stellar performance in Q2, driving steady improvement, culminating in a new record for weekly sales and full U.S. comp recovery as we exited the quarter. 
Importantly, in Q2, we further advanced the 3 business-driving initiatives fundamental to our Growth at Scale agenda: elevating the customer experience, driving relevant beverage innovation and expanding digital customer engagement. Let me share notable highlights from Q2 and our traffic-driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021. 
Starting with the largest contributor for the quarter, expanding digital customer engagement. Digital continues to be a significant driver of our sales recovery in the U.S. Starbucks Rewards' contribution to the business continues to exceed pre-COVID levels and for the second consecutive quarter is displaying all-time highs across key metrics. Between continued growth in SR member spend, fueled by strength in ticket and frequency as well as new member acquisition, 52% of our U.S. company-operated sales in Q2 were driven by Starbucks Rewards members, reflecting strong member engagement and resilience. 
Total 90-day active members grew by over 1 million members in Q2 to a record 22.9 million. Relative to the launch of Stars for Everyone just 6 months ago, our 90-day active SR member base has expanded by 19%, a clear testament that the program is attracting customers as we had intended. The increase was underpinned by a meaningful uptick in conversions, with more app downloads advancing to member activations. With Stars for Everyone, customers can choose from a range of payment options, offering convenience, flexibility and choice. 
Our pioneering digital capabilities not only successfully transformed our digital relationships to drive mobile ordering but also amplify convenience and safety, which are both very much top of mind for our customers. We continue to leverage the advantages of our mobile app to elevate the personalization of the customer experience and deepen customer engagement. As a result, mobile orders represented 26% of U.S. company-operated transactions in Q2, up from 18% a year ago. 
As we have seen each quarter, our digital channel's convenience has proven successful in driving demand. A quick comment on digital that I think is important to highlight, the increasing role that artificial intelligence is playing in the growth and success of our company, an initiative we call Deep Brew. In October 2019, I published an article on LinkedIn entitled, Can Artificial Intelligence Help Nurture Humanity? This article outlined a vision for how Starbucks would leverage artificial intelligence in support of our mission. 
And that vision has come to life with Deep Brew, our AI engine that is now used today throughout the company. Deep Brew personalizes the offers and suggestions we make to our customers. It is also at the center of trade area transformation, which I'll provide an update on in a moment. Deep Brew has now automated daily inventory, orders across hundreds of U.S. stores as we deploy it broadly. It is supporting partner scheduling and optimizing it in ways that improve both the customer and the partner experience. 
Deep Brew drives our pandemic dashboard used by our retail leaders across the U.S. And Deep Brew is now doing predictive analytics to model vaccination progress in key markets around the world. Our work in AI is providing Starbucks the underlying predictive models, enabling us to fuel the great human reconnection by freeing up partners to do what they do best, connect with customers and deliver a world-class customer experience. 
Elevating the customer experience is another fundamental business-driving initiative underlying the Growth at Scale agenda and perhaps the most important of all of our priorities. Starbucks has always excelled at meeting our customers where they are, even as transactions in the current environment have migrated from dense metro centers to suburbs and from cafes to drive-throughs. Company-operated sales in our U.S. suburban and rural locations, where drive-throughs are most predominant, continued to gain momentum, more than offsetting the impact from central business districts and metro centers, where the recovery continues to lag. 
The drive-through channel has improved quarter-over-quarter since the onset of the pandemic. We continued to invest in several initiatives to increase the throughput of our drive-throughs, including updated operational standards, handheld order devices, more efficient warming ovens and accelerated deployment of our more efficient Mastrena espresso machines. As a result, drive-through saw a slight improvement in out-the-window times versus the prior year. Out-the-window drove over 50% of net sales in Q2, increasing more than 10% from pre-pandemic levels, unlocking capacity and enhancing the customer experience by reducing wait times, ultimately fueling our business recovery. 
Last June, we wrote a letter to all stakeholders, outlining our plan to accelerate strategic initiatives focused on rapidly transforming our store portfolio and optimizing for shifting consumer behaviors. This plan, which we refer to as the Americas Trade Area Transformation, has positioned us extremely well for the future. We called this early. And in just 9 months, we have already completed 70% of the strategic store closures, clearing the way for the development of new, innovative and more efficient retail store formats over time. 
The plan leverages new store formats like Starbucks Pickup in dense metro areas that complements our traditional Starbucks Cafe formats in suburban and rural areas and also enables us to balance continued growth in high-volume and high-margin locations, primarily cafes with drive-throughs. We are responding to customers' increased desire for convenience while also improving the overall profitability of every trade area. 
As the great human reconnection gains momentum and anticipation of behaviors and daily routines continuing to evolve, we are meeting our customers wherever they need us to be with the right store, in the right place and at the right time, yet another key differentiator of the Starbucks brand. 
As our sales fully recovered in the quarter, average ticket remains meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels. This is true even as transactions have improved significantly quarter-over-quarter, given the shift in sales mix toward drive-through, where average spend tends to be higher, partially due to a higher incident of group orders. U.S. ticket comp growth of approximately 21% in Q2 was driven by a combination of increased beverage attach, premium beverage mix, increased customization and upsizing and all-time high food attach. 
The popularity of our innovative menu offerings, which command a premium price, also benefited U.S. ticket growth. Customers have responded extremely well to the new beverage platforms we have introduced, with a focus on relevant new handcrafted beverages that deliver on wellness trends, offer customers choice and support our sustainability agenda. Our winter and spring menus resonated and drove momentum. 
Cold beverages delivered resounding year-over-year growth in Q2, led by Cold Espresso, Starbucks Refreshers and Cold Brew. Also driving our strength in cold beverages was our spring lineup, which launched in early March. We have seen an overwhelmingly positive response to oat milk, with the Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shake and Espresso far exceeding expectations to date. This has helped us push year-over-year growth of 53% in all dairy beverage sales, a testament to the relevance of our sustainability agenda. 
Plant-based is also resonating in food, with the impossible breakfast sandwich delivering record performance, which, alongside other breakfast sandwiches and cake pops, pushed food attach to record highs in Q2. Any way you look at it, our second quarter results were phenomenal in the U.S. and exceeded our expectations. 
Importantly, affinity for Starbucks has strengthened as measured by improvements in our customer connection scores and growth in customer loyalty, which further reinforces the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand and healthy optimism for the future. 
I will now move on to China, our second lead growth market. The strong start to fiscal '21 continued as we entered Q2. And while a resurgence of COVID-19 restrictions impacted customer mobility as the quarter progressed, our China leadership team once again rapidly adapted to the changing conditions and successfully regained momentum as we exited the quarter. In Q2, we achieved 91% comp growth in China, including that favorability of approximately 9 percentage points, which came in slightly below our expectations as unanticipated pandemic-related restrictions were imposed across the market. 
Nonessential travel was discouraged in Q2, severely impacting our stores located in travel hubs, including during the entirety of the Chinese New Year holiday, the peak domestic travel season, which saw a significantly lower number of travelers relative to both pre-pandemic and prior year levels. Even as mobility impacted our comps, our ability to expand our digital customer relationships in China through the Starbucks Rewards program reinforces the long-term position of our brand in our fastest-growing market. 
As we lapped the first anniversary of the pandemic, I am particularly pleased with our ability to dramatically expand digital customer relationships in China through the Starbucks Rewards program. Our progress is evidenced by the number of 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members more than doubling versus prior year to 16.3 million, driving 72% of sales in China, up 5 percentage points from prior year. 
In addition, we expanded the Starbucks Now Mobile Order and Pay service to WeChat in Q2, making our mobile ordering services ubiquitously available to customers on both Alibaba and WeChat ecosystems as well as our Starbucks app. This enables us to acquire new customers in the WeChat ecosystem while enhancing the customer experience by allowing customers to place orders via the app of their choice. 
In Q2, we also launched our flagship store on JD.com, one of China's leading e-commerce platforms, offering merchandise, stored value cards and seasonal food offerings, among other products. Mobile order sales mix hit a record 34% of sales in China, up from 30% in Q1, with 15% driven by Starbucks Delivers and 19% from Starbucks Now. Starbucks Rewards customer engagement continues to grow as mobile order sales have more than doubled in China over this past year. 
As COVID-related restrictions subsided late in the quarter, momentum in customer mobility improved, particularly in residential, office and commercial trade developments. In addition, as much of our growth in China comes from our continued expansion of the store portfolio, we crossed the 4,900-store milestone with the opening of 110 net new stores in Q2. That equates to 14% growth in net new stores over the past 12 months, which is particularly impressive considering that we suspended new store development activities for a couple of months in China at the onset of the pandemic. This week, we announced our 5,000th store opening in China, underscoring our continued confidence in Starbucks' long-term growth opportunity in China. 
And finally, a few comments on the strength of our channel partnerships with Nestlé and Pepsi. In the U.S., Starbucks' share of total packaged coffee outpaced the category, growing over 8% in dollar sales in Q2. This is a sharp contrast to the overall coffee category, which declined due to a surge in pantry stocking that occurred last year at the onset of the pandemic. I'm proud to say that Starbucks remained the #1 brand in total coffee in the U.S. and was the top share gainer of the coffee category in Q2, gaining nearly 1.5 points over the prior year. 
Internationally, Starbucks' products on single-serve platforms, including Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, continued to exceed our expectations. And with the Q1 launch of Starbucks' products on the Nespresso virtual line, our outlook is optimistic as we continue to build distribution, amplify the brand and grow share. 
The Global Coffee Alliance is now in 71 markets around the world, up from 48 markets in Q2 fiscal year '20, bringing more customers the opportunity to enjoy Starbucks in many different ways. Similarly, consumption of our U.S. ready-to-drink coffee products through our North American coffee partnership with PepsiCo grew more than 23% in Q2, over a 5% jump from Q1. 
Q2 also marked the launch of new beverages, including the Cold and Crafted platform and new Nitro Cold beverages, leveraging last year's Starbucks' Nitro ready-to-drink platform launch, which became the #1 innovation in the ready-to-drink category. 
In summary, as you can see, there are many reasons to be confident and optimistic about the future for Starbucks. Personally, I am optimistic about the back half of this fiscal year. But even more importantly, it is clear to me that the actions we are taking, the customer and partner response we are seeing and the focus and discipline we have brought to the business have clearly positioned Starbucks for the next several years of growth. 
The Growth at Scale algorithm we shared at our December Investor Day is solid. The Starbucks' brand is stronger and more resilient than ever. We have more opportunities to reach customers than ever before. And we are continuing to personalize and enhance those interactions by always delivering for our customers a unique and innovative food and beverage experience in a safe environment with a personal touch where and when they want. 
As we celebrate our 50th anniversary throughout this year, we do so knowing that Starbucks' third place experience is well established and core to the great human reconnection that has begun. We are a destination for human connection, a warm and welcoming place for all and a place that brings entire communities together, and that is exactly what the world needs, a place that inspires and nurtures the human spirit, 1 person, 1 cup and 1 neighborhood at a time. 
And I want to thank our over 400,000 Green Apron partners in 83 markets around the world who have been navigating through this complex environment. Partners, it is you who exemplify what Starbucks has always stood for, a company with a purpose that goes beyond the pursuit of profit, a culture that demonstrates care for our partners, creates uplifting experiences for our customers and plays a positive role in our communities and throughout society. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rachel, who will walk you through our Q2 results. Rachel?"

As Kevin shared, we are very pleased with the continued momentum in our business, with meaningful sequential improvements in quarterly financial results demonstrating the overall strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand as well as the effectiveness of our strategies, our innovation and our agility. 
Starbucks reported global revenue of $6.7 billion in Q2, up 11% from the prior year, inclusive of approximately 2% foreign currency favorability, with growth driven by our company-operated retail markets particularly in the U.S. And with these better-than-expected results, we are confidently raising our outlook for the full year as I will explain later. 
Q2 EPS exceeded our expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected margin recovery. Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.56 increased from $0.28 in the prior year and was $0.15 higher than the upper end of our guidance range inclusive of lower-than-expected restructuring and impairment costs of about $0.04, largely attributable to our more favorable lease exit costs. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.62, up from $0.32 in the prior year and $0.12 above the upper end of our guidance range, primarily driven by continued core business recovery fueled by strong U.S. performance. 
I will first take you through our Q2 fiscal '21 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. I will then share our improved outlook for the full fiscal year. 
Our Americas segment delivered revenue of $4.7 billion in Q2, 8% higher than the prior year, driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales, partially offset by lower product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees as a result of the pandemic. As Kevin mentioned, in the U.S., we saw continued sequential improvement in quarterly comparable store sales from minus 5% in the prior quarter to a very strong positive 9% in Q2. Transaction comp improved from minus 21% in Q1 to minus 10% in Q2, with continued strength in average ticket, which remains significantly above pre-pandemic levels. 
On a cumulative 2-year basis, which measures our growth relative to pre-pandemic levels, U.S. comp sales in the month of March grew 11%, implying annual average growth above our long-term algorithm of 4% to 5% and a full sales recovery by the end of Q2, as we previously communicated. 
America's Q2 non-GAAP operating margin expanded 550 basis points from the prior year to 19.9%, primarily driven by lapping of COVID-19-related costs incurred in the prior year, sales leverage from business recovery, pricing, temporary government subsidies and the benefits of trade area transformation, partially offset by growth in investments in wages and benefits for our store partners. Notably, this represented a meaningful improvement from the prior quarter's non-GAAP operating margin of 18.8%. 
Moving on to International. The International segment delivered revenue of $1.6 billion in Q2. Excluding an 8% favorable impact of warrants currency translation, the segment's revenue in the quarter was 34% higher than the prior year, reflecting a 35% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 4% VAT benefit and an 8% net new store growth over the past 12 months, partially offset by lower product sales to and revenues from our international licensees. 
In China, we lapped the first anniversary of widespread COVID-related store closures. And as Kevin mentioned, comparable store sales grew 91% in Q2, including VAT favorability of approximately 9 percentage points. The VAT benefit was reinstated for the entire quarter to mitigate the impact of government-mandated restrictions across the mainland, following flare-ups of COVID-19 in several key cities, significantly limiting customer mobility. On a cumulative 2-year basis, China comp sales growth in March was minus 5%, including 4% of VAT benefit. 
International's non-GAAP operating margin rose to 19.6% from 3.9% in the prior year and surpassed Q2 FY '19 margin by 30 basis points, mainly driven by sales leverage, reflecting the lapping of severe impacts in the prior year attributable to the COVID-19 outbreak and favorability from temporary government subsidies in Japan. 
On to Channel Development. Revenue was $370 million in Q2, a decline of 29% from the prior year, primarily driven by Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business and lapping additional product sales in the prior year to Nestlé to transition foodservice order fulfillment. When excluding the approximately 30% adverse impact of these transition-related activities, Channel Development's revenue grew by nearly 2% in Q2, mainly driven by growth in our ready-to-drink business. 
The segment's non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 46.7% in Q2 from 37.8% in the prior year. Normalizing for the 770 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 120 basis points in Q2, driven primarily by the strength of our ready-to-drink business. 
Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin was 16.1% in Q2, up 690 basis points from 9.2% in the prior year, up 30 basis points from Q2 of fiscal 2019 and an improvement from 15.5% in Q1. The year-over-year increase in our operating margin for Q2 was primarily driven by lapping of COVID-19 impacts but also included stronger-than-expected sales leverage and favorability from temporary government subsidies. The margin expansion in Q2 was partially offset by both growth and investments in wages and benefits for store partners. 
Moving on to our guidance for fiscal '21. Now that we're at the midpoint of our fiscal year, we have better visibility to anticipated full year results, and therefore, we are raising our full year fiscal '21 EPS guidance as well as updating a few other metrics. The increase is predominantly driven by better-than-expected operating results in the first half of the year, an anticipated benefit attributable to certain discrete tax items in Q4 and a slight tailwind from foreign currency translation, barring, of course, any new significant and sustained ways of COVID-19 infections and any major economic disruptions. 
Our new fiscal '21 GAAP EPS guidance range is $2.65 to $2.75, up from $2.42 to $2.62 previously. Our fiscal '21 non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2.90 to $3, up from our prior range of $2.70 to $2.90. We continue to drive leverage in all areas of our business, giving us confidence in our full year earnings guidance. As a reminder, our fiscal '21 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges are inclusive of approximately $0.10 for the 53rd week. 
Given the momentum we've seen in the U.S. business to date, we are raising our guidance for full year fiscal '21 consolidated revenue to a new range of $28.5 billion to $29.3 billion, up from $28 billion to $29 billion. As a reminder, our fiscal '21 consolidated revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately $500 million for the 53rd week. 
Additionally, we are raising our consolidated operating margin to a range of 16.5% to 17.5%, up from our previous guidance of 16% to 17%, even as we continue to make meaningful investments in our key growth drivers. We continue to expect our operating margin recovery to lag sales recovery by 2 quarters, improving as the year progresses and approaching our ongoing target range of 18% to 19% at the consolidated level as we exit fiscal '21. 
As I mentioned earlier, we currently expect certain discrete tax items to favorably impact Q4's tax rate in fiscal '21. Based on current expectation, Q4's tax rate is forecasted to decline to the high teens level, but given the nature of discrete tax items, the timing and magnitude of the favorability are subject to change. In contrast, Q3 tax rate is expected to be slightly higher than our Q2 tax rate. As a result, we now expect our fiscal '21 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the low to mid-20% range. 
Moving on to comp sales growth. As sales in our 2 lead growth markets have returned to roughly pre-pandemic levels, albeit with different customer patterns than before the pandemic, we are reverting to our quarterly sales reporting convention at this time and do not anticipate providing monthly comps going forward. And while we continue to see strength in average ticket, we expect it to moderate as customer mobility improves, and we anticipate store visitation frequency will start to normalize in the latter half of fiscal '21. Therefore, we expect a corresponding shift between the mix of traffic and ticket comp as we lap the depth of fiscal '20's pandemic impacts in Q3. 
As a reminder, our usual 1-year reported comps are expected to be outsized as we lap the significant negative comps from the effects of COVID-19 in fiscal '20, which began in late January in China, followed by the U.S. as we exited Q2. Consequently, until we lap fiscal '20's COVID-19-related impacts, we believe that our fiscal '21 comps should be assessed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Therefore, the 2-year comp growth rate will be more indicative of our underlying performance. 
I want to underscore that the 2-year comps we are monitoring are not calculated on an additive basis, which yield distorted results when lapping large negative comps as the second year comp base is not comparable to the first year. Instead, we are calculating our 2-year comps on a multiplicative basis as described in today's earnings release. 
Finally, to be clear, except for the updates on revenue, EPS, margin and tax rates that I just provided, the remainder of our full year fiscal '21 guidance metrics are unchanged from what we communicated with our Q1 fiscal '21 quarterly earnings report. 
To summarize, we are delighted that our U.S. business has fully recovered sales as we expected. While we may experience pandemic-related volatility until global herd immunity is attained, we have the protocols in place to respond in real time to ensure the health and safety of our customers and partners while continuing to operate the business. Our performance in Q2 demonstrates the relevance and success of our strategies, with operating margins above the levels of 2 years ago. Our cash position remains strong and we have meaningfully deleveraged our balance sheet this year by paying off debt maturities totaling nearly $1.7 billion, keeping us on track to approach our 3x leverage target by the end of this fiscal year. 
Going forward, I want to underscore that we have a clear set of actions underway to continue to drive comp growth and profitability as we move through the year. Importantly though, we will continue to invest in our business strategically with a long game mentality, taking decisive action to ensure that we are continuing to drive shareholder value long into the future. 
Now more than ever, we remain confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of our growth model, giving us continued confidence in the model shared at our 2020 Investor Day of delivering long-term double-digit EPS growth at scale, with another year of outsized EPS growth expected in fiscal 2022 as we lap this year's recovery curve. 
Once again, the real credit for our success goes to our more than 400,000 Green Apron partners worldwide who continue to go above and beyond to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience. That experience, above all, fueled our growth this past quarter and will continue to be a competitive advantage in the future. Thank you. And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by Rossann Williams, Brady Brewer and John Culver, as Durga outlined at the top of the call. Thank you. Operator?"

But on your last part of the question, in terms of dayparts, we saw our 2-year comp growth in all dayparts. So we've seen that morning ritual return, and we've seen positive 2-year comps across those dayparts, which is a very, very positive sign. 
One of the things that I've been monitoring is when you look at when the FDA announced emergency approval for the Pfizer vaccine on December 11 and then followed with Moderna on December 18 and then J&J on February 27, sort of mapping the actions taken by the FDA to announce availability of vaccines and correlated that back to watch what's happening in our stores day-to-day, and that action alone created this wave of optimism of, I think, consumers, customers being more mobile. Now they're still being cautious. 
But then certainly, as we saw the rate of vaccinations start to hit 3 million to 4 million vaccinations a day, you really start to see how this great human reconnection unfolds. And so we saw it unfold in all dayparts. And we still see stores in our dense metropolitan areas recovering slower. But I'd tell you the cafes with drive-throughs that we have are comping to more than make up for that. 
We are seeing recovery though in those metropolitan areas. It's just -- I think that's going to take a little longer for businesses to bring employees back to work and sort of reshift those traffic patterns. But I think very, very positive progress on dayparts and continued progress in terms of both in dense metropolitan located stores. But I actually think the trade area transformation is unlocking a significantly positive upside for us. And so maybe Rachel, why don't you hit on the numbers? And then Rossann, I'll let you add other observations that you see from the U.S. perspective."

And of course, the outperformance in our drive-through. So we saw that across the board and across all dayparts, which give us confidence. 
And to Kevin's point, what helped fuel that, particularly in our more metro areas and urban markets, was the trade area transformation where we're 71% -- about 70% complete with that effort today. As you might remember, we communicated we would close around 800 stores across Americas. And so as we've gone through that, we've been able to overall strengthen the portfolio as part of that effort. So that's playing into some of the recovery as well, as well as the overall mobility that's increased throughout the United States. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Rossann."

What I would say is China was having a good -- seeing good momentum before we entered into Q2. And then there was a resurgence of COVID that caused restrictions across travel, across actually our International markets impacting China, given this was an important period for a market in terms of holidays and the Chinese New Year. 
And so as a result, we saw that cause mobility issues in the quarter, which impacted performance and impacted comp. As we saw some of the restrictions start to lift at the end of the quarter, we started to see momentum build, particularly in our key trade zones and key trade areas. For those reasons, we believe in the overall momentum in the market. And the brand continues to be strong, and we're continuing to see great growth in our digital platforms. We're connecting with customers in new and different ways. We continue to open significant amount of new stores. So our confidence in the market continues. 
And because of that, we felt the comp range was appropriate. There's a lot of volatility in our comps overall. And so for that reason, we kept comp guidance in line with the ranges we had provided previously. That allows us to be able to keep that level of volatility uncertainty within that range as we find our customers continue to return to our business and until our customers have a more routine activity overall, and we see a more return to normal patterns, we think that range is appropriate."

We're now using our Deep Brew AI technology to start to monitor and look at the vaccination progress of every country around the world and use predictive analytics to give us a view and correlation to how that's going to pace the recovery and the acceleration of our growth in International business. 
Clearly, this quarter, we had some COVID-related restrictions in many countries in Europe, certainly in Japan and China, and so that had an impact there. But when you look at the products we're making on vaccinations, certainly in the U.S., that's a proxy for what's going to happen around the world.

We're seeing that now in Mexico as restrictions have been lifted and vaccinations have improved. We're also optimistic for the U.K. as openings occur in the U.K. and vaccination levels approach over 50%. So all indications are that we're very confident with the comp guidance that we've provided from an International perspective.

Keep in mind, a year ago,",366,"Yes. Thanks for the question. Let me sort of summarize kind of my view at a high level and then I'll hand over to Rossann. First of all, it's important to ground ourselves in what we've done for our partners over this last year. Keep in mind, a year ago, the extreme lockdowns that we had in the U.S., we decided to give our partners economic certainty through that period. We did not do any involuntary layoffs or furloughs. We paid our partners whether they came to work or stayed home. We increased the benefits that we gave them for COVID-related health benefits, mental wellness benefits, parental care benefits, childcare benefits. 
We took care of our partners through this pandemic. And as a result, our partners have risen to the occasion. Certainly, as we came out of this pandemic, we made a significant investment, an increase of wage that went into effect in December. And partners have applauded that. And so we're in a position right now where I think our partners appreciate what we've done, and we have great respect and appreciation for our partners. 
So unlike what I've read about from other companies, we -- our retention numbers are good. Our partners' energy and spirit is high. And so I don't anticipate us having challenges when it comes to having our partners show up and be in a position to create a great customer experience in every store around the world. 
Now before I hand over to Rossann, I do want to comment though, in some areas in supply chain, let's take in distribution where store deliveries. Now some of our partners who run the store deliveries are from our customer distribution centers to stores, they've struggled a bit having -- being able to hire and staff to meet the demand that we have and to get enough people. So we are working with them. So I do anticipate we'll do a little bit more to invest and help our supply chain partners, whether it's staff that they need in manufacturing or staffing they need for distribution and transportation. But when it comes to Starbucks, I think we're in a very solid position. Rossann?"

We still believe that we'll have a slightly elevated ticket as we continue to drive food attach and premiumization of our products as well as shifting customers into cold platforms, but we will see our ticket moderate, which will impact our margin. 
In addition to that, as I mentioned, we're going to continue to invest in our business. It's critically important as we think about how we unlock the back half of the year and we continue to grow and meet the demand. So we're going to have to continue to invest in partners, continue to invest in technology and equipment in our stores. And finally, there's an inflationary component in there as well. So when you put that together, that's what really drives our guidance. 
Now what I would say is we would expect to exit Q4, so we'll strengthen from a margin perspective throughout the quarters, but we would expect to exit Q4 approaching the 18% to 19% guidance range that we gave at Investor Day for the long term. So that will show you how the -- how our EPS will essentially strengthen with that margin. 
And what I can say in terms of next year, we don't provide guidance for next year but what we've already provided, but I would say you can still expect outside performance in line with that approximately 20% as we had previously guided."

And likewise, you've given a lot of color on investments in the business and that lag between top line and margin. But is there a -- my sense is that the restaurant-level margin at drive-throughs is actually higher than sort of some of the traditional stores. So I would have thought that might be a tailwind as well as you kind of the store-based transformation. So just those 2 kind of questions on the face of the store-based sales transfer and then margin differentials."

But it's also important to note that approximately 200 of those new stores have been built and reopened, so we're also in the process of fulfilling the repositioning aspect of that. 
I think that's boding very well for us because it's actually helping us improve the customer experience by having the right store in the right location with the right format for customers. And we're on track to complete that as we go through the fiscal year. And I think that's one of the things that's going to set us up and help us in fiscal year '22, kind of going back to David's question about the outsized EPS growth that we look for in fiscal '22.

What I would say is from a trade area transformation perspective, if you think about the Americas segment, in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that Americas saw about a 550 basis point improvement on margin in the quarter. A driver of that was trade area transformation. 
And so what we've seen is what we, I think, outlined in Q2 -- or excuse me, in Q1 of this year is that on a full year basis, at the enterprise level, trade area transformation would be a benefit to margin of about 40 basis points. We saw significant improvement in Q2, and that will still align with approximately 40 basis points on the full year at the enterprise level. But that trade area transformation was a contributing factor to part of the success of the Americas segment in the quarter. 
And then in terms of the investments that I talked about, certainly, the investments that I've been talking about are across all stores. Largely, our drive-through as we're trying to -- as we're focusing on unlocking capacity and being able to accommodate the demand but it also relates to our cafes as well. But of course, more predominantly, drive-through concepts where we're seeing the majority of our demand currently. 
And as you might recall, at our Investor Day, we actually increased our comp guidance based on what we have seen from the investments we've been doing. So our comp guidance previously had been in the 3% to 4% range. We increased it to 4% to 5% based on these investments that we're making. And so the fact that these investments are starting to unlock productivity and we're seeing the margin benefit from those, we were able to show, on a long-term basis, that will increase comp and then subsequently increase our margin, allow us to continue to expand our margin and support our EPS growth for the longer term. So that's where you're seeing some of the tailwinds as we make these investments in the near term."

Trying to lower the barrier to entry so that customers can get the benefits of the program and experience the incentives and the personalized experience they get through the program. And it's through those efforts that we are attracting more customers into the program. 
SFE specifically was a program that we launched to make it easier to join and to make purchases in the program with the pay-as-you-go option. So lowering those barriers to entry, reaching as many people with the program and then ensuring that the incentives and the services that are attached to that program to make the experience personalized and effortless.

And in doing that, we've now started to apply some very creative and very thoughtful ways to get under the data that we have about customers so that we can -- even if they're non-Rewards customers so that we can better serve them and start to personalize offers and personalize the experience for them. And so working with technology companies that have machine learning algorithms, companies like Amperity and Bridge, they've been able to help us continue to advance this. 
So I think we've got a great set of features and initiatives that enhance the customer experience and how they want to use that mobile app to personalize that customer experience in ways that are relevant to them and for us to find new ways to reach out to non-Rewards customers and start to personalize our engagement with them to bring them into becoming Rewards customers. And so we're going to think very broadly about this over the long term. And I'm optimistic that we're doing some things that are very creative, and it's just going to take some time."

And I would say that over the course of the last year, we are seeing that really come to fruition right now. 
We've talked about the resurgence of customers coming back to our stores and stores reopened. We've seen the growth of packaged coffee down the aisle during this time, not only in the U.S. but also internationally. The growth in single-serve internationally as well being on the Nespresso platform, Dolce Gusto platform, the Keurig platform. 
In addition, foodservice is going to continue to play a very important role. We just opened our 1,000th foodservice location in China this past month, and we're going to continue to expand in that way. So it's a holistic strategy.

But right now, the volume of customer occasions that have returned to our stores in the U.S. is phenomenal, and it's exceeded our forecast and our projections in the U.S. And Rossann and her team have adapted rapidly to that. 
But the thing we're most focused on is how we have rapidly adapted to shifting consumer behaviors that I outlined in sort of my opening comments, how in doing that, we extend and enhance the attributes that differentiate Starbucks from everyone else and how we then create a great experience for our customers in the stores. And the way we do that, the trade area transformation is 1 important initiative. But the work we do to elevate the customer experience, deliver relevant and exciting new beverages and to extend and enhance digital customer relationships are the 3 key things. 
And when you look at what's happening in each 1 of those areas, there's so much positive activity and initiatives and accomplishments and then customer response to those things that I just believe that we're hitting on the right notes. And at this point, I look and say, we're going to have a 2- to 3-year tailwind just simply by watching vaccinations progress around the world. This great human reconnection will happen probability 1.0. And so we are positioned for that, and we're trying to -- we're working to enhance and differentiate the brand in ways that are meaningful to us. 
We're going to take care of our partners. Our partners are the heartbeat of Starbucks. They have risen to the occasion. And so specialty coffee retail is where we set the brand. 100 million of customers a week come to see us, and that's where we establish the brand and then we amplify it through our channels.

Yes, what I would say is we definitely -- I mean, as we start to comp the most severe part of the pandemic from last year, we'll definitely see the construct of our comp shift, and it will return to more of a pre-pandemic level where you see greater transaction and maybe a lower ticket. So we'll definitely see our ticket moderate from the high 20s where we've been. 
But we believe that some of that will sustain, now not to the degree that it's been, but if you look at some of the behaviors that have driven that, the behaviors that have driven it today are the fact that we have higher beverage attach from group orders, multiple orders. Some of that will probably moderate as people start to go back into the offices and we have more single visits and single-item purchases. But we've had an all-time food attach. This quarter was an all-time record attach on our food. And that's because we're putting forward products that our customers love and enjoy. And so they'll continue to -- if we continue to innovate in the areas that are relevant for them, we continue to see that, that will have -- that will drive food attach. 
In addition to that, we're seeing, across the board, growth in cold and some of that is from our promotional offerings as well as some of our core offerings. And I think that focus in that area, which is more premium for us in nature is where our customers are gravitating. And so that will also help us to sustain ticket. I just think the issue will be that it will moderate from where it is today, but we have belief that some of those levers that I just spoke about are indeed sticky."

I want to begin this call by recognizing the impressive momentum in our business, evidenced over this past year and further amplified by the Q2 results we released today.

I want to begin this call by recognizing the impressive momentum in our business, evidenced over this past year and further amplified by the Q2 results we released today. While the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, this momentum is giving us confidence to raise our full year guidance as Rachel will outline later. 
Starbucks is as well positioned as it has ever been as global events have driven us to instill a new level of agility and speed into the business. With our Growth at Scale agenda in place well before the global pandemic emerged, we quickly set principles and established store protocols to guide us globally. We monitored events in real time and quickly adapted to changing conditions on a store-by-store basis around the world, working to provide safe, familiar and convenient experiences for our partners and customers. 
Many of us have lived this past year feeling isolated, protecting ourselves and our families from COVID-19. We now share a powerful craving for human connection, a desire to socialize and feel part of the community and the need to be with others and heal. And with vaccination programs underway and, in turn, consumer mobility, we have begun to see what we describe as the great human reconnection. This is evidenced by our Q2 sales in the U.S., which fully recovered in the quarter as we had previously communicated, and the forward momentum across our business around the world as the COVID-19 vaccine distribution progresses at varying rates. 
It is no secret that consumer behaviors were disrupted as a result of the pandemic. We recognized shifts in behaviors early, and our understanding of those behaviors will guide our strategy well beyond the pandemic as we believe many of these behaviors are here to stay. Our ability to move with speed and agility and to be out in front of these shifts has helped further differentiate Starbucks, positioning us well for the future. 
I had previously outlined the 5 most notable consumer behaviors we are laser-focused on, which I will share with you again today. First, customers crave human connection. They've been longing to be together again face-to-face, feeling part of a community. This is human nature and has always been central to the Starbucks Experience. Second, they are looking for convenient, personalized experiences that effortlessly fit their lifestyle. Third, customers appreciate consistency, knowing what to expect at each visit. Fourth, customers seek out high-quality offerings that support the well-being of the planet and society. And finally, customers are increasingly looking to support brands with strong values, values that are demonstrated by actions. 
Not only have we been adapting to and benefiting from these consumer behaviors, but we also see a clear opportunity to further modernize and reinforce our leadership position, leveraging our strength in technology and predictive analytics as well as the continued transformation of our store portfolio, offering experiences that will drive greater customer loyalty in ways only Starbucks can do. 
When we spoke with you last quarter, markets were in the initial stages of gaining access to COVID-19 vaccines. And we were seeing very early signs of friends and families celebrating being together again to heal from a year filled with economic and social hardship that has challenged our overall well-being. Certainly, not all markets are moving at the same speed in terms of vaccine distribution, but we know that this is the key that enables all of us to once again be together as part of humanity. And there is no global brand better positioned than Starbucks. Founded 50 years ago, Starbucks was built for this moment. 
Now I want to share with you results from Q2 that reinforce my optimism for our long-term outlook. Let me begin in the U.S. Building on our very strong Q1 holiday results, our second quarter comparable store sales returned to strong positive growth and a meaningful improvement from last quarter's minus 5%. In Q2, comparable store sales rose to an impressive 9%, at the high end of our 5% to 10% guidance range for the quarter. Once again, the credit for this remarkable resilience and recovery goes to our phenomenal Green Apron partners who delivered another quarter of stellar performance in Q2, driving steady improvement, culminating in a new record for weekly sales and full U.S. comp recovery as we exited the quarter. 
Importantly, in Q2, we further advanced the 3 business-driving initiatives fundamental to our Growth at Scale agenda: elevating the customer experience, driving relevant beverage innovation and expanding digital customer engagement. Let me share notable highlights from Q2 and our traffic-driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021. 
Starting with the largest contributor for the quarter, expanding digital customer engagement. Digital continues to be a significant driver of our sales recovery in the U.S. Starbucks Rewards' contribution to the business continues to exceed pre-COVID levels and for the second consecutive quarter is displaying all-time highs across key metrics. Between continued growth in SR member spend, fueled by strength in ticket and frequency as well as new member acquisition, 52% of our U.S. company-operated sales in Q2 were driven by Starbucks Rewards members, reflecting strong member engagement and resilience. 
Total 90-day active members grew by over 1 million members in Q2 to a record 22.9 million. Relative to the launch of Stars for Everyone just 6 months ago, our 90-day active SR member base has expanded by 19%, a clear testament that the program is attracting customers as we had intended. The increase was underpinned by a meaningful uptick in conversions, with more app downloads advancing to member activations. With Stars for Everyone, customers can choose from a range of payment options, offering convenience, flexibility and choice. 
Our pioneering digital capabilities not only successfully transformed our digital relationships to drive mobile ordering but also amplify convenience and safety, which are both very much top of mind for our customers. We continue to leverage the advantages of our mobile app to elevate the personalization of the customer experience and deepen customer engagement. As a result, mobile orders represented 26% of U.S. company-operated transactions in Q2, up from 18% a year ago. 
As we have seen each quarter, our digital channel's convenience has proven successful in driving demand. A quick comment on digital that I think is important to highlight, the increasing role that artificial intelligence is playing in the growth and success of our company, an initiative we call Deep Brew. In October 2019, I published an article on LinkedIn entitled, Can Artificial Intelligence Help Nurture Humanity? This article outlined a vision for how Starbucks would leverage artificial intelligence in support of our mission. 
And that vision has come to life with Deep Brew. Our AI engine that is now used today throughout the company. Deep Brew personalizes the offers and suggestions we make to our customers. It is also at the center of trade area transformation, which I'll provide an update on in a moment. Deep Brew has now automated daily inventory orders across hundreds of U.S. stores as we deploy it broadly. It is supporting partner scheduling and optimizing it in ways that improve both the customer and the partner experience. 
Deep Brew drives our pandemic dashboard used by our retail leaders across the U.S. And Deep Brew is now doing predictive analytics to model vaccination progress in key markets around the world. Our work in AI is providing Starbucks the underlying predictive models, enabling us to fuel the great human reconnection by freeing up partners to do what they do best, connect with customers and deliver a world-class customer experience. 
Elevating the customer experience is another fundamental business-driving initiative underlying the Growth at Scale agenda and perhaps the most important of all of our priorities. Starbucks has always excelled at meeting our customers where they are, even as transactions in the current environment have migrated from dense metro centers to suburbs and from cafes to drive-throughs. Company-operated sales in our U.S. suburban and rural locations, where drive-throughs are most predominant, continued to gain momentum, more than offsetting the impact from central business districts and metro centers, where the recovery continues to lag. 
The drive-through channel has improved quarter-over-quarter since the onset of the pandemic. We continued to invest in several initiatives to increase the throughput of our drive-throughs, including updated operational standards, handheld order devices, more efficient warming ovens and accelerated deployment of our more efficient Mastrena espresso machines. As a result, drive-through saw a slight improvement in out-the-window times versus the prior year. Out-the-window drove over 50% of net sales in Q2, increasing more than 10% from pre-pandemic levels, unlocking capacity and enhancing the customer experience by reducing wait times, ultimately fueling our business recovery. 
Last June, we wrote a letter to all stakeholders, outlining our plan to accelerate strategic initiatives focused on rapidly transforming our store portfolio and optimizing for shifting consumer behaviors. This plan, which we refer to as the Americas Trade Area Transformation, has positioned us extremely well for the future. We called this early. And in just 9 months, we have already completed 70% of the strategic store closures, clearing the way for the development of new, innovative and more efficient retail store formats over time. 
The plan leverages new store formats like Starbucks Pickup in dense metro areas that complements our traditional Starbucks Cafe formats in suburban and rural areas and also enables us to balance continued growth in high-volume and high-margin locations, primarily cafes with drive-throughs. We are responding to customers' increased desire for convenience while also improving the overall profitability of every trade area. 
As the great human reconnection gains momentum and anticipation of behaviors and daily routines continuing to evolve, we are meeting our customers wherever they need us to be with the right store, in the right place and at the right time, yet another key differentiator of the Starbucks brand. 
As our sales fully recovered in the quarter, average ticket remains meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels. This is true even as transactions have improved significantly quarter-over-quarter, giving the shift in sales mix toward drive-through, where average spend tends to be higher, partially due to a higher incident of group orders. U.S. ticket comp growth of approximately 21% in Q2 was driven by a combination of increased beverage attach, premium beverage mix, increased customization and upsizing and all-time high food attach. 
The popularity of our innovative menu offerings, which command a premium price, also benefited U.S. ticket growth. Customers have responded extremely well to the new beverage platforms we have introduced, with a focus on relevant new handcrafted beverages that deliver on wellness trends, offer customers choice and support our sustainability agenda. Our winter and spring menus resonated and drove momentum. 
Cold beverages delivered resounding year-over-year growth in Q2, led by Cold Espresso, Starbucks Refreshers and Cold Brew. Also driving our strength in cold beverages was our spring lineup, which launched in early March. We have seen an overwhelmingly positive response to oat milk, with the Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso far exceeding expectations to date. This has helped us push year-over-year growth of 53% in all dairy beverage sales, a testament to the relevance of our sustainability agenda. 
Plant-based is also resonating in food, with the Impossible Breakfast Sandwich delivering record performance, which, alongside other breakfast sandwiches and cake pops, pushed food attach to record highs in Q2. Any way you look at it, our second quarter results were phenomenal in the U.S. and exceeded our expectations. Importantly, affinity for Starbucks has strengthened as measured by improvements in our customer connection scores and growth in customer loyalty, which further reinforces the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand and healthy optimism for the future. 
I will now move on to China, our second lead growth market. The strong start to fiscal '21 continued as we entered Q2. And while a resurgence of COVID-19 restrictions impacted customer mobility as the quarter progressed, our China leadership team once again rapidly adapted to the changing conditions and successfully regained momentum as we exited the quarter. In Q2, we achieved 91% comp growth in China, including VAT favorability of approximately 9 percentage points, which came in slightly below our expectations as unanticipated pandemic-related restrictions were imposed across the market. 
Nonessential travel was discouraged in Q2, severely impacting our stores located in travel hubs, including during the entirety of the Chinese New Year holiday, the peak domestic travel season, which saw a significantly lower number of travelers relative to both pre-pandemic and prior year levels. Even as mobility impacted our comps, our ability to expand our digital customer relationships in China through the Starbucks Rewards program reinforces the long-term position of our brand in our fastest-growing market. 
As we lapped the first anniversary of the pandemic, I am particularly pleased with our ability to dramatically expand digital customer relationships in China through the Starbucks Rewards program. Our progress is evidenced by the number of 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members more than doubling versus prior year to 16.3 million, driving 72% of sales in China, up 5 percentage points from prior year. 
In addition, we expanded the Starbucks Now, Mobile Order & Pay service to WeChat in Q2, making our mobile ordering services ubiquitously available to customers on both Alibaba and WeChat ecosystems as well as our Starbucks app. This enables us to acquire new customers in the WeChat ecosystem while enhancing the customer experience by allowing customers to place orders via the app of their choice. 
In Q2, we also launched our flagship store on JD.com, one of China's leading e-commerce platforms, offering merchandise, stored value cards and seasonal food offerings, among other products. Mobile order sales mix hit a record 34% of sales in China, up from 30% in Q1, with 15% driven by Starbucks Delivers and 19% from Starbucks Now. Starbucks Rewards customer engagement continues to grow as mobile order sales have more than doubled in China over this past year. 
As COVID-related restrictions subsided late in the quarter, momentum in customer mobility improved, particularly in residential, office and commercial trade zones. In addition, as much of our growth in China comes from our continued expansion of the store portfolio, we crossed the 4,900-store milestone with the opening of 110 net new stores in Q2. That equates to 14% growth in net new stores over the past 12 months, which is particularly impressive considering that we suspended new store development activities for a couple of months in China at the onset of the pandemic. This week, we announced our 5,000th store opening in China, underscoring our continued confidence in Starbucks' long-term growth opportunity in China. 
And finally, a few comments on the strength of our channel partnerships with Nestlé and Pepsi. In the U.S., Starbucks' share of total packaged coffee outpaced the category, growing over 8% in dollar sales in Q2. This is a sharp contrast to the overall coffee category, which declined due to a surge in pantry stocking that occurred last year at the onset of the pandemic. I'm proud to say that Starbucks remained the #1 brand in total coffee in the U.S. and was the top share gainer of the coffee category in Q2, gaining nearly 1.5 points over the prior year. 
Internationally, Starbucks' products on single-serve platforms, including Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, continued to exceed our expectations. And with the Q1 launch of Starbucks' products on the Nespresso virtual line, our outlook is optimistic as we continue to build distribution, amplify the brand and grow share. 
The Global Coffee Alliance is now in 71 markets around the world, up from 48 markets in Q2 fiscal year '20, bringing more customers the opportunity to enjoy Starbucks in many different ways. Similarly, consumption of our U.S. ready-to-drink coffee products through our North American coffee partnership with PepsiCo grew more than 23% in Q2, over a 5% jump from Q1. 
Q2 also marked the launch of new beverages, including the Cold and Crafted platform and new Nitro Cold beverages, leveraging last year's Starbucks' Nitro ready-to-drink platform launch, which became the #1 innovation in the ready-to-drink category. 
In summary, as you can see, there are many reasons to be confident and optimistic about the future for Starbucks. Personally, I am optimistic about the back half of this fiscal year. But even more importantly, it is clear to me that the actions we are taking, the customer and partner response we are seeing and the focus and discipline we have brought to the business have clearly positioned Starbucks for the next several years of growth. 
The Growth at Scale algorithm we shared at our December Investor Day is solid. The Starbucks brand is stronger and more resilient than ever. We have more opportunities to reach customers than ever before. And we are continuing to personalize and enhance those interactions by always delivering for our customers a unique and innovative food and beverage experience in a safe environment with a personal touch where and when they want. 
As we celebrate our 50th anniversary throughout this year, we do so knowing that Starbucks' third place experience is well established and core to the great human reconnection that has begun. We are a destination for human connection, a warm and welcoming place for all and a place that brings entire communities together, and that is exactly what the world needs, a place that inspires and nurtures the human spirit, one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time. 
And I want to thank our over 400,000 Green Apron partners in 83 markets around the world who have been navigating through this complex environment. Partners, it is you who exemplify what Starbucks has always stood for, a company with a purpose that goes beyond the pursuit of profit, a culture that demonstrates care for our partners, creates uplifting experiences for our customers and plays a positive role in our communities and throughout society. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Rachel, who will walk you through our Q2 results. Rachel?"

As Kevin shared, we are very pleased with the continued momentum in our business, with meaningful sequential improvements in quarterly financial results demonstrating the overall strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand as well as the effectiveness of our strategies, our innovation and our agility. 
Starbucks reported global revenue of $6.7 billion in Q2, up 11% from the prior year, inclusive of approximately 2% foreign currency favorability, with growth driven by our company-operated retail markets particularly in the U.S. And with these better-than-expected results, we are confidently raising our outlook for the full year as I will explain later. 
Q2 EPS exceeded our expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected margin recovery. Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.56 increased from $0.28 in the prior year and was $0.15 higher than the upper end of our guidance range, inclusive of lower-than-expected restructuring and impairment costs of about $0.04, largely attributable to our more favorable lease exit costs. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.62, up from $0.32 in the prior year and $0.12 above the upper end of our guidance range, primarily driven by continued core business recovery fueled by strong U.S. performance. 
I will first take you through our Q2 fiscal '21 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. I will then share our improved outlook for the full fiscal year. 
Our Americas segment delivered revenue of $4.7 billion in Q2, 8% higher than the prior year, driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales, partially offset by lower product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees as a result of the pandemic. As Kevin mentioned, in the U.S., we saw continued sequential improvement in quarterly comparable store sales from minus 5% in the prior quarter to a very strong positive 9% in Q2. Transaction comp improved from minus 21% in Q1 to minus 10% in Q2, with continued strength in average ticket, which remains significantly above pre-pandemic levels. 
On a cumulative 2-year basis, which measures our growth relative to pre-pandemic levels, U.S. comp sales in the month of March grew 11%, implying annual average growth above our long-term algorithm of 4% to 5% and a full sales recovery by the end of Q2, as we previously communicated. 
America's Q2 non-GAAP operating margin expanded 550 basis points from the prior year to 19.9%, primarily driven by lapping of COVID-19-related costs incurred in the prior year, sales leverage from business recovery, pricing, temporary government subsidies and the benefits of trade area transformation, partially offset by growth in investments in wages and benefits for our store partners. Notably, this represented a meaningful improvement from the prior quarter's non-GAAP operating margin of 18.8%. 
Moving on to International. The International segment delivered revenue of $1.6 billion in Q2. Excluding an 8% favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the segment's revenue in the quarter was 34% higher than the prior year, reflecting a 35% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 4% VAT benefit and an 8% net new store growth over the past 12 months, partially offset by lower product sales to and revenues from our international licensees. 
In China, we lapped the first anniversary of widespread COVID-related store closures. And as Kevin mentioned, comparable store sales grew 91% in Q2, including VAT favorability of approximately 9 percentage points. The VAT benefit was reinstated for the entire quarter to mitigate the impact of government-mandated restrictions across the mainland, following flare-ups of COVID-19 in several key cities, significantly limiting customer mobility. On a cumulative 2-year basis, China comp sales growth in March was minus 5%, including 4% of VAT benefit. 
International's non-GAAP operating margin rose to 19.6% from 3.9% in the prior year and surpassed Q2 FY '19 margin by 30 basis points, mainly driven by sales leverage, reflecting the lapping of severe impacts in the prior year attributable to the COVID-19 outbreak and favorability from temporary government subsidies in Japan. 
On to channel development. Revenue was $370 million in Q2, a decline of 29% from the prior year, primarily driven by Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business and lapping additional product sales in the prior year to Nestlé to transition foodservice order fulfillment. When excluding the approximately 30% adverse impact of these transition-related activities, Channel Development's revenue grew by nearly 2% in Q2, mainly driven by growth in our ready-to-drink business. 
The segment's non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 46.7% in Q2 from 37.8% in the prior year. Normalizing for the 770 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 120 basis points in Q2, driven primarily by the strength of our ready-to-drink business. 
Finally, at the consolidated level, non-GAAP operating margin was 16.1% in Q2, up 690 basis points from 9.2% in the prior year, up 30 basis points from Q2 of fiscal 2019 and an improvement from 15.5% in Q1. The year-over-year increase in our operating margin for Q2 was primarily driven by lapping of COVID-19 impacts but also included stronger-than-expected sales leverage and favorability from temporary government subsidies. The margin expansion in Q2 was partially offset by both growth and investments in wages and benefits for store partners. 
Moving on to our guidance for fiscal '21. Now that we're at the midpoint of our fiscal year, we have better visibility to anticipated full year results, and therefore, we are raising our full year fiscal '21 EPS guidance as well as updating a few other metrics. The increase is predominantly driven by better-than-expected operating results in the first half of the year, an anticipated benefit attributable to certain discrete tax items in Q4 and a slight tailwind from foreign currency translation, barring, of course, any new significant and sustained waves of COVID-19 infections and any major economic disruptions. 
Our new fiscal '21 GAAP EPS guidance range is $2.65 to $2.75, up from $2.42 to $2.62 previously. Our fiscal '21 non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2.90 to $3, up from our prior range of $2.70 to $2.90. We continue to drive leverage in all areas of our business, giving us confidence in our full year earnings guidance. As a reminder, our fiscal '21 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges are inclusive of approximately $0.10 for the 53rd week. 
Given the momentum we've seen in the U.S. business to date, we are raising our guidance for full year fiscal '21 consolidated revenue to a new range of $28.5 billion to $29.3 billion, up from $28 billion to $29 billion. As a reminder, our fiscal '21 consolidated revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately $500 million for the 53rd week. 
Additionally, we are raising our consolidated operating margin to a range of 16.5% to 17.5%, up from our previous guidance of 16% to 17%, even as we continue to make meaningful investments in our key growth drivers. We continue to expect our operating margin recovery to lag sales recovery by 2 quarters, improving as the year progresses and approaching our ongoing target range of 18% to 19% at the consolidated level as we exit fiscal '21. 
As I mentioned earlier, we currently expect certain discrete tax items to favorably impact Q4's tax rate in fiscal '21. Based on current expectation, Q4's tax rate is forecasted to decline to the high teens level, but given the nature of discrete tax items, the timing and magnitude of the favorability are subject to change. In contrast, Q3 tax rate is expected to be slightly higher than our Q2 tax rate. As a result, we now expect our fiscal '21 effective GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the low to mid-20% range. 
Moving on to comp sales growth. As sales in our 2 lead growth markets have returned to roughly pre-pandemic levels, albeit with different customer patterns than before the pandemic, we are reverting to our quarterly sales reporting convention at this time and do not anticipate providing monthly comps going forward. And while we continue to see strength in average ticket, we expect it to moderate as customer mobility improves, and we anticipate store visitation frequency will start to normalize in the latter half of fiscal '21. Therefore, we expect a corresponding shift between the mix of traffic and ticket comp as we lap the depth of fiscal '20's pandemic impacts in Q3. 
As a reminder, our usual 1-year reported comps are expected to be outsized as we lap the significant negative comps from the effects of COVID-19 in fiscal '20, which began in late January in China, followed by the U.S. as we exited Q2. Consequently, until we lap fiscal '20's COVID-19-related impacts, we believe that our fiscal '21 comps should be assessed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Therefore, the 2-year comp growth rate will be more indicative of our underlying performance. 
I want to underscore that the 2-year comps we are monitoring are not calculated on an additive basis, which yield distorted results when lapping large negative comps as the second year comp base is not comparable to the first year. Instead, we are calculating our 2-year comps on a multiplicative basis as described in today's earnings release. 
Finally, to be clear, except for the updates on revenue, EPS, margin and tax rates that I just provided, the remainder of our full year fiscal '21 guidance metrics are unchanged from what we communicated with our Q1 fiscal '21 quarterly earnings report. 
To summarize, we are delighted that our U.S. business has fully recovered sales as we expected. While we may experience pandemic-related volatility until global herd immunity is attained, we have the protocols in place to respond in real time to ensure the health and safety of our customers and partners while continuing to operate the business. Our performance in Q2 demonstrates the relevance and success of our strategies, with operating margins above the levels of 2 years ago. Our cash position remains strong and we have meaningfully deleveraged our balance sheet this year by paying off debt maturities totaling nearly $1.7 billion, keeping us on track to approach our 3x leverage target by the end of this fiscal year. 
Going forward, I want to underscore that we have a clear set of actions underway to continue to drive comp growth and profitability as we move through the year. Importantly though, we will continue to invest in our business strategically with a long game mentality, taking decisive action to ensure that we are continuing to drive shareholder value long into the future. 
Now more than ever, we remain confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of our growth model, giving us continued confidence in the model shared at our 2020 Investor Day of delivering long-term double-digit EPS growth at scale, with another year of outsized EPS growth expected in fiscal 2022 as we lap this year's recovery curve. 
Once again, the real credit for our success goes to our more than 400,000 Green Apron partners worldwide who continue to go above and beyond to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience. That experience, above all, fueled our growth this past quarter and will continue to be a competitive advantage in the future. Thank you. 
And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by Rossann Williams, Brady Brewer and John Culver, as Durga outlined at the top of the call. Thank you. Operator?"

But on your last part of the question, in terms of dayparts, we saw our 2-year comp growth in all dayparts. So we've seen that morning ritual return, and we've seen positive 2-year comps across those dayparts, which is a very, very positive sign. 
One of the things that I've been monitoring is when you look at when the FDA announced emergency approval for the Pfizer vaccine on December 11 and then followed with Moderna on December 18 and then J&J on February 27, sort of mapping the actions taken by the FDA to announce availability of vaccines and correlated that back to watch what's happening in our stores day-to-day, and that action alone created this wave of optimism of, I think, consumers, customers being more mobile. Now they're still being cautious. 
But then certainly, as we saw the rate of vaccinations start to hit 3 million to 4 million vaccinations a day, you really start to see how this great human reconnection unfolds. And so we saw it unfold in all dayparts. And we still see stores in our dense metropolitan areas recovering slower. But I'd tell you the cafes with drive-throughs that we have are comping to more than make up for that. 
We are seeing recovery though in those metropolitan areas. It's just -- I think that's going to take a little longer for businesses to bring employees back to work and sort of reshift those traffic patterns. But I think very, very positive progress on dayparts and continued progress in terms of both in dense metropolitan located stores. But I actually think the trade area transformation is unlocking a significantly positive upside for us. And so maybe Rachel, why don't you hit on the numbers? And then Rossann, I'll let you add other observations that you see from the U.S. perspective."

And of course, the outperformance in our drive-through. So we saw that across the board and across all dayparts, which give us confidence. 
And to Kevin's point, what helped fuel that, particularly in our more metro areas and urban markets, was the trade area transformation where we're 71% -- about 70% complete with that effort today. As you might remember, we communicated we would close around 800 stores across Americas. And so as we've gone through that, we've been able to overall strengthen the portfolio as part of that effort. So that's playing into some of the recovery as well, as well as the overall mobility that's increased throughout the United States. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Rossann."

What I would say is China was having a good -- seeing good momentum before we entered into Q2. And then there was a resurgence of COVID that caused restrictions across travel, across actually our International markets impacting China, given this was an important period for a market in terms of holidays and the Chinese New Year. 
And so as a result, we saw that cause mobility issues in the quarter, which impacted performance and impacted comp. As we saw some of the restrictions start to lift at the end of the quarter, we started to see momentum build, particularly in our key trade zones and key trade areas. For those reasons, we believe in the overall momentum in the market. And the brand continues to be strong, and we're continuing to see great growth in our digital platforms. We're connecting with customers in new and different ways. We continue to open significant amount of new stores. So our confidence in the market continues. 
And because of that, we felt the comp range was appropriate. There's a lot of volatility in our comps overall. And so for that reason, we kept comp guidance in line with the ranges we had provided previously. That allows us to be able to keep that level of volatility uncertainty within that range as we find our customers continue to return to our business. And until our customers have a more routine activity overall, and we see more return to normal patterns, we think that range is appropriate."

Clearly, this quarter, we had some COVID-related restrictions in many countries in Europe, certainly in Japan and China. And so that had an impact there. But when you look at the progress we're making on vaccinations, certainly in the U.S., that's a proxy for what's going to happen around the world.

We're seeing that now in Mexico as restrictions have been lifted and vaccinations have improved.

So all indications are that we're very confident with the comp guidance that we've provided from an International perspective.

Let me sort of summarize kind of my view at a high level and then I'll hand over to Rossann. But yes, first of all, it's important to ground ourselves in what we've done for our partners over this last year. Keep in mind, a year ago, the extreme lockdowns that we had in the U.S., we decided to give our partners economic certainty through that period. We did not do any involuntary layoffs or furloughs. We paid our partners whether they came to work or stayed home. We increased the benefits that we gave them for COVID-related health benefits, mental wellness benefits, parental care benefits, childcare benefits. 
We took care of our partners through this pandemic. And as a result, our partners have risen to the occasion. Certainly, as we came out of this pandemic, we made a significant investment, an increase of wage that went into effect in December. And partners have applauded that. And so we're in a position right now where I think our partners appreciate what we've done, and we have great respect and appreciation for our partners. 
So unlike what I've read about from other companies, we -- our retention numbers are good. Our partners' energy and spirit is high. And so I don't anticipate us having challenges when it comes to having our partners show up and be in a position to create a great customer experience in every store around the world. 
Now before I hand over to Rossann, I do want to comment though, in some areas in supply chain, let's take in distribution where store deliveries. Now some of our partners who run the store deliveries are from our customer distribution centers to stores, they've struggled a bit having -- being able to hire and staff to meet the demand that we have and to get enough people. So we are working with them. So I do anticipate we'll do a little bit more to invest and help our supply chain partners, whether it's staff that they need in manufacturing or staffing they need for distribution and transportation. But when it comes to Starbucks, I think we're in a very solid position. Rossann?"

But it sounds like there's also some tax benefit towards the end of the year that's in there. So I was just wondering if you could clarify if there's any offsets we should consider on why the guidance range didn't go up by more than it did. I think that's my first question. 
And the second question is at the Investor Day in December, I think the company laid out plans for 20% type EPS growth or 20%-plus off of the 2021 base. And I was wondering if that type of growth is still in play as you think about next year, given the overperformance that you're seeing this year."

What I would say is we felt confident in being able to raise our guidance on EPS for the full year. And of course, a big driver of that is our overdelivery and our outperformance in the first 2 quarters. But as I've mentioned, we expect that our margin is going to lag our sales recovery over the next couple of quarters. So we'll lag our sales recovery. 
And some drivers of that are, we won't see the onetime benefit that we had from the government subsidies that we had in Q2. So we won't have that. We'll start to see our ticket moderate. We still believe that we'll have a slightly elevated ticket as we continue to drive food attach and premiumization of our products as well as shifting customers into cold platforms. But we will see our ticket moderate, which will impact our margin. 
In addition to that, as I mentioned, we're going to continue to invest in our business. It's critically important as we think about how we unlock the back half of the year and how -- and we continue to grow and meet the demand. So we're going to have to continue to invest in partners, continue to invest in technology and equipment in our stores. And finally, there's an inflationary component in there as well. So when you put that together, that's what really drives our guidance. 
Now what I would say is we would expect to exit Q4, so we'll strengthen, from a margin perspective, throughout the quarters, but we would expect to exit Q4 approaching the 18% to 19% guidance range that we gave at Investor Day for the long term. So that will show you how the -- how our EPS will essentially strengthen with that margin. 
And what I can say in terms of next year, we don't provide guidance for next year but what we've already provided, but I would say you can still expect outside performance in line with that approximately 20% as we had previously guided."

What I would say is from a trade area transformation perspective, if you think about the Americas segment, in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that Americas saw about a 550 basis point improvement on margin in the quarter. A driver of that was trade area transformation. 
And so what we've seen is what we, I think, outlined in Q2 -- or excuse me, in Q1 of this year is that on a full year basis, at the enterprise level, trade area transformation would be a benefit to margin of about 40 basis points. We saw significant improvement in Q2, and that will still align with approximately 40 basis points on the full year at the enterprise level. But that trade area transformation was a contributing factor to part of the success of the Americas segment in the quarter.

Largely our drive-throughs as we're trying to -- as we're focusing on unlocking capacity and being able to accommodate the demand but it also relates to our cafes as well. But of course, more predominantly, [ drive-throughs concepts ] where we're seeing the majority of our demand currently. 
And as you might recall, at our Investor Day, we actually increased our comp guidance based on what we have seen from the investments we've been doing. So our comp guidance previously had been in the 3% to 4% range. We increased it to 4% to 5% based on these investments that we're making. And so the fact that these investments are starting to unlock productivity and we're seeing the margin benefit from those, we were able to show, on a long-term basis, that will increase comp and then subsequently increase our margin, allow us to continue to expand our margin and support our EPS growth for the longer term. So that's where you're seeing some of the tailwinds as we make these investments in the near term."

I think you mentioned that it's right just over 50% of the U.S. company-operated sales from what I think are now 23 million members. And that 23 million number feels like it's, I think based on what you last commented on maybe a year or so ago, that you have 80 million or 90 million total addressable customers that you service. So it seems like 23 million number spending clearly outsized relative to the average. So I'm just wondering what are the initiatives at this point? It seems like you're still growing that program double digits from a percentage basis, but what are the biggest initiatives to further ramp up that 23 million member base over the next 12 to 24 months?"

It is 52% of total sales in the U.S. And as you heard, we added 1 million new active members just in the last quarter alone. That was on top of the 1 million in the quarter before. And there are a few things that we're doing. One is we want to know as many customers as we possibly can. We want to personalize their experience and we want to make the experience effortless. 
And so effortless means things like mobile order, curbside, delivery. And we've looked at things like Stars for Everyone, which you've heard us launch about 6 months ago. Trying to lower the barrier to entry so that customers can get the benefits of the program and experience the incentives and the personalized experience they get through the program. And it's through those efforts that we are attracting more customers into the program. 
SFE specifically was a program that we launched to make it easier to join and to make purchases in the program with the pay-as-you-go option. So lowering those barriers to entry, reaching as many people with the program and then ensuring that the incentives and the services that are attached to that program to make the experience personalized and effortless. That's how we're growing the program. And we've seen just tremendous results, obviously, over the last 6 months with those programs, attracting new members and seeing them activate."

I think Brady and team have done a great job growing our -- keep in mind, these are 90-day active Rewards members so they are active members. When we were at about 20 million active -- 90-day active reward members, we had this conversation with the team that said, look, I believe we have an opportunity to double that number. I'm not going to give a time frame, it might take a couple of years, but double that number. 
And in doing that, we've now started to apply some very creative and very thoughtful ways to get under the data that we have about customers so that we can -- even if they're non-Rewards customers so that we can better serve them and start to personalize offers and personalize the experience for them. And so working with technology companies that have machine learning algorithms, companies like the Amperity, [ Bridge ], they've been able to help us continue to advance this. 
So I think we've got a great set of features and initiatives that enhance the customer experience and how they want to use that mobile app to personalize that customer experience in ways that are relevant to them and for us to find new ways to reach out to non-Rewards customers and start to personalize our engagement with them to bring them into becoming Rewards customers. And so we're going to think very broadly about this over the long term. And I'm optimistic that we're doing some things that are very creative, and it's just going to take some time."

We still see that high frequency overall for the program.

So we see tremendous opportunity in bringing that occasional customer into the program, providing them with a great experience, great incentives and experiences that drive their frequency over time.

And I would say that over the course of the last year, we are seeing that really come to fruition right now. 
We've talked about the resurgence of customers coming back to our stores and stores reopened. We've seen the growth of packaged coffee down the aisle during this time, not only in the U.S. but also internationally. The growth in single-serve internationally as well being on the Nespresso platform, Dolce Gusto platform, the Keurig platform. 
In addition, foodservice is going to continue to play a very important role. We just opened our 1,000th foodservice location in China this past month, and we're going to continue to expand in that way. So it's a holistic strategy. We've been able to, in the U.S., now be the #1 brand down the aisle in terms of share, and we've actually grown that share and expanded that #1 position in the quarter versus Q1. So we are seeing our customers who have loved Starbucks continue to consume our coffee and to continue to want to experience it in unique ways and we're very humbled by that."

So Brian, you can see that on our Channels business, every quarter, we get the number, we get the measurement. On our specialty coffee retail, we tend to look at Euromonitor and other longer-term data sources to give us a sense. But right now, the volume of customer occasions that have returned to our stores in the U.S. is phenomenal, and it's exceeded our forecast and our projections in the U.S. And Rossann and her team have adapted rapidly to that. 
But the thing we're most focused on is how we have rapidly adapted to shifting consumer behaviors that I outlined in sort of my opening comments, how in doing that, we extend and enhance the attributes that differentiate Starbucks from everyone else and how we then create a great experience for our customers in the stores. And the way we do that, the trade area transformation is one important initiative. But the work we do to elevate the customer experience, deliver relevant and exciting new beverages and to extend and enhance digital customer relationships are the 3 key things. 
And when you look at what's happening in each one of those areas, there's so much positive activity and initiatives and accomplishments and then customer response to those things that I just believe that we're hitting on the right notes. And at this point, I look and say, we're going to have a 2- to 3-year tailwind just simply by watching vaccinations progress around the world. This great human reconnection will happen probability 1.0. And so we are positioned for that, and we're trying to -- we're working to enhance and differentiate the brand in ways that are meaningful to us. 
We're going to take care of our partners. Our partners are the heartbeat of Starbucks. They have risen to the occasion. And so specialty coffee retail is where we set the brand. 100 million of customers a week come to see us, and that's where we establish the brand and then we amplify it through our channels. And I think in both specialty coffee retail and channels, it's happening. And so we'll give you more info as we get more data on share gains.

So we'll definitely see our ticket moderate from the high 20s where we've been. 
But we believe that some of that will sustain, now not to the degree that it's been, but if you look at some of the behaviors that have driven that, the behaviors that have driven it today are the fact that we have higher beverage attach from group orders, multiple orders. Some of that will probably moderate as people start to go back into the offices and we have more single visits and single-item purchases. But we've had an all-time food attach. This quarter was an all-time record attach on our food. And that's because we're putting forward products that our customers love and enjoy. And so they'll continue to -- if we continue to innovate in the areas that are relevant for them, we continue to see that, that will have -- that will drive food attach. 
In addition to that, we're seeing, across the board, growth in cold and some of that is from our promotional offerings as well as some of our core offerings. And I think that focus in that area, which is more premium for us in nature, is where our customers are gravitating. And so that will also help us to sustain ticket.

I, too, want to wish Durga and her husband well as they begin a new adventure in London. Durga leaves the team and our investor community in great hands with you, Greg, and thank you for stepping in to lead Investor Relations while we search for a permanent replacement for this important role. 
Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we celebrate Starbucks' 50th anniversary, we are reminded of the increasing premium on genuine human connection, which has always been at the heart of Starbucks. If there is any lesson we can take from this past year, it is that our promise to uplift you every day through authentic human connection over coffee is enduring and has never been more valuable and sought after. As humans, we belong together, and Starbucks was built for this moment. 
Now with customer mobility increasing, we are at the beginning of what we describe as the great human reconnection. The reopening of markets is translating to incredible increases in demand for Starbucks as people are again on the go, reconnecting and socializing with one another. Human connection is the very foundation of the Starbucks Experience. The differentiated experience we create for our customers, strengthened through the actions we've accelerated over the past year, enables us to meet our customers wherever they need us to be. That experience is core to who we are at Starbucks, and it drove significant momentum through Q3. That experience is also a direct reflection of the 400,000 Green Apron partners who continue to make every moment right. It is our partners who deliver the elevated and uplifting experiences for each of the millions of customers we serve every day. Our partners make the difference. They are the heartbeat of Starbucks. And for that, I am incredibly proud. 
Now let me take you through Q3, which is highlighted by record-breaking results, fueled by the continued strength of the Starbucks brand around the world. The impressive momentum Starbucks saw in Q2 accelerated through Q3, in which we delivered record revenue of $7.5 billion, up 78% year-on-year and a record non-GAAP EPS of $1.01. Additionally, 2-year comparable store sales improved sequentially, led by an incredible overall performance in the U.S. as well as significant net new store growth in China, where we reached over 5,100 stores during the quarter and the double-digit growth and continued share gains that our channels business delivered in the at-home market. 
Our performance globally reflects the strength of our diverse portfolio and the benefits of scale as we once again exceeded our expectations for the quarter, despite inflationary pressures and ongoing pandemic-related restrictions in certain global markets. Our focus, combined with our unwavering commitment to innovating and elevating the Starbucks Experience as our key differentiator, has proven successful time and time again. All of this gives us confidence to raise guidance for the balance of the year and further positions the company for solid long-term growth. 
In the U.S., our momentum accelerated in Q3, posting year-on-year revenue growth of 90% and 2-year revenue growth of 16%. Comparable same-store sales grew 83%. And importantly, 2-year comp grew 10%. This is at the high end of our long-term annual comp growth target of 4% to 5%. We posted these results even with mobility restrictions still impacting some U.S. geographies, with industry-wide pressure in pockets of the supply chain and with our in-store cafe seating not yet fully reopened. Not only have we posted incredible results as we emerge from the pandemic, our internal research also confirms Starbucks has gained meaningful market share in the U.S. And the momentum we have created is sustainable. In fact, Starbucks competitive share is the highest this year than it has ever been in the away-from-home coffee and tea category. Simply put, our Green Apron partners are delivering an experience that customers are craving. And the growing opportunities serve our customers with the unmatched experience Starbucks offers gives us resounding confidence in the strength of the brand and the growth potential ahead. 
One powerful example of innovation that is fueling our momentum is our beverage portfolio, which, when coupled with our unparalleled ability for customizing handcrafted beverages, separates Starbucks from the competition. The investments we have made over the past few years, innovating and expanding our coffee forward cold beverage platform, continue to boost sales and draw new customers to Starbucks. We continue to see strong demand for Starbucks Cold Brew, Nitro Cold Brew and Starbucks Refresher beverages. While iced shake and espresso alone contributed more than 1/3 of the iced espresso growth in the quarter, the cold category represented 74% of beverage sales in Q3, growing 10 percentage points over the past 2 years. With the wide range of beverage options, both cold and hot, our customers love personalizing their drinks. Over the last 2 years, we've seen a meaningful increase in customizations, such as adding cold foam or a shot of espresso. Additionally, alternative dairy offerings represent nearly 25% of milk-related beverage sales, up from prior year. These innovative offerings in cold and alternative dairy are particularly attractive to millennial and Gen Z customers and are aligned with our focus on the well-being of people and the planet. With premium customization of beverages, coupled with operational improvements, the growth of both hot and cold beverages in stores is enabling margin expansion despite some continued inflationary pressures, which Rachel will discuss in more detail. 
In addition to beverage platform innovation, extending the in-store experience with digital customer relationships continues to extend our reach, deepen engagement and enhance the customer experience, further differentiating Starbucks and offering customers ever-increasing choice as to how they engage with the brand. We again added over 1 million new active Starbucks Rewards members in the quarter. With over 24 million active members now representing 51% of all spend in our U.S. stores and up 8 percentage points over pre-pandemic levels, our ability to engage has never been higher. More and more of these customers are embracing experiences that effortlessly fit their lifestyle. With drive-through representing 47% of transactions and mobile ordering for in-store pickup, delivery or curbside at 26% of transactions, we are leveraging all channels to better serve our customers. 
While it is very clear that our Rewards program has accelerated our recovery in a meaningful way, where Q3 really stands out and what adds to our confidence is the acceleration we saw in our non-Rewards customers. While Rewards spend grew at a rapid mid-teens rate quarter-over-quarter, for the first time in 11 quarters, non-Rewards spend growth outpaced SR spend. This is further evidence of the great human reconnection. The rapid reengagement of non-Rewards customers not only propelled our record results, but also underscores the strength of the brand and the growth potential ahead. 
And finally, we continue to make meaningful progress to reposition our U.S. store portfolio through trade area transformation, which is now nearly 80% complete. In the past 12 months, we have opened 554 new stores combined in-store seating and drive-through service. This portfolio repositioning and new store formats have increased drive-through store performance to 75% of our total U.S. sales, a number that continues to rise as we increase efficiency. The improvements and additions we are making to our portfolio today will provide benefits for years to come. With our focus on the customer experience, new beverage innovation and digital customer relationships, we continue to increase share of customer occasions while also contributing to a rapidly growing market for all things coffee. 
Moving on to China, where we posted a very positive result with year-on-year revenue growth of 45%. Remarkably, total revenue in China has grown 23% in just 2 years as we continue to play the long game. And we are on track to open more than 600 net new stores this fiscal year. In Q3 alone, we opened 162 net new stores that continue to deliver best-in-class new store profitability and returns. We ended the quarter with 5,135 stores, and we are well on track to operate over 6,000 stores by the end of fiscal year '22. In addition, we posted 19% same-store comp growth in Q3 and saw sequential acceleration of our 2-year comp when excluding the impact of value-added tax. Furthermore, we gained strong momentum with sequential improvement on every key metric on a 2-year basis, including total revenue growth, store traffic recovery and margin expansion. The health of our business in China is strong, and we've never been more confident in the long-term growth opportunity. 
In addition to significant new store growth and sequential acceleration of 2-year comps in China, we are expanding digital customer relationships and engagement by creating new occasions and experiences that make mobile ordering even more convenient and personalized. This has resonated strongly with our customers in China, propelling mobile ordering to 34% of sales, significantly higher than the 23% in the prior year and more than double pre-COVID levels. 
Starbucks Rewards continues to aggressively expand our digital ecosystem across major platforms, driving 90-day active members to an all-time high of 17 million, a 4% increase over previous quarter and a 71% increase versus prior year. Gold members, a very important cohort, are engaging Starbucks at pre-pandemic levels. 
Our performance in China is a testimony to the unparalleled strength of the Starbucks brand and our enduring relationship with our Chinese customers. Our rapidly growing store footprint, market-leading digital ecosystem and customer engagement, robust innovation pipeline and the enduring love and loyalty for the Starbucks brand in China are all unmatched. I have full confidence in the strength of the Starbucks brand in China and across all our international markets. There should be no misunderstanding of how big and robust our business in China is and will be. These are still early days, and our strategies are clearly working. Starbucks is uniquely positioned for success in China well into the future. 
With phenomenal strength and growing momentum in our retail business, let me now move on to our Channel Development segment that also continues to exceed expectations. Over the past 3 years, we have made significant progress expanding our reach and amplifying the Starbucks brand through CPG, single-serve coffee, ready-to-drink and foodservice. I attribute our success to the power of the Starbucks brand, the bold innovation that attracts new coffee levers into our categories and the caliber of our strategic business partners globally. In Q3, Starbucks retained our #1 brand position in total U.S. at-home coffee and further expanded our leadership position versus other brands. The Starbucks brand continued to increase share in the total U.S. category, impressively adding 1 percentage point over the prior year despite lapping a strong comp. The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé is a powerhouse, and we continue to see strong performance across all aspects of the key strategic relationship. Earlier this year, building on the success of the Starbucks by Nespresso platform, we expanded and introduced Starbucks by Nespresso on the virtual line, which is already exceeding 6-month distribution and velocity targets. In addition, the combination of strong CPG performance combined with a steady recovery in food service gives us added confidence. In ready-to-drink, Starbucks is the #1 premium brand globally, with our North America coffee partnership with PepsiCo growing 19% in consumption and our international ready-to-drink business growing double digits in EMEA and China, Asia Pacific. These channels amplify our brand in more than 80 markets around the world, offering millions of customers at-home and at-work options that complement their Starbucks in-store experience. And just yesterday, we announced plans to reach new markets and grow our Starbucks ready-to-drink portfolio with Nestlé, who will now serve markets across Southeast Asia and Latin America. Our channel development strategy to amplify the brand, while growing share of at-home occasions, continues to attract new customers to Starbucks with unparalleled choice while driving best-in-class returns. 
The key takeaway from today's call is this. We look to the future with as much conviction as ever in our strategy as this quarter represents the beginning of a multiyear tailwind for Starbucks that is powered by 3 factors. First, the total coffee addressable market is large and growing rapidly. The market is expected to grow to well over $400 billion in size globally over the next 3 years. That represents a compound annual growth rate of 8% to 9% as the market rapidly recovers from the global pandemic. Second, within this large and growing market, consumer preferences continue to shift from mainstream robusta coffee to premium arabica coffee, where Starbucks is the leader. Third, and perhaps most important, Starbucks is rapidly adapted to new consumer behaviors and strengthened key points of differentiation. Our focus on the customer experience, relevant new beverage platforms and expanded digital customer relationships are translating to increased consumer preference and deeper customer engagement. The combination of a highly differentiated brand experience, a continued consumer shift to premium arabica coffee and a large and growing addressable market is a powerful trifecta that provides our business with a multiyear tailwind. These factors, reinforced by the results of this past quarter, give us confidence that this is just the beginning of what is about to unfold. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rachel, who will walk you through details of our Q3 results. Rachel?"

I'm thrilled to share with you the results of this milestone quarter, delivering record revenue and record non-GAAP EPS only 4 quarters after the depth of the pandemic. Over the past year, we have proven our",2043,"Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm thrilled to share with you the results of this milestone quarter, delivering record revenue and record non-GAAP EPS only 4 quarters after the depth of the pandemic. Over the past year, we have proven our ability to differentiate ourselves to the unique and personalized experiences we create for Starbucks customers, whether in our stores, through our app or down the grocery aisle, leading to this quarter's impressive results. 
Starbucks global revenue reached $7.5 billion in Q3, up 78% from the prior year, far surpassing the pre-pandemic quarterly record set in Q1 fiscal '20 driven largely by the incredible performance in the U.S., our largest market. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $1.01, up from the loss of $0.46 in the prior year driven by faster-than-expected margin recovery in the Americas due to sales leverage from lapping prior year COVID-19 impacts and the benefit from continued strength in average ticket. Our Q3 EPS includes $0.09 of benefit related to discrete tax items, most of which was originally anticipated in Q4 as referenced on our previous earnings call. The investments we have made in our business have made Starbucks stronger, more resilient and positioned for long-term growth. This powerful momentum gives us the confidence to meaningfully raise our EPS outlook for the full year, as I'll explain later. 
I will now take you through our Q3 fiscal '21 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. Our Americas segment, which fueled our record quarter, delivered revenue of $5.4 billion in Q3, 92% higher than the prior year primarily driven by an 84% increase in comparable store sales, including 82% comp transaction growth. As Kevin mentioned, U.S. comparable store sales growth reached 83% in Q3, driven by a material improvement in transaction comp of 80%. Average store transactions continued to grow and ended the quarter at nearly 90% of pre-pandemic levels, presenting further opportunity to return to and grow beyond FY '19 levels. 
As transactions have grown we've maintained the strength in average ticket, up 1% over the prior year, remaining significantly elevated as many key post-pandemic consumer trends have continued. Growth of cold beverages and customization, coupled with sustained strong beverage attach and record food attach in Q3, all contributed to the strong ticket and give us confidence in our ability to maintain a meaningful portion of the ticket gains over the coming quarters. 
Americas Q3 non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 24.7%, up more than 200 basis points from Q3 of fiscal 2019, largely driven by sales leverage on our product and distribution costs, including waste favorability, the benefits of SKU rationalization over the prior 2 years and favorable sales mix shift. Pricing and the benefits of trade area transformation also helped to offset the sizable investments in wages and benefits as well as higher supply chain costs due to inflationary pressures. While we're thrilled with our margin performance in Q3, we expect it to moderate slightly in Q4, primarily due to the growing impact of inflation, coupled with incremental investments critical to our continued growth, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Moving on to international. The International segment delivered revenue of $1.7 billion in Q3. Excluding a 10% favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the segment's revenue grew 65% over the prior year, reflecting a 41% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 5% adverse impact from lapping the prior year VAT benefit. Strong sales growth from our international licensees as well as 8% net new store growth over the prior -- over the past 12 months also contributed to this growth. 
Kevin spoke to our performance in China. In addition, the International segment performance was adversely impacted by virus resurgences in Japan with a state of emergency severely limiting consumer traffic during most of the quarter. It's important to remember that the vast majority of international markets in which we operate are behind the U.S. in terms of both vaccination and mobility so revenue recovery is predictably lagging in those markets. Still, our partners in every market remain focused on what they can control and what they do best. The moments of connection they are providing our customers during these challenging times will support growth as vaccination rates improve. 
International's non-GAAP operating margin rose to 22.5% from minus 2.7% in the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage from lapping the impacts of COVID-19 as well as store labor efficiencies across our company-operated markets in larger government subsidies. On a 2-year basis, these temporary subsidies provided an approximately 200 basis point benefit in the quarter, boosting the segment's non-GAAP operating margin close to its pre-pandemic level of [ 22.7 ] in Q3 fiscal '19. 
On to Channel Development. Revenue was $414 million in Q3, a decline of 7% from the prior year, primarily driven by Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business. When excluding the approximately 20% adverse impact of these transition-related activities, Channel Development's revenue increased by 13% in Q3, mainly driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance product sales and our ready-to-drink business. The segment's non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 46.7% in Q3 from 35.6% in the prior year. Normalizing for the 700 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 410 basis points in Q3, driven primarily by the strength of our ready-to-drink business. We expect the impacts from the transition to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal '21. 
Finally, at the consolidated level, our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5% in Q3, up from minus 12.6% in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in our operating margin for Q3 was primarily driven by sales leverage across the P&L as we lap COVID-19 impacts and related costs as well as pricing in the Americas. These were partially offset by additional investments in retail store partner wages and benefits, which remain a strategic priority for us to support our world-class partners. 
Given the strength of our performance in Q3 and the optimism we have for the fourth quarter, we're pleased to update our guidance across a number of key areas. We expect the momentum we have seen in the U.S., underpinned by the ongoing great human reconnection to continue, and as a result, we expect both Americas and U.S. comparable store sales growth in Q4 in the range of 22% to 25%.  This corresponds to a 2-year comp range for Q4 of 11% to 13%, reflecting further sequential improvement from an already strong level of 9% in the Americas in Q3. As a reminder, the 2-year comps we are monitoring are calculated on a multiplicative basis instead of an additive basis as described in today's earnings release. 
For the International segment where sporadic virus resurgences continue to impair consumer mobility in some markets, we now expect comparable store sales to grow mid- to high single digits in Q4. For China, we expect comparable store sales to be roughly flat in Q4. Similar to the Americas, these ranges for both international and China translate to a meaningful sequential improvement in 2-year comp from Q3 to Q4 despite the challenging market dynamics expected to linger in Q4. 
Based on the outlook for the segment, we now expect Q4 consolidated comp growth in the range of 18% to 21%. On a 2-year basis, this equates to a range of 7% to 10%, a considerable sequential increase from the Q3 2-year comp of 4%. 
Moving on to retail store development. Although we expect approximately 1,100 net new stores globally in fiscal '21, we now anticipate a slight shift between our segments. For the Americas, we now expect the total store count in fiscal '21 to remain roughly flat to prior year as the new store openings are virtually offset by higher-than-normal closures, reflecting the continued progress of our accelerated trade area transformation initiative. For international, net new stores for fiscal '21 are expected to increase to approximately 1,100 from 1,050 in the original guidance. With the updated comp sales and the store growth outlook, we are also tightening our guidance for full year fiscal '21 consolidated revenue to a new range of $29.1 billion to $29.3 billion from $28.5 billion to $29.3 billion. This includes channel development revenue, which is now expected in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for full year fiscal '21 compared to the previous guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, reflecting the segment's strong performance to date. As a reminder, our fiscal '21 consolidated revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately $0.5 billion for the 53rd week. 
Additionally, given the faster-than-expected margin recovery to date, we are raising our consolidated GAAP operating margin outlook for the full year to approximately 17%, up from the previous range of 15% to 16%. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to reach approximately 18% in fiscal '21, up from the previous guidance of 16.5% to 17.5%, reflecting the momentum we saw in Q3 and expect in Q4. Our operating margin has tempered a bit by 2 factors that we see growing in relevance in Q4 and into fiscal '22. The first is our latest view on rising global inflation requiring continued incremental investments to support our growth. The second is our strong commitment to increasing wages of partners, making deliberate investments towards an hourly wage for $15 in the U.S., in line with the announcement we made in November of last year. As Kevin mentioned, our Green Apron partners are fundamental to the Starbucks Experience and are critical to our long-term success. These important wage increases, coupled with continued investment in digital initiatives and operational efficiencies, will further solidify the foundation for our next stage of growth. 
Given the accelerated timing of certain discrete tax benefits in Q3, I noted earlier, which were originally anticipated in Q4, we now forecast our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate to increase to the low 20% from our previous outlook of high teens. For fiscal '21, our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates are expected in the low 20% range, revised from the previous guidance of low to mid-20%. 
Summing this all up, driven by the tremendous momentum we've seen as customers return to our stores propelling our record results in Q3, we are raising our full year fiscal '21 EPS guidance. Our new fiscal '21 GAAP EPS guidance range is $2.97 to $3.02, up from $2.65 to $2.75 previously. Our fiscal '21 non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.25 , up from our prior range of $2.90 to $3. This predominantly reflects our better-than-expected performance to date as well as the improved outlook for Q4, barring any new significant and sustained waves of COVID-19 infections and any major economic disruptions. As a reminder, our fiscal '21 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges include approximately $0.10 of benefit for the 53rd week. 
Consistent with our past practice, we will provide guidance for fiscal '22 on our Q4 earnings call. However, I should note that the earlier-than-expected margin recovery we saw in Q3 and expect in Q4 not contemplated when we provided our fiscal '22 EPS growth outlook at our December Investor Day. We are pleased with the strength of our business and we'll provide our FY '22 outlook during our Q4 call. Importantly, our ongoing commitment to the double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth at scale remains strongly intact. 
To summarize, Q3 performance exceeded our expectations with record revenue and earnings, underscoring the resilience and power of our brand, which remains as relevant as ever. While temporary marketplace dynamics will impact our business until the global pandemic is behind us, the enduring strength of the Starbucks experience, fueled by our incredible partners around the globe, remains intact, thriving in this moment of human reconnection and continuing to guide our long-term growth. And as always, the credit for our success this quarter and in the future belongs to our Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the green apron. They have our greatest respect and appreciation. 
And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Culver, Michael Conway and Belinda Wong. Thank you. Operator?"

With that said, the third quarter shortfall and seemingly a significant reduction in the fiscal '21 guidance. I'm just wondering whether you're concerned at all about that. It sounds like from your commentary, not so much. I'm just wondering maybe you can give some color, or Belinda, perhaps in terms of what you attribute the slowdown which you expect to continue, whether maybe China is seeing a virus uptick or whether -- I know some people are fearful that there's consumer pushback on certain U.S. brands?

And every step of the way, we have built Starbucks in China for China. And the brand resonates with our customers in China. So I think that's number one. 
Number two, we are in a market-building mode right now where most of our growth comes from the new stores that we open. And the fact that the new stores that we have been opening are performing at some of the highest levels of prior generations gives us confidence that we are continuing to expand our reach and presence in China. I think those 2 things. Certainly, from a geopolitical standpoint, we've -- we've got businesses in 84 markets around the world. So we constantly deal with geopolitical situations. And I'd say there's not a geopolitical situation that has really impacted us in China over the last couple of years. And I don't really foresee that happening as long as we continue to stay focused on what we do and what we do well, which is create a great experience for our customers in China, take care of our Starbucks partners who proudly wear the green apron in China. 
And we're bullish. We continue to invest, whether it's the investment we're making in new stores, whether it's the Coffee Innovation Park, the first sustainable roasting plant that we're building in China, the work we're doing with coffee farmers in Yunnan. And I sort of look at this navigating some of the implications of COVID as just being short term. And so that's why I kind of look at it as a very -- from a very bullish perspective long term.

Now if you exclude the adverse impacts from lapping prior year VAT exemption benefit, outcome grew actually 24% in the quarter. Our previous comp guidance has assumed a shorter time frame for the lifting of travel restrictions and also less of the uncertainties that we have faced in the market. And hence, we are adjusting our comp guidance to reflect the uncertainties. Now make no mistake that the short-term volatility that we're facing today are only temporary. The recovery, as we've always said, will continue to be nonlinear. 
Now 1 point that you have to fully realize is that we have fully regained our pre-COVID pace of store development. And Kevin spoke about the achievements that we achieved in Q3, and we are well on track to open more than 600 net new stores this fiscal year and operate 6,000 stores by the next fiscal year. 
And on top of that, yes, we are delivering best-in-class store profitability and returns. We are meeting the year 1 new store performance guidance that we provided during last Investor Day. And please note that our focus in the past decade has always been about total revenue growth and reaching new customers for them to trial the Starbucks Experience and coffee in China market. And majority of our total revenue growth and close to [ 70% ] of that comes from new stores. There's huge runway for growth in China due to growing coffee consumption and the addressable market, rising middle-class population and disposable income. So we're still in very early chapters of our growth story here in this market. 
My personal on-the-ground experience and what I see here in the market gives me full confidence in the resiliency and the dynamism of the Chinese consumer economy. No other F&B retailer or specialty coffee brands possess our speed, quality, coverage of our national footprint, our market-leading digital ecosystem and customer engagement, our robust innovation pipeline and the strength of our brand, these are all unmatched in China, and we are well positioned than ever to continue to win in this market. 
We will focus on what we can control. Our strategies are clearly working. So we are playing the long game here and ready and excited to capture the additional growing opportunities once the international travel restrictions are lifted and the pandemic is behind us."

The other thing that I would point out is the guidance that we gave for Q4 on comp for international and China, it implies a sequential improvement on a 2-year basis from Q3 to Q4. So I think it's important to show that we're continuing to be optimistic and showing continued momentum in the business for the remainder of this fiscal year."

The way I think about it is, let me put it into a little bit of context is, in Q3, our margin was incredible. I mean, we -- from a standpoint of both -- across all of our markets, we saw margin expansion versus prior year and even against FY '19. And a big driver of that was our sales leverage as well as comping over COVID impacts broadly pricing. But it did help to offset some accelerated investments we've made in wage as well as inflationary pressures. When you think about Q4, we would expect, as we've guided, we guided our margin to increase from 16.5% to 17.5%, going to 18% for the balance of the year. So this shows our optimism and the continued momentum in the business. But what I caution is there's a slightly lower relative to the performance we saw in Q3 based on increasing costs that we see related to inflation as well as the continued investments that we need to make in our business. Those investments were critical to our recovery, but they're more important even foundationally for growth. 
And so as we think about FY '22, we're not going to provide guidance for FY '22 today. That will be on our Q4 call to give us time to complete our annual operating plan, which we're in the process of right now. But if you think about that, some of what we guided at Investor Day from that growth in FY '22 has been pulled forward into FY '21. But I want to be clear that we remain committed to double-digit EPS -- non-GAAP EPS growth. So we're committed to that. When you think about that margin that we laid out at Investor Day, that 18% to 19%, that was up from 17% to 18% that we had guided previously. That accounted for the benefit that we're seeing from the investments we're making. So it just again reiterates the importance of those investments. And so when we think about that guidance at Investor Day, what it allows us to do is modestly expand margin while continuing to invest. And again, we'll provide further guidance on FY '22 at our Q4 call, but that's how I put it into perspective."

I mean, I think it probably would have been a rational expectation to think lapping a 27% ticket from the second quarter -- excuse me, the third quarter of '20 would have basically been impossible and yet you were able to do that for all the reasons that you pointed out. Yet I would have thought, as people came back in the morning and migrated more towards single-order transactions, just by definition, that would have fallen. So could you kind of give some more color around maintaining that average ticket. I think there was a comment made in the prepared remarks about the -- excuse me, about maintaining a significant portion of that pricing. But whether, in fact, it can be 100% of the ticket lift that you got over the past 5 quarters or so. 
And secondly, China was the inverse of that. Even if I adjust for that benefit from the previous year, the ticket was actually down in China, which isn't very common, especially in an inflationary environment, if you could talk about the China ticket as well. And for both businesses, just your attitude on overall menu pricing, given what is your inflationary cost pressure, is that something that a consumer may expect as well as higher pricing, whether that's something that may accelerate as well on the menu for both businesses."

We continue to see strong sales recovery in the rural and suburban areas of the business, and in particular, drive-through, where drive-throughs are most common. That is helping us to drive larger orders and a higher ticket. We saw record ticket in the quarter from an overall U.S. perspective. 
Now we're also, at the same time, as the customers become more mobile and start coming back into the central business district in the urban core, we did achieve a positive comp for the first time in that trade area since Q1 of FY '20, which gives us even more optimism for the future recovery of the business. 
Now as that recovers, in the Central Business District in urban core, what we do expect is that the customers will begin frequenting those stores in those areas. And as part of that, transactions will increase, but ticket will moderately decrease and it will balance itself out over time. We see great opportunity to continue to drive transactions in our stores right now. Broadly across the U.S. of business, we're operating at about 90% of pre-COVID transaction levels. So we've got a lot of room to go to grow back to a more normalized rate pre-pandemic wise as it relates to transactions. And as we do that, we do expect the tickets to moderately decline during that time."

Our actual ticket continues to be at one of our highest levels and it's our third consecutive quarter. And we continue to see, as John mentioned, as we see more single beverage transactions, we expect our ticket to moderate, but we do believe that our ticket will remain elevated, slightly elevated, compared to where from a pre-pandemic level. And drivers of that are the attach that John spoke about as well as the continued attach we see in food, our ability to continue to move customers to our cold beverages, which have a more premium price. In addition to our promotional offerings and our customization, those are other ways that we're further evolving our ticket across the U.S. and Americas space. 
And what I want to just point out is that the margin that we're guiding to for the balance of the year, increasing to 18%, again, up from the 16.5% to 17% -- 17.5% on a non-GAAP basis that we previously guided, part of that growth is really coming from an elevated ticket.

I know there's been a lot on written in the press about the cold weather that's hit Brazil and the implications on the sea price of coffee. And so just to give you some context, on the increasing [indiscernible] price of coffee, you should know that over the years, we've created a very thoughtful approach to how we source, warehouse and use hedging techniques to ensure we always have supply of premium Arabica green coffee at an attractive cost basis. In fact, we purchase green coffee 12 to 18 months in advance, and we never stopped buying green coffee through the pandemic. So as a result, we currently have over 14 months of price forward coverage, which means we have price locked on our coverage for the next 14 months which gets us through the rest of fiscal year '21 and most of fiscal year '22. And I think we may be the only large buyer of green coffee that uses this approach, and that will serve us well as it gives us a significant advantage relative to our competitors who, if they don't buy this far in advance, will certainly not have that cost structure that we put in place. And so I just want to comment on that since it's been in the press and kind of relates to your question, John, on inflation."

I know you talked about inflationary pressures, but some companies talk about the aggregate inflation, some even talk about wages. Is there inflation coming in the supply chain? Is there a way to quantify that? And how do you think about pricing in that context? Are you willing to take an unusual amount of pricing relative to history to offset that? Or do you find there's other places in the P&L? I mean it's notable that some of your peers are taking significant amounts of pricing now. They feel like they have that power. I always thought Starbucks had that power maybe use it more judiciously, but is your frame of how you think about pricing changing because of this environment?"

But within that, we covered headwinds in the Americas business of about 70 basis points. And we expect headwinds related to rising costs and inflationary pressures to continue into Q4, which is reflected in the guidance that we've given. 
Now some of the ways that we not only offset headwinds such as inflation, but also the investments we're making are price. And we've always been very thoughtful and measured in the pricing actions we take so that we don't inhibit growth. And I would say our pricing strategy hasn't fundamentally changed. We're very surgical in nature. We look on a store-by-store basis, and we leverage analytics and insights. And importantly, what our analytics and insights show us is that we do have pricing power. And we see that in the premiumization of our beverages, the gravitation towards our promotional offerings. And this is our opportunity to be able to leverage price in those ways, which is one of the reasons why we talk about our ticket continuing to stay elevated, not at the rate that we have today, but a slightly elevated. But pricing will be one of many levers that we use to offset these headwinds. For example, we'll continue to drive customization with our customers, continue to drive our customers to our cold beverage offerings where we have a more premium nature, continue to drive beverage and food and [ tach ] when and where possible, those are ways to continue to have an elevated ticket. So through pricing, an elevated ticket, we'll also continue to look at efficiencies in our supply chain as well as efficiencies in G&A. So this particular quarter, we saw our G&A returning to pre-pandemic levels, and we'll continue to find efficiencies in G&A over time with our goal to be able to grow G&A less than our revenue growth as another way. 
In addition to that, we're seeing benefit from trade area transformation. Our trade area transformation in the Americas and more broadly in the segment, delivered almost 80 basis points on margin. That's meaningful. And so we continue, as we've optimized that portfolio, that's yet another lever that we're using to help offset not only headwinds related to inflation, but also the investments that we know we need to make that are critical to our growth in the future. And those are investments both in wages for our partners as well as investments in our service experience and our throughput as well as investments in digital initiatives. All those are critical for our growth in the future and really our fueling our not only our recovery, but will fuel the growth for years to come. So those are important investments for us broadly. And those are the ways we think about how we'll offset those increasing costs while still modestly expanding margin."

Chris, the one thing I would add to what Kevin is saying is the Success of the Stars for Everyone program that we launched a little over 3 quarters ago. It makes it easier for people to join the Starbucks Rewards program. It enables customers to make purchases by adding alternative payment options in addition to utilizing store value. And really, what we're seeing there is that it's helped to drive the 49% increase that we're seeing year-over-year in membership across broadly the Starbucks Reward program. 
To put that into context, we have added nearly 5 million 90-day active members since the beginning of this fiscal year. And what this has done, it's driven a meaningful increase in the conversion rate for those who joined the Starbucks Rewards program. And really, while we're not seeing a material shift from customers leaving the store value program to alternate payment methods, the vast majority of the customers who use these alternative payment methods are new or reengaged members that we're tracking back into the program. So going forward, we're going to continue to double down on both our Rewards members as well as our non-Rewards members.

It's very exciting to talk about this because the U.S. team has done a remarkable job in terms of driving throughput and operational efficiencies overall. One of the big things to note is that we have returned to pre-",609,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Dennis. It's very exciting to talk about this because the U.S. team has done a remarkable job in terms of driving throughput and operational efficiencies overall. One of the big things to note is that we have returned to pre-pandemic levels in terms of our overall operating efficiencies within our stores. So that's very encouraging to see. 
The other thing that we've done to drive productivity and operational efficiencies in the store a couple of things. First, we significantly upgraded our Play Builder program, which allows us to be more effective in how we deploy our labor. We've also made good investments, strong investments in customer service training. And if you look at it over the last 18 months or so since COVID has hit, about 70% -- roughly 70% of our partners have been hired in these last 18 months, and they've been operating in this COVID-restricted environment. So we're reinvesting now in customer service training for our partners as customers become more mobile and frequent in our stores. 
Now in addition to the ongoing operations and how our stores and partners are operating, we've also made equipment innovation investments as well that is driving throughput as well as efficiency. The [indiscernible] [ 2 ] espresso machines, it's a big investment that we're making. We have it deployed at 70% of our U.S. company-operated stores. We'll complete the rollout in fiscal year '22. We've introduced a new warming oven, the Merrychef Warming Oven, which is an upgrade to our current ovens. That's currently in 20% of our stores, and will be in 35% of the stores by the end of the fiscal year. And then with the success of cold beverages and in particular, Cold Brew, we've developed a proprietary cold brew system, brewing system, to our Trier center that's currently in 2,000 U.S. stores and we'll have it in 75% of our stores by the end of the year. It makes brewing the product more efficient. It is also a more efficient use of partner time, and it fits within the back of the house. 
The other big thing that we're rolling out, which I'm excited about and our supply chain team has worked with the operations team on, is automated inventory ordering. And this is a system that we have been testing. We just recently expanded the test. We're now rolling it out to 1,500 stores this past week. It basically removes the inventory task from our store partners and allows them to focus on their customers and the customer experience. And we expect that this will be fully rolled out in all company-operated stores for food and merchandise items by the end of the calendar year. 
And then just one other thing that you asked about, about drive-through. We're doing a lot of work on drive-through and revolutionizing the drive-through experience. So really focusing on decreasing the out-the-window times for the drive-through experience. We've introduced new equipment and technology with handheld order points to target to improve the speed of service. We've also introduced tech improvements to make the orders more easily managed through consolidation and handoff. And we're going through and renovating about 150 constrained drive-through stores to design a new engine, removing pace or cases or repositioning it, and really indicating a POS system to that drive-through location. And then we're not stopping there. We're continuing to innovate about what is the next evolution of the drive-thru store for our customers. So a lot of great work by the teams broadly across operations, store development, supply chain and the technology team. So hats off to all of them."

And then sort of relatedly, looking back at this last quarter, anytime you've done in the past, the type of performance you've done in cold beverage and Rewards user growth, I would expect a sequential acceleration.

So we're showing that we're expecting -- we're implying that we'll have improvement above the 10%, and we've given a range of about 11% to 13% on a 2-year basis. So that certainly reflects the momentum we've seen in the business and the momentum we're expecting as we see more customers returning to the stores. As I mentioned, we had a very similar customer count, overall count in terms of this quarter versus pre-pandemic. But our opportunity really continues to be -- we certainly have the ability to bring more customers in, but our opportunity is the frequency of those customers. We ended the quarter at about 90% of where we've been from a transaction standpoint prior to the pandemic, so in FY '19 levels, and that's really our opportunity. And we reflected that in the guidance we've given, but I'll give it to John to add some further commentary on that."

I think that we're very optimistic in terms of customers returning to our stores and in our stores being ready with relevant innovation that resonates very strongly with our customers. And nowhere are we seeing that more than with cold and cold beverages. As we shared, record 74% of beverage sales in Q3, that's 13 percentage points higher than what it was in the previous quarter. 
And it's important to note, and Rachel mentioned this, but I just want to emphasize, cold beverages are generally ticket and margin accretive. So how do we classify cold beverages? It's Cold Brew, it's Nitro Cold Brew, it's iced shaken espressos and it's refreshers. And then you couple those products with the ability to customize and personalize to the customers' desires. We've got a wide range of beverage options for customers that are both hot as well as cold. And we're seeing meaningful growth in the customization of our beverages in the modifiers that people are adding to their products, such as espresso shots, cold foam, alternate dairy and really driving awareness of the -- of these personalized offerings and our customers are resonating with that. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing. We're very optimistic but we realize it's also at the same time that we've got to earn our customers' trust, loyalty and respect each and every day, and our partners are doing yeoman's work in terms of creating that great experience that customers have come to expect. So congratulations to that."

Durga leaves the team and our investor community in great hands with you, Greg, and thank you for stepping in to lead Investor Relations while we search for a permanent replacement for this important role.  
Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we celebrate Starbucks' 50th anniversary, we are reminded of the increasing premium on genuine human connection, which has always been at the heart of Starbucks. If there is any lesson we can take from this past year, it is that our promise to uplift you every day through authentic human connection over coffee is enduring and has never been more valuable and sought after. As humans, we belong together, and Starbucks was built for this moment.  
Now with customer mobility increasing, we are at the beginning of what we describe as the great human reconnection. The reopening of markets is translating to incredible increases in demand for Starbucks as people are again on the go, reconnecting and socializing with one another. Human connection is the very foundation of the Starbucks Experience. The differentiated experience we create for our customers, strengthened through the actions we've accelerated over the past year, enables us to meet our customers wherever they need us to be. That experience is core to who we are at Starbucks, and it drove significant momentum through Q3. That experience is also a direct reflection of the 400,000 Green Apron partners who continue to make every moment right. It is our partners who deliver the elevated and uplifting experiences for each of the millions of customers we serve every day.  
Our partners make the difference. They are the heartbeat of Starbucks. And for that, I am incredibly proud.  
Now let me take you through Q3, which is highlighted by record-breaking results, fueled by the continued strength of the Starbucks brand around the world. The impressive momentum Starbucks saw in Q2 accelerated through Q3, in which we delivered record revenue of $7.5 billion, up 78% year-on-year and a record non-GAAP EPS of $1.01. Additionally, 2-year comparable store sales improved sequentially, led by an incredible overall performance in the U.S. as well as significant net new store growth in China, where we reached over 5,100 stores during the quarter and the double-digit growth and continued share gains that our channels business delivered in the at-home market.  
Our performance globally reflects the strength of our diverse portfolio and the benefits of scale as we once again exceeded our expectations for the quarter, despite inflationary pressures and ongoing pandemic-related restrictions in certain global markets. Our focus, combined with our unwavering commitment to innovating and elevating the Starbucks Experience as our key differentiator, has proven successful time and time again. All of this gives us confidence to raise guidance for the balance of the year and further positions the company for solid long-term growth.  
In the U.S., our momentum accelerated in Q3, posting year-on-year revenue growth of 90% and 2-year revenue growth of 16%. Comparable same-store sales grew 83%. And importantly, 2-year comp grew 10%. This is at the high end of our long-term annual comp growth target of 4% to 5%. We posted these results even with mobility restrictions still impacting some U.S. geographies, with industry-wide pressure in pockets of the supply chain and with our in-store cafe seating not yet fully reopened. 
Not only have we posted incredible results as we emerge from the pandemic, our internal research also confirms Starbucks has gained meaningful market share in the U.S. And the momentum we have created is sustainable. In fact, Starbucks competitive share is the highest this year than it has ever been in the away-from-home coffee and tea category. Simply put, our Green Apron partners are delivering an experience that customers are craving, and the growing opportunities serve our customers with the unmatched experience Starbucks offers gives us resounding confidence in the strength of the brand and the growth potential ahead.  
One powerful example of innovation that is fueling our momentum is our beverage portfolio, which, when coupled with our unparalleled ability for customizing handcrafted beverages, separates Starbucks from the competition. The investments we have made over the past few years, innovating and expanding our coffee forward cold beverage platform, continue to boost sales and draw new customers to Starbucks. 
We continue to see strong demand for Starbucks Cold Brew, Nitro Cold Brew and Starbucks Refresher beverages, while Iced Shaken Espresso alone contributed more than 1/3 of the Iced Espresso growth in the quarter. The cold category represented 74% of beverage sales in Q3, growing 10 percentage points over the past 2 years. With the wide range of beverage options, both cold and hot, our customers love personalizing their drinks. 
Over the last 2 years, we've seen a meaningful increase in customizations, such as adding cold foam or a shot of espresso. Additionally, alternative dairy offerings represent nearly 25% of milk-related beverage sales, up from prior year. These innovative offerings in cold and alternative dairy are particularly attractive to millennial and Gen Z customers and are aligned with our focus on the well-being of people and the planet. With premium customization of beverages, coupled with operational improvements, the growth of both hot and cold beverages in stores is enabling margin expansion despite some continued inflationary pressures, which Rachel will discuss in more detail.  
In addition to beverage platform innovation, extending the in-store experience with digital customer relationships continues to extend our reach, deepen engagement and enhance the customer experience, further differentiating Starbucks and offering customers ever-increasing choice as to how they engage with the brand. We again added over 1 million new active Starbucks Rewards members in the quarter. With over 24 million active members now representing 51% of all spend in our U.S. stores and up 8 percentage points over pre-pandemic levels, our ability to engage has never been higher. More and more of these customers are embracing experiences that effortlessly fit their lifestyle. With drive-thru representing 47% of transactions and mobile ordering for in-store pickup, delivery or curbside at 26% of transactions, we are leveraging all channels to better serve our customers.  
While it is very clear that our Rewards program has accelerated our recovery in a meaningful way, where Q3 really stands out and what adds to our confidence is the acceleration we saw in our non-Rewards customers. While Rewards spend grew at a rapid mid-teens rate quarter-over-quarter, for the first time in 11 quarters, non-Rewards spend growth outpaced SR spend. This is further evidence of the great human reconnection. The rapid reengagement of non-Rewards customers not only propelled our record results, but also underscores the strength of the brand and the growth potential ahead.  And finally, we continue to make meaningful progress to reposition our U.S. store portfolio through Trade Area Transformation, which is now nearly 80% complete. 
In the past 12 months, we have opened 554 new stores combined with in-store seating and drive-thru service. This portfolio repositioning and new store formats have increased drive-thru store performance to 75% of our total U.S. sales, a number that continues to rise as we increase efficiency. The improvements and additions we are making to our portfolio today will provide benefits for years to come.  
With our focus on the customer experience, new beverage innovation and digital customer relationships, we continue to increase share of customer occasions while also contributing to a rapidly growing market for all things coffee.  
Moving on to China, where we posted a very positive result with year-on-year revenue growth of 45%. Remarkably, total revenue in China has grown 23% in just 2 years as we continue to play the long game. And we are on track to open more than 600 net new stores this fiscal year. In Q3 alone, we opened 162 net new stores that continue to deliver best-in-class new store profitability and returns. We ended the quarter with 5,135 stores, and we are well on track to operate over 6,000 stores by the end of fiscal year '22. In addition, we posted 19% same-store comp growth in Q3 and saw sequential acceleration of our 2-year comp when excluding the impact of value-added tax. Furthermore, we gained strong momentum with sequential improvement on every key metric on a 2-year basis, including total revenue growth, store traffic recovery and margin expansion. The health of our business in China is strong, and we've never been more confident in the long-term growth opportunity.  
In addition to significant new store growth and sequential acceleration of 2-year comps in China, we are expanding digital customer relationships and engagement by creating new occasions and experiences that make mobile ordering even more convenient and personalized. This has resonated strongly with our customers in China, propelling mobile ordering to 34% of sales, significantly higher than the 23% in the prior year and more than double pre-COVID levels.  
Starbucks Rewards continues to aggressively expand our digital ecosystem across major platforms, driving 90-day active members to an all-time high of 17 million, a 4% increase over previous quarter and a 71% increase versus prior year. Gold members, a very important cohort, are engaging Starbucks at pre-pandemic levels.  
Our performance in China is a testimony to the unparalleled strength of the Starbucks brand and our enduring relationship with our Chinese customers. Our rapidly growing store footprint, market-leading digital ecosystem and customer engagement, robust innovation pipeline and the enduring love and loyalty for the Starbucks brand in China are all unmatched. I have full confidence in the strength of the Starbucks brand in China and across all our international markets. There should be no misunderstanding of how big and robust our business in China is and will be. These are still early days, and our strategies are clearly working. Starbucks is uniquely positioned for success in China well into the future.  
With phenomenal strength and growing momentum in our retail business, let me now move on to our Channel Development segment that also continues to exceed expectations. Over the past 3 years, we have made significant progress expanding our reach and amplifying the Starbucks brand through CPG, single-serve coffee, ready-to-drink and foodservice. I attribute our success to the power of the Starbucks brand, the bold innovation that attracts new coffee lovers into our categories and the caliber of our strategic business partners globally. 
In Q3, Starbucks retained our #1 brand position in total U.S. at-home coffee and further expanded our leadership position versus other brands. The Starbucks brand continued to increase share in the total U.S. category, impressively adding 1 percentage point over the prior year despite lapping a strong comp. The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé is a powerhouse, and we continue to see strong performance across all aspects of the key strategic relationship. 
Earlier this year, building on the success of the Starbucks by Nespresso platform, we expanded and introduced Starbucks by Nespresso on the virtual line, which is already exceeding 6-month distribution and velocity targets. In addition, the combination of strong CPG performance combined with a steady recovery in foodservice gives us added confidence. In ready-to-drink, Starbucks is the #1 premium brand globally, with our North America coffee partnership with PepsiCo growing 19% in consumption and our international ready-to-drink business growing double digits in EMEA and China, Asia Pacific. These channels amplify our brand in more than 80 markets around the world, offering millions of customers at-home and at-work options that complement their Starbucks in-store experience. And just yesterday, we announced plans to reach new markets and grow our Starbucks ready-to-drink portfolio with Nestlé, who will now serve markets across Southeast Asia and Latin America. Our channel development strategy to amplify the brand, while growing share of at-home occasions, continues to attract new customers to Starbucks with unparalleled choice while driving best-in-class returns.  
The key takeaway from today's call is this. We look to the future with as much conviction as ever in our strategy as this quarter represents the beginning of a multiyear tailwind for Starbucks that is powered by 3 factors. First, the total coffee addressable market is large and growing rapidly. The market is expected to grow to well over $400 billion in size globally over the next 3 years. That represents a compound annual growth rate of 8% to 9% as the market rapidly recovers from the global pandemic. Second, within this large and growing market, consumer preferences continue to shift from mainstream robusta coffee to premium arabica coffee, where Starbucks is the leader. Third, and perhaps most important, Starbucks is rapidly adapted to new consumer behaviors and strengthened key points of differentiation. Our focus on the customer experience, relevant new beverage platforms and expanded digital customer relationships are translating to increased consumer preference and deeper customer engagement. The combination of a highly differentiated brand experience, a continued consumer shift to premium arabica coffee and a large and growing addressable market is a powerful trifecta that provides our business with a multiyear tailwind. These factors, reinforced by the results of this past quarter, give us confidence that this is just the beginning of what is about to unfold. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Rachel, who will walk you through details of our Q3 results. Rachel?"

I'm thrilled to share with you the results of this milestone quarter, delivering record revenue and record non-GAAP EPS only 4 quarters after the depth of the pandemic. Over the past year, we have proven our",2042,"Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm thrilled to share with you the results of this milestone quarter, delivering record revenue and record non-GAAP EPS only 4 quarters after the depth of the pandemic. Over the past year, we have proven our ability to differentiate ourselves to the unique and personalized experiences we create for Starbucks customers, whether in our stores, through our app or down the grocery aisle, leading to this quarter's impressive results.  
Starbucks global revenue reached $7.5 billion in Q3, up 78% from the prior year, far surpassing the pre-pandemic quarterly record set in Q1 fiscal '20 driven largely by the incredible performance in the U.S., our largest market. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $1.01, up from the loss of $0.46 in the prior year driven by faster-than-expected margin recovery in the Americas due to sales leverage from lapping prior year COVID-19 impacts and the benefit from continued strength in average ticket. 
Our Q3 EPS includes $0.09 of benefit related to discrete tax items, most of which was originally anticipated in Q4 as referenced on our previous earnings call. The investments we have made in our business have made Starbucks stronger, more resilient and positioned for long-term growth. This powerful momentum gives us the confidence to meaningfully raise our EPS outlook for the full year, as I'll explain later.  
I will now take you through our Q3 fiscal '21 operating performance by segment, followed by an analysis of our consolidated margin performance. Our Americas segment, which fueled our record quarter, delivered revenue of $5.4 billion in Q3, 92% higher than the prior year primarily driven by an 84% increase in comparable store sales, including 82% comp transaction growth. As Kevin mentioned, U.S. comparable store sales growth reached 83% in Q3, driven by a material improvement in transaction comp of 80%. Average store transactions continued to grow and ended the quarter at nearly 90% of pre-pandemic levels, presenting further opportunity to return to and grow beyond FY '19 levels.  
As transactions have grown we've maintained the strength in average ticket, up 1% over the prior year, remaining significantly elevated as many key post-pandemic consumer trends have continued. Growth of cold beverages and customization, coupled with sustained strong beverage attach and record food attach in Q3, all contributed to the strong ticket and give us confidence in our ability to maintain a meaningful portion of the ticket gains over the coming quarters.  
Americas Q3 non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 24.7%, up more than 200 basis points from Q3 of fiscal 2019, largely driven by sales leverage on our product and distribution costs, including waste favorability, the benefits of SKU rationalization over the prior 2 years and favorable sales mix shift. Pricing and the benefits of trade area transformation also helped to offset the sizable investments in wages and benefits as well as higher supply chain costs due to inflationary pressures.  
While we're thrilled with our margin performance in Q3, we expect it to moderate slightly in Q4, primarily due to the growing impact of inflation, coupled with incremental investments critical to our continued growth, which I'll discuss in a moment.  
Moving on to international. The International segment delivered revenue of $1.7 billion in Q3. Excluding a 10% favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the segment's revenue grew 65% over the prior year, reflecting a 41% increase in comparable store sales, inclusive of a 5% adverse impact from lapping the prior year VAT benefit. Strong sales growth from our international licensees as well as 8% net new store growth over the prior -- over the past 12 months also contributed to this growth.  
Kevin spoke to our performance in China. In addition, the International segment performance was adversely impacted by virus resurgences in Japan with a state of emergency severely limiting consumer traffic during most of the quarter. It's important to remember that the vast majority of international markets in which we operate are behind the U.S. in terms of both vaccination and mobility so revenue recovery is predictably lagging in those markets. Still, our partners in every market remain focused on what they can control and what they do best, the moments of connection they are providing our customers during these challenging times will support growth as vaccination rates improve.  
International's non-GAAP operating margin rose to 22.5% from minus 2.7% in the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage from lapping the impacts of COVID-19 as well as store labor efficiencies across our company-operated markets in larger government subsidies. On a 2-year basis, these temporary subsidies provided an approximately 200 basis point benefit in the quarter, boosting the segment's non-GAAP operating margin close to its pre-pandemic level of 22.7% in Q3 fiscal '19.  
On to Channel Development. Revenue was $414 million in Q3, a decline of 7% from the prior year, primarily driven by Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business. When excluding the approximately 20% adverse impact of these transition-related activities, Channel Development's revenue increased by 13% in Q3, mainly driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance product sales and our ready-to-drink business. 
The segment's non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 46.7% in Q3 from 35.6% in the prior year. Normalizing for the 700 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 410 basis points in Q3, driven primarily by the strength of our ready-to-drink business. We expect the impacts from the transition to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal '21.  
Finally, at the consolidated level, our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5% in Q3, up from minus 12.6% in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in our operating margin for Q3 was primarily driven by sales leverage across the P&L as we lap COVID-19 impacts and related costs as well as pricing in the Americas. These were partially offset by additional investments in retail store partner wages and benefits, which remain a strategic priority for us to support our world-class partners.  
Given the strength of our performance in Q3 and the optimism we have for the fourth quarter, we're pleased to update our guidance across a number of key areas. We expect the momentum we have seen in the U.S., underpinned by the ongoing great human reconnection to continue, and as a result, we expect both Americas and U.S. comparable store sales growth in Q4 in the range of 22% to 25%.  This corresponds to a 2-year comp range for Q4 of 11% to 13%, reflecting further sequential improvement from an already strong level of 9% in the Americas in Q3. As a reminder, the 2-year comps we are monitoring are calculated on a multiplicative basis instead of an additive basis as described in today's earnings release.  
For the International segment where sporadic virus resurgences continue to impair consumer mobility in some markets, we now expect comparable store sales to grow mid- to high single digits in Q4. For China, we expect comparable store sales to be roughly flat in Q4. Similar to the Americas, these ranges for both international and China translate to a meaningful sequential improvement in 2-year comp from Q3 to Q4 despite the challenging market dynamics expected to linger in Q4.  
Based on the outlook for the segment, we now expect Q4 consolidated comp growth in the range of 18% to 21%. On a 2-year basis, this equates to a range of 7% to 10%, a considerable sequential increase from the Q3 2-year comp of 4%.  
Moving on to retail store development. Although we expect approximately 1,100 net new stores globally in fiscal '21, we now anticipate a slight shift between our segments. For the Americas, we now expect the total store count in fiscal '21 to remain roughly flat to prior year as the new store openings are virtually offset by higher-than-normal closures, reflecting the continued progress of our accelerated Trade Area Transformation initiative. For international, net new stores for fiscal '21 are expected to increase to approximately 1,100 from 1,050 in the original guidance. 
With the updated comp sales and the store growth outlook, we are also tightening our guidance for full year fiscal '21 consolidated revenue to a new range of $29.1 billion to $29.3 billion from $28.5 billion to $29.3 billion. This includes channel development revenue, which is now expected in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion for full year fiscal '21 compared to the previous guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, reflecting the segment's strong performance to date. As a reminder, our fiscal '21 consolidated revenue guidance range is inclusive of approximately $0.5 billion for the 53rd week.  
Additionally, given the faster-than-expected margin recovery to date, we are raising our consolidated GAAP operating margin outlook for the full year to approximately 17%, up from the previous range of 15% to 16%. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to reach approximately 18% in fiscal '21, up from the previous guidance of 16.5% to 17.5%, reflecting the momentum we saw in Q3 and expect in Q4. 
Our operating margin has tempered a bit by 2 factors that we see growing in relevance in Q4 and into fiscal '22. The first is our latest view on rising global inflation requiring continued incremental investments to support our growth. The second is our strong commitment to increasing wages of our store partners, making deliberate investments towards an hourly wage for $15 in the U.S., in line with the announcement we made in November of last year. As Kevin mentioned, our Green Apron partners are fundamental to the Starbucks Experience and are critical to our long-term success. These important wage increases, coupled with continued investment in digital initiatives and operational efficiencies, will further solidify the foundation for our next stage of growth.  
Given the accelerated timing of certain discrete tax benefits in Q3, I noted earlier, which were originally anticipated in Q4, we now forecast our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate to increase to the low 20% from our previous outlook of high teens. For fiscal '21, our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates are expected in the low 20% range, revised from the previous guidance of low to mid-20%.  
Summing this all up, driven by the tremendous momentum we've seen as customers return to our stores propelling our record results in Q3, we are raising our full year fiscal '21 EPS guidance. Our new fiscal '21 GAAP EPS guidance range is $2.97 to $3.02, up from $2.65 to $2.75 previously. Our fiscal '21 non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.25, up from our prior range of $2.90 to $3. This predominantly reflects our better-than-expected performance to date as well as the improved outlook for Q4, barring any new significant and sustained waves of COVID-19 infections and any major economic disruptions. As a reminder, our fiscal '21 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges include approximately $0.10 of benefit for the 53rd week.  
Consistent with our past practice, we will provide guidance for fiscal '22 on our Q4 earnings call. However, I should note that the earlier-than-expected margin recovery we saw in Q3 and expect in Q4 was not contemplated when we provided our fiscal '22 EPS growth outlook at our December Investor Day. We are pleased with the strength of our business and we'll provide our FY '22 outlook during our Q4 call. Importantly, our ongoing commitment to the double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth at scale remains strongly intact.  
To summarize, Q3 performance exceeded our expectations with record revenue and earnings, underscoring the resilience and power of our brand, which remains as relevant as ever. While temporary marketplace dynamics will impact our business until the global pandemic is behind us, the enduring strength of the Starbucks Experience, fueled by our incredible partners around the globe, remains intact, thriving in this moment of human reconnection and continuing to guide our long-term growth. As always, the credit for our success this quarter and in the future belongs to our Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the Green Apron. They have our greatest respect and appreciation.  
And with that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Culver, Michael Conway and Belinda Wong. Thank you. Operator?"

And we know it is your highest growth market for Starbucks, and clearly 100% company operated, so a major market for you. 
With that said, the third quarter shortfall and seemingly a significant reduction in the fiscal '21 guidance. I'm just wondering whether you're concerned at all about that. It sounds like from your commentary, not so much. I'm just wondering maybe you can give some color, or Belinda, perhaps in terms of what you attribute the slowdown which you expect to continue, whether maybe China is seeing a virus uptick or whether -- I know some people are fearful that there's consumer pushback on certain U.S. brands? Just trying to get a sense for what's changed of late in the China market and yet still confidence quite high longer term?"

Let me share some thoughts, and then I'll hand it over to Belinda to comment a bit further. Jeffrey, we've been in China now for over 20 years. And every step of the way, we have built Starbucks in China for China. And the brand resonates with our customers in China. So I think that's number one. 
Number two, we are in a market-building mode right now where most of our growth comes from the new stores that we open. And the fact that the new stores that we have been opening are performing at some of the highest AUV levels prior generations, gives us confidence that we are continuing to expand our reach and presence in China. I think those 2 things. Certainly, from a geopolitical standpoint, we've -- we've got businesses in 84 markets around the world. So we constantly deal with geopolitical situations. And I'd say there's not a geopolitical situation that has really impacted us in China over the last couple of years. And I don't really foresee that happening as long as we continue to stay focused on what we do and what we do well, which is create a great experience for our customers in China, take care of our Starbucks partners who proudly wear the Green Apron in China. 
And we're bullish. We continue to invest, whether it's the investment we're making in new stores, whether it's the Coffee Innovation Park, the first sustainable roasting plant that we're building in China, the work we're doing with coffee farmers in Yunnan. And I sort of look at this navigating some of the implications of COVID as just being short term. And so that's why I kind of look at it as a very -- from a very bullish perspective long term. 
So let me hand it over to Belinda. Belinda, I'll let you comment a bit further on Jeffrey's question."

Now if you exclude the adverse impacts from lapping prior year VAT exemption benefit, our comp grew actually 24% in the quarter. Our previous comp guidance has assumed a shorter time frame for the lifting of travel restrictions and also less of the uncertainties that we have faced in the market. And hence, we are adjusting our comp guidance to reflect the uncertainties. Now make no mistake that the short-term volatility that we're facing today are only temporary. The recovery, as we've always said, will continue to be nonlinear. 
Now 1 point that you have to fully realize is that we have fully regained our pre-COVID pace of store development. And Kevin spoke about the achievements that we achieved in Q3, and we are well on track to open more than 600 net new stores this fiscal year and operate 6,000 stores by the next fiscal year. 
And on top of that, yes, we are delivering best-in-class store profitability and returns. We are meeting the year 1 new store performance guidance that we provided during last Investor Day. And please note that our focus in the past decade has always been about total revenue growth and reaching new customers for them to trial the Starbucks Experience and coffee in China market. And majority of our total revenue growth and close to 70% of that comes from new stores. There's huge runway for growth in China due to growing coffee consumption and the addressable market, rising middle-class population and disposable income. So we're still in very early chapters of our growth story here in this market. 
My personal on-the-ground experience and what I see here in the market gives me full confidence in the resiliency and the dynamism of the Chinese consumer economy. No other F&B retailer or specialty coffee brands possess our speed, quality, coverage of our national footprint, our market-leading digital ecosystem and customer engagement, our robust innovation pipeline and the strength of our brand, these are all unmatched in China, and we are well positioned than ever to continue to win in this market. 
We will focus on what we can control. Our strategies are clearly working. So we are playing the long game here and ready and excited to capture the additional growing growth opportunities once the international travel restrictions are lifted and the pandemic is behind us. Thank you."

The other thing that I would point out is the guidance that we gave for Q4 on comp for international and China, it implies a sequential improvement on a 2-year basis from Q3 to Q4. So I think it's important to show that we're continuing to be optimistic and showing continued momentum in the business for the remainder of this fiscal year."

The way I think about it is, let me put it into a little bit of context is, in Q3, our margin was incredible. I mean we -- from a standpoint of both -- across all of our markets, we saw margin expansion versus prior year and even against FY '19. And a big driver of that was our sales leverage as well as comping over COVID impacts broadly pricing. But it did help to offset some accelerated investments we've made in wage as well as inflationary pressures. When you think about Q4, we would expect, as we've guided, we guided our margin to increase from 16.5% to 17.5%, going to 18% for the balance of the year. So this shows our optimism and the continued momentum in the business. But what I caution is there's a slightly lower relative to the performance we saw in Q3 based on increasing costs that we see related to inflation as well as the continued investments that we need to make in our business. Those investments were critical to our recovery, but they're more important even foundationally for our growth. 
And so as we think about FY '22, we're not going to provide guidance for FY '22 today. That will be on our Q4 call to give us time to complete our annual operating plan, which we're in the process of right now. But if you think about that, some of what we guided at Investor Day from that growth in FY '22 has been pulled forward into FY '21. But I want to be clear that we remain committed to double-digit EPS -- non-GAAP EPS growth. So we're committed to that. When you think about that margin that we laid out at Investor Day, that 18% to 19%, that was up from 17% to 18% that we had guided previously. That accounted for the benefit that we're seeing from the investments we're making. So it just again reiterates the importance of those investments. And so when we think about that guidance at Investor Day, what it allows us to do is modestly expand margin while continuing to invest. And again, we'll provide further guidance on FY '22 at our Q4 call, but that's how I put it into perspective."

I mean I think it probably would have been a rational expectation to think lapping a 27% ticket from the second quarter -- excuse me, the third quarter of '20 would have basically been impossible and yet you were able to do that for all the reasons that you pointed out. Yet I would have thought, as people came back in the morning and migrated more towards single-order transactions, just by definition, that would have fallen. So could you kind of give some more color around maintaining that average ticket. I think there was a comment made in the prepared remarks about the -- excuse me, about maintaining a significant portion of that pricing. But whether, in fact, it can be 100% of the ticket lift that you got over the past 5 quarters or so. 
And secondly, China was the inverse of that. Even if I adjust for that benefit from the previous year, the ticket was actually down in China, which isn't very common, especially in an inflationary environment, if you could talk about the China ticket as well. And for both businesses, just your attitude on overall menu pricing, given what is your inflationary cost pressure, is that something that a consumer may expect as well as higher pricing, whether that's something that may accelerate as well on the menu for both businesses."

Now we're also, at the same time, as the customers become more mobile and start coming back into the Central Business District in the urban core, we did achieve a positive comp for the first time in that trade area since Q1 of FY '20, which gives us even more optimism for the future recovery of the business. 
Now as that recovers, in the Central Business District in urban core, what we do expect is that the customers will begin frequenting those stores in those areas. And as part of that, transactions will increase, but ticket will moderately decrease and it will balance itself out over time. We see great opportunity to continue to drive transactions in our stores right now, broadly across the U.S. business, we're operating at about 90% of pre-COVID transaction levels. So we've got a lot of room to go to grow back to a more normalized rate pre-pandemic wise as it relates to transactions.

And drivers of that are the attach that John spoke about as well as the continued attach we see in food, our ability to continue to move customers to our cold beverages, which have a more premium price. In addition to our promotion offerings and our customization, those are other ways that we're further evolving our ticket across the U.S. and Americas space.

I know there's been a lot on the -- written in the press about the cold weather that's hit Brazil and the implications on the CIF price of coffee. And so just to give you some context, on the increasing CIF price of coffee, you should know that over the years, we've created a very thoughtful approach to how we source, warehouse and use hedging techniques to ensure we always have supply of premium arabica green coffee at an attractive cost basis. In fact, we purchase green coffee 12 to 18 months in advance, and we never stopped buying green coffee through the pandemic. So as a result, we currently have over 14 months of price forward coverage, which means we have price locked on our coverage for the next 14 months which gets us through the rest of fiscal year '21 and most of fiscal year '22. And I think we may be the only large buyer of green coffee that uses this approach, and that will serve us well as it gives us a significant advantage relative to our competitors who, if they don't buy this far in advance, will certainly not have that cost structure that we put in place. And so I just want to comment on that since it's been in the press and kind of relates to your question, John, on inflation."

I know you talked about inflationary pressures, but some companies talk about the aggregate inflation, some even talk about wages. Is there inflation coming in the supply chain? Is there a way to quantify that? And how do you think about pricing in that context? Are you willing to take an unusual amount of pricing relative to history to offset that? Or do you find there's other places in the P&L? I mean it's notable that some of your peers are taking significant amounts of pricing now. They feel like they have that power. I always thought Starbucks had that power maybe use it more judiciously, but is your frame of how you think about pricing changing because of this environment?"

But within that, we covered headwinds in the Americas business of about 70 basis points. And we expect headwinds related to rising costs and inflationary pressures to continue into Q4, which is reflected in the guidance that we've given. 
Now some of the ways that we not only offset headwinds such as inflation, but also the investments we're making are price. And we've always been very thoughtful and measured in the pricing actions we take so that we don't inhibit growth. And I would say our pricing strategy hasn't fundamentally changed. We're very surgical in nature. We look on a store-by-store basis, and we leverage analytics and insights. And importantly, what our analytics and insights show us is that we do have pricing power. And we see that in the premiumization of our beverages, the gravitation towards our promotional offerings. And this is our opportunity to be able to leverage price in those ways, which is one of the reasons why we talk about our ticket continuing to stay elevated, not at the rate that we have today, but a slightly elevated. But pricing will be one of many levers that we use to offset these headwinds. For example, we'll continue to drive customization with our customers, continue to drive our customers to our cold beverage offerings where we have a more premium nature, continue to drive beverage and food attach when and where possible, those are ways to continue to have an elevated ticket. So through pricing, an elevated ticket, we'll also continue to look at efficiencies in our supply chain as well as efficiencies in G&A. So this particular quarter, we saw our G&A returning to pre-pandemic levels, and we'll continue to find efficiencies in G&A over time with our goal to be able to grow G&A less than our revenue growth as another way. 
In addition to that, we're seeing benefit from Trade Area Transformation. Our Trade Area Transformation in the Americas and more broadly in the segment, delivered almost 80 basis points on margin. That's meaningful. And so we continue, as we've optimized that portfolio, that's yet another lever that we're using to help offset not only headwinds related to inflation, but also the investments that we know we need to make that are critical to our growth in the future. And those are investments both in wages for our partners as well as investments in our service experience and our throughput as well as investments in digital initiatives. All those are critical for our growth in the future and really are fueling our -- not only our recovery, but will fuel the growth for years to come. So those are important investments for us broadly. And those are the ways we think about how we'll offset those increasing costs while still modestly expanding margin."

We know that customers when they join Starbucks Rewards, they spend more. There's more frequency and more engagement from those customers. And that's why you think over a multiyear period, we have this aspiration to double the number of active Rewards members in North America.

Chris, the one thing I would add to what Kevin is saying is the success of the Stars for Everyone program that we launched a little over 3 quarters ago. It makes it easier for people to join the Starbucks Rewards program. It enables customers to make purchases by adding alternative payment options in addition to utilizing store value. And really, what we're seeing there is that it's helped to drive the 49% increase that we're seeing year-over-year in membership across broadly the Starbucks Reward program. 
To put that into context, we have added nearly 5 million 90-day active members since the beginning of this fiscal year. And what this has done, it's driven a meaningful increase in the conversion rate for those who joined the Starbucks Rewards program. And really, while we're not seeing a material shift from customers leaving the store value program to alternate payment methods, the vast majority of the customers who use these alternative payment methods are new or reengaged members that we're tracking back into the program. So going forward, we're going to continue to double down on both our Rewards members as well as our non-Rewards members. We see that this is being highly accretive to driving frequency as well as spend, and we see this as being one of the biggest opportunities we have for the long-term program growth in attracting those occasional customers into our stores."

It's very exciting to talk about this because the U.S. team has done a remarkable job in terms of driving throughput and operational efficiencies overall. One of the big things to note is that we have returned to pre-pandemic levels in terms of our overall operating efficiencies within our stores. So that's very encouraging to see. 
The other thing that we've done to drive productivity and operational efficiencies in the store a couple of things. First, we significantly upgraded our play builder program, which allows us to be more effective in how we deploy our labor. We've also made good investments, strong investments in customer service training. And if you look at it over the last 18 months or so since COVID has hit, about 70% -- roughly 70% of our partners have been hired in these last 18 months, and they've been operating in this COVID-restricted environment. So we're reinvesting now in customer service training for our partners as customers become more mobile and frequent in our stores. 
Now in addition to the ongoing operations and how our stores and partners are operating, we've also made equipment innovation investments as well that is driving throughput as well as efficiency. The strain of 2 espresso machines. It's a big investment that we're making. We have it deployed at 70% of our U.S. company-operated stores. We'll complete the rollout in fiscal year '22. We've introduced a new warming oven, the Merrychef warming oven, which is an upgrade to our current ovens. That's currently in 20% of our stores, and will be in 35% of the stores by the end of the fiscal year. And then with the success of cold beverages and in particular, Cold Brew, we've developed a proprietary Cold Brew system, brewing system, through our Tryer Center that's currently in 2,000 U.S. stores and we'll have it in 75% of our stores by the end of the year. It makes brewing the product more efficient. It is also a more efficient use of partner time, and it fits within the back of the house. 
The other big thing that we're rolling out, which I'm excited about and our supply chain team has worked with the operations team on, is automated inventory ordering. And this is a system that we have been testing. We just recently expanded the test. We're now rolling it out to 1,500 stores this past week. It basically removes the inventory task from our store partners and allows them to focus on their customers and the customer experience. And we expect that this will be fully rolled out in all company-operated stores for food and merchandise items by the end of the calendar year. 
And then just one other thing that you asked about drive-thru. We're doing a lot of work on drive-thru and revolutionizing the drive-thru experience. So really focusing on decreasing the out-the-window times for the drive-thru experience. We've introduced new equipment and technology with handheld order points to target to improve the speed of service. We've also introduced tech improvements to make the orders more easily managed through consolidation and handoff. And we're going through and renovating about 150 constrained drive-thru stores to design a new engine, removing pastry cases or repositioning it, and really dedicating a POS system to that drive-thru location. And then we're not stopping there. We're continuing to innovate about what is the next evolution of the drive-thru store for our customers. So a lot of great work by the teams broadly across operations, store development, supply chain and the technology team. So hats off to all of them."

So we're showing that we're expecting -- we're implying that we'll have improvement above the 10%, and we've given a range of about 11% to 13% on a 2-year basis. So that certainly reflects the momentum we've seen in the business and the momentum we're expecting as we see more customers returning to the stores. As I mentioned, we had a very similar customer count, overall count in terms of this quarter versus pre-pandemic. But our opportunity really continues to be -- we certainly have the ability to bring more customers in, but our opportunity is the frequency of those customers. We ended the quarter at about 90% of where we've been from a transaction standpoint prior to the pandemic, so in FY '19 levels, and that's really our opportunity. And we reflected that in the guidance we've given, but I'll give it to John to add some further commentary on that."

I think that we're very optimistic in terms of, number one, customers returning to our stores and in our stores being ready with relevant innovation that resonates very strongly with our customers. And nowhere are we seeing that more than with cold and cold beverages. As we shared, record 74% of beverage sales in Q3, that's 13 percentage points higher than what it was in the previous quarter. 
And it's important to note, and Rachel mentioned this, but I just want to emphasize, cold beverages are generally ticket and margin accretive. So how do we classify cold beverages? It's Cold Brew, it's Nitro Cold Brew, it's Iced Shaken Espressos and it's refreshers. And then you couple those products with the ability to customize and personalize to the customers' desires. We've got a wide range of beverage options for customers that are both hot as well as cold. And we're seeing meaningful growth in the customization of our beverages in the modifiers that people are adding to their products, such as espresso shots, cold foam, alternate dairy and really driving awareness of the -- of these personalized offerings and our customers are resonating with that. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing. We're very optimistic but we realize also at the same time that we've got to earn our customers' trust, loyalty and respect each and every day, and our partners are doing yeoman's work in terms of creating that great experience that customers have come to expect.

Before we begin, there are 4 reminders I'd like to make with respect to the numbers that will be discussed on today's call. First, as noted in our earnings release, we have realigned our fully licensed Latin America and Caribbean markets to our international segment. As a result, we renamed the Americas segment to North America. All discussions and comparisons today are reflective of the resegmentation.
Second, a reminder that Starbucks' fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year instead of the usual 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2021 results on today's call are on a 14-week basis for the quarter and 53-week basis for the year, except the year-on-year comparative metrics, including revenue growth, comp growth, EPS growth and margin expansion, which are based on a 13-week or 52-week basis to exclude the impact of an extra fiscal week.
Third, all references on today's call are on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. And lastly, effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, certain international integration-related expenses previously excluded from our non-GAAP results will be included as they are expected to be representative of ongoing operations.
Please refer to the reconciliation of these measures and a schedule showing adjusted fiscal 2021 EPS to bridge year-on-year impacts of this recast as well as reconciliations of 53-week to 52-week metrics at the supplemental financial data section of our website at investor.starbucks.com.
I will now turn the call over to Kevin."

I'm very pleased to comment on the record Q4 and FY '21 results Starbucks reported today. I'm particularly pleased that we were able to deliver these results in Starbucks' 50th anniversary yea",2905,"Well, thank you, Greg, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. I'm very pleased to comment on the record Q4 and FY '21 results Starbucks reported today. I'm particularly pleased that we were able to deliver these results in Starbucks' 50th anniversary year and in the face of increased costs and unprecedented operating challenges resulting from the global pandemic. Today's results reflect very strong operating and financial performance across the board, with Q4 revenue growing 22% and full year non-GAAP EPS of 168% over prior year. This was a record Q4 and that punctuates a very strong FY '21 performance with record highs in revenue, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS.
Our performance accelerated throughout FY '21 and fueling revenue growth of 21%, non-GAAP operating income grew 139% and translated to a non-GAAP earnings of $3.24 per share near the high end of our guidance for the year. Perhaps more persuasively than ever, the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand and the power and opportunity afforded by the authentic connection and the deep trust and loyalty we have built with customers around the world is resonating.
Today's results demonstrate that despite the pandemic, Starbucks' long-term double-digit Growth at Scale model remains solidly intact. Today's results also underscore the passion and dedication of our over 400,000 Starbucks Green Apron partners who serve nearly 100 million customer occasions around the world every week. And I'm humbled by our partners' commitment to each other and to our customers as we continue to navigate through the pandemic. Their resilience and service honors the company and our history, and I could not be more appreciative of their efforts.
Finally, today's results demonstrate the success of the investments we have made and will continue to make ahead of the growth curve in our people, digital, beverage and food innovation and store experiences. These investments are driving and strengthening our global business and setting us up for even greater success in the future.
Starbucks' long-standing view is that our partners guide this company, and we applaud other like-minded companies who are following our lead. Starbucks has been at the forefront of investing in our people since we opened our first store in the Pike Place market in Seattle in 1971; we offer paid company health care 25 years before the Affordable Care Act; equity ownership in the form of Bean Stock to eligible part-time partners; free college tuition through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan with Arizona State University; and mental health support through our partnership with Lyra. Investing in our people is the cornerstone of our storied 50-year history in tradition. And these investments continue to deliver real measurable value to our partners, our customers and our shareholders.
I'll be providing granularity around the incremental partner investments we made beginning last year and the additional partner investments we will be making in fiscal '22 in a moment. On today's call, I will highlight Q4 performance in our key markets, and provide detail around some of our actions and investments since the pandemic first surfaced in Q2 of 2020 that are contributing to our performance today and setting us up for accelerated growth in the future. I'll also open a window on our exciting holiday plans and several initiatives that will launch over the near term.
Then I'll turn the call over to Rachel to provide a deep dive into our Q4 and fiscal year performance and share our guidance for fiscal '22. We'll then move on to Q&A.
Over the last 18 months, Starbucks, like most global retail operators, has been confronted with a seemingly never-ending wave of consumer and business headwinds. Many businesses in our space have not survived. From day 1 of the pandemic, Starbucks leaders around the world were determined to use the company's size and scale to navigate whatever challenges lie ahead with steadfast commitment to our people, our mission and values, a set of principles guided us through the pandemic, every decision was rooted in our core purpose and reason for being.
These decisions have made the Starbucks of today stronger and better positioned to profitably grow, extend our coffee leadership around the world and create more value for our shareholders more than ever before in our history. Last year, we made significant pandemic-driven strategic investments, including providing our partners with financial support and economic certainty, avoiding layoffs while most of our stores were temporarily closed, and accelerating our U.S. store portfolio transformation by opportunistically repositioning 500 stores to better locations with more favorable economics. To this last point, we expanded our portfolio of drive-throughs, introduced new store formats to meet our customers where they are and turbocharged growth in our digital customer relationships in the U.S. and China.
As a result of these successful investments, we are entering fiscal '22 with strong momentum around the world. In the U.S., our largest global market, our key growth driver is comparable sense. We grew a strong 2-year comp to 11% in Q4 despite variance across the country that created a dynamic set of city-by-city COVID restrictions which we had to navigate. We made significant progress addressing supply chain issues and experienced an overall improvement in inventory availability as we move through the quarter by increasing production at existing suppliers, onboarding new suppliers, and strategically prioritizing key holiday and Q1 merchandise. While we made significant progress addressing supply chain challenges as fiscal 2021 progressed, we remain cautious and vigilant as we enter fiscal '22 given the dynamic nature of the situation.
The recovery in Q4 surged forward as evidenced by the sequential acceleration of 2-year comp growth. We exited Q4 with even stronger 14% 2-year comp growth in September and closed to a record average ticket driven by the strength of our fall beverage lineup, a shift in customer behavior towards more premium beverages and strong food attach. We have great confidence for the year ahead given the comp momentum throughout the quarter, combined with holiday plans certain to excite and delight our customers, and increasing consumer demand around the world today for everything Starbucks.
Yesterday, we made an important announcement to raise wages across the U.S. in fiscal '22 to ensure we continue to attract and retain talented partners as consumer mobility continues to increase. We believe this investment, combined with our industry-leading benefits program, will enable us to remain an employer of choice. This builds on historic partner investments and meaningful wage increases we made in fiscal year '21, and prioritizes significant additional investment to address inflation and wage compression that our tenured partners have experienced while also increasing our wage floor.
In December of 2020, I announced our intention to provide a starting wage of at least $15 an hour for our store partners across the country. And by the summer of '22, we will have delivered on that plan. Effective in January, partners with 2 or more years of service will get up to a 5% raise, and partners with 5 or more years will get up to a 10% raise in keeping with our long-standing history of investing in our partners.
And next summer, hourly partners in the U.S. will make an average of nearly $17 an hour, with barista rates ranging from $15 to $23 an hour across the country. In total, the FY '21 and FY '22 investments represent approximately $1 billion in incremental annual wages and benefits.
We continue to build a great and enduring company by investing ahead of the growth curve, not just in wages, but in training and technology and the overall Starbucks experience for both our partners and our customers. And as we have seen in the past, we expect investment in the partner experience will be accretive to profits over time.
We believe the U.S. market is at a unique inflection point. Stakeholders and companies whose leaders correctly identify emerging trends, thoughtfully shape strategic action and invest in the future will be big winners over the long term. In the quarters ahead, Starbucks will continue to target investment in high-returning assets that we believe will accelerate our double-digit growth at scale model, driving long-term sustainable and profitable growth.
We continue to build and leverage our technology-first mobile and digital capabilities and accelerate growth in active Starbucks Rewards membership. We grew our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members, representing our most loyal engage customers by approximately 30% in fiscal year '21 to 24.8 million members. Noteworthy is that in Q4, 51% of U.S. tender for company-operated stores was generated by this loyal customer base. We continue to nurture and deepen our direct personalized digital relationship with our members with enhancements to the program like Stars for Everyone to expand reach and through payment partnerships with PayPal and BAC, where a customer can now reload their Starbucks card with a range of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, Ethereum and others by converting digital currencies to physical currency and reloading their Starbucks card.
Through blockchain or other innovative technologies, we are exploring how to tokenize Stars, create the ability for other merchants to connect their rewards program to Starbucks Rewards. This will enable customers to exchange value across brands, engage in more personalized experiences, enhance digital services and exchange other loyalty points for Stars at Starbucks.
An example of this innovation is evident in the recent launch of our Canadian loyalty program with Air Canada. Over the next year, you will see the first instance of this loyalty points exchange with other consumer brands. This approach will also serve as a foundation for a more aspirational concept for new, modern payment rails that align payment expenses with the value received by customers and merchants. We intend to be at the forefront of this disruptive innovation, which will unfold over the next few years.
Finally, a rich pipeline of innovation will elevate the Starbucks experience in our stores, and drive in-store productivity gains. Examples include our Mastrena 2 espresso machines that more efficiently pulls triple shots of high-quality espresso; our Deep Brew artificial intelligence platform that has automated daily inventory management; and store staffing and training improvements designed to reduce complexity in our stores. Simplifying this workflow helps reduce the strain on our partners, resulting from the ever-increased demand in our stores. And enables our partners to connect and engage with their customers, which is at the heart of the Starbucks Experience.
Starbucks is entering fiscal year '22 with strong customer demand and solid momentum in our U.S. business. And expanding and accelerating in-store channels and digital flywheel and Green Apron partners eager to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to their customers. Having navigated through so many challenges over the past year, we are excited and optimistic about the year that has just begun while remaining humble and mindful of unknown challenges.
On to China. Starbucks China extended our market leadership position in Q4 despite pandemic-driven disruptions, propelled by an accelerated pace of store development and significant growth in digital customer relationships, all while achieving record customer engagement scores in the quarter and in the year. Starbucks has built one of the most respected consumer brands in China, with 1 in 2 consumers preferring Starbucks to any other brands in away-from-home coffee.
Our growth strategy in the market continues to differentiate us and position us well for the long game. We continue to invest meaningfully in all aspects of our China business, including accelerated investment in our partners, the creation of award-winning, experiential store designs, unprecedented benefits like health care for partners and their parents, rent assistance and programs that offer career paths for young people from rural and remote provinces. Together, these investments further elevate the Starbucks brand and partner experience. They instill pride in our China partners and deepen our customer engagement and connection.
Starbucks continues to be in a strong market expansion cycle. And as such, much of our growth in China comes as we aggressively expand our store footprint and introduce more customers to the Starbucks Experience. We expanded the store footprint with 225 net new stores in Q4, and we are going deeper and broader, deeper into existing cities and broader by opening in new cities.
For the full fiscal year, we opened a record 654 net new stores and ended the year with 5,360 stores in 208 cities throughout China. As we noted on our Q3 earnings call, our recovery in China will not be linear. In Q4, we experienced COVID-related restrictions that constrained customer mobility in 18 provincial-level regions. At its peak in mid-August, approximately 80% of our stores in China were impacted by the pandemic, with some stores fully closed or operating at different levels of elevated public health protocols, such as mobile ordering only, limited seating or health stations. Our recovery momentum was below expectation and pushed our 2-year comps to a minus 10% in Q4. Cities with local COVID cases were impacted the most with stores relying on transportation and tourism also materially impacted during the quarter.
Notably, though, much like the U.S., China's 2-year comp also accelerated in the month of September as we remain optimistic for the recovery. Despite these strong headwinds, China grew revenue 11% year-on-year. While our overall reported comp growth was minus 7% for Q4, if we exclude the lap of a VAT subsidy we received in fiscal year '20 along with the stores and cities that experienced local COVID cases or were in transportation and tourism zones, our core fleet of stores comped positive. Starbucks' business and operating margins remained strong, and our commitment to China and our confidence in our long-term growth strategy in China is unwavering.
In addition to expanding our portfolio of stores in China, we also expanded our digital footprint with 90 days Starbucks Rewards active members, reaching an all-time high of 17.9 million in Q4. This represents a sequential increase of 5% over Q3 and an increase of 33% over prior year. Frequency of purchases by our Gold members remained at pre-pandemic levels despite the mobility limitations in the quarter, demonstrating the effectiveness of our efforts in up-leveling member engagement.
One example was our Star Dash gift with purchase campaign. The successfully lifted member frequency and spend and evolved into a highly anticipated activity for members to earn limited availability to Starbucks' 50th anniversary merchandise.
With operations heavily impacted by COVID-related safety restrictions in the quarter, we are laser-focused on what we can control in China while continuing to elevate our partner and customer experiences to further elevate the Starbucks brand and build on the loyalty that will continue to drive our long-term growth.
Including the U.S. and China, Starbucks' presence in 84 markets around the world provides us with a unique perspective on the global recovery from this pandemic. There's no doubt that we are seeing continued recovery in our markets.
Latin America grew system sales by 113% in Q4 driven by a strong recovery in Mexico. EMEA posted system sales growth of 52% in the quarter. And Japan navigated through a challenging quarter, turning the corner towards renewed growth. We see positive signs in many other markets as well as reinforcing our belief that pandemic-related headwinds are temporary.
In addition, our strategic channel partnerships with the North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo and our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé, are on plan and have propelled Starbucks to #1 share positions in the U.S. and throughout many other markets around the world, further underscoring the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand and illuminating the decades-long runway of growth ahead.
As we enter fiscal year '22, we are fully prepared for a record-breaking holiday with strong growth planned around the world and a holiday campaign designed to build genuine human connection as only Starbucks can. At a time when human connection is more important than ever.
In addition to new and iconic seasonal products, we are integrating brand building and transaction-driving marketing programs to demonstrate our values and touch our customers' hearts. We are prepared with inventory this holiday, and we are also anticipating that nearly $3 billion will be loaded on Starbucks Cards this season by leveraging our digital and out-of-store distribution channels, and creating a promotional presence in drive-through lanes where we have seen significant channel shift during the pandemic. We are ready for this holiday.
In closing, Starbucks' strong performance through the recovery is a direct result of the hard work and dedication of our partners as well as the investments we made both before and during the pandemic. We remain confident in our future and steadfast in our commitment to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders. This confidence supports the plan we announced today to return $20 billion to shareholders over the next 3 years through dividends and share repurchases. I'm particularly pleased that hundreds of thousands of Starbucks partners who are also Starbucks shareholders through our Bean Stock program, will also benefit from this plan.
50 years ago, Starbucks was founded as a different kind of company, a company that would balance profit with social conscious, embrace the ideal that doing good for one another and for society would actually be very good for business over the long term. Our performance in 2021 demonstrates the wisdom and correctness of that founding principle. As we enter our second 50 years, we continue to honor our history and heritage just as we boldly reimagine our future.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rachel. Rachel?"

It's my privilege to share with you Starbucks' strong finish to fiscal 2021, our 50th year in business, delivering the highest full year revenue, operating income and EPS in company history, an accomplishmen",2232,"Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. It's my privilege to share with you Starbucks' strong finish to fiscal 2021, our 50th year in business, delivering the highest full year revenue, operating income and EPS in company history, an accomplishment that is truly special considering the profound challenges we have navigated throughout the pandemic. Please note that as Greg discussed at the top of the call, fiscal '21 results that I will discuss today are non-GAAP, unless noted, and on a 14-week basis for the quarter and a 53-week basis for the year, except year-on-year revenue, comp, operating margin and EPS growth metrics which will be on a 13-week or 52-week basis to exclude the impact of an extra fiscal week for comparative purposes.
In Q4, Starbucks Global revenue reached $8.1 billion, up 22% from the prior year, setting another quarterly record, along with a fiscal year record of $29.1 billion, primarily driven by the continued momentum in the U.S. and strong contributions from across the globe despite the severe headwinds of the COVID Delta variant. Our consolidated operating margin was 19.6% in Q4, up 580 basis points from the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by sales leverage across the P&L as we lap the COVID-19 impacts and related costs as well as pricing in North America. These were partially offset by rapid inflation related to logistics, commodities and labor costs across our supply chain.
Q4 GAAP EPS was $1.49, inclusive of a $0.56 divestiture gain from the Starbucks Coffee Korea transaction, which yielded pretax proceeds of almost $1.2 billion. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1, capping off the company's most profitable year ever with non-GAAP EPS of $3.24.
I will now provide some segment highlights for Q4 and then we'll provide guidance for fiscal 2022. The North America segment delivered revenue of $5.8 billion in Q4, 27% higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 22% increase in comparable store sales, including 18% comp transaction growth and a 3% increase in average ticket. In the U.S., comparable store sales reached 22% in Q4 driven by transaction comp of 19%, delivering another sequential improvement in 2-year transaction comp in the face of COVID Delta variant disruptions. Simultaneously, we maintained our strength in average ticket up 3% over the prior year remaining near record levels and posting 2-year ticket comp of over 20% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Cold beverages reached 75% of total sales in Q4, contributing to our ticket strength along with outstanding results from our fall promotion and another record quarter of food attach.
North America's operating margin was 22.5% in Q4, expanding 510 basis points from the prior year, driven by sales leverage as we lap the impacts of COVID as well as continued strength in ticket, including pricing. The segment's operating margin exceeded the pre-pandemic level in Q4 fiscal 2019 by 170 basis points, primarily due to the leadership conference and labor our investments in Q4 fiscal 2019. Strong ticket and the benefit of trade area transformation also offset the margin headwind of approximately 270 basis points over the past 2 years from sizable investments in wage and benefits as well as the supply chain inflationary pressures.
Moving on to International. The International segment delivered record revenue of $1.9 billion in Q4, growing 18% over the prior year. The growth was driven by an 8% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months, strong sales growth from our international licensees as well as a 3% increase in comparable store sales. Both company-operated and licensed markets across our international portfolio are contributing meaningfully with double-digit sales growth in key markets like Japan, the U.K., Korea and Mexico.
Kevin noted that the COVID-related volatility drove comp sales down 7% in China in Q4. However, our experienced team and 22-year history continue to serve us well as operating income was only down 1% versus last year. Our team in China and across the globe has done a tremendous job of managing through the volatility. In fact, operating margin for the International segment was 22.8% in Q4, expanding 650 basis points from the prior year, well above pre-pandemic levels, mainly driven by sales leverage as the segment continued to recover from the pandemic.
Higher government subsidies, lapping store asset impairments in the prior year as well as store and overhead labor efficiencies also contributed to the expansion. We expect margin to settle a bit in fiscal '22 versus the levels of the past 2 quarters as government subsidies are not expected to repeat, and we have pressures relating to the impacts of inflation. The opportunity ahead, coupled with tremendous experience and a strong diversified portfolio has us very optimistic for the future growth of China and our other international markets.
On to Channel Development. Revenue was $438 million in Q4, a decline of 10% from the prior year, primarily driven by Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business. When excluding the approximately 20% adverse impact of these transition-related activities, Channel Development's revenue increased by 10% in Q4, primarily driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance as well as other international ready-to-drink business. As a reminder, Q4 was the last quarter we will be lapping this transition, so we expect Channel Development to return to more normalized reported revenue growth levels in fiscal 2022.
The segment's operating margin was 50.2% in Q4, up 960 basis points from the prior year. Normalizing for the 890 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 70 basis points in Q4, driven primarily by lower trade spend in our international ready-to-drink business.
Now I will turn to our fiscal '22 outlook. For fiscal 2022, we are expecting global comp sales growth to reach high single digits as we lap prior year impacts of COVID and continue to build on our Q4 momentum. This also reflects our thoughtful pricing actions, which are expected to further bolster our comp growth as we work to offset the impacts of inflation across our supply chain.
New stores will also contribute meaningfully to our growth in fiscal 2022. We expect to add approximately 2,000 net new stores globally in fiscal 2022, up significantly from 1,173 in fiscal 2021 as we successfully completed closures under our North America trade area transformation program and are now refocusing on expansion. We estimate that approximately 75% of our net new stores will come from outside the U.S. as we continue to diversify our global portfolio across highly profitable markets. This represents global net new store growth of 6%, returning to our ongoing growth model.
With this powerful combination of global comp and store growth, coupled with the continued strength in our Channel Development segment, we are expecting consolidated revenue to range between $32.5 billion and $33 billion in fiscal 2022, growing well above our long-term guidance of 8% to 10% growth, setting us up for another year of record performance.
As Kevin mentioned, fiscal 2022 will be a pivotal year of investment, marked by increase in wage investments to further support our store partners in this critical moment, helping to ensure we have, one, the very best talent to drive our business forward; and two, the ability to continue capturing and maintaining meaningful category share gains.
Accelerating our growth in share is fuel for future margin expansion as sales leverage is one of the most meaningful expansion opportunities we have. So while we'll see an impact to operating margin in fiscal 2022 resulting from these investments, Increasing our share of customers now will drive long-term earnings and value for all Starbucks stakeholders. The success of Starbucks starts with our partners, and we are committed to continuing to invest in them as a critical strategic differentiator for our business.
With these investments, we expect fiscal 2022 operating margin to be approximately 17%, below our long-term target, driven by approximately 400 basis points of impact related to the wage investments, coupled with an additional headwind of approximately 200 basis points from a combination of inflationary pressures, other growth investments and discontinuation of government subsidies. Further, our fiscal 2022 margin expectation reflects factors unrelated to our core performance with an approximately 40 basis point dilutive impact from a combination of the Starbucks Korea transition as well as a change in non-GAAP reporting treatment, both representing a onetime step down in margin.
However, we will meaningfully offset these margin impacts in fiscal year 2022 with benefits from pricing, leverage on our expected strong sales and productivity gains. Importantly, given our continued proactive actions to continue to drive margin expansion and leverage accelerated sales growth, we expect our operating margin to return to the ongoing target of 18% to 19% in fiscal 2023.
While fiscal 2022 margin represents a departure from our long-term growth algorithm, we believe the value of these strategic investments will create for our partners, our business and all of our stakeholders will endure for many years to come.
We are pleased that as we had previously committed, we successfully managed our leverage ratio back within our target at the end of fiscal 2021. As a result, we plan to reinstitute our share repurchase program beginning this quarter and are committed to returning $20 billion to shareholders or approximately 15% of our current market capitalization over the next 3 years. With this commitment, Starbucks will have returned over $45 billion to shareholders since fiscal 2018 or approximately 35% of our current market capitalization, while simultaneously delivering on our algorithm for double-digit EPS growth at scale. Approximately 2/3 of this $20 billion will come in the form of share repurchases with the proceeds from the Korea transaction pushing fiscal 2022 repurchases a bit higher than the following 2 years. The remaining 1/3 will come through a very competitive dividend, targeting an approximate 50% payout.
To support this plan, we plan on issuing a moderate amount of incremental debt while retaining leverage below our target of 3x rent-adjusted EBITDA consistent with our existing BBB+ rating. As a result, we expect interest expense to be between $490 million and $500 million in fiscal 2022 versus $470 million in fiscal 2021.
Capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 are expected to total approximately $2 billion up from $1.5 billion in fiscal 2021 and back to pre-COVID levels, reflecting increases in new store development and technology initiatives in our stores. As always, we plan to focus on capital spending in fiscal 2022 on opportunities that drive significant returns across our global retail portfolio.
We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. This range translates to an EPS headwind of roughly 4% year-on-year and is meaningfully higher than the non-GAAP tax rate of 21.3% in fiscal 2021, which benefited from certain discrete tax benefits that are not expected to repeat to the same degree in fiscal 2022.
When you add it all up, on a 52-week comparative basis, we expect fiscal 2022 GAAP EPS to decline by 4% [ or less ]. We expect our fiscal 2022 non-GAAP EPS growth to be at least 10% from the base of $3.10 in fiscal 2021 that excludes the extra week and is adjusted for the change in non-GAAP treatment of certain integration costs.
With the phased rollout of wage investments and the ongoing global recovery from COVID throughout the year, we expect fiscal 2022 quarterly non-GAAP EPS to be the lowest in Q2 before peaking in Q3 to form a strong back half of the year. We recognize that this earnings guidance is a temporary change from the outlook discussed at our Investor Day in December 2020, driven by wage investments as well as faster-than-expected recovery in fiscal 2021. We continue, however, to stand by our commitment to the growth algorithm over the longer term. The strategic investments in our partners are the right thing to do for our business and all of our stakeholders, and we are confident this provides the foundation necessary to continue to grow our coffee leadership position for many years to come.
To summarize, here are the 3 key takeaways for my discussion today. First, we are thrilled with what we accomplished in fiscal 2021, far surpassing the pre-pandemic performance levels to deliver record high revenue, operating income and EPS even as global consumer mobility remains suppressed and inflationary headwinds pressure our business.
Second, fiscal 2022 will be a year of outsized investments prioritizing our store partners, and ensuring we have the very best talent to drive and maintain lasting category share gains while still delivering double-digit EPS growth and initiating a return of $20 billion to our shareholders over the next 3 years. And finally, we remain fully committed to our ongoing growth model and expect to progress towards our algorithm with an operating margin of 18% to 19% in fiscal 2023 while continuing to balance returns and investments necessary to sustain this performance over the long term.
Of course, all of this is made possible because of the significant efforts of our Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the Green Apron. It is their unwavering commitment to serving our customers that drives the financial results and outlook that I've shared today.
With that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Culver, Michael Conway and Leo Tsoy. Thank you, operator."

As we move into FY '23, we'll continue those efforts. And that's going to allow us to return back to the 18% to 19% margin that we guided for the long term. We feel confident that given that our Growth at Scale agenda and our focus on pipeline of innovation, our ability to continue to grow our digital customer memberships and our ability to continue to accelerate the service in through new stores and through the experience we're creating in stores, coupled with productivity and efficiency throughout our global network is really what allows us to continue on that path towards 18% to 19% margin in line with our long-term guidance."

The strategic investments we are making in wage, here's how to think about it. First, our Q4 and FY '21 revenue results demonstrate that we are growing faster than the coffee addressable market as estimated by Euromonitor. We are taking market share. Then if you look at consumer mobility, it's going to continue to increase, and we want to recruit and retain the very best talent for our stores.
The most important investment we can make is in our Green Apron partners. We know this to be true because it has been proven time and time again throughout our 50-year history. That when we take care of our partners, they always rise to the occasion and create that unique experience for our customers.
Clearly, from my perspective, this investment in our partners is not only the right thing to do for them. It's also the right thing to do for all stakeholders, including our shareholders. We're on the front foot right now, and we have this opportunity to accelerate by investing into the growth curve. This means with this investment, we predict higher market share gains as consumers return to our stores, and these share gains will be permanent. And these share gains will create long-term shareholder value.
If you think about it and you model this, those permanent gains, we know we get operating leverage as we get more customers. So if you just take the share gains and you run the spreadsheets on operating leverage, that is what's going to create -- this is actually going to increase the terminal value calculation for Starbucks. And we're so confident in this strategy, in this investment, that's why we're committing this $20 billion return to shareholders over the next 3 years.
So this is all about leaning into the growth taking market share that's going to be permanent, and the benefit of that market share is going to create significantly more shareholder value than we would have created without the investment. And we're so confident we're $20 billion returned to shareholders in dividends and buybacks. That's how I think about it, and that's how I think every shareholder ought to think about this investment."

Look, with COVID cases, in this case, the Delta variant, it creates the variability in consumer behavior. So as you saw in the United States more government restrictions, and many of these were done state by state and city by city that we had to respond to, that, I think, was the impact in August. And as we responded to those and certainly adds I think consumers start to see the Delta variance, the curve starting to slow, consumer mobility unfolded.
So these are all transitory and they're unpredictable. It is all related to the pandemic. So the acceleration that we saw in both the U.S. and China are the exact same reason. It's just a variable of dealing with the global pandemic. And when these Delta variants and these other things pop up, it does have some impact on consumer mobility. But the one thing we know for sure, absolutely, we see in every market around the world, that as the spread of COVID gets under control in -- market by market, customers return to our stores immediately. That's why this investment in wage and ensuring we staff our stores with the very best and most talented Green apron partners we can is so important.

What we're seeing from a behavior standpoint are very similar behaviors from customers as we've had in prior quarters in pre-COVID. So routines are beginning to normalize.
I think it speaks to a little bit around what Kevin said that as people become more mobile and particularly as we launched our fall campaign, normal routines entered with kids going back to school. Our peak hours have returned to pre-COVID behavior. They started in Q3, and they continued into Q4. Morning daypart, very strong growth on a year-over-year basis as well as midday. And then into the afternoon, we're seeing a very high beverage and food attach. And really a shift to cold beverages that we talked about on the last earnings call. Cold beverages actually accounted for 75% and of our beverage sales in the quarter. But food equally was strong. We were up 35%, espresso was up 34%, and we are seeing larger tickets come through as well.
So when you look at it from a store standpoint, we're very pleased with what the performance has been. First, in rural and suburban areas where our drive-throughs are most common, and which helped carry us through the COVID period. And over the last 18 months were very strong, and they continue to show strong performance. Our urban stores have reached recovered status, and we're very encouraged by that.
And then from a central business district, recovery has been slower, but it continues. For the second quarter in a row, central business district is returned to a positive comp performance as well.
And then the last thing I would just leave you with is what we're seeing on the convenience aspect of Starbucks. And in particular, the growth of drive-thru and the growth of MLP. And we've done a lot of this during the trade area transformation work we did around the stores. Today drive-through and MLP accounted for 70% of transactions, which is up 15% versus pre-pandemic levels. So we're very encouraged with the momentum that we've been able to build. And then obviously, with the investments that we're making in our people from a wage perspective, we expect to continue to increase staffing levels, continue to increase the training for our partners, and we are very, very well positioned for a very strong holiday season."

Obviously, like all other retailers, we're navigating a very complex and unprecedented environment. And yes, we have seen some staffing challenges in certain parts of the country. But I think from the results we've been able to deliver, it demonstrates our ability to navigate through these challenges, whether it be staffing, whether it be any of the supply chain challenges or any of the inflationary pressures. When you look at it, one of the things that we've done during this time as we've looked at adjusting the staffing levels and how do we manage through this is we've also taken action to adjust store operating hours. And when I say that, we've really looked at the evening daypart and pulled that back from an hours perspective. And that has enabled us to redeploy staffing into other stores where we need. So we're continuing to do that.
In terms of your question around attrition, we are -- over the last year, we have approximately 70% of our hourly partners are new to Starbucks, and we continue to make investments in them from a training standpoint as we announced yesterday for all our partners. In addition, we've made investments now and we announced this yesterday around recruiting and adding recruiters, more recruiters into the regions to really focus and find and attract new talent. And then also, at the same time, we continue to work very closely with our partners to understand how we can continue to make them effective as well as reduce complexity in the store.
complexity is a big thing for us, a big focus. And in that, we're looking at 2 things. Number one is driving automation in the stores. We've driven automated ordering for food and merchandise. It will be fully rolled out across all of our U.S. company-owned stores by the middle of this quarter. And then in addition, we continue to make investments in equipment. And from an equipment standpoint, whether it's Mastrena, whether it's our warming ovens or whether it's our Cold Brew system, all these equipment investments also make our partners more effective and free up time for them as they do their tasks.
So a lot of work going on. I'm very proud of the way in which our partners have navigated over the course of the last year, in particular. And as we've experienced some of these challenges, and we feel as though we are in a very good spot in managing through this, and we'll continue to make investments in this area. It's an area we're watching very closely."

Actually, in Q4 last year -- last fiscal year, we were impacted by 3 waves of COVID resurgence in the entire quarter, which hit 42 cities in total across the quarter. Now what it means is that we saw elevated public health measures were implemented, which significantly reduced the customer mobility and disrupted the consumption patterns.
As you know, the borders also remained closed. And when we see what this impacts us, it means that over half of our stores were located in cities hit by local cases. And around 80% of our stores were operating under the elevated safety protocols at the peak of the resurgence. So that's why [ weighed down ] by these headwinds we, in Q4, delivered 11% revenue growth year-on-year as Kevin pointed out. And that means in Q4, the comp was up -- minus 7% or minus 3% if we exclude the lapping over of FY '20 VAT release. However, I must say that when we exclude the stores in the cities with local cases, as well as transportation and tourist stores, our comp was actually positive, excluding the FY '20 VAT release.
And more importantly, as Rachel also pointed out, our operating income was minus 1% versus last year. And if we actually exclude the one-off COVID-related [ benefit ] in FY '20, we actually achieved improved -- improvement on the operating income. So this is really showing and demonstrating our team's operational agility.
So what I would say, Sara, we are seeing this dynamic dynamics happening in the market. But I'm confidently saying that this is short term and they're going to recover, we're going to recover. And this is why our focus right now is focus on what we can control to navigate all the short-term volatility with our team's abilities while capturing the key opportunity by, for example, generating our growth and elevating our digital engagement and our customer experience. I think this is all going to power our future growth and build sustainable competitive advantage of Starbucks China. Turning over to you."

Sara, let me take the second half of your question, the back half of your question regarding these investments. And just want to start if I just sort of looking back at some of the strategic investments that we made through this pandemic, starting with the decision we took in March of 2020. To give our partners economic certainty and pay them with no lapse, no furloughs, pay them while we closed all of our stores in the United States and just kept drive-throughs open. That was a big strategic decision. And we made that decision certainly staying true to our mission and values and taking care of our partners. But we also knew that as this pandemic began to ease and the recovery came back, our partners would be there, and they were.
And so why do you think we drove a faster recovery than people expected? Why did we drive a faster recovery than others in the industry? Answer, because we have the courage to make that strategic bet at that time in March of 2020. Then in June of 2020, we made a strategic decision to transform the trade area portfolio of the store portfolio in the United States. We basically repositioned nearly 600 stores to reposition them to better serve our customers and to give us better economics and to elevate the customer experience. That strategic decision -- we had the courage to make that. And that strategic position today is giving us margin expansion, an elevated customer experience and that, too, is contributing to our recovery.
I think about this decision on this wage investments, the very same way we have in the past. We're going to stay true to our mission value. And we know for certain because we've seen it time and time again that when we invest in our partners, they rise to the occasion. And we also know this pandemic is transitory. We know vaccines work. We know that when we see markets, as governments just reduced restrictions, customers are back into our stores. So this is an opportunity for us to move now.
We can't wait. This is the time to take that market share that we know we can take and that market share gain is permanent. That market share gain will build long-term customer engagement, long-term customer loyalty, and that market share gain will also drive operating leverage in our stores. In addition to that, we also know that we have a combination of in-store productivity innovation that's going to help offset that. We also have pricing power. And we're very thoughtful about how we take price, but we are taking price and we will continue to take price in an inflationary environment.
So we just believe this is the absolute right thing to do at this moment in time. And this investment, like the other 2 that I just described will return value to shareholders. Because of that, that's why we reinforced our confidence with this $20 billion return to shareholders in the form of repurchases and buybacks. Thanks for your question."

When we look at this past quarter, Q4, we had about a 90 basis point impact from inflationary pressures across the globe. It was a combination of logistics labor as well as commodities. As we move into Q1 and Q2, we would expect that to increase, and that will start to settle in Q3 and Q4. But we concluded it as part of our guidance throughout the year because we really don't know when these are going to -- when these inflationary pressures will subside. And to that point, we've got some planned in this year. Of course, they could increase. We don't know what's going to happen, but we feel confident we've got at least approach based on what we've seen in Q3 and Q4 this year, and we've accounted for that into next year.

But I feel very good about the way in which we've been able to navigate it. Those supply impacts began in mid-fiscal '21. And we would expect that they will continue into this coming year, all right? And what we're seeing is headwinds on commodity pricing, challenges around transportation and also the ability for our distributors and manufacturers to find labor to work in their factories and distribution centers.
A couple of things that we've done with the team is, number one, we've worked very closely to add new manufacturing and supply partners across our critical categories. And that is paying dividends for us, and we're seeing inventory ease in those categories, i.e., oat milk, breakfast sandwiches, egg bites, et cetera. We're building throughput and production capacity. We have suppliers adding new lines so that they can increase their safety stock. We work with suppliers to invest in wage for their workers, and many of them have done so.
And the last thing I would say that what we've done is we've really focused our production efforts on high-volume items. And some of those lower-volume items we pulled back on and deprioritized. So all that work and the actions that we've taken, we started early on as we began to see these challenges we've addressed them. We're not out of the woods yet, but we feel very good about the path that we're on.
And as Kevin highlighted, we're very confident that as we head in the holiday, our inventory position is very strong. and we'll continue to watch this very closely, and we'll continue to work with our supply network to ensure we've got an adequate supply of products in our stores.
And then the last thing I would say is that clearly, like other retailers, we're seeing customers come back into our stores at record levels. And the strength of our business is very strong.

Just wondering what the thoughts are around increasing that licensing mix over time which would seemingly generate a high margin annuity stream of royalty income, allow for greater balance sheet leverage, maybe return incremental cash. I'm not sure whether that would require a change in the China ownership structure, but we've obviously seen that at your largest multinational QSR peers.

As we said, in December 2020, we're always evaluating markets, and you saw that the Korea joint venture, we did sell our 50% stake to a long-term license partners and say, who's been operating that market, and we'll continue to operate that market. So we're always evaluating that. But we're happy with where we are today and I guess that's -- that's what I would say.

And part of this is how do you take the right amount of price at the right time and not have customer attrition.
We're the share -- we want to grow share of customer occasions right now, and so that's the balance that we strike. And it's really a fairly dynamic thing. So for us, we just -- I prefer not to say here's what we built in because I think we actually have more if we need it, and we can take less if we don't need it.

So that combination of the $0.14 is what we're reducing this year's non-GAAP EPS of $3.24 down to an adjusted FY '21 non-GAAP EPS of $3.10. And then we're encouraging a growth rate off of that baseline of it meets 10%.
And again, that 10% is given the dynamic operating environment that we're in this unprecedented level of investments that we're taking as well as the pressures we still see related to the supply chain and the inflationary pressures as well as the pressures we're seeing from the COVID vaccine -- or from the COVID environment, we think the combination of that and the dynamic environment we're in, that at least 10% growth reflects a lot of confidence and optimism for where we're headed, even though it's quite a challenging environment ahead."

GAAP results in fiscal 2021 include several items related to strategic actions, including restructuring and impairment charges, transaction and integration costs and other items.

Before we begin, there are 4 reminders I'd like to make with respect to the numbers that will be discussed on today's call. First, as noted in our earnings release, we have realigned our fully licensed Latin America and Caribbean markets to our International segment. As a result, we renamed the Americas segment to North America. All discussions and comparisons today are reflective of the resegmentation.
Second, a reminder that Starbucks' fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year instead of the usual 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2021 results on today's call are on a 14-week basis for the quarter and 53-week basis for the year, except the year-on-year comparative metrics, including revenue growth, comp growth, EPS growth and margin expansion, which are based on a 13-week or 52-week basis to exclude the impact of an extra fiscal week.
Third, all references on today's call are on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. And lastly, effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, certain international integration-related expenses previously excluded from our non-GAAP results will be included as they are expected to be representative of ongoing operations. Please refer to the reconciliation of these measures and a schedule showing adjusted fiscal 2021 EPS to bridge year-on-year impacts of this recast as well as reconciliations of 53-week to 52-week metrics at the supplemental financial data section of our website at investor.starbucks.com.

I'm very pleased to comment on the record Q4 and FY '21 results Starbucks reported today. I'm particularly pleased that we were able to deliver these results in Starbucks' 50th anniversary year and in the face of increased costs and unprecedented operating challenges resulting from the global pandemic. Today's results reflect very strong operating and financial performance across the board, with Q4 revenue growing 22% and full year non-GAAP EPS of 168% over prior year. This was a record Q4 that punctuates a very strong FY '21 performance with record highs in revenue, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS.
Our performance accelerated throughout FY '21, fueling revenue growth of 21%. Non-GAAP operating income grew 139% and translated to a non-GAAP earnings of $3.24 per share, near the high end of our guidance for the year. Perhaps more persuasively than ever, the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand and the power and opportunity afforded by the authentic connection and the deep trust and loyalty we have built with customers around the world is resonating.
Today's results demonstrate that despite the pandemic, Starbucks' long-term double-digit Growth at Scale model remains solidly intact. Today's results also underscore the passion and dedication of our over 400,000 Starbucks Green Apron partners who serve nearly 100 million customer occasions around the world every week. And I'm humbled by our partners' commitment to each other and to our customers as we continue to navigate through the pandemic. Their resilience and service honors the company and our history, and I could not be more appreciative of their efforts.
Finally, today's results demonstrate the success of the investments we have made and will continue to make ahead of the growth curve in our people, digital, beverage and food innovation and store experiences. These investments are driving and strengthening our global business and setting us up for even greater success in the future.
Starbucks' long-standing view is that our partners guide this company, and we applaud other like-minded companies who are following our lead. Starbucks has been at the forefront of investing in our people since we opened our first store in the Pike Place market in Seattle in 1971. We offer paid company health care 25 years before the Affordable Care Act; equity ownership in the form of Bean Stock to eligible part-time partners; free college tuition through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan with Arizona State University; and mental health support through our partnership with Lyra. Investing in our people is the cornerstone of our storied 50-year history and tradition. And these investments continue to deliver real measurable value to our partners, our customers and our shareholders.
I'll be providing granularity around the incremental partner investments we made beginning last year and the additional partner investments we will be making in fiscal '22 in a moment. On today's call, I will highlight Q4 performance in our key markets and provide detail around some of our actions and investments since the pandemic first surfaced in Q2 of 2020 that are contributing to our performance today and setting us up for accelerated growth in the future. I'll also open a window on our exciting holiday plans and several initiatives that will launch over the near term. Then I'll turn the call over to Rachel to provide a deep dive into our Q4 and fiscal year performance and share our guidance for fiscal '22. We'll then move on to Q&A.
Over the last 18 months, Starbucks, like most global retail operators, has been confronted with a seemingly never-ending wave of consumer and business headwinds. Many businesses in our space have not survived. From day 1 of the pandemic, Starbucks leaders around the world were determined to use the company's size and scale to navigate whatever challenges lie ahead with steadfast commitment to our people, our mission and values. A set of principles guided us through the pandemic. Every decision was rooted in our core purpose and reason for being. These decisions have made the Starbucks of today stronger and better positioned to profitably grow, extend our coffee leadership around the world and create more value for our shareholders more than ever before in our history. 
Last year, we made significant pandemic-driven strategic investments, including providing our partners with financial support and economic certainty, avoiding layoffs while most of our stores were temporarily closed and accelerating our U.S. store portfolio transformation by opportunistically repositioning 500 stores to better locations with more favorable economics. To this last point, we expanded our portfolio of drive-throughs, introduced new store formats to meet our customers where they are and turbocharged growth in our digital customer relationships in the U.S. and China.
As a result of these successful investments, we are entering fiscal '22 with strong momentum around the world. In the U.S., our largest global market, our key growth driver is comparable sales. We grew a strong 2-year comp to 11% in Q4 despite variance across the country that created a dynamic set of city-by-city COVID restrictions which we had to navigate. We made significant progress addressing supply chain issues and experienced an overall improvement in inventory availability as we moved through the quarter by increasing production at existing suppliers, onboarding new suppliers and strategically prioritizing key holiday and Q1 merchandise. While we made significant progress addressing supply chain challenges as fiscal 2021 progressed, we remain cautious and vigilant as we enter fiscal '22 given the dynamic nature of the situation.
The recovery in Q4 surged forward as evidenced by the sequential acceleration of 2-year comp growth. We exited Q4 with even stronger 14% 2-year comp growth in September and closed to a record average ticket driven by the strength of our fall beverage lineup, a shift in customer behavior toward more premium beverages and strong food attach. We have great confidence for the year ahead given the comp momentum throughout the quarter, combined with holiday plans certain to excite and delight our customers and increasing consumer demand around the world today for everything Starbucks.
Yesterday, we made an important announcement to raise wages across the U.S. in fiscal '22 to ensure we continue to attract and retain talented partners as consumer mobility continues to increase. We believe this investment, combined with our industry-leading benefits program, will enable us to remain an employer of choice. This builds on the historic partner investments and meaningful wage increases we made in fiscal year '21 and prioritizes significant additional investment to address inflation and wage compression that our tenured partners have experienced while also increasing our wage floor.
In December of 2020, I announced our intention to provide a starting wage of at least $15 an hour for our store partners across the country. And by the summer of '22, we will have delivered on that plan. Effective in January, partners with 2 or more years of service will get up to a 5% raise, and partners with 5 or more years will get up to a 10% raise in keeping with our long-standing history of investing in our partners. And next summer, hourly partners in the U.S. will make an average of nearly $17 an hour, with barista rates ranging from $15 to $23 an hour across the country. In total, the FY '21 and FY '22 investments represent approximately $1 billion in incremental annual wages and benefits.
We continue to build a great and enduring company by investing ahead of the growth curve, not just in wages but in training and technology and the overall Starbucks experience for both our partners and our customers. And as we have seen in the past, we expect investment in the partner experience will be accretive to profits over time.
We believe the U.S. market is at a unique inflection point. Stakeholders and companies whose leaders correctly identify emerging trends, thoughtfully shape strategic action and invest in the future will be big winners over the long term. In the quarters ahead, Starbucks will continue to target investment in high-returning assets that we believe will accelerate our double-digit Growth at Scale model, driving long-term sustainable and profitable growth.
We continue to build and leverage our technology-first mobile and digital capabilities and accelerate growth in active Starbucks Rewards membership. We grew our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members, representing our most loyal engaged customers by approximately 30% in fiscal year '21 to 24.8 million members. Noteworthy is that in Q4, 51% of U.S. tender for company-operated stores was generated by this loyal customer base. We continue to nurture and deepen our direct personalized digital relationship with our members with enhancements to the program like Stars for Everyone to expand reach and through payment partnerships with PayPal and Bakkt, where a customer can now reload their Starbucks card with a range of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, Ethereum and others, by converting digital currencies to physical currency and reloading their Starbucks card.
Through blockchain or other innovative technologies, we are exploring how to tokenize Stars, create the ability for other merchants to connect their rewards program to Starbucks Rewards. This will enable customers to exchange value across brands, engage in more personalized experiences, enhance digital services and exchange other loyalty points for Stars at Starbucks. An example of this innovation is evident in the recent launch of our Canadian loyalty program with Air Canada. 
Over the next year, you will see the first instance of this loyalty points exchange with other consumer brands. This approach will also serve as a foundation for a more aspirational concept for new, modern payment rails that align payment expenses with the value received by customers and merchants. We intend to be at the forefront of this disruptive innovation, which will unfold over the next few years.
Finally, a rich pipeline of innovation will elevate the Starbucks experience in our stores and drive in-store productivity gains. Examples include our Mastrena 2 espresso machines that more efficiently pulls triple shots of high-quality espresso; our Deep Brew artificial intelligence platform that has automated daily inventory management; and store staffing and training improvements designed to reduce complexity in our stores. Simplifying this workflow helps reduce the strain on our partners, resulting from the ever-increased demand in our stores and enables our partners to connect and engage with their customers, which is at the heart of the Starbucks experience.
Starbucks is entering fiscal year '22 with strong customer demand and solid momentum in our U.S. business and expanding and accelerating in-store channels and digital flywheel and Green Apron partners eager to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to their customers. Having navigated through so many challenges over the past year, we are excited and optimistic about the year that has just begun while remaining humble and mindful of unknown challenges.
On to China. Starbucks China extended our market leadership position in Q4 despite pandemic-driven disruptions, propelled by an accelerated pace of store development and significant growth in digital customer relationships, all while achieving record customer engagement scores in the quarter and in the year. Starbucks has built one of the most respected consumer brands in China, with 1 in 2 consumers preferring Starbucks to any other brands in away-from-home coffee.
Our growth strategy in the market continues to differentiate us and position us well for the long game. We continue to invest meaningfully in all aspects of our China business, including accelerated investment in our partners; the creation of award-winning, experiential store designs; unprecedented benefits like health care for partners and their parents; rent assistance; and programs that offer career paths for young people from rural and remote provinces. Together, these investments further elevate the Starbucks brand and partner experience. They instill pride in our China partners and deepen our customer engagement and connection.
Starbucks continues to be in a strong market expansion cycle. And as such, much of our growth in China comes as we aggressively expand our store footprint and introduce more customers to the Starbucks experience. We expanded the store footprint with 225 net new stores in Q4, and we are going deeper and broader, deeper into existing cities and broader by opening in new cities.
For the full fiscal year, we opened a record 654 net new stores and ended the year with 5,360 stores in 208 cities throughout China. As we noted on our Q3 earnings call, our recovery in China will not be linear. In Q4, we experienced COVID-related restrictions that constrained customer mobility in 18 provincial-level regions. At its peak in mid-August, approximately 80% of our stores in China were impacted by the pandemic, with some stores fully closed or operating at different levels of elevated public health protocols, such as mobile ordering only, limited seating or health stations. Our recovery momentum was below expectation and pushed our 2-year comps to a minus 10% in Q4. Cities with local COVID cases were impacted the most, with stores relying on transportation and tourism also materially impacted during the quarter.
Notably, though, much like the U.S., China's 2-year comp also accelerated in the month of September as we remain optimistic for the recovery. Despite these strong headwinds, China grew revenue 11% year-on-year. While our overall reported comp growth was minus 7% for Q4, if we exclude the lap of a VAT subsidy we received in fiscal year '20, along with the stores and cities that experienced local COVID cases or were in transportation and tourism zones, our core fleet of stores comped positive. Starbucks' business and operating margins remained strong, and our commitment to China and our confidence in our long-term growth strategy in China is unwavering.
In addition to expanding our portfolio of stores in China, we also expanded our digital footprint with 90 days Starbucks Rewards active members, reaching an all-time high of 17.9 million in Q4. This represents a sequential increase of 5% over Q3 and an increase of 33% over prior year. Frequency of purchases by our Gold members remained at pre-pandemic levels despite the mobility limitations in the quarter, demonstrating the effectiveness of our efforts in up-leveling member engagement. One example was our Star Dash gift with purchase campaign that successfully lifted member frequency and spend and evolved into a highly anticipated activity for members to earn limited availability to Starbucks' 50th anniversary merchandise.
With operations heavily impacted by COVID-related safety restrictions in the quarter, we are laser-focused on what we can control in China while continuing to elevate our partner and customer experiences to further elevate the Starbucks brand and build on the loyalty that will continue to drive our long-term growth.
Including the U.S. and China, Starbucks' presence in 84 markets around the world provides us with a unique perspective on the global recovery from this pandemic. There's no doubt that we are seeing continued recovery in our markets.
Latin America grew system sales by 113% in Q4 driven by a strong recovery in Mexico. EMEA posted system sales growth of 52% in the quarter. And Japan navigated through a challenging quarter, turning the corner towards renewed growth. We see positive signs in many other markets as well as reinforcing our belief that pandemic-related headwinds are temporary.
In addition, our strategic channel partnerships with the North American Coffee Partnership with PepsiCo and our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé are on plan and have propelled Starbucks to #1 share positions in the U.S. and throughout many other markets around the world, further underscoring the strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand and illuminating the decades-long runway of growth ahead.
As we enter fiscal year '22, we are fully prepared for a record-breaking holiday with strong growth planned around the world and a holiday campaign designed to build genuine human connection as only Starbucks can at a time when human connection is more important than ever.
In addition to new and iconic seasonal products, we are integrating brand building and transaction-driving marketing programs to demonstrate our values and touch our customers' hearts. We are prepared with inventory this holiday, and we are also anticipating that nearly $3 billion will be loaded on Starbucks Cards this season by leveraging our digital and out-of-store distribution channels and creating a promotional presence in drive-through lanes, where we have seen significant channel shift during the pandemic. We are ready for this holiday.
In closing, Starbucks' strong performance through the recovery is a direct result of the hard work and dedication of our partners as well as the investments we made both before and during the pandemic. We remain confident in our future and steadfast in our commitment to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders. This confidence supports the plan we announced today to return $20 billion to shareholders over the next 3 years through dividends and share repurchases. I'm particularly pleased that hundreds of thousands of Starbucks partners who are also Starbucks shareholders through our Bean Stock program will also benefit from this plan.
50 years ago, Starbucks was founded as a different kind of company, a company that would balance profit with social conscious and embrace the ideal that doing good for one another and for society would actually be very good for business over the long term. Our performance in 2021 demonstrates the wisdom and correctness of that founding principle. As we enter our second 50 years, we continue to honor our history and heritage just as we boldly reimagine our future.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rachel. Rachel?"

Please note that as Greg discussed at the top of the call, fiscal '21 results that I will discuss today are non-GAAP, unless noted, and on a 14-week basis for the quarter and a 53-week basis for the year, except year-on-year revenue, comp, operating margin and EPS growth metrics, which will be on a 13-week or 52-week basis to exclude the impact of an extra fiscal week for comparative purposes.
In Q4, Starbucks Global revenue reached $8.1 billion, up 22% from the prior year, setting another quarterly record, along with a fiscal year record of $29.1 billion, primarily driven by the continued momentum in the U.S. and strong contributions from across the globe despite the severe headwinds of the COVID Delta variant. Our consolidated operating margin was 19.6% in Q4, up 580 basis points from the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by sales leverage across the P&L as we lap the COVID-19 impacts and related costs as well as pricing in North America. These were partially offset by rapid inflation related to logistics, commodities and labor costs across our supply chain.
Q4 GAAP EPS was $1.49, inclusive of a $0.56 divestiture gain from the Starbucks Coffee Korea transaction, which yielded pretax proceeds of almost $1.2 billion. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1, capping off the company's most profitable year ever with non-GAAP EPS of $3.24.
I will now provide some segment highlights for Q4 and then we'll provide guidance for fiscal 2022. The North America segment delivered revenue of $5.8 billion in Q4, 27% higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 22% increase in comparable store sales, including 18% comp transaction growth and a 3% increase in average ticket. In the U.S., comparable store sales reached 22% in Q4 driven by transaction comp of 19%, delivering another sequential improvement in 2-year transaction comp in the face of COVID Delta variant disruptions. Simultaneously, we maintained our strength in average ticket, up 3% over the prior year in Q4, remaining near record levels and posting 2-year ticket comp of over 20% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Cold beverages reached 75% of total sales in Q4, contributing to our ticket strength, along with outstanding results from our fall promotion and another record quarter of food attach.
North America's operating margin was 22.5% in Q4, expanding 510 basis points from the prior year, driven by sales leverage as we lap the impacts of COVID as well as continued strength in ticket, including pricing. The segment's operating margin exceeded the pre-pandemic level in Q4 fiscal 2019 by 170 basis points, primarily due to the leadership conference and labor hour investments in Q4 fiscal 2019. Strong ticket and the benefit of trade area transformation also offset the margin headwind of approximately 270 basis points over the past 2 years from sizable investments in wage and benefits as well as supply chain inflationary pressures.
Moving on to International. The International segment delivered record revenue of $1.9 billion in Q4, growing 18% over the prior year. The growth was driven by an 8% increase in net new stores over the past 12 months, strong sales growth from our international licensees as well as a 3% increase in comparable store sales. Both company-operated and licensed markets across our international portfolio are contributing meaningfully, with double-digit sales growth in key markets like Japan, the U.K., Korea and Mexico.
Kevin noted that the COVID-related volatility drove comp sales down 7% in China in Q4. However, our experienced team and 22-year history continue to serve us well as operating income was only down 1% versus last year. Our team in China and across the globe has done a tremendous job of managing through the volatility. In fact, operating margin for the International segment was 22.8% in Q4, expanding 650 basis points from the prior year, well above pre-pandemic levels, mainly driven by sales leverage as the segment continued to recover from the pandemic.
Higher government subsidies, lapping store asset impairments in the prior year as well as store and overhead labor efficiencies also contributed to the expansion. We expect margin to settle a bit in fiscal '22 versus the levels of the past 2 quarters as government subsidies are not expected to repeat and we have pressures relating to the impacts of inflation. The opportunity ahead, coupled with tremendous experience and a strong diversified portfolio, has us very optimistic for the future growth of China and our other international markets.
On to Channel Development. Revenue was $438 million in Q4, a decline of 10% from the prior year, primarily driven by Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including a structural change in our single-serve business. When excluding the approximately 20% adverse impact of these transition-related activities, Channel Development's revenue increased by 10% in Q4, primarily driven by growth in the Global Coffee Alliance as well as other International ready-to-drink business. As a reminder, Q4 was the last quarter we will be lapping this transition so we expect Channel Development to return to more normalized reported revenue growth levels in fiscal 2022.
The segment's operating margin was 50.2% in Q4, up 960 basis points from the prior year. Normalizing for the 890 basis point impact of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities I just mentioned, Channel Development's operating margin expanded 70 basis points in Q4, driven primarily by lower trade spend in our International ready-to-drink business.
Now I will turn to our fiscal '22 outlook. For fiscal 2022, we are expecting global comp sales growth to reach high single digits as we lap prior year impacts of COVID and continue to build on our Q4 momentum. This also reflects our thoughtful pricing actions, which are expected to further bolster our comp growth as we work to offset the impacts of inflation across our supply chain.
New stores will also contribute meaningfully to our growth in fiscal 2022. We expect to add approximately 2,000 net new stores globally in fiscal 2022, up significantly from 1,173 in fiscal 2021 as we successfully completed closures under our North America trade area transformation program and are now refocusing on expansion. We estimate that approximately 75% of our net new stores will come from outside the U.S. as we continue to diversify our global portfolio across highly profitable markets. This represents global net new store growth of 6%, returning to our ongoing growth model.
With this powerful combination of global comp and store growth, coupled with the continued strength in our Channel Development segment, we are expecting consolidated revenue to range between $32.5 billion and $33 billion in fiscal 2022, going well above our long-term guidance of 8% to 10% growth, setting us up for another year of record performance.
As Kevin mentioned, fiscal 2022 will be a pivotal year of investment marked by increase in wage investments to further support our store partners in this critical moment, helping to ensure we have, one, the very best talent to drive our business forward; and two, the ability to continue capturing and maintaining meaningful category share gains.
Accelerating our growth in share is fuel for future margin expansion as sales leverage is one of the most meaningful expansion opportunities we have. So while we'll see an impact to operating margin in fiscal 2022 resulting from these investments, increasing our share of customers now will drive long-term earnings and value for all Starbucks stakeholders. The success of Starbucks starts with our partners, and we are committed to continuing to invest in them as a critical strategic differentiator for our business.
With these investments, we expect fiscal 2022 operating margin to be approximately 17%, below our long-term target, driven by approximately 400 basis points of impact related to the wage investments, coupled with an additional headwind of approximately 200 basis points from a combination of inflationary pressures, other growth investments and discontinuation of government subsidies. Further, our fiscal 2022 margin expectation reflects factors unrelated to our core performance with an approximately 40 basis point dilutive impact from a combination of the Starbucks Korea transition as well as a change in non-GAAP reporting treatment, both representing a onetime step-down in margin.
However, we will meaningfully offset these margin impacts in fiscal year 2022 with benefits from pricing, leveraging on our expected strong sales and productivity gains. Importantly, given our continued proactive actions to continue to drive margin expansion and leverage accelerated sales growth, we expect our operating margin to return to the ongoing target of 18% to 19% in fiscal 2023. While fiscal 2022 margin represents a departure from our long-term growth algorithm, we believe the value of these strategic investments will create for our partners, our business and all of our stakeholders will endure for many years to come.
We are pleased that as we had previously committed, we successfully managed our leverage ratio back within our target at the end of fiscal 2021. As a result, we plan to reinstitute our share repurchase program beginning this quarter and are committed to returning $20 billion to shareholders or approximately 15% of our current market capitalization over the next 3 years. With this commitment, Starbucks will have returned over $45 billion to shareholders since fiscal 2018 or approximately 35% of our current market capitalization while simultaneously delivering on our algorithm for double-digit EPS growth at scale. Approximately 2/3 of this $20 billion will come in the form of share repurchases, with the proceeds from the Korea transaction pushing fiscal 2022 repurchases a bit higher than the following 2 years. The remaining 1/3 will come through a very competitive dividend, targeting an approximate 50% payout. To support this plan, we plan on issuing a moderate amount of incremental debt while retaining leverage below our target of 3x rent-adjusted EBITDA, consistent with our existing BBB+ rating. As a result, we expect interest expense to be between $490 million and $500 million in fiscal 2022 versus $470 million in fiscal 2021.
Capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 are expected to total approximately $2 billion, up from $1.5 billion in fiscal 2021 and back to pre-COVID levels, reflecting increases in new store development and technology initiatives in our stores. As always, we plan to focus on capital spending in fiscal 2022 on opportunities that drive significant returns across our global retail portfolio.
We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 24% and 25%. This range translates to an EPS headwind of roughly 4% year-on-year and is meaningfully higher than the non-GAAP tax rate of 21.3% in fiscal 2021, which benefited from certain discrete tax benefits that are not expected to repeat to the same degree in fiscal 2022.
When you add it all up, on a 52-week comparative basis, we expect fiscal 2022 GAAP EPS to decline by 4% or less. We expect our fiscal 2022 non-GAAP EPS growth to be at least 10% from the base of $3.10 in fiscal 2021 that excludes the extra week and is adjusted for the change in non-GAAP treatment of certain integration costs.
With the phased rollout of wage investments and the ongoing global recovery from COVID throughout the year, we expect fiscal 2022 quarterly non-GAAP EPS to be the lowest in Q2 before peaking in Q3 to form a strong back half of the year. We recognize that this earnings guidance is a temporary change from the outlook discussed at our Investor Day in December 2020, driven by wage investments as well as faster-than-expected recovery in fiscal 2021. We continue, however, to stand by our commitment to the growth algorithm over the longer term. The strategic investments in our partners are the right thing to do for our business and all of our stakeholders, and we are confident this provides the foundation necessary to continue to grow our coffee leadership position for many years to come.
To summarize, here are the 3 key takeaways for my discussion today. First, we are thrilled with what we accomplished in fiscal 2021, far surpassing the pre-pandemic performance levels to deliver record high revenue, operating income and EPS even as global consumer mobility remains suppressed and inflationary headwinds pressure our business.
Second, fiscal 2022 will be a year of outsized investments prioritizing our store partners and ensuring we have the very best talent to drive, capture and maintain lasting category share gains while still delivering double-digit EPS growth and initiating a return of $20 billion to our shareholders over the next 3 years. 
And finally, we remain fully committed to our ongoing growth model and expect to progress towards our algorithm with an operating margin of 18% to 19% in fiscal 2023 while continuing to balance returns and investments necessary to sustain this performance over the long term. 
Of course, all of this is made possible because of the significant efforts of our Starbucks partners around the world who proudly wear the Green Apron. It is their unwavering commitment to serving our customers that drives the financial results and outlook that I've shared today.
With that, Kevin and I are happy to take your questions, joined by John Culver, Michael Conway and Leo Tsoi. Thank you, operator."

Thank you for the question. What I'd say is when we look at our margins that we're guiding for this year and we think about where we're headed to next year, as you know, there are over 640 basis points of dilution to our margin this year given the investments we're making as well as some of the inflationary headwinds and changes, as outlined in my prepared remarks. We're going to work this year to offset the majority of that through pricing, through sales leverage, through productivity and other efficiency measures.
As we move into FY '23, we'll continue those efforts, and that's going to allow us to return back to the 18% to 19% margin that we guided for the long term. We feel confident that given that our Growth at Scale agenda and our focus on pipeline of innovation, our ability to continue to grow our digital customer memberships and our ability to continue to accelerate the service experience through new stores and through the experience we're creating in stores, coupled with productivity and efficiency throughout our global network, is really what allows us to continue on that path towards 18% to 19% margin in line with our long-term guidance."

The strategic investments we are making in wage, here's how to think about it. First, our Q4 and FY '21 revenue results demonstrate that we are growing faster than the coffee addressable market as estimated by Euromonitor. We are taking market share. Then if you look at consumer mobility, it's going to continue to increase, and we want to recruit and retain the very best talent for our stores. The most important investment we can make is in our Green Apron partners. We know this to be true because it has been proven time and time again throughout our 50-year history. That when we take care of our partners, they always rise to the occasion and create that unique Starbucks experience for our customers. Clearly, from my perspective, this investment in our partners is not only the right thing to do for them. It's also the right thing to do for all stakeholders, including our shareholders. 
We're on the front foot right now, and we have this opportunity to accelerate by investing into the growth curve. This means with this investment, we predict higher market share gains as consumers return to our stores, and these share gains will be permanent. And these share gains will create long-term shareholder value. If you think about it and you model this, those permanent gains, we know we get operating leverage as we get more customers. So if you just take the share gains and you run the spreadsheets on operating leverage, that is what's going to create -- this is actually going to increase the terminal value calculation for Starbucks. And we're so confident in this strategy, in this investment, that's why we're committing this $20 billion return to shareholders over the next 3 years.
So this is all about leaning into the growth, taking market share that's going to be permanent, and the benefit of that market share is going to create significantly more shareholder value than we would have created without the investment. And we're so confident we're $20 billion returned to shareholders in dividends and buybacks. That's how I think about it, and that's how I think every shareholder ought to think about this investment."

Look, with COVID cases, in this case, the Delta variant, it creates the variability in consumer behavior. So as you saw in the United States more government restrictions, and many of these were done state by state and city by city, that we had to respond to, that I think was the impact in August. And as we responded to those and certainly as I think consumers start to see the Delta variance, the curve starting to slow, consumer mobility unfolds. So these are all transitory and they're unpredictable. It's all related to the pandemic. So the acceleration that we saw in both the U.S. and China are the exact same reason. It's just a variable of dealing with the global pandemic. And when these Delta variants and these other things pop up, it does have some impact on consumer mobility. 
But the one thing we know for sure, absolutely, we see it in every market around the world, that as the spread of COVID gets under control in -- market by market, customers return to our stores immediately. That's why this investment in wage and ensuring we staff our stores with the very best and most talented Green Apron partners we can is so important. This is the right time to make that investment, and we're confident that, that investment is going to return significant value to shareholders.

What we're seeing from a behavior standpoint are very similar behaviors from customers as we've had in prior quarters in pre-COVID. So routines are beginning to normalize. I think it speaks to a little bit around what Kevin said that as people become more mobile and particularly as we launched our fall campaign, normal routines entered with kids going back to school. 
Our peak hours have returned to pre-COVID behavior. They started in Q3 and continued into Q4. Morning daypart, very strong growth on a year-over-year basis as well as midday. And then into the afternoon, we're seeing a very high beverage and food attach. And really a shift to cold beverages that we talked about on the last earnings call. Cold beverages actually accounted for 75% of our beverage sales in the quarter. But food equally was strong. We were up 35%, espresso was up 34%, and we are seeing larger tickets come through as well.
So when you look at it from a store standpoint, we're very pleased with what the performance has been. First, in rural and suburban areas where our drive-throughs are most common, and which helped carry us through the COVID period and over the last 18 months were very strong, and they continue to show strong performance. Our urban stores have reached recovered status, and we're very encouraged by that. And then from a central business district, recovery has been slower, but it continues. For the second quarter in a row, central business district has returned to a positive comp performance as well.
And then the last thing I would just leave you with is what we're seeing on the convenience aspect of Starbucks and in particular, the growth of drive-thru and the growth of MOP. And we've done a lot of this during the trade area transformation work we did around the stores. Today, drive-through and MOP accounted for 70% of transactions, which is up 15% versus pre-pandemic levels. So we're very encouraged with the momentum that we've been able to build. And then obviously, with the investments that we're making in our people from a wage perspective, we expect to continue to increase staffing levels, continue to increase the training for our partners, and we are very, very well positioned for a very strong holiday season."

Obviously, like all other retailers, we're navigating a very complex and unprecedented environment. And yes, we have seen some staffing challenges in certain parts of the country. But I think from the results we've been able to deliver, it demonstrates our ability to navigate through these challenges, whether it be staffing, whether it be any of the supply chain challenges or any of the inflationary pressures. When you look at it, one of the things that we've done during this time as we've looked at adjusting the staffing levels and how do we manage through this is we've also taken action to adjust store operating hours. And when I say that, we've really looked at the evening daypart and pulled that back from an hours perspective, and that has enabled us to redeploy staffing into other stores where we need it. So we're continuing to do that.
In terms of your question around attrition, we are -- over the last year, approximately 70% of our hourly partners are new to Starbucks, and we continue to make investments in them from a training standpoint as we announced yesterday for all our partners. In addition, we've made investments now and we announced this yesterday around recruiting and adding recruiters, more recruiters into the regions to really focus and find and attract new talent. And then also, at the same time, we continue to work very closely with our partners to understand how we can continue to make them effective as well as reduce complexity in the store.
Complexity is a big thing for us, a big focus. And in that, we're looking at 2 things. Number one is driving automation in the stores. We've driven automated ordering for food and merchandise. It will be fully rolled out across all of our U.S. company-owned stores by the middle of this quarter. And then in addition, we continue to make investments in equipment. And from an equipment standpoint, whether it's Mastrena, whether it's our warming ovens or whether it's our cold brew system, all these equipment investments also make our partners more effective and free up time for them as they do their tasks.
So a lot of work going on. I'm very proud of the way in which our partners have navigated over the course of the last year, in particular. And as we've experienced some of these challenges, we feel as though we are in a very good spot in managing through this and we'll continue to make investments in this area. It's an area we're watching very closely."

I didn't know if there's sort of an underlying dynamic there outside of just the pandemic that might be playing out.
And then my follow-up was on the investments you're making holistically. I certainly understand why -- and to your point, the payoff has been visible. But why not sort of approach it more ratably as opposed to a lot upfront in the coming year just given the volatility in the operating environment and you're coming off of kind of obviously depressed earnings growth from the pandemic. Can you just talk about the timing and sort of the front-loading of it?"

My pleasure to take this question.

Actually, in Q4 last year -- last fiscal year, we were impacted by 3 waves of COVID resurgence in the entire quarter, which hit 42 cities in total across the quarter. Now what it means is that we saw elevated public health measures were implemented, which significantly reduced the customer mobility and disrupted the consumption patterns.
As you know, the borders also remained closed. And when we see -- what this impacts us, it means that over half of our stores were located in cities hit by local cases. And around 80% of our stores were operating under the elevated safety protocols at the peak of the resurgence. So that's why, weighed down by these headwinds, we in Q4 delivered an 11% revenue growth year-on-year, as Kevin pointed out. And that means in Q4, the comp was up -- minus 7% or minus 3% if we exclude the lapping over of FY '20 VAT relief. However, I must say that when we exclude the stores in the cities with local cases as well as transportation and tourist stores, our comp was actually positive, excluding the FY '20 VAT relief.
And more importantly, as Rachel also pointed out, our operating income was minus 1% versus last year. And if we actually exclude the one-off COVID-related benefits in FY '20, we actually achieved improved -- an improvement on the operating income. So this is really showing and demonstrating our team's operational agility.
So what I would say, Sara, we are seeing this pandemic dynamics happening in the market. But I'm confidently saying that this is short term and they're going to recover, we're going to recover. And this is why our focus right now is focused on what we can control to navigate all these short-term volatilities with our team's abilities while capturing the key opportunity by, for example, generating our store growth and elevating our digital engagement and our customer experience. I think this is all going to power our future growth and build sustainable competitive advantage of Starbucks China. Turning over to you."

Sara, let me take the second half of your question -- the back half of your question regarding these investments. And I just want to start by just sort of looking back at some of the strategic investments that we made through this pandemic",519,"Thank you, Leo. Sara, let me take the second half of your question -- the back half of your question regarding these investments. And I just want to start by just sort of looking back at some of the strategic investments that we made through this pandemic, starting with the decision we took in March of 2020 to give our partners economic certainty and pay them with no lapse, no furloughs, pay them while we closed all of our stores in the United States and just kept drive-throughs open, that was a big strategic decision. And we made that decision certainly staying true to our mission and values and taking care of our partners. But we also knew that as this pandemic began to ease and the recovery came back, our partners would be there, and they were.
And so why do you think we drove a faster recovery than people expected? Why did we drive a faster recovery than others in the industry? Answer, because we had the courage to make that strategic bet at that time in March of 2020. Then in June of 2020, we made the strategic decision to transform the trade area portfolio, the store portfolio in the United States. We basically repositioned nearly 600 stores to reposition them to better serve our customers and to give us better economics and to elevate the customer experience. That strategic decision -- we had the courage to make that. And that strategic decision today is giving us margin expansion, an elevated customer experience, and that, too, is contributing to our recovery.
I think about this decision on this wage investment the very same way we have in the past. We're going to stay true to our mission and values. And we know for certain, because we've seen it time and time again that when we invest in our partners, they rise to the occasion. And we also know this pandemic is transitory. We know vaccines work. We know that when we see markets, as governments just reduced restrictions, customers are back into our stores. So this is an opportunity for us to move now.
We can't wait. This is the time to take that market share that we know we can take, and that market share gain is permanent. That market share gain will build long-term customer engagement, long-term customer loyalty, and that market share gain will also drive operating leverage in our stores. In addition to that, we also know that we have a combination of in-store productivity innovation that's going to help offset that. We also have pricing power. And we're very thoughtful about how we take price, but we are taking price and we will continue to take price in an inflationary environment.
So we just believe this is the absolute right thing to do at this moment in time. And this investment, like the other 2 that I just described, will return value to shareholders. Because of that, that's why we reinforced our confidence with this $20 billion return to shareholders in the form of repurchases and buybacks. Thanks for your question."

I'll start with the perspective in terms of how we think about it within our guidance, and then I'll turn it over to John, and he can speak more to the specifics. But from a guidance standpoint, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, there's are about 200 basis points of margin dilution related to a combination of the supply chain pressures, inflation related to the supply chain pressures as well as hopping over government subsidies from prior year investments.
When we look at this past quarter, Q4, we had about a 90 basis point impact from inflationary pressures across the globe. It was a combination of logistics, labor as well as commodities. As we move into Q1 and Q2, we would expect that to increase, and that will start to settle in Q3 and Q4. But we concluded it as part of our guidance throughout the year because we really don't know when these are going to -- when these inflationary pressures will subside. And to that point, we've got some planned in this year. Of course, it could increase. We don't know what's going to happen, but we feel confident we've got at least an approach based on what we've seen in Q3 and Q4 this year, and we've accounted for that into next year. But it does impact us more meaningfully in Q1 and Q2 than what we would have originally thought, and then again settled in Q3 and Q4 from a margin perspective.

John, just real quick, on the inflationary impacts from a supply chain standpoint, we are seeing impacts, and that's evident by some of the inventory levels in our stores. But I feel very good about the way in which we've been able to navigate it. Those supply impacts began in mid-fiscal '21, and we would expect that they will continue into this coming year, all right? And what we're seeing is headwinds on commodity pricing, challenges around transportation and also the ability for our distributors and manufacturers to find labor to work in their factories and distribution centers.
A couple of things that we've done with the team is, number one, we've worked very closely to add new manufacturing and supply partners across our critical categories. And that is paying dividends for us, and we're seeing inventory ease in those categories, i.e., oat milk, breakfast sandwiches, egg bites, et cetera. We're building throughput and production capacity. We have suppliers adding new lines so that they can increase their safety stock. We work with suppliers to invest in wage for their workers, and many of them have done so.
And the last thing I would say that what we've done is we've really focused our production efforts on high-volume items. And some of those lower-volume items we pulled back on and deprioritized. So all that work and the actions that we've taken, we started early on as we began to see these challenges. We've addressed them. We're not out of the woods yet, but we feel very good about the path that we're on.
And as Kevin highlighted, we're very confident that as we head into holiday, our inventory position is very strong. And we'll continue to watch this very closely, and we'll continue to work with our supply network to ensure we've got an adequate supply of products in our stores.
And then the last thing I would say is that clearly, like other retailers, we're seeing customers come back into our stores at record levels. And the strength of our business is very strong. So we're very encouraged around the progress that we're making and the growth opportunities that we see going forward."

As we said, in December 2020, we're always evaluating markets, and you saw that the Korea joint venture, we did sell our 50% stake to a long-term license partners, who's been operating that market and will continue to operate that market. So we're always evaluating that. But we're happy with where we are today and I guess that's how -- that's what I would say.

But it is a dynamic thing because we're watching inflation and we really want to do this in a way that stays true to the thoughtfulness that we've always had in the past. And part of this is how do you take the right amount of price at the right time and not have customer attrition.
We're the share -- we want to grow share of customer occasions right now and so that's the balance that we strike. And it's really a fairly dynamic thing. So for us, we just -- I prefer not to say, here's what we built in, because I think we actually have more if we need it and we can take less if we don't need it.

So that combination of the $0.14 is what we're reducing this year's non-GAAP EPS of $3.24 down to an adjusted FY '21 non-GAAP EPS of $3.10. And then we're encouraging a growth rate off of that baseline of at least 10%.
And again, that 10% is given the dynamic operating environment that we're in, this unprecedented level of investments that we're taking as well as the pressures we still see related to the supply chain and the inflationary pressures as well as the pressures we're seeing from the COVID vaccine -- or from the COVID environment. We think the combination of that and the dynamic environment we're in that, that at least 10% growth reflects a lot of confidence and optimism for where we're headed, even though it's quite a challenging environment ahead."
