I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments and then ask Paul Donofrio, our CFO, to cover the details of the quarter. 
Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, just let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call that regards various elements of our financial results. Forward-looking statements are based on our management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties and particularly as we continue to operate during this pandemic period. Factors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and SEC filings that are available on the website. Information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in those materials. 
With that, I am happy to turn the call over to Brian. Take it away, Brian."

Before I pass the call to Paul to review the fourth quarter, I want to hit a few points. First, I want to provide some brief commentary on 2020 for the full year, then tal",2982,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us today. Before I pass the call to Paul to review the fourth quarter, I want to hit a few points. First, I want to provide some brief commentary on 2020 for the full year, then talk about what we see in the economy as we enter 2021 and then highlight some areas where I believe we made strong strategic progress that will drive momentum into 2021 and beyond. 
So starting on Slide 2. 2020 was a tough operating environment as you all know. In that period, we generated net income of nearly $18 billion or $1.87 in EPS and earned a return above our cost of capital. Our EPS was down 32% compared to 2019 driven by the impacts of coronavirus pandemic on the company and the economy. 
As you know, the Fed dropped rates to nearly 0. Longer rates also fell to historic lows. Loan demand surged and then waned as the panic subsided. That reduced net interest income. But as we told you last quarter that we believe that had likely bottomed in the third quarter of 2019. In fact, we saw a modest improvement this quarter, which Paul will cover later, despite the challenges from lower loans. 
Noninterest revenue declined slightly but included some interesting dynamics, highlighting diversity of Bank of America's model. Consumer fees declined driven by the activity levels of clients but also by higher account balances and customer accounts. That's a good thing for the economy going forward. 
Our business mix allowed us to benefit from more market-related activities in sales and trading, investment banking and investment brokerage in the wealth management businesses. Our full year revenue of $15 billion from sales and trading rose 17%, and we generated more than $7 billion of Investment Banking revenues this year, an increase of 27% over last year. 
Investment in brokerage revenue grew 5% to nearly $15 billion. Our expenses were higher as a result of the many costs associated with COVID and the support for our teams, our clients and our communities we serve. 
For a comparison of '19 and '20, 2019, 2020, 2020 included the third quarter addition of merchant service costs following dissolution of joint venture in the third quarter of 2019. These costs were always incurred as a net revenue deduction under joint venture accounting but now come through our expense line. 
Setting aside the elevated -- net elevated COVID-related expense and the change in accounting from merchant services, our teams continue to do a good job managing costs. And you'll see that later and Paul will talk about it and maintain a focus on user and productivity gains to fund all the investments we're making across the franchise and including increasing client flows. 
Expenses then remained relatively flat year-over-year. We expect them to be flat for '21 versus '20. 
Provision was higher as a result of reserves built given the macroeconomic deterioration experienced in the first part of the year. This also reflects the new CECL accounting rules, which were adopted as of January 1, 2020. But as the macroeconomic outlook improved, we released some reserves in the fourth quarter. 
As we look at share count, it declined 7% driven by the momentum in the share spot as we move in the second half of '19 and then in the first quarter of '20 prior to time of suspending share repurchases. With $36 billion excess capital above our common CET1 minimum requirements and excess capital above -- that's how reverting back to its normal calculation and completion of the CCAR exam, we'll once again begin repurchasing shares starting today. 
As you know, our first priority of use of all our capital is to grow our business organically. And we have funded growth in many areas and we have funded expanded minimum wages to $20 an hour for all our teammates. We expanded increased COVID benefits, and we take care of all that. Now we're looking to return as much capital to our shareholders as we're allowed and as our Board deems prudent. 
So you saw this morning the beginning of that in a separate press release that our Board has approved share repurchase in the first quarter of up to $3.2 billion, including shares issued to employees. This is in addition to maintaining our quarterly dividend $0.18 per quarter, and that accounts for a return of another $1.6 billion of capital. This is a maximum allowed in the Fed's guidelines established for the first quarter 2020 -- '21. 
Before -- beyond the first quarter, when we find out what the rules are, we'll continue to change our authorizations to reflect those rules. 
In summary, it was a good year given the circumstance the health crisis and the impact on the economy in the markets around the world. I want to thank my teammates for the hard work they did to serve our clients, to serve our communities and to help each other. 
As we begin the new year, let's turn to the economy -- that -- and what we see is the continued recovery occurring. Consumer spending by our clients and asset quality continue to improve. Our companies are highly liquid and generally in pretty good shape, except, of course, for those industries that are focused on that are most hard hit by COVID. 
As the economy continues to push ahead, these companies that are operating well will need operating capital, and we saw early signs of loan demand stabilizing as we went through the fourth quarter. As we all know, there's one priority, and that's to get everyone vaccinated so the health care crisis is behind us, and therefore, the economy can regain as straight. 
Our research team has just this past week has upgraded the 2021 forecast. And their view is that U.S. GDP growth will be around 5%, and global forecast for growth are 5.4%. Let me give you a snapshot of what we see in our customer data that supports some of our views for growth. 
On Slide 5 -- excuse me, Slide 3, you can see the consumer payments. With 66 million consumer and small business clients making payments across all our channels, we have a rich data set that provides a deep view of the U.S. consumer payment trends and small business trends. You can see this on Slide 3. 
This chart shows solid lines reflecting cumulative change for the year in spending. The dotted line shows the year-over-year change for each month during the year in total spending. 
Consumer payment activity began and ended the year very strong. In the first 2 months of the year, payments were up high single digits year-over-year. By April, given the early spread of the pandemic and the full across-the-board economic lockdowns, which is different in the status we are now, payments troughed then were down 25%. By early summer payments snapped back, and you can see that here with the reopening of the economies in many areas, the impact of government stimulus and increased unemployment. 
As some of those funds were depleted, it ran off. And the volumes, in fact, grew back to normal levels. We saw a slowdown in the rate of the recovery, but still spending managed to grow at a level consistent with prepandemic prior year periods. And as we entered the holiday period, lengthened -- which was lengthened here by the difference in activity of retail purchasing, the trends continue to strengthen. 
Total payments in the month of December hit a high of $304 billion, up 8% year-over-year driven by a record volume of holiday spending. Full year payments reached a new high of $3.1 trillion, up 2% year-over-year. 
So one of the things we have done here is provide a pie chart on the lower left-hand side of this page for an important reason. When we think about consumer spending, we think about all the ways consumers take money and consume and spend it to do things. This is outside of just debit and credit spending habits, which tend to get all the discussion because they're easier to track, quite frankly. But they represent 75% of transaction volume but only about 20% of the dollar volume of transactions. 
And you can see that they make up that smaller amount on the lower left-hand side. And especially as travel has -- travel and entertainment spending has shifted away, you've actually even seen debit spending outgrow credit spend. 
So 80% of the dollar volume of payments made by our consumers happens through person-to-person payments, person-to-business payments, ACH, wires and many other means, including cash taken out of the ATMs and spent and checks written. So in terms of transaction, you can see at the bottom right of this chart how the physical payments of cash and checks have moved to more digital forms, which creates operational efficiencies for us and has been a strategic initiative for many years and one that was moved forward by the crisis. 
Full year 2020 cash and check transaction volume fell to the lowest on record, down 21% as COVID accelerated the migration to digital card-based payments. 2021 has begun as a strong year for payments. The new stimulus checks started hitting customers' accounts in the first weeks of January. More than 11 million of those payments have hit our accounts, about $11 billion, and they flowed into the accounts, mostly from digital transfers to IRS. 
So how payments performed in the first half of January? The first half of January across all these payment types is up 6.7% from 2020. In good news, debit and credit is up 5.6%. Growth rates in total exceed pre-COVID levels of growth rates, and they are larger dollar amounts. So bigger dollars and faster growth rates. And that is with about 30% of the $600 payments being spent by our primary checking customers, so 70% more to be spent. 
As we move to Slide 4, we can see the activity on the commercial side. In the closing weeks of 2020, we continue to see some stabilization mainly driven by our middle market auto finance clients as inventories have gotten low and they rebuilt them. 
The chart on the top of Slide 5 reflects the total Global Banking loans across all segments, Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Investment Banking. As you recall, in the first quarter of the year, we experienced a heightened level of client draws on commitments as the panic borrowings set in with a crisis. And that was about 3 years of normalized commercial loan growth in a single month. 
And as you know, driven by capital markets for the high -- the GCIB clients and soft loan demand as people gathered their wits about them and the crisis moved to a different stage, we saw significant paydowns in loan balances. During the last 2 months of the year, we have seen more stable results that we hope can continue to turn into increased demand and growth as we look forward. 
In the chart on the bottom of the page, you can see that middle market in business banking, that core part of American economy has started to tip up, but the larger corporate loans continue to be affected by the markets and declines of the period. A decade operating on our responsible growth has prepared us well for this crisis and allowed us to remain focused on our customer and our well-understood risk framework to support them and the communities to live it. And in fact, we have basically reopened all the credit underwriting to the standards we have before the crisis. We are well positioned against this improving economic backdrop because of the progress we made in respect of our strategic initiatives over many years. 
Let's go to the next slide, Slide 5, and we'll talk about the strategic process. We can start with the consumer bank in the upper left. As you know, we retained the #1 deposit share position for retail deposits. That's $800 billion-plus and coupled with our wealth management deposits for American consumers, we have $1 trillion of deposits now. 
We grew average checking consumer deposits. We do have average consumer deposits $166 billion or 23%. $108 billion of that $166 billion was low-cost checking accounts. 
Customer satisfaction ended the year at a new all-time high. In 25 of the top 30 markets across America, representing over half the U.S. population, we now hold the #1, 2 or 3 leadership position including in 14 of those markets, the #1 position, which is twice as many markets as our closest peer. 
Another important consumer objective has been the focus on digital banking. Digital engagement expanded throughout all our businesses through the year. 69% of our consumer wealth management households are now digitally active, not just enrolled but active. That's up a couple hundred basis points in this deep penetration of customer base. 
These clients signed 9 billion times this year, representing double-digit growth. And they aren't just signing in for transactions or looking at their balances, they are also buying things. 42% of the sales this year were digital sales. It expanded in areas of checking account sales, auto sales and mortgage loan sales. 
Erica, our digital assistant, users grew 67% to 17 million. They spent 1.4 million hours, those clients did, talking to Erica, interacting with it. 
In Zelle, the payment -- the P2P payment form, B2B payment form also, is up 80% year-over-year. Remember those earlier payments charts on the early pages, there's a lot of growth ahead here, and it helps us move from higher-cost to lower-cost means. 
What's interesting about the Zelle customers is the depth of the relationship they have with us. On average, they have 3 accounts for Bank of America, an average checking balance of more than $9,000 and an average investment balances of $400,000 when they have investment balances. 
Now switching more broadly. Consumer investment balances, these are investment balances, the mass affluent in our consumer business, surpassed a major milestone and moved over $300 billion with 3 main accounts. We added 537 new funded accounts in 2020 in that mass affluent segment. That's up 27% year-over-year. 
In September, we rolled out Life Plan, our financial planning, that helps people prioritize their financial goals. And we've had 2 million-plus plans created already, one of the fastest rollouts of the product we've ever had. 
As we move to the wealth management group, we saw record client balances of $3.3 trillion through both market appreciation and flows. Product integration continued to improve as Merrill clients utilize our checking services, and their checking balances at Bank of America were up 28% year-over-year. And digital adoption by Merrill clients increased as 43% of the checks deposited by Merrill clients were done digitally. And the private bank clients continued a strong adoption with 70% of the checks they deposit were deposit digitally. 
Despite the virtual environment, the inability to have face-to-face meetings and inherently the wealth management business is a face-to-face business, household growth accelerated through the second half of the year, with Merrill adding 22,000 net new households and the private bank adding 1,800. And indeed, we had a record year for $10 million-plus new relationships across the 2 businesses. 
When we turn to our commercial businesses in Global Banking, we focused on virtual services for clients through the COVID crisis, increased our calling in for 60% this year in terms of numbers of engagements to clients. We saw a significant gain in our Investment Banking market share. 
Overall, in all areas, but particularly in our middle market clients, we've achieved a strong position this year. This has been a multiyear effort of hiring more and dedicating more bankers, investment bankers to partner with the commercial banking relationship managers across the country. 
Given the nature of clients and staff working from home, the digital capabilities we had allowed our client development to continue. We saw record sign-ons through our CashPro app. This is the way a commercial customer accesses the said app in the commercial cash management businesses. In December alone, 14 of 22 business days, there were over $1 billion moved on that app. This shows our clients' growing comfort level with the system. 
We reported record Investment Banking fees with 3 of our strongest quarters in the company's history this year. We improved our overall fee ranking to #3 as market share grew 70 basis points and is up for 2 consecutive years in a row. These market share improvements include our highest-ever shares in equity capital markets and M&A advice. 
In fixed income trading and markets business, the trading side of the house, we continue to enhance our e-trading capabilities, increase our systems being the ability of process customer trades even faster. In the equities trading side of the house, we had our best year since 2009 when the merger of Merrill and Bank of America took place, and we gained market share even while the market was growing in cash equities. We estimate we picked up 200 basis points in cash equities in the fourth quarter of '20 compared to the fourth quarter last year. 
The last point I want to mention is all the work we continue to do with our clients surround our activities in environmental, social and governance, including our award-winning proprietary research from the #1 research platform in the world as well as a sustainable financing initiatives, including green bonds, sustainable bonds and COVID-related bonds. Our team also committed $1 billion to further economic opportunities and address racial injustice in the middle of the COVID pandemic. We've made significant progress and made announcements over the last 6 months on the strong work done there. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Paul for the quarter."
19049,670919296,2175271,"Bank of America Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2021",2021-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 6 and 7 together. As I did last quarter, I will mostly compare our results relative to Q3 as most investors we speak with are more interested in our progress as we transverse the pandemic rather than i",2991,"Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 6 and 7 together. As I did last quarter, I will mostly compare our results relative to Q3 as most investors we speak with are more interested in our progress as we transverse the pandemic rather than in comparison to prepandemic periods. 
In Q4, we earned $5.5 billion or $0.59 per share, which compares to $4.9 billion or $0.51 a share in Q3. Compared to Q3, the earnings improvement was driven by lower provision expense as we released $828 million in reserves, nearly offsetting net charge-offs, which also declined. Also benefiting earnings, expenses declined $474 million from Q3 on lower litigation costs, and NII moved from Q3 -- from the Q3 trough. 
Noninterest income declined from Q3, but results across individual line items were mixed. First, the decline in other income was driven by seasonal client activity with respect to ESG investments, which created higher partnership losses but benefited our annual tax rate as I have described in previous discussions. 
Our tax rate for the year was 6%. If we adjust for the tax benefit of our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been roughly 21%. I point this out to emphasize that the full year tax benefits of the socially responsible investments more than offset the portion of losses recorded in other income throughout the year. 
Relative to Q3, noninterest income was also impacted by lower sales and trading, which typically slows from Q3 to Q4. But while sales and trading revenue was down linked quarter, year-over-year, it was up 7%. On the positive side, noninterest income benefited from higher asset management fees as the market improved, and we grew net new households again this year. 
And finally, we had another good quarter of Investment Banking revenue, which increased from both the strong Q3 levels and year-over-year. Also, when comparing net income to Q3, remember, the Q3 tax expense benefited by $700 million from the revaluation of our U.K. deferred tax asset. Finally, with respect to returns, note that our ROTCE was 11.7%, and our ROA approached 80 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 8. The balance sheet expanded $81 billion versus Q3 to $2.8 trillion in assets, total assets. The main point is that deposits are driving and funding substantially all of this growth. Deposits grew $93 billion in the quarter and are up $361 billion from Q4 '19. 
On the other hand, loans declined from Q3. With deposits up, loans down, excess liquidity is piling up in our cash and securities portfolios. Global Liquidity Sources are up $367 billion year-over-year and $84 billion just from Q3. In fact, global liquidity is up so much that it now exceeds total loans. 
With respect to regulatory ratios, the standardized approach remains binding at 11.9%, consistent with Q3. Shareholders' equity increased $4 billion as earnings were more than 3x the amount of common dividends paid, plus we issued preferred stock totaling $1.1 billion. But this was offset by higher RWA as we invested more cash in securities. 
At 11.9%, our CET1 ratio is 240 basis points above our minimum requirement, which equates to a $36 billion capital cushion. Our TLAC ratio also increased and remains comfortably above our requirements. 
Before leaving the balance sheet, as usual, we provide the charts on Slide 9 and 10 to show the historical trends with respect to average loans and deposits. For reference, we included these same charts on an end-of-period basis in the appendix. Overall, year-over-year, total loans are down 4%. And in the lines of business, they are down 2%. The decline year-over-year was driven by lower revolver utilization and other paydowns in commercial and by pullback in credit card activity. 
On Slide 10, we provide the same trends by line of business for deposits. Brian already made a number of points on deposits, and you can see the tremendous year-over-year growth in every line of business that led to 23% growth in deposits for the company. At $1.7 trillion in deposits, far surpasses any previous record for deposits. 
We believe our strong deposit growth reflects our customers' overall experience with us as we continue to innovate around digital capabilities as well as enhance our nationwide physical footprint of financial centers and ATMs, which have continued to prove important to customers and clients. I will just add that given historically low interest rates, our rate paid on deposits declined modestly linked quarter, and we are now lower than the rate paid to customers in 2015 before the Fed began raising rates. And I will point out that our interest cost on $1.7 trillion of deposits this quarter was only $159 million. 
Turning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q4 was $10.25 billion, $10.37 billion on an FTE basis. While net interest income declined 
[Audio Gap] 
from Q3. The improvement from Q3 was driven by the increased deployment of excess deposits into securities. Lower loan balances, lower reinvestment rates and modestly higher mortgage-backed securities, premium write-offs mitigated the improvement in NII. The net interest yield was relatively stable, declining only 1 basis point from the Q3 level. Note that given all the deposit growth plus the low starting point with respect to interest rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains quite large and is a good reminder of the value of these deposit relationships. 
Now with respect to NII, as we move into 2021, we offer the following perspectives. Our perspective on NIIs assume that net interest rates follow the forward curve and do not move lower than current levels and that the economy does not take a meaningful step backwards as a result of recent negative COVID developments. 
With that said, first, I would remind everyone that Q1 will be impacted by 2 less days of interest, which is a headwind of nearly $200 million. Also, seasonally, we would expect to see payments related to holiday spending result in lower card balances. We also have the continuing impact of higher-yielding assets maturing or paying off and being replaced with lower-yielding ones. Offsetting these headwinds, we currently intend to again invest a portion of our excess deposits, which continued to grow in Q4 into securities. 
Having listed those specific Q1 impacts, NII improvement more generally will depend on all the factors we are all focused on, such as loan growth, PPP loan forgiveness and PPP new originations and mortgage refinancings as well as mortgage-backed security payment speeds, which impact the write-off of bond premiums. Should those trends develop in a positive way, our NII and earnings will benefit. 
One final note on NII. We added a slide in the appendix that shows the difference between 2015 when short-term rates will last this low and today. The important difference between then and now is the growth in our balance sheet, which improved NII and the decline in expenses since then. 
Speaking of expenses and turning to Slide 12. Q4 expenses were $13.9 billion, $474 million lower than Q3. The decline was driven by a reduction in litigation expense. We also saw a reduction in COVID-related expenses, primarily those associated with processing claims for unemployment insurance, higher planned marketing costs across the firm and revenue-related processing and incentives mitigated the reductions. 
As we move into 2021, remember, Q1 will include seasonally higher payroll tax expense, which we estimate at roughly $350 million. Given the resurgence of COVID cases across the U.S. and in Europe, we estimate that $300 million to $400 million of net COVID-related expense remained in our Q4 expenses. 
We continue to work hard to lower these types of expense but not at the expense of the safety of our employees and customers. And outside of these COVID costs, we continue to manage expense tightly, using gains in productivity and digital activity to mitigate other increases. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. Our total net charge-offs this quarter were $881 million or 38 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs continued to benefit from years of responsible growth as well as government stimulus and loan deferral programs. 
A $91 million decline in net charge-offs was driven by lower credit card losses. The loss rate on credit card declined to a 20-year low of 206 basis points of average loans. Provision expense was $53 million, which not only reflected an improvement in macroeconomic projections but also incorporated uncertainties that remain in the economy due to the health crisis. These considerations resulted in an $838 million reserve release this quarter, reducing consumer loan reserves by $621 million and commercial by $207 million. 
Our allowance as a percentage of loans and leases ended the year at 2.04%, which is well above the 1.27% where we began the year following our day 1 adoption of the CECL accounting standards. 
With respect to key variables used in setting our reserve as done in previous quarters, we continued to include a number of downside scenarios. Based on our Q4 '20 weighting of those scenarios, GDP is forecasted to return to its Q4 '19 level in the early part of 2022. This improved by a couple of quarters relative to Q3. The weighting scenario also resulted in an unemployment rate at the end of 2021, consistent where it is today, just north of 6.5%. 
On Slide 14, break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. On the consumer front, COVID's effects on net charge-offs continued to remain benign. Overall, consumer net charge-offs declined 800 -- excuse me, declined $82 million driven by card losses and remained near historic lows. We experienced modest increases in delinquency and NPL levels but they remained low and were expected, given the deferral activity of customers. 
While expired deferrals drove consumer 30-day delinquency modestly higher compared to Q3, importantly, they remain 22% below the year-ago level. And consumer deferral balances continued to decline in Q4, ending the year at $8 billion. Moreover, balances are now mostly consumer real estate related with strong underlying collateral values. 
We added a slide in our appendix which further highlights delinquency trends for credit card. It shows a modest bulge of the expected deferral-related delinquencies moving their way through time and into the 90-plus bucket at year-end. As the bulge of deferral-related delinquencies passed through time periods, delinquencies receded. 
As an example, in Q4, 5-day delinquencies were down more than 30% year-over-year, which shows that after deferrals pass through this time period, delinquencies fell and stayed lower. So assuming net losses follow their historical relationship to delinquencies in the 90-plus day bucket and no other changes in card payment trends, we would expect card losses to be higher in Q1 but then decline in Q2. 
Moving to commercial. Net charge-offs were relatively flat to Q3 even as we sold some loans in affected industries, crystallizing losses but reducing risk. Overall, given the environment, the asset quality of our commercial loan book remained solid, and 89% of exposures were either investment-grade or collateralized. 
Our reservable criticized exposure metric continue to be the most heavily impacted by COVID and increased this quarter by $3 billion from Q3 led by downgrades -- downgraded exposures in commercial real estate, primarily hotels. Importantly, commercial NPLs, while up modestly, remained low at only 45 basis points of loans. 
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 15. Consumer Banking throughout 2020 has been the segment most impacted -- most heavily impacted by COVID. It bore the brunt of revenue disruption from interest rates, customer activity and fee waivers. Reserve building impacted provision expense, and expenses increased for PPP programs and protection of associates and customers. 
In Q4 compared to Q3, revenue, expenses and provision all improved. We earned 6 -- $2.6 billion in Consumer Banking in Q4 versus $2.1 billion in Q3. But with earnings still below prior year prepandemic levels, we know we still have plenty of room for improvement. 
Client momentum in this business continued to show strength around deposits and investment flows, while near-term loan growth was -- has been impacted by the decline in mortgage balances from heightened refinance activity. Looking at the components of the P&L linked quarter. Revenue growth included both higher NII and fees. 
Consumer fees reflected an increased level of holiday spending as well as higher investment account activity. Even as revenue moved higher, expenses moved modestly lower as we had a reduction in pandemic costs and continue to realize the benefits of a more digitally engaged customer base. 
As Brian noted, and as you can see on Slide 17, we saw improvement in digital enrollment. Most importantly, customer use of our digital capabilities increased with not only more sign-ons and higher digital sales but also more service fulfillment through digital channels as reflected by volume growth in both Erica and Zelle. 
Note also that both our rate paid and cost of deposit declined. Cost of deposits is now 135 basis points. In the past year, we added over 500,000 net new checking accounts, grew deposits 23% and dropped our cost of deposits 17 basis points even with the increase in costs associated with the pandemic. 
Let's skip to wealth management on Slide 18 and 19, and I will refer to both slides as I speak. Okay. Here again, the impact of lower rates on a large deposit book pressured NII, impacting an otherwise solid quarter with positive AUM flows, market appreciation and solid deposit and loan growth. 
Net income of $836 million improved 12% from Q3 as revenue growth and improvement in provision exceeded a modest increase in expense. With respect to revenue, NII grew driven by solid growth of both loans and deposits. And asset management fees grew to a new record on higher market valuations and solid flows. Expenses increased driven by revenue-related expense and investments in our sales force. 
Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank both continue to grow households as we remain a provider of choice for affluent clients. Client balances rose to a record of more than $3.3 trillion, up $302 billion year-over-year driven by higher market levels as well as positive client flows. 
Let's move to our Global Banking results on Slide 20. COVID has also heavily impacted Global Banking to lower interest rates, softer loan demand and higher credit costs. But here again, we saw improvement. 
The business earned nearly $1.7 billion in Q4, improving $751 million from Q3 driven by lower provision expense and improved revenue. On a year-over-year basis, earnings were $341 million lower driven by NII. 
Looking at revenue and comparing to Q3, revenue improvement was driven by higher Investment Banking fees as well as more leasing activity associated with our clients' ESG investments. Investment Banking fees for the company of nearly $1.9 billion grew 5% from Q3 and were up 26% year-over-year. As Brian noted, this performance led to improved market share overall and in a number of key products. 
Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $266 million in Q4 compared to a build in reserves of $555 million in Q3. Noninterest expense was higher compared to the linked quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting investments in the platform as well as support for the PPP program and also reflecting the recording of merchant services expense given the change in accounting versus the year-ago quarter. 
As Brian noted earlier, customers continued to appreciate the ease, safety and convenience of our digital banking capabilities. And usage continue to grow, helping defray other costs. 
We present some digital highlights on Slide 22. As noted earlier, loans declined but saw stabilization late in the quarter. And continuing to trend since Q2, the spread of the loan portfolio continued to tick higher at spreads on new originations on average exceeded the average spread of the portfolio. Average deposits increased [ 22% ] relative to Q3 as businesses remained highly liquid. 
Okay. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 23. Results reflect solid year-over-year improvement in revenue from sales and trading but declined from the robust levels of Q3. 
As I usually do, I will talk about segment results, excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was a small loss of $56 million. On that basis, Global Markets produced $834 million of earnings in Q4, a decline from the more robust trading in Q3 but up markedly from Q4 '19. 
Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was up 13% on higher sales and trading. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by higher activity-based costs for both trading and unemployment claims processing. Sales and trading contributed $3.1 billion to revenue, increasing 7% year-over-year driven by a 30% improvement in equities and a 5% decline in FICC. 
The strength in equities was driven by market volatility and investment repositioning, which drove client activity higher. The decline of FICC reflected strong credit trading performance, which was more than offset by declines across most macro products and mortgage trading. 
As Brian noted, the year-over-year performance of this business has been strong in every quarter of 2020. You can see that on Slide 24, and that produced strong segment returns of 15% on allocated capital for the year. 
Okay. Finally, on Slide 25, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $425 million. Compared to Q3, the decline in net income was driven primarily by the prior quarter's tax benefit of $700 million associated with our U.K. deferred tax asset. Revenue declined from Q3 driven by the accounting for wind and solar and other ESG investments. We also experienced some modest equity investment losses. Expenses declined from Q3 on lower litigation expense but were partially offset by higher marketing costs. For 2021, absent any changes in the current tax laws or unusual items, we would expect the effective tax rate to be in the low double digits driven by the level of ESG client activity relative to pretax earnings. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Lee and Brian for Q&A."

So you're right, but it's more affected by the revenue impact NII than it is by anything else in terms of expenses. Remember, we're saying net COVID cost of $300 million, $400 million. That includes offsetting against that all savings on travel and stuff. The gross costs are obviously much higher than that.

But I do think as you think about how you want to estimate and model NII and how it may unfold in '21, I think it's really sort of helpful to kind of review",391,"We didn't give specific guidance. I can give you a little more color on our perspectives on 2021. But I do think as you think about how you want to estimate and model NII and how it may unfold in '21, I think it's really sort of helpful to kind of review the progress we made in 2020. There's a lot of clues there. 
Remember, in Q1 of '20, interest rates fell to historically low levels. Short rates were down 150 and long rates were down 100 basis points plus loans declined significantly beginning in Q2 as demand weakened and larger companies assess the capital markets to pay down debt and build liquidity. 
In the past, when we've had situations like this where interest rates and/or loans have declined, it's always taken sort of several quarters to reach a point where renewed balance sheet growth was significant enough to compensate. We believe we found that NII bottom in Q3, and NII indeed moved higher in Q4. 
All else equal, day count, et cetera, it should become easier from here to grow NII. I think what helped us to start to grow again quickly in this crisis was the tremendous influx of deposits and our relatively recent confidence to invest the excess in securities instead of holding that excess in cash. So our continued investment of that cash in Q4 leads us to believe that we can offset the headwinds of low loan demand in the near term, recent reinvestment yields and 2 less days of NII in Q1, leaving NII relatively flat in Q1 versus Q4 before moving up through the balance of the year. 
Remember, in Q2 and Q3, we picked -- backed up those days of interest we lost in Q1. As Brian reviewed, we also saw commercial loans stabilize at the end of Q4, providing hope that increased loan demand will soon follow. 
Given that we expect some loan demand through the year and using the existing rate curve, which has steepened over the past 90 days, we would expect NII in Q4 '21, for example, to be much higher than Q1 '21. And when we get to the second half of '21, year-over-year quarterly comparisons to 2020 as well as the second half of '21 compared to the first half of '20 should be quite favorable."

But -- and then asset management, remember, we sold asset management because we believe that being the large distributor is the priority. So don't expect us -- we look at stuff from time to time like everybody does. But the way we're going to -- we built this company was organic growth and then delivering the capital back to the shareholders. 
And what's interesting, we'll see what the rules change. But remember that things like the SLR and the accommodations that were given, we didn't need, and we have plenty of SLR. It doesn't have any constraint. It doesn't become an issue. 
Like you said, even if you look at the SEB recalcs and stuff, we've got plenty over that. So we will be aggressive on returning capital. We got basically 2 months to return those $3 billion and change. We've got to return now. And then we'll see what the Fed instructions are, and then we'll get after it as we move forward.

And those delinquencies are -- that have sort of if you look at the other buckets, you'll see in the 90-plus bucket, they're higher than the other bucket. And that's the deferrals have worked their way from the 5-day to 30-day, the 30 to 60 days, they're now in the 90 bucket. And we can look back historically and say X percent of our delinquencies in the 90 bucket show up as losses in the next quarter because you get to 180 days. And so that's all we're seeing. 
But importantly, when you look behind the 90-day bucket, you don't see the same elevated levels. In fact, if you look at the 30-day bucket, you're down meaningfully year-over-year in terms of levels. So that's why we think Q2 will have to come down. Probably maybe have to is too strong a word. All else equal, what you think would come down. 
And the question is really, if you think about it, the people who have been affected by this health crisis, who are unemployed, who have been helped by stimulus, will this new stimulus carry them to the point where they get vaccinated and they get jobs back? And will we ever see those losses? Or will they just be pushed out into future periods?"

So if you look across the buckets and you look from the mid '19 to the end of '20, you can see the different delinquency buckets are all down. Even the 90-plus day's down in gross dollar amount year-over-year. 
But you can see that the -- what people thought was sort of the analogy of a pig through a snake is probably more of a mouse through the snake and that it went up, it's still a lower dollar amount. And then it would come back down because you move from the left to the right side of the page. And if you go back to Page 14, you can actually see in the top chart, the total charge-offs in consumer this quarter were 4 82. If you look in the red bars, which is the credit card, you can see that they're down dramatically year-over-year in terms of gross dollar amounts, and then this will bode well in the future. 
So when we talk about going back up, they're going up from a level that was much below where they have ever been historically in terms of dollar amounts. And so the last point you made, just so you have it, is that the unemployment rate in our customer base is below the unemployment rate in American society.

I can give you a lot more -- there's lots of things in that line item, but the volatility is often driven certainly in the fourth quarter by those partnership losses. 
Other things in that line are equity investment gains, gains and losses on the sale of debt securities. And there's some mark-to-market income in there on our FEA loans, our fair value loans and related hedges. So there's going to be volatility in there.

So the good news is, is that we're reverting to norm. 
And so in December, for example, we had 198,000 booked accounts in credit card, that -- 191,000. That's the highest really going back to pre-COVID days, but we were running 300,000 back then. So we got some work to do to get it back to the full amount on the card side, for example. 
In terms of mortgage, again, we are careful there, but also we're conservative on rates, and we gone to look at that. So we booked about $7 billion in the secured lending side, including mortgage in the core consumer business. And so we feel better about that. Auto picked back up, but home equity is down to $0.5 billion a quarter or something like that when it was running 3 or something. 
So we've got some room to go. But the good news is the card is stable, the balances are sort of stabilized. At the 85 million, you have some seasonality, but at least they stabilize there. And then the mortgage looks like we're picking back up a bit as we've made some adjustments and gone back to the more normalized underwriting, and auto has been strong. So we'll see it play out. 
But you're  right, we had to pull back and have lost about half the credit card volume on a given month. And we're picked back up from 150 at the low point to 200, but we've got some work to do."

So let me start with the commercial side. And this is about sort of the relationship side of commercial business, Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Investment Banking. Basically, in March, we stopped prospecting, frankly,",492,"Yes. So let me start with the commercial side. And this is about sort of the relationship side of commercial business, Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Investment Banking. Basically, in March, we stopped prospecting, frankly, because it was sort of impossible to do plus you want to make sure you understood the portfolios. We've done quarterly portfolio. Every single loan going through to make sure the ratings are right, make sure we understood with the customer to make sure we understood whether they're going to need covenant waivers. That over the course of the time here is sort of the group of customers where in the industries that Paul talked about that are difficult. And the rest of the customers are solid, in good shape. And frankly, their credit has been improving as we looked at it by quarter. 
And so about 4 months ago, we moved into prospecting with very narrow list of prospects for Business Bank and go commercial banking, think for middle market and upper end of small business across all our markets. With them recently, we flipped, and they can go back to full prospecting except for limited industries that you'd expect. 
On the small business side, because of the nature of the business, it was a little more dramatic, and we've opened back up. And we're getting -- we're up, I think, in the fourth quarter to give you a sense, we were up 50% in terms of the originations quarter-over-quarter. But we're still -- we're up a lot more than that, more than 50%. We're still down 50% year-over-year [ or ] 100-plus percent in quarter linked quarter, I think. And so new commitments up 135%, but year-over-year still down 47%. So that shows you that it's coming through, and we will see that happen in the small business side. So that was probably the slowest because it's with there the most risk. And so -- that's the commercial side. 
When you go to the consumer side, the reality was we basically -- we stayed on LTVs on the commercial -- on the consumer mortgage side. We basically stopped with the FICO requirements, we slowed down and do the market dynamics, home equity slowed down. Auto, we went back out more quickly just because of the secured nature, short-term nature of it. So we felt good about that and probably we're always super prime and stayed there. 
But it's really what's changed in consumer in the last several -- last few months has been the move, and we're back to probably 80%, 90% of the ability to generate that we had. We were down probably 20% and we move back up, and so we'll see that flow through. But it was really just until you had some clarity where this thing was going, you had to be careful for a while. So that bodes well to economic activity and loan growth in the future."

I don't -- I'm not sure we -- but I'm not sure we give the exact methodology, but let me just give you a sense.

I don't -- I'm not sure we -- but I'm not sure we give the exact methodology, but let me just give you a sense. If you take our reserve setting weighting, in other words, what we set the reserve by December, for year-end 2020 because we said it before the statistics, the unemployment rate was 7.8%. And for year-end 2021, it was 6.6%. And obviously, the actual was 100 basis points plus below that. 
So you would expect, as you have more confidence that the forward path is into a narrow range and the forward probability, two things are going to happen as you go forward. One is the sheer dollar volumes of site activity has changed, and so you're dealing with less in terms of charge-offs and things like that, which gives you confidence of where the path is. 
But most importantly, as you think about real reserve setting, lifetime reserves is that the economic assumptions are clarifying, and the end of the COVID era is clarified with a vaccine. And as we see that, you'll see the uncertainty come down pretty quickly on the other side of that when that shows up in our assumptions. So we weighted downside nearly 50% of the elements. That weighting will come down over time. And so when that comes down over time, you'll see the reserves releases come away from that. 
The second thing is, as the duration of the rest of the crisis comes in with more certainty, i.e., more people vaccinated, you also see the lifetime calculation include the other side of the river to a bigger, bigger portion, and so that will drive it. So both of those things will change it. 
And as Paul said earlier, if you look at our underlying economics team, they have the economy crossing over where it was before and growing past in terms of share size at the end of this year and our reserve setting takes it into next year and things like that. So we are using a more conservative case, which implies judgment."

And so we welcome an industry which has a great consumer-oriented path to it because that's how we run our company. We've been doing it that way for a long time. 
So our fees on overdrafts have been declining really as a percentage of fees every year and probably in gross dollar amounts most years. And so we're not depending on those largely because of how we run the business, being core customer checks, 90% plus the primary checking account in the household. And therefore, they tend to overdraft less. And this year with the stimulus and stuff, it's even lower. 
So we welcome -- we introduced this new loan product that basically gives a right to get an emergency loan for $5. And that is our response to allowing our customers who have been with us for a while to access their money for really no interest at all and use it in anticipation of paying us back quickly. These are things we've done to really help our retail customer segment, which is the mass market customer segment on manage their lives effectively. And so we don't have a business build in those kind of fee structures, and that's we're not -- that's why we welcome any regulation it brings the market to us because as the most efficient and the best brand and the best customer service, the largest franchise, that's fine with us."

Before I pass the call to Paul to review the fourth quarter, I want to hit a few points. First, I want to provide some brief commentary on 2020 for the full year, then talk about what we see in the economy as we enter 2021 and then highlight some areas where I believe we made strong strategic progress that will drive momentum into 2021 and beyond.  
So starting on Slide 2. 2020 was a tough operating environment, as you all know. In that period, we generated net income of nearly $18 billion or $1.87 in EPS and earned a return above our cost of capital. Our EPS was down 32% compared to 2019 driven by the impacts of coronavirus pandemic on the company and the economy.  
As you know, the Fed dropped rates to nearly 0. Longer rates also fell to historic lows. Loan demand surged and then waned as the panic subsided. That reduced net interest income. But as we told you last quarter, that we believed [ that NII ] had likely bottomed in the third quarter of 2019. In fact, we saw a modest improvement this quarter, which Paul will cover later, despite the challenges from lower loans.  
Noninterest revenue declined slightly but included some interesting dynamics, highlighting diversity of Bank of America's model. Consumer fees declined driven by the activity levels of clients but also by higher account balances and customer accounts. That's a good thing for the economy going forward.  
Our business mix allowed us to benefit from more market-related activities in sales and trading, investment banking and investment brokerage in the wealth management businesses. Our full year revenue of $15 billion from sales and trading rose 17%, and we generated more than $7 billion of Investment Banking revenues this year, an increase of 27% over last year. Investment and brokerage revenue grew 5% to nearly $15 billion. Our expenses were higher as a result of the many costs associated with COVID and the support for our teams, our clients and our communities we serve. 
For a comparison of '19 and '20, 2019 and 2020, 2020 included the third quarter addition of merchant service costs following dissolution of joint venture in the third quarter of 2019. These costs were always incurred as a net revenue deduction under joint venture accounting but now will come through our expense line.  
Setting aside the elevated -- net elevated COVID-related expense and the change in accounting for merchant services, our teams continued to do a good job managing costs, and you'll see that later and Paul will talk about it; and maintained a focus on using productivity gains to fund all the investments we're making across the franchise, and including increasing client flows. Expenses then remained relatively flat year-over-year. We expect them to be flat for '21 versus '20.  
Provision was higher as a result of reserves built given the macroeconomic deterioration experienced in the first part of the year. This also reflects the new CECL accounting rules which were adopted as of January 1, 2020. But as the macroeconomic outlook improved, we released some reserves in the fourth quarter.  
As we look at share count, it declined 7% driven by the momentum in shares bought as we moved in the second half of '19 and then in the first quarter of '20 prior to time of suspending share repurchases. With $36 billion in excess capital above our common CET1 minimum requirements and excess capital above -- SLR reverting back to its normal calculation and completion of the CCAR exam, we'll once again begin repurchasing shares starting today.  
As you know, our first priority of use of all our capital is to grow our business organically. And we have funded growth in many areas and we have funded expanded minimum wages to $20 an hour for all our teammates, we expanded increased COVID benefits, and we've taken care of all that. Now we're looking to return as much capital to our shareholders as we're allowed and as our Board deems prudent.  
So you saw this morning the beginning of that in a separate press release, that our Board has approved share repurchase in the first quarter of up to $3.2 billion, including shares issued to employees. This is in addition to maintaining our quarterly dividend $0.18 per quarter, and that accounts for a return of another $1.6 billion of capital. This is the maximum allowed under Fed's guidelines established for the first quarter 2020 -- '21. Before -- beyond the first quarter, we -- when we find out what the rules are, we'll continue to change our authorizations to reflect those rules.  
In summary, it was a good year given the circumstance of the health crisis and the impact on the economy and the markets around the world. I want to thank my teammates for the hard work they did to serve our clients, to serve our communities and to help each other.  
As we begin the new year, let's turn to the economy -- that -- and what we see is the continued recovery occurring. Consumer spending by our clients and asset quality continue to improve. Our companies are highly liquid and generally in pretty good shape, except of course for those industries that are focused on -- that are most hard hit by COVID. As the economy continues to push ahead, these companies that are operating well will need operating capital, and we saw early signs of loan demand stabilizing as we went through the fourth quarter. 
As we all know, there's one priority, and that's to get everyone vaccinated so the health care crisis is behind us, and therefore, the economy can regain its strength.  
Our research team has, just this past week, has upgraded the 2021 forecast. And their view is that U.S. GDP growth will be around 5% and global forecast for growth are 5.4%. Let me give you a snapshot of what we see in our customer data that supports some of our views for growth. 
On Slide 5 -- excuse me, Slide 3, you can see the consumer payments. With 66 million consumer and small business clients making payments across all our channels, we have a rich data set that provides a deep view of the U.S. consumer payment trends and small business trends. You can see this on Slide 3. This chart shows solid lines, reflecting cumulative change for the year in spending. The dotted line shows the year-over-year change for each month during the year in total spending. 
Consumer payment activity began and ended the year very strong. In the first 2 months of the year, payments were up high single digits year-over-year. By April, given the early spread of the pandemic and the full across-the-board economic lockdowns, which is different in the status we are now, payments troughed then were down 26%. By early summer, payments snapped back, and you can see that here, with the reopening of the economies in many areas, the impact of government stimulus and increased unemployment. 
As some of those funds were depleted and ran off, and the volumes in fact grew back to normal levels, we saw a slowdown in the rate of the recovery. But still, spending managed to grow at a level consistent with pre-pandemic prior year periods. And as we entered the holiday period, lengthened -- which was lengthened here by the difference in activity of retail purchasing, the trends continue to strengthen. Total payments in the month of December hit a high of $304 billion, up 8% year-over-year, driven by a record volume of holiday spending. Full year payments reached a new high of $3.1 trillion, up 2% year-over-year. 
So one of the things we have done here is provide a pie chart on the lower left-hand side of this page for an important reason. When we think about consumer spending, we think about all the ways consumers take money and consume -- and spend it to do things. This is outside of just debit and credit spending habits, which tend to get all the discussion because they're easier to track, quite frankly. But they represent 75% of transaction volume but only about 20% of the dollar volume of transactions. And you can see that they make up that smaller amount on the lower left-hand side. And especially, as travel has -- travel and entertainment spending has shifted away, you've actually even seen debit spending outgrow credit spend. 
So 80% of the dollar volume of payments made by our consumers happens through person-to-person payments, person-to-business payments, ACH, wires and many other means, including cash taken out of the ATMs and spent and checks written. So in terms of transaction, you can see at the bottom right of this chart, how the physical payments of cash and checks have moved to more digital forms, which creates operational efficiencies for us and has been a strategic initiative for many years and one that was moved forward by the crisis. Full year 2020 cash and check transaction volume fell to the lowest on record, down 21%, as COVID accelerated the migration to digital card-based payments. 
2021 has begun as a strong year for payments. The new stimulus checks started hitting customers' accounts in the first weeks of January. More than 11 million of those payments have hit our accounts, about $11 billion, and they flowed into the accounts, mostly from digital transfers to IRS.  
So how payments performed in the first half of January? The first half of January, across all these payment types, is up 6.7% from 2020. In good news, debit and credit is up 5.6%. Growth rates in total exceed pre-COVID levels of growth rates, and they are larger dollar amounts. So bigger dollars and faster growth rates. And that is with about 30% of the $600 payments being spent by our primary checking customers, so 70% more to be spent. 
As we move to Slide 4, we can see the activity on the commercial side. In the closing weeks of 2020, we continued to see some stabilization mainly driven by our middle market auto finance clients as inventories have gotten low and they rebuilt them. 
The chart on the top of Slide 5 reflects the total Global Banking loans across all segments: Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Investment Banking. As you recall, in the first quarter of the year, we experienced a heightened level of client draws on commitments as the panic-borrowing set in with the crisis. And that was about 3 years of normalized commercial loan growth in a single month. And as you know, driven by capital markets for the high -- the G-SIB clients and soft loan demand as people gathered their wits about them and the crisis moved to a different stage, we saw significant paydowns in loan balances. 
During the last 2 months of the year, we have seen more stable results that we hope can continue to turn into increased demand and growth as we look forward. In the chart on the bottom of the page, you can see that middle market and Business Banking, that core part of the American economy, has started to tip up, but the larger corporate loans continue to be affected by the markets and declines of the period. 
A decade of operating under our responsible growth principles has prepared us well for this crisis and allowed us to remain focused on our customer on our well-understood risk framework and support them and the communities they live in. And in fact, we have basically reopened all the credit underwriting to the standards we have before the crisis. We are well positioned against this improving economic backdrop because of the progress we made in respect of our strategic initiatives over the many years. 
Let's go to the next slide, Slide 5, and we'll talk about the strategic process. We can start with the Consumer Bank in the upper left. As you know, we retained the #1 deposit share position for retail deposits. That's $800 billion-plus. And coupled with our Wealth Management deposits for American consumers, we have $1 trillion of deposits now. We grew average checking consumer deposits -- we grew our average consumer deposits $166 billion or 23%. $108 billion of that $166 billion was low-cost checking accounts. 
Customer satisfaction ended the year at a new all-time high. In 25 of the top 30 markets across America, representing over half the U.S. population, we now hold the #1, 2 or 3 leadership position; including in 14 of those markets, the #1 position, which is twice as many markets as our closest peer. 
Another important consumer objective has been the focus on digital banking. Digital engagement expanded throughout all our businesses through the year. 69% of our consumer and wealth management households are now digitally active, not just enrolled but active. That's up a couple hundred basis points in this deep penetration of the customer base. These clients signed 9 billion times this year, representing double-digit growth. And they aren't just signing in for transactions or looking at their balances, they are also buying things. 42% of the sales this year were digital sales. It expanded in areas of checking account sales, auto sales and mortgage loan sales. 
Erica, our digital assistant, users grew 67% to 17 million. They spent 1.4 million hours, those clients did, talking to Erica, interacting with it. 
In Zelle, the payment -- the P2P payment form, P2B payment form also, is up 80% year-over-year. Remember those earlier payments charts on the early pages. There's a lot of growth ahead here, and it helps us move from higher-cost to lower-cost means. What's interesting about the Zelle customers is the depth of the relationship they have with us. On average, they have 3 accounts with Bank of America, an average checking balance of more than $9,000 and an average investment balances of $400,000 when they have investment balances. 
Now switching more broadly. Consumer investment balances, these are investment balances, the mass affluent in our consumer business, surpassed a major milestone and moved over $300 billion with 3 million accounts. We added 537 new funded accounts in 2020 in that mass affluent segment. That's up 27% year-over-year. 
In September, we rolled out Life Plan, our financial planning that helps people prioritize their financial goals. And we've had 2 million-plus plans created already, one of the fastest rollouts of product we've ever had. 
As we move to the Wealth Management group, we saw record client balances of $3.3 trillion through both market appreciation and flows. Product integration continued to improve as Merrill clients utilized our checking services, and their checking balances at Bank of America were up 28% year-over-year. And digital adoption by Merrill clients increased as 43% of the checks deposited by Merrill clients were done digitally. In the Private Bank, clients continued a strong adoption, with 70% of the checks they deposited were deposit digitally. 
Despite the virtual environment, the inability to have face-to-face meetings, and inherently, the Wealth Management business is a face-to-face business, household growth accelerated through the second half of the year, with Merrill adding 22,000 net new households and the Private Bank adding 1,800. And indeed, we had a record year for $10 million-plus new relationships across the 2 businesses.  
When we turn to our commercial businesses. In Global Banking, we focused on virtual services for clients through the COVID crisis, increased our calling efforts 60% this year in terms of numbers of engagements with clients. We saw a significant gain in our Investment Banking market share. Overall, in all areas, but particularly in our middle market clients, we've achieved a strong position this year. This has been a multiyear effort of hiring more and dedicating more bankers, investment bankers, to partner with the Commercial Banking relationship managers across the country. 
Given the nature of clients and staff working from home, the digital capabilities we had allowed our client development to continue. We saw record sign-ons through our CashPro app. This is the way a commercial customer accesses that app in the commercial cash management businesses. In December alone, 14 of 22 business days, there were over $1 billion moved on that app. This shows our clients' growing comfort level with the system.  
We reported record Investment Banking fees with 3 of our strongest quarters in the company's history this year. We improved our overall fee ranking to #3 as market share grew 70 basis points and is up for 2 consecutive years in a row. These market share improvements include our highest-ever shares in equity capital markets and M&A advice.  
In fixed income trading and markets business, the trading side of the house, we continue to enhance our e-trading capabilities, increase our system speed and ability to process customer trades even faster. In the equities trading side of the house, we had our best year since 2009 when the merger of Merrill and Bank of America took place, and we gained market share even while the market was growing in cash equities. We estimate we picked up 200 basis points in cash equities in the fourth quarter of '20 compared to the fourth quarter last year. 
The last point I want to mention is all the work we continue to do with our clients surround our activities in environmental, social and governance, including our award-winning proprietary research from the #1 research platform in the world as well as the sustainable financing initiatives, including green bonds, sustainable bonds and COVID-related bonds. Our team also committed $1 billion to further economic opportunities and address racial injustice in the middle of the COVID pandemic. We've made significant progress and made announcements over the last 6 months on the strong work done there.  
And with that, let me turn it over to Paul for the quarter."
19049,670919296,2175557,"Bank of America Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2021",2021-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 6 and 7 together. As I did last quarter, I will mostly compare our results relative to Q3 as most investors we speak with are more interested in our progress as we transverse the pandemic rather than i",2991,"Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 6 and 7 together. As I did last quarter, I will mostly compare our results relative to Q3 as most investors we speak with are more interested in our progress as we transverse the pandemic rather than in comparison to pre-pandemic periods. 
In Q4, we earned $5.5 billion or $0.59 per share, which compares to $4.9 billion or $0.51 a share in Q3. Compared to Q3, the earnings improvement was driven by lower provision expense as we released $828 million in reserves, nearly offsetting net charge-offs, which also declined. Also benefiting earnings, expenses declined $474 million from Q3 on lower litigation costs, and NII moved from Q3 -- from the Q3 trough. Noninterest income declined from Q3, but results across individual line items were mixed. 
First, the decline in other income was driven by seasonal client activity with respect to ESG investments, which created higher partnership losses but benefited our annual tax rate, as I have described in previous discussions. Our tax rate for the year was 6%. If we adjust for the tax benefit of our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been roughly 21%. I point this out to emphasize that the full year tax benefits of the socially responsible investments more than offset the portion of losses recorded in other income throughout the year.  
Relative to Q3, noninterest income was also impacted by lower sales and trading, which typically slows from Q3 to Q4. But while sales and trading revenue was down linked-quarter, year-over-year, it was up 7%. On the positive side, noninterest income benefited from higher asset management fees as the market improved. And we grew net new households again this year. 
And finally, we had another good quarter of Investment Banking revenue, which increased from both the strong Q3 levels and year-over-year. Also, when comparing net income to Q3, remember, the Q3 tax expense benefited by $700 million from the revaluation of our U.K. deferred tax asset. Finally, with respect to returns, note that our ROTCE was 11.7%, and our ROA approached 80 basis points. 
Moving to Slide 8. The balance sheet expanded $81 billion versus Q3 to $2.8 trillion in assets, total assets. The main point is that deposits are driving and funding substantially all of this growth. Deposits grew $93 billion in the quarter and are up $361 billion from Q4 '19. On the other hand, loans declined from Q3. With deposits up, loans down, excess liquidity is piling up in our cash and securities portfolios. Global liquidity sources are up $367 billion year-over-year and $84 billion just from Q3. In fact, global liquidity is up so much that it now exceeds total loans. 
With respect to regulatory ratios, the standardized approach remains binding at 11.9%, consistent with Q3. Shareholders' equity increased $4 billion as earnings were more than 3x the amount of common dividends paid, plus, we issued preferred stock totaling $1.1 billion. But this was offset by higher RWA as we invested more cash in securities. At 11.9%, our CET1 ratio is 240 basis points above our minimum requirement, which equates to a $36 billion capital cushion. Our TLAC ratio also increased and remains comfortably above our requirements. 
Before leaving the balance sheet, as usual, we provide the charts on Slide 9 and 10 to show the historical trends with respect to average loans and deposits. For reference, we included these same charts on an end-of-period basis in the appendix. Overall, year-over-year, total loans are down 4%. And in the lines of business, they are down 2%. The decline year-over-year was driven by lower revolver utilization and other paydowns in commercial and by pullback in credit card activity. 
On Slide 10, we provide the same trends by line of business for deposits. Brian already made a number of points on deposits, and you can see the tremendous year-over-year growth in every line of business that led to 23% growth in deposits for the company. At $1.7 trillion in deposits, far surpasses any previous record for deposits. We believe our strong deposit growth reflects our customers' overall experience with us as we continue to innovate around digital capabilities as well as enhance our nationwide physical footprint of financial centers and ATMs, which have continued to prove important to customers and clients. 
I will just add that given historically low interest rates, our rate paid on deposits declined modestly linked-quarter, and we are now lower than the rate paid to customers in 2015 before the Fed began raising rates. And I will point out that our interest cost on $1.7 trillion of deposits this quarter was only $159 million. 
Turning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q4 was $10.25 billion, $10.37 billion on an FTE basis, while net interest income declined 
[Audio Gap]  
Million from Q3. The improvement from Q3 was driven by the increased deployment of excess deposits into securities. Lower loan balances, lower reinvestment rates and modestly higher mortgage-backed securities, premium write-offs mitigated the improvement in NII. The net interest yield was relatively stable, declining only 1 basis point from the Q3 level. Note that given all the deposit growth plus the low starting point with respect to interest rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains quite large and is a good reminder of the value of these deposit relationships. 
Now with respect to NII. As we move into 2021, we offer the following perspectives. Our perspective on NIIs assume that net interest rates follow the forward curve and do not move lower than current levels and that the economy does not take a meaningful step backwards as a result of recent negative COVID developments. With that said, first, I would remind everyone that Q1 will be impacted by 2 less days of interest, which is a headwind of nearly $200 million. Also, seasonally, we would expect to see payments related to holiday spending result in lower card balances. We also have the continuing impact of higher-yielding assets maturing or paying off and being replaced with lower-yielding ones. Offsetting these headwinds, we currently intend to again invest a portion of our excess deposits, which continued to grow in Q4, into securities. 
Having listed those specific Q1 impacts, NII improvement more generally will depend on all the factors we are all focused on, such as loan growth, PPP loan forgiveness and PPP new originations and mortgage refinancings as well as mortgage-backed security payment speeds which impact the write-off of bond premiums. Should those trends develop in a positive way, our NII and earnings will benefit.  
One final note on NII. We added a slide in the appendix that shows the difference between 2015 when short-term rates were last this low and today. The important difference between then and now is the growth in our balance sheet which improved NII and the decline in expenses since then. 
Speaking of expenses and turning to Slide 12. Q4 expenses were $13.9 billion, $474 million lower than Q3. The decline was driven by a reduction in litigation expense. We also saw a reduction in COVID-related expenses, primarily those associated with processing claims for unemployment insurance. Higher planned marketing costs across the firm and revenue-related processing and incentives mitigated the reductions. As we move into 2021, remember, Q1 will include seasonally higher payroll tax expense, which we estimate at roughly $350 million. 
Given the resurgence of COVID cases across the U.S. and in Europe, we estimate that $300 million to $400 million of net COVID-related expense remained in our Q4 expenses. We continue to work hard to lower these types of expense but not at the expense of the safety of our employees and customers. And outside of these COVID costs, we continue to manage expense tightly, using gains in productivity and digital activity to mitigate other increases. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. Our total net charge-offs this quarter were $881 million or 38 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs continued to benefit from years of responsible growth as well as government stimulus and loan deferral programs. A $91 million decline in net charge-offs was driven by lower credit card losses. The loss rate on credit card declined to a 20-year low of 206 basis points of average loans. Provision expense was $53 million, which not only reflected an improvement in macroeconomic projections, but also incorporated uncertainties that remain in the economy due to the health crisis. These considerations resulted in an $838 million reserve release this quarter, reducing consumer loan reserves by $621 million and commercial by $207 million. Our allowance as a percentage of loans and leases ended the year at 2.04%, which is well above the 1.27% where we began the year following our day 1 adoption of the CECL accounting standards. 
With respect to key variables used in setting our reserve. As done in previous quarters, we continued to include a number of downside scenarios. Based on our Q4 '20 weighting of those scenarios, GDP is forecasted to return to its Q4 '19 level in the early part of 2022. This improved by a couple of quarters relative to Q3. The weighting scenario also resulted in an unemployment rate at the end of 2021 consistent where it is today, just north of 6.5%. 
On Slide 14, we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. On the consumer front, COVID's effects on net charge-offs continued to remain benign. Overall, consumer net charge-offs declined 800 -- excuse me, declined $82 million driven by card losses and remained near historic lows. We experienced modest increases in delinquency and NPL levels, but they remained low and were expected, given the deferral activity of customers. 
While expired deferrals drove consumer 30-day delinquency modestly higher compared to Q3, importantly, they remain 22% below the year-ago level. And consumer deferral balances continued to decline in Q4, ending the year at $8 billion. Moreover, balances are now mostly consumer real estate-related with strong underlying collateral values. 
We added a slide in our appendix which further highlights delinquency trends for credit card. It shows a modest bulge of the expected deferral-related delinquencies moving their way through time and into the 90-plus bucket at year-end. As the bulge of deferral-related delinquencies passed through time periods, delinquencies receded. As an example, in Q4, 5-day delinquencies were down more than 30% year-over-year, which shows that after deferrals passed through this time period, delinquencies fell and stayed lower. So assuming net losses follow their historical relationship to delinquencies in the 90-plus day bucket and no other changes in card payment trends, we would expect card losses to be higher in Q1 but then decline in Q2. 
Moving to commercial. Net charge-offs were relatively flat to Q3 even as we sold some loans in affected industries, crystallizing losses but reducing risk. Overall, given the environment, the asset quality of our commercial loan book remained solid, and 89% of exposures were either investment-grade or collateralized. Our reservable criticized exposure metric continue to be the most heavily impacted by COVID and increased this quarter by $3 billion from Q3 led by downgrades -- downgraded exposures in commercial real estate, primarily hotels. Importantly, commercial NPLs, while up modestly, remained low at only 45 basis points of loans. 
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 15. Consumer Banking throughout 2020 has been the segment most impacted -- most heavily impacted by COVID. It bore the brunt of revenue disruption from interest rates, customer activity and fee waivers. Reserve-building impacted provision expense, and expenses increased for PPP programs and protection of associates and customers. 
In Q4 compared to Q3, revenue, expenses and provision all improved. We earned 6 -- $2.6 billion in Consumer Banking in Q4 versus $2.1 billion in Q3. But with earnings still below prior year pre-pandemic levels, we know we still have plenty of room for improvement. Client momentum in this business continued to show strength around deposits and investment flows, while near-term loan growth was -- has been impacted by the decline in mortgage balances from heightened refinance activity. 
Looking at the components of the P&L, linked-quarter. Revenue growth included both higher NII and fees. Consumer fees reflected an increased level of holiday spending as well as higher investment account activity. Even as revenue moved higher, expenses moved modestly lower as we had a reduction in pandemic costs and continued to realize the benefits of a more digitally engaged customer base. 
As Brian noted, and as you can see on Slide 17, we saw improvement in digital enrollment. Most importantly, customer use of our digital capabilities increased with not only more sign-ons and higher digital sales but also more service fulfillment through digital channels as reflected by volume growth in both Erica and Zelle. 
Note also that both our rate paid and cost of deposit declined. Cost of deposits is now 135 basis points. In the past year, we added over 500,000 net new checking accounts, grew deposits 23% and dropped our cost of deposits 17 basis points, even with the increase in costs associated with the pandemic. 
Let's skip to Wealth Management on Slide 18 and 19, and I will refer to both slides as I speak. Okay. Here again, the impact of lower rates on a large deposit book pressured NII, impacting an otherwise solid quarter with positive AUM flows, market appreciation and solid deposit and loan growth. Net income of $836 million improved 12% from Q3 as revenue growth and improvement in provision exceeded a modest increase in expense. 
With respect to revenue, NII grew driven by solid growth of both loans and deposits. And asset management fees grew to a new record on higher market valuations and solid flows. Expenses increased driven by revenue-related expense and investments in our sales force. 
Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank both continue to grow households as we remain a provider of choice for affluent clients. Client balances rose to a record of more than $3.3 trillion, up $302 billion year-over-year driven by higher market levels as well as positive client flows. 
Let's move to our Global Banking results on Slide 20. COVID has also heavily impacted Global Banking due to lower interest rates, softer loan demand and higher credit costs. But here again, we saw improvement. The business earned nearly $1.7 billion in Q4, improving $751 million from Q3 driven by lower provision expense and improved revenue. On a year-over-year basis, earnings were $341 million lower, driven by NII. 
Looking at revenue and comparing to Q3, revenue improvement was driven by higher Investment Banking fees as well as more leasing activity associated with our clients' ESG investments. Investment Banking fees for the company of nearly $1.9 billion grew 5% from Q3 and were up 26% year-over-year. As Brian noted, this performance led to improved market share overall and in a number of key products. 
Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $266 million in Q4 compared to a build in reserves of $555 million in Q3. Noninterest expense was higher compared to the linked quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting investments in the platform as well as support for the PPP program and also reflecting the recording of merchant services expense given the change in accounting versus the year-ago quarter. 
As Brian noted earlier, customers continued to appreciate the ease, safety and convenience of our digital banking capabilities. And usage continued to grow, helping defray other costs. We present some digital highlights on Slide 22. 
As noted earlier, loans declined but saw stabilization late in the quarter. And continuing to trend since Q2, the spread of the loan portfolio continued to tick higher as spreads on new originations on average exceeded the average spread of the portfolio. Average deposits increased 26% relative to Q3 (sic) [ 4Q19 ] as businesses remained highly liquid. 
Okay. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 23. Results reflect solid year-over-year improvement in revenue from sales and trading but declined from the robust levels of Q3. As I usually do, I will talk about segment results, excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was a small loss of $56 million. On that basis, Global Markets produced $834 million of earnings in Q4, a decline from the more robust trading in Q3 but up markedly from Q4 '19.  
Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was up 13% on higher sales and trading. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by higher activity-based costs for both trading and unemployment claims processing. Sales and trading contributed $3.1 billion to revenue, increasing 7% year-over-year driven by a 30% improvement in equities and a 5% decline in FICC. The strength in equities was driven by market volatility and investment repositioning, which drove client activity higher. The decline in FICC reflected strong credit trading performance, which was more than offset by declines across most macro products and mortgage trading. 
As Brian noted, the year-over-year performance of this business has been strong in every quarter of 2020. You can see that on Slide 24, and that produced strong segment returns of 15% on allocated capital for the year.  
Okay. Finally, on Slide 25, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $425 million. Compared to Q3, the decline in net income was driven primarily by the prior quarter's tax benefit of $700 million associated with our U.K. deferred tax asset. Revenue declined from Q3 driven by the accounting for wind and solar and other ESG investments. We also experienced some modest equity investment losses. Expenses declined from Q3 on lower litigation expense but were partially offset by higher marketing costs. For 2021, absent any changes in the current tax laws or unusual items, we would expect the effective tax rate to be in the low double digits driven by the level of ESG client activity relative to pretax earnings.  
And with that, I'll turn it back to Lee and Brian for Q&A."

So yes, flat year-over-year, all-in number. And then we're working the dynamics underneath it. But importantly, remember, we are investing: $3.5 billion in technology next year, new financial centers, expansion, employees to help sell more, and we'll continue to drive it through.

I can give you a little more color on our perspectives on 2021. But I do think, as you think about how you want to estimate and model NII and how it may unfold in '21, I think it's really sort of helpful to kind of review the progress we made in 2020. There's a lot of clues there. 
Remember, in Q1 of '20, interest rates fell to historically low levels. Short rates were down 150 and long rates were down 100 basis points, plus, loans declined significantly beginning in Q2 as demand weakened and larger companies accessed the capital markets to pay down debt and build liquidity. 
In the past, when we've had situations like this where interest rates and/or loans have declined, it's always taken sort of several quarters to reach a point where renewed balance sheet growth was significant enough to compensate. We believe we found that NII bottom in Q3, and NII indeed moved higher in Q4. All else equal, day count, et cetera, it should become easier from here to grow NII. 
I think what helped us to start to grow again quickly in this crisis was the tremendous influx of deposits and our relatively recent confidence to invest the excess in securities instead of holding that excess in cash. So our continued investment of that cash in Q4 leads us to believe that we can offset the headwinds of low loan demand in the near term, recent reinvestment yields and 2 less days of NII in Q1, leaving NII relatively flat in Q1 versus Q4, before moving up through the balance of the year. 
Remember, in Q2 and Q3, we picked back up those days of interest we lost in Q1. As Brian reviewed, we also saw commercial loans stabilize at the end of Q4, providing hope that increased loan demand will soon follow. Given that we expect some loan demand through the year and using the existing rate curve, which has steepened over the past 90 days, we would expect NII in Q4 '21, for example, to be much higher than Q1 '21. And when we get to the second half of '21, year-over-year quarterly comparisons to 2020, as well as the second half of '21 compared to the first half of '20, should be quite favorable."

But -- and then asset management. Remember, we sold asset management because we believed that being the large distributor is the priority. So don't expect us -- we look at stuff from time to time like everybody does. But the way we're going to -- we built this company was organic growth and then delivering the capital back to the shareholders. 
And what's interesting, we'll see what the rules change. But remember that things like the SLR and the accommodations that were given, we didn't need, and we have plenty of SLR. It doesn't have any constraint. It doesn't become an issue. Like you said, even if you look at the SCB recalcs and stuff, we've got plenty over that. So we will be aggressive on returning capital. We got basically 2 months to return those $3 billion and change we've got to return now. And then we'll see what the Fed instructions are, and then we'll get after it as we move forward. 
And we look at things from time to time, but they -- there just isn't much to consider in the United States right now, and the best answer is to develop -- continue development of this franchise on an organic basis.

And the 4 charts at the bottom were put in specifically because this question, we knew, would arise. So if you look across the buckets and you look from the mid '19 to the end of '20, you can see the different delinquency buckets are all down, even the 90-plus days, down in gross dollar amount year-over-year. But you can see that the -- what people thought was sort of the analogy of a pig through a snake is probably more of a mouse through the snake in that it went up, it's still a lower dollar amount. And then it would come back down because you move from the left to the right side of the page. 
And if you go back to Page 14, you can actually see in the top chart that the total charge-offs in consumer this quarter were $482 million. If you look in the red bars, which is the credit card, you can see that they're down dramatically year-over-year in terms of gross dollar amounts, and then this will bode well in the future. So when we talk about going back up, they're going up from a -- to a level that was much below where they have ever been historically in terms of dollar amounts. 
And so the last point you made, just so you have it, is that the unemployment rate in our customer base is below the unemployment rate in American society. And that's just due to the -- especially on the borrowing customer base, due to the client selection and being in the prime business."

I can give you a lot more -- there's lots of things in that line item, but the volatility is often driven, certainly in the fourth quarter, by those partnership losses. 
Other things in that line are equity investment gains, gains and losses on the sale of debt securities. And there's some mark-to-market income in there on our FVL loans -- our fair value loans and related hedges. So there's going to be volatility in there.

In terms of mortgage. Again, we are careful there, but also we're conservative on rates, and we gone to look at that. So we booked about $7 billion in the secured lending side, including mortgage in the core consumer business. And so we feel better about that. Auto picked back up, but home equity is down to $0.5 billion a quarter or something like that, when it was running $3 billion or something. So we've got some room to go. 
But the good news is the card is stable, the balances are sort of stabilized. And at the 85 million, you have some seasonality, but at least they stabilize there. And then the mortgage looks like we're picking back up a bit as we've made some adjustments and gone back to the more normalized underwriting. And auto has been strong. So we'll see it play out. 
But you're right, we had to pull back and have lost about half the credit card volume on a given month. And we're picked back up to -- from 150 million at the low point to 200 million, but we've got some work to do."

Can you give us some color of how they changed? When you tightened them up, now they're back to normal? Was it FICO scores on the consumer side? 
And was it also on the commercial side, did you do the same thing? And some color on what's changed today there."

So let me start with the commercial side. And this is about sort of the relationship side of commercial business, Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Investment Banking. Basically, in March, April, we stopped prospecting, fr",494,"Yes. So let me start with the commercial side. And this is about sort of the relationship side of commercial business, Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Investment Banking. Basically, in March, April, we stopped prospecting, frankly, because it was sort of impossible to do plus you want to make sure you understood the portfolios. 
We've done quarterly portfolio reviews, every single loan going through to make sure the ratings are right, make sure we understood with the customer, to make sure we understood whether they're going to need covenant waivers. That, over the course of the time here, has sorted the group of customers, which are in the industries that Paul talked about, that are difficult. And the rest of the customers are solid, in good shape. And frankly, their credit has been improving as we looked at it by quarter. 
And so about 4 months ago, we moved into prospecting with very narrow list of prospects for Business Bank and Global Commercial Banking, think for middle market and upper end of small business across all our markets. But then recently, we flipped, and they can go back to full prospecting except for limited industries that you'd expect. 
On the small business side, because of the nature of the business, it was a little more dramatic, and we've opened back up. And we're getting -- we're up, I think, in the fourth quarter to give you a sense, we were up 50% in terms of the originations quarter-over-quarter. But we're still -- we were up a lot more than that, more than 50%. We're still down 50% year-over-year, up 100-plus percent in quarter -- linked-quarter, I think. And so new commitments, up 135%; but year-over-year, still down 47%. So that shows you that's coming through and we will see that happen in the small business side. So that was probably the slowest because it's -- they are the most risk. And so that's the commercial side. 
When you go to the consumer side, the reality was we basically -- we stayed on LTVs on the commercial -- on the consumer mortgage side. We basically stopped with the FICO requirements, we slowed down and do the market dynamics, home equity slowed down. Auto, we went back out more quickly just because of the secured nature of and short-term nature of it. So we felt good about that. And probably we're always super prime and stayed there. 
But it's really what's changed in consumer in the last several -- last few months has been the move. And we're back to probably 80%, 90% of the ability to generate that we had. We were down probably 20% and we moved back up, and so we'll see that flow through. 
But it was really just, until you had some clarity where this thing was going, you had to be careful for a while. So that bodes well to economic activity and loan growth in the future."

Three, when you look at just the sheer growth of the money supply, coupled with the expectation as we come out of this recession that the velocity of money will likely increase, it's hard to build a case that we're going to see a significant decline in deposits in the U.S. And we're going to get our fair share, if not more, of those deposits. So because of how we run our business on both commercial and the retail side in terms of focusing on high-quality deposits, we just feel good about the deposits we have."

I don't -- I'm not sure we -- well, I'm not sure we give the exact methodology, but let me just give you a sense.

I don't -- I'm not sure we -- well, I'm not sure we give the exact methodology, but let me just give you a sense. If you take our reserve setting weighting, in other words, what we set the reserve by December, for year-end 2020 because we set it before the statistics. The unemployment rate was 7.8%, and for year-end 2021, it was 6.6%. And obviously, the actual was 100 basis points-plus below that. 
So you would expect, as you have more confidence, that the forward path is into a narrower range. And the forward probability, two things are going to happen as you go forward. One is the sheer dollar volumes of site activity has changed, and so you're dealing with less in terms of charge-offs and things like that, which gives you confidence of where the path is. 
But most importantly, as you think about real reserve setting and lifetime reserves, is that the economic assumptions are clarifying, and the end of the COVID era is clarified with the vaccine. And as we see that, you'll see the uncertainty come down pretty quickly on the other side of that when that shows up in our assumptions. 
So we weighted downside nearly 50% of the elements. That weighting will come down over time. And so when that comes down over time, you'll see the reserves releases come away from that. The second thing is, as the duration of the rest of the crisis comes in with more certainty, i.e., more people vaccinated, you also see the lifetime calculation include the other side of the river to a bigger and bigger portion, and so that will drive it. So both of those things will change it. 
And as Paul said earlier, if you look at our underlying economics team, they have the economy crossing over where it was before and growing past in terms of sheer size at the end of this year, and our reserve setting takes it into next year and things like that. So we are using a more conservative case, which implies judgment."

And so we welcome an industry which has a great consumer-oriented path to it because that's how we run our company. We've been doing it that way for a long time. 
So our fees on overdrafts have been declining really as a percentage of fees every year and probably in gross dollar amounts most years. And so we're not depending on those largely because of how we run the business, being core customer checks, 90%-plus, the primary checking account in the household. And therefore, they tend to overdraft less. And this year with the stimulus and stuff, it's even lower. 
So we welcome -- we introduced this new loan product that basically gives a right to get an emergency loan for $5. And that is our response to allowing our customers who've been with us for a while to access their money for really no interest at all and use it in anticipation of paying us back quickly. These are things we've done to really help our retail customer segment, which is the mass market customer segment, on manage their lives effectively. 
And so we don't have a business built on those kind of fee structures, and that's we're not -- that's why we not -- we welcome any regulation that brings the market to us because, as the most efficient and the best brand and the best customer service, the largest franchise, that's fine with us."

It's been a year since we first reported our results which would include the health crisis impact. But what we see different now is we see an accelerating recovery versus the economic uncertainty that we would have faced the last year at this time. The most recent economic indicators reflected an economic recovery that has gained momentum and continues to be supported by fiscal monetary policies. 
From our company's perspective, we have emerged as an even stronger company and competitor than what we were when we entered the health care crisis. Compared to last year, Bank of America's balance sheet has higher capital ratios, higher reserves with lower charge-offs and record liquidity. Our diverse business model with leadership positions across all our businesses has helped us earn our way through the crisis. Our Global Markets and Global Wealth Management businesses, which would typically benefit from this healthy capital markets environment, continued to perform well this quarter. Our Consumer and Global Banking businesses also performed well. But they were -- this is after being more negatively impacted for several quarters by the interest rate environment and credit costs. These businesses now are in full recovery mode and are out generating new assets and new relationship with our clients. 
All this work by my team, and which we're very proud of here, has led to EPS in the first quarter of $0.86 per share, and a return on tangible common equity of 17%. Paul is going to take you through the details in a moment. 
But simply put, we believe our decade-plus long dedication to responsible growth has put us in a position to both earn more money and deliver more back to you, our shareholders. Our announcement this morning regarding share repurchases highlights our intention to increase those repurchases over the coming quarters as the current restrictions are lifted by the Federal Reserve. 
But first, let's discuss the recovering economy. On Slides 3, 4 and 5, we've shared slides like this with you the last few quarters. They are updated for the most quarterly data. They highlight the key economic signposts. I won't go through all the details on them, but they're there for your reference. 
But a few highlights. Obviously, GDP consensus production -- projections continue to improve. And you can see our tremendous best-in-class Bank of America Research Team's projections in the upper left-hand corner of Slide 3. You will note also the increases in the consumer spending from our Bank of America customers at the bottom of the slide, which is not only much higher than the prior year when payments began decline, but notably is much higher this year-to-date than year-to-date 2019, a more appropriate comparison. This is a key element of the economic optimism you're seeing reflected in the market. 
Looking back to 2017, after tax reform and other matters, we saw a step-change in money movement by our customers, moving from previously a 5% year-over-year type of growth rate to up to 9% in 2019 versus 2018. Then the pandemic hit and growth of '20 over '19 was only 1%. But so far year-to-date, we're going faster on a larger base than the 2019 9%-plus growth trend at 10% plus. The first quarter was a record dollar amount of money moved by Bank of America consumers. The trend is fully on track, even though the economy is not yet fully reopened. March was a record month of spending by Bank of America consumers and led to the highest ever quarter of consumer spending. 
As you look also on these slides, note on Slide 4, the lower level of card delinquencies as a spike from the expired deferrals and the for auto and company has worked its way through the charge-offs. In addition, early-stage delinquencies that are at or near historic lows, suggesting low levels of card charge-offs again next year -- the next quarter, excuse me. 
As the economy has improved, customers have continued to increase their business across our platform. When you think about it from a customer's perspective, which is what we do as a business and comparing across the pandemic period of the last 12 months, we have simply added more customers across every line of business. And those customers are more digitally engaged in every business as well. You're going to see later on Slide 17 that we added nearly 1 million active digital customers this quarter, pushing us past 40 million active users, led by increased use by boomers and seniors. We have more deposit and cash management customers and balances in every business from consumer to small business to Merrill Lynch to Private Bank, the business bank and the commercial bank across the whole franchise. New investment relationships in our consumer businesses Merrill Edge platform now total more than 3 million accounts and net new households continue to grow both in Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank. We saw aggregated client flows across our investment platforms of $48 billion in the quarter, bringing those total investment assets over $4 trillion with a range of those capabilities from our digital-only capabilities in our consumer business all the way through the great service and capabilities provided by our 20,000 wealth advisers. We added new lending customers, whether through PPP and small business and business banking, and along with broader traditional banking relationships, our middle market and corporate clients. And we've helped existing the new clients attained funding taxes market through our sales and trading investment banking platforms. Combined sales and trading investment banking revenue of $7.3 billion is the highest in a decade, is up 28% year-over-year. Jimmy and Matthew Koder and the teams led by Tom Montag have done a great job there. Our customer satisfaction levels across all these groups of clients rose during the pandemic and a brand loyalty of our company is at the highest it's been. We also note that our employee engagement is at highest it's been. And we have driven our success to our teammates this quarter, and you'll note in our expenses with another broad-based bonus plan, which is the fourth time we've done this. And with support provided to the communities we serve, our employees sense of pride in our company and what it does has reached a new level of satisfaction. So with that being said, we do have some work to do in certain areas as we have for the last decade. 
I'd highlight those 3 areas with a couple of comments on each. Those areas are loan growth, net interest income and expense. While loan growth continues to be a lot of liquidity in the system and customer payments remain high, which impacts our loan balances. This is across the whole consumers and companies. Pipeline origination are improving but remain below pre-pandemic levels. We've reinstated all our credit standards back to where they were before the pandemic. And we remain highly focused on capturing loan growth as the economy expands and continues to recover. The projected economic growth should cause the need for companies to borrow, build inventory, increase hiring and invest and do what they do in their businesses. 
As you can see from Slide 4, Global Banking loans after following in January appear to have stabilized again in March. We'll have to see how this plays out, but that's the first -- this -- the month of March was a good sign. Pipelines continue to build but line usage remains low. Card applications and mortgage originations continue to increase in each of the last 3 quarters. This, along with mortgage rates moving higher and driving lower prepayments and runoff of current mortgage loan, sets up consumer loan growth. That strong customer liquidity obviously negatively impacts loan growth, but it has benefited credit cost. We saw quarter 1 net charge-offs remain below pre-pandemic levels in dollars and percentage, further supporting reduction in our credit reserves this quarter. 
Now net interest income. We told you 6 months ago that we believe the third quarter would be the trough and has proven to be so. Despite the drawdown of loans and 2 less days of interest in this current quarter, NII was flat to fourth quarter of last year. As we move through 2021, we believe the benefits from a steepened interest rate curve should begin to work its way into our revenue, driven by continued investment of our liquidity as well as picking up those lost days of interest. 
And thinking about the expected NII trajectory this year in the year ahead, I would set the stage just as follows: if the forward interest rate curve materializes and we see modest loan growth late in the later quarters of the year, we ought to see NII as we exit the fourth quarter of this year, $1 billion a quarter higher than the most recent level of $10.3 billion in this quarter. 
The last area I would highlight is expense. We had a large expense this quarter driven by several factors. Some are seasonal impacts. Some were good news in that their volume and revenue-driven impacts and others were not typical of our normal operating expense due to charges taken. We expect a significant decline as you look forward to the second quarter 2021 in expense. We've seen the headcount in our company start to work its way back down due to attrition, especially as the specialized programs begin to run their course. I'd also remind you that the first quarter is typically elevated for payroll tax expense and this year was about $350 million. 
Next, I would say roughly $500 million of our increase is driven by the improved activity and higher revenue, which, of course, is a positive. It's what we're in the business to do. The items classifies differing from our typical costs were as follows. First, given the progress made in our digital engagement with our customers and other customer traffic behavior. We will continue to rationalize real estate for our teammates and our customers and recorded an impairment charge to do that of $240 million in the quarter. Second, a portion of the equity awarded last year to our Global Bank -- before last year's work for our Global Banking and Markets teammates, we had different retirement rule. And as previously reported, we changed our retirement rule, which caused that to accelerate in full this quarter instead of being amortized over the next 4 years. Other costs worth noting include severance costs and special incentive Board recognizing a broad base of 200,000 teammates for their outstanding efforts during this pandemic. That award for the fourth time is built on shared success awards the 3 times prior, that was given in 3 previous years. 
Additionally, COVID expense remains elevated as we continue to help our clients through the various assistant programs established by the government. PPP, unemployment claims, stimulus payment disbursement and PPP forgiveness. But broadly speaking, we have done a great job in helping customers to these programs. We've now originated almost 500,000 PPP loans and have obtained forgiveness for our clients for 200,000 of those. We processed $180 billion unemployment claims and $73 billion in the IP stimulus payments. Paul is going to share a bit of the details in the quarter's expenses but even after absorbing these expenses are PPNR rose from fourth quarter. 
As we ended last year, we talked about a target for this year's expense in 2021 fiscal year expenses to be similar to the $55 billion level in 2020. Given the charges this quarter, we would increase that target by about $1.5 billion. However, I just want you to keep some perspective here. We reported $57 billion in expense for the year 2015, 6 years ago. Even though all the investments we have made in technology and the build-out of branches in new markets, new sales resources and just having more customers, more activities, the inflation in health care and real estate and other costs, moving our teammates -- our starting wages from $15 to $20 an hour during that time period. We are targeting 2021 expense at roughly to where it was in 2015, 6 years later and a lot bigger company later. That discipline in operational excellence is what we do, and you should expect us to continue that. 
So in summary, this quarter, we again drove responsible growth. We support our employees by keeping them safe and rewarding their efforts in the pandemic. We support our customers by providing strong balance sheet and resilient systems to transact. We support our communities by supplying critical funding and driving improvement toward racial and social equality with our increase in our $1 billion commitment to $1.25 billion. We've already delivered over $300 million of that commitment. At the same time, we delivered to you, our shareholders $8 billion in earnings, generating return on tangible common equity of 17% and returned $5 billion in capital to the shareholders in the first quarter. This shows you we can both deliver for you, our shareholders and deliver for our customers, our employees and our other stakeholders in society. 
With that, let me hand off to Paul to cover the quarter in a little more detail."

Good morning, and hello, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 6 and 7 together. As I've done in the past few quarters now, the majority of my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter to reflect how we are progressing through this heal",3043,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning, and hello, everyone. 
I'm starting on Slide 6 and 7 together. As I've done in the past few quarters now, the majority of my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter to reflect how we are progressing through this health crisis rather than year-over-year. In Q1, we earned net income of $8.1 billion or $0.86 per share, which compares to $5.5 billion or $0.59 per share in Q4. The earnings improvement included strong revenue growth, which more than offset higher expense. Additionally, earnings also included a $2.7 billion reserve release, which resulted in a $1.9 billion provision benefit. Revenue growth was driven by strong sales and trading results, record investment banking fees and record asset management fees and our wealth management business, while consumer fees faced the seasonal challenge against elevated Q4 holiday spending. With respect to returns, return on tangible common equity was 17.1 and ROA was 113 basis points. 
Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 8. The balance sheet expanded $150 billion versus Q4 to $2.97 trillion in total assets. Deposit growth continued to drive the balance sheet higher. Deposits grew $89 billion in the quarter and are up $300 billion from Q1 '20. Note that as deposits continue to grow, loans declined $25 billion from Q4. We deployed some of this excess liquidity into debt securities, which increased $172 billion while cash balances declined $54 billion and a reverse repo also fell. 
It is also worth noting that our liquidity portfolio is now more than 1/3 of our total balance sheet and has surpassed $1 trillion. 
On a period-end basis, our Global Markets balance sheet increased by $129 billion, coming off year-end seasonal lows and as customers increase their activity with us. Note that on an average basis, it is only up marginally from the prior year. And versus Q4, up only $40 billion. Shareholders' equity increased $1 billion. Earnings were mostly offset by $4.5 billion in net capital distributions and a decrease in OCI of $1.8 billion, driven by an increase in long bond rates. 
With respect to regulatory ratios, consistent with the fourth quarter, standardized remains our binding approach for us and at 11.8%, our CET1 ratio is our binding metric. While the CET1 ratio declined 15 basis points from Q4, it is 230 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into a $35 billion capital cushion. The benefits to the ratio from an increased level of capital were more than offset by higher RWA from the liquidity deployed into mortgage-backed securities and growth in our Global Markets balance sheet. 
Our supplemental ratio at quarter end was 7% and 6.1% on a pro forma basis, excluding the relief for deposits at the Fed, and investments in treasuries. 6.1% versus the 5% minimum requirement leaves us plenty of room for growth in the balance sheet. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements. 
Let me spend a minute on loans and deposits before moving away from the balance sheet. I will focus on averages as that is what drives NII. With respect to loans, on Slide 9, you can see the downward trend across the year as customer liquidity and accommodating capital markets drove paydowns well above historic levels. I would draw your attention to the linked quarter change. Global Banking commercial loans declined $16 billion, but as Brian noted earlier, we are seeing pipelines build and balances have stabilized for more than a month. So we are hopeful for a turnaround. Loan payments by consumers continue to outpace originations, with loans declining $14 billion in Consumer Banking led by mortgages. Plus we saw normal seasonality in our card products as customers pay down holiday balances with stimulus contributing to the high payment rates. 
But what is also noteworthy is the linked quarter improvement in GWIM and Global Markets. GWIM continued to benefit from security-based lending as well as custom lending in Global Markets. We relaxed some hold limits as the economy continued to strengthen. With respect to deposits on Slide 10, we continue to see tremendous growth across the client base, not only because of growth in the money supply, but also because we are adding new accounts and attracting liquidity from existing customers. 
Turning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q1 was $10.2 billion, $10.3 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income declined $1.9 billion from Q1 '20, driven by the rate environment and lower loan balances, but was relatively flat to Q4. Compared to Q4, we see this as a good outcome considering the headwinds of 2 fewer days of interest, lower loan levels and modestly higher premium amortization expense. These headwinds were mostly offset by the deployment of excess deposits into securities and a benefit of approximately $100 million from a legacy litigation settlement involved in some securities. The net interest yield was relatively stable, declining 3 basis points from Q4, and it was flat if you exclude Global Markets. 
Reducing cash and repo, we deployed some of our excess liquidity into securities in Q1, split across treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Securities increased $172 billion from year-end. On a weighted average basis relative to what we were earning on the cash, we improved our yield on that roughly $170 billion by approximately 115 basis points. Now the improvement in yield could have been higher, however. But similar to Q4 purchases, we hedged a portion of the treasuries purchased with swaps effectively keeping those securities floating. 
As you will note, given all the deposit growth and low rates, our asset sensitivity is rising. Our asset sensitivity to rising our rates remained significant, highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships. Sensitivity is lower from the year-end levels as higher rates and deployment of liquidity into securities increased our baseline. So the sensitivity no longer assumes that liquidity is available to invest at higher rates. 
A few thoughts on NII for the remainder of the year. But first, please note that these forward-looking comments on NII assume that the forward interest rate curve materializes, that the economy continues to recover and that we have some fairly modest loan growth in the back half of the year. Given those assumptions, we expect some improvement in premium amortization across the next few quarters, if mortgage rates follow the forward curve. At $1.5 billion in Q1, write-off for premium continued to be a headwind as mortgage prepayments remained quite high. So forward-looking comments include a lot of material moving parts from rates, loan levels and premium amortization. But as Brian said, we believe 4Q '21 NII could rise by as much as $1 billion from this quarter's level. 
Okay. Turning to Slide 12 and expenses. Q1 expenses were $15.5 billion, $1.6 billion higher than Q4. I will add to some of the remarks Brian mentioned earlier. First, Q1 included the normal seasonal elevation of payroll tax expense of about $250 million. Second, as a result of the current period's solid revenue performance and a better outlook for revenue for the remainder of the year, we accrued for higher incentives and experienced increased processing costs. This added roughly $500 million to the quarter. Third, we incurred some expense that differs from our typical operating expense. We reversed a decision made on some 2020 incentive comp awards, making certain portions of those awards retirement eligible. This accelerated approximately $300 million of expense into Q1 that would have been expensed over 4 years. We also recorded an impairment charge of $240 million for real estate realization, and we incurred $160 million of severance charge as we move back towards business as usual with respect to our headcount. This is based on an expectation that as roles get eliminated through process improvement, some associates might choose severance over opportunities to work in a different role in the company. 
Lastly, our COVID costs remained largely unchanged as modest declines in some employee-related costs were offset by costs associated with restarting PPP originations and forgiveness and additional unemployment claim processing. COVID costs are proving a little slower to safely reduce than we had hoped. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. Government stimulus and support has helped customers get through this pandemic. That support, coupled with our customer assistance programs and years of underwriting discipline under responsible growth, has resulted in low net charge-offs. Net charge-offs this quarter were $833 million or 37 basis points of average loans and were lower than Q4. And they were 14% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019, which was the last quarter before the pandemic despite an expected increase in card losses of $229 million in Q1. With the exception of a small uptick in small business and the card losses, losses in every other category declined from Q4. 
Provision was a 1.9% benefit in the quarter as an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and lower loan balances resulted in a $2.7 billion release of credit reserves. Total consumer reserve releases were $1.4 billion, driven primarily by card while the commercial release was $1.2 billion. Our allowance as a percent of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.8%, which still remained well above the 1.27% where we began 2020 following our day 1 adoption of CECL. 
With respect to reserve setting assumptions, we continue to include a multitude of scenarios. Based upon our Q1 weighting of those scenarios, GDP is forecasted to return to its 4Q '19 level by the end of 2021. The weighted scenario also assumes that the unemployment rate at the end of 2021 will be just north of 6%, which is in line with March unemployment rate. For 2022, the weighted average scenario assumed unemployment just under 5.5% as we exit the year. To the extent the economic outlook and the remaining uncertainties continue to improve, we expect our reserve levels will move lower. 
On Slide 14, we show the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Overall, consumer net charge-offs rose $211 million from Q4. And absent the $229 million increase noted in card, other losses declined. With respect to card losses, given the reduction in late-stage delinquencies in the 180-day pipeline, we expect card losses to be lower in Q2. NPLs remained low despite a small uptick due to consumer real estate deferrals, which have limited expected loss content given healthy LTV ratios. 
Moving to commercial. Net charge-offs declined $296 million from the fourth quarter as the portfolio stabilize, with reservable criticized exposure and NPLs declining in the quarter. Overall, given the environment, the asset quality of our commercial book remains solid, and 90% of the exposures are either investment-grade or collateralized. 
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 15. Consumer Banking produced another strong quarter in terms of customer deposits and investment flows, reflecting the strength of our brand, the innovation around digital and deployment of specialists in our centers, all of which has enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the increase in customer liquidity. The segment earned $2.7 billion in Q1 versus $2.6 billion as the provision benefit more than offset lower mostly seasonal revenue and higher expense. 
Revenue declined 2%, reflecting lower card income from Q4 -- Q4's elevated holiday spending. Expenses moved higher as a result of real estate impairment costs as well as seasonally higher payroll tax expense. This also caused an increase in our cost of deposits this quarter to 142 basis points. Absent the impairment charge, the cost of deposits would have been 131 basis points. As expected, net charge-offs rose from Q4 due to the flow-through of the bold in-car delinquencies, as noted earlier, at a $1.4 billion reserve release resulted in a $617 million provision benefit in the quarter. 
On Slide 16, you can see the significant increase in consumer deposits and investments. Average deposits of $924 billion are up 25% compared to Q1 '20, with nearly 2/3 of that growth in checking. Rate paid is down to 3 basis points as 56% of the deposits are low interest checking. Lastly, note the growth throughout the quarter as average deposits were up $39 billion from Q4. We covered loans earlier, so I would just note investment balances of $324 billion are up 53% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering. 
As Brian noted, and as you can see on Slide 17, we continued to see improvement in digital enrollment this quarter. 70% of our consumer households use some part of our digital platform this year. We continued to see digital payments and Zelle taking hold across all our businesses. Zelle consumer dollar volume is up 72% year-over-year. Small business is up 182% year-over-year. And 90% of our business-to-consumer payments in Global Banking are now made via Zelle. As you can see, our digital assistant Erica continues to add users, capabilities and usage. Plus, we are applying our success with Erica to other businesses as well. 
Okay. Turning to Wealth Management. We continued to deliver solid organic growth, serve the comprehensive banking and investing needs of clients and manage risk responsibly. We experienced strong household -- new household acquisition in a virtual environment and a very competitive market. This resulted in a record quarter with respect to total client flows, including near-record AUM flows and record AUM fees. Net income of $881 million improved 6% from Q4 as revenue growth and improvement in provision exceeded an increase in expense. 
With respect to revenue, the record AUM fees were complemented by higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses increased driven by revenue-related costs and seasonally elevated payroll tax. 
Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank both continued to grow clients as we remained a provider of choice for affluent clients. Client balances rose to a record $3.5 trillion, up $822 billion year-over-year, driven by higher market levels as well as strong client flows. During Q1, our advisers added over 6,000 net new households in Merrill Lynch and nearly 700 net new relationships in the private bank. 
Let's skip to Slide 20, which is a new page that highlights our progress to digitally engaged wealth management clients. In Merrill and the Private Bank, our clients and advisers have both embraced the value of a digitally-enabled relationship in which digital tools are critical mechanisms for fast, safe and secure interactions. Our Wealth clients are some of the most highly engaged clients in the franchise, with 80% of Merrill households digitally active. In Q1, we saw a record number of log-ins. Clients are logging into trade, check balances and originate loans with ease, all of which can be done through a simplified sign-in. We continue to enhance and modernize the capabilities for both the client and adviser and these capabilities are becoming key differentiators as well as being recognized by third parties. 
Moving to Global Banking on Slide 21. The business earned nearly $2.2 billion in Q1, improving $500 million from Q4 driven by a provision benefit and solid revenue. While loan growth has been challenging, deposit growth has been strong and investment banking revenue exceeded previous records. The team produced $2.2 billion in firm-wide investment banking fees, growing year-over-year by 62% and 20% over Q4. 
Looking at revenue and comparing to Q4, despite the higher IB fees, total revenue declined 3%, driven by the -- by weather-related impairments on some tax advantage investments. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $1.2 billion in Q1. Importantly, net charge-offs of $36 million fell by $278 million from Q4. 
Noninterest expense rose 14% from Q4, reflecting the incentive award changes noted earlier. Additionally, the strong IB performance and improved outlook and seasonally elevated payroll tax increased personnel costs in Q1. 
Looking at the balance sheet on Slide 22. Average deposits moved up relative to Q4 as customers remained highly liquid. Year-over-year, deposits are up an impressive 27% while rate paid is at an historic low. As noted earlier, loans declined early in the quarter but stabilized late in the quarter. 
Wholesale digital engagement continued to accelerate and usage continue to grow, driven by the same ease, safety and convenience of our digital banking capabilities that our consumer customers enjoy. We present some wholesale digital highlights on Slide 23. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 24. Results reflected the highest revenue quarter in over a decade with solid year-over-year improvement and an even more significant increase relative to Q4. As I usually do, I will talk about the segment's results excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was negligible but the year-ago quarter had a $300 million gain. Global Markets produced $2.1 billion of earnings in Q1, more than double the level of Q4 and up 39% from Q1 '20. Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was up 26% on higher sales and trading and equity underwriting fees. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by volume-related expenses in both card and trading and an acceleration in expense from changes in the incentive awards. Sales and trading contributed $5.1 billion to revenue, increasing 17% year-over-year driven by a 22% improvement in FICC and a 10% increase in equities. FICC results reflected gains in commodities and strong results in credit, mortgage and municipal products versus relatively -- relative weakness in the year-ago period. This was partially offset by reduced activity and trading opportunities in other macro products. The strength in equities was driven by a strong trading performance in cash. The business produced strong returns, delivering a 22% return on capital in Q1. 
Finally, on Slide 26, we show All Other, which reported profits of $257 million. Compared to Q1 '20, the improvement in net income was driven by a larger tax benefit given an expected increase in ESG activities this year. The year-ago quarter also included a modest reserve build. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 12% and excluding the tax credits driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been 23%. For the full year, absent any changes in the current tax laws or other unusual items, we expect an effective tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 12%. 
Okay. With that, let's go to Q&A."

So in terms of the second quarter, I think you're about right. We expect expenses just north of $14 billion, depending on the revenue environment and the amount of progress we make in taking down the COVID costs. In terms of your comment about our ability to manage expenses, we agree with you. I think as Brian noted in his opening comments, we've managed not to increase expenses for years now, and we've absorbed merit increases, investments, minimum wage, improvement in benefits, all the dramatic increase in processing volumes, digital increases. So where we have sort of, as talked about on other calls, we've been using operational excellence and other initiatives to basically fund the investments in our future. 
I think our goal here is to clearly create operating leverage over an extended period of time. We've talked about maybe expenses rising maybe at a 1% level per year. And I think that's probably the best guidance we can give you. Absent again, some of the ins and outs, we had a lot of variability this quarter. And obviously, we're sitting here in the middle of a pandemic with a lot of COVID expenses that have been a little bit more sticky than we had all hoped. But they're going to come out. There's no question about that. And so we'll get back to kind of a normal level of expenses and a very reasonable growth level over the long term relative to revenue."

So sure, there -- that has an impact, but our job is to compete through it. But the reality of what's happening the impact now, frankly, is that draw rates on lines of credit and stuff are low in companies that are operating well. There's companies that still need to get through the pandemic impact just aren't using the lines, and that's bump along the bottom, we've shown you these long-term charts. So we feel good about our middle market and our business banking businesses and small businesses. We feel good about they're getting set up as the economy continues to improve and the growth will come back. And in the services and rate we can provide are competitive. And so I don't think that will ever change. And I think it reaches further. Sometimes it reaches the step we won't do as a company, obviously, in terms of leverage -- extra amounts of leverage and things like that, but we feel we're very strong and competitive. And before the pandemic, actually middle market will grow mid-single digits, and we'd expect to turn back to that level."

So as you think about that, you've got to recognize that our portfolio has changed. 
For example, card, which has -- which, as you know, has some of the highest reserve rates is down 25% from day 1. So you really need to think about how the mix has changed.

So all that technology progress is noted. On the other hand, I look at Slide 12, and I see the efficiency ratio, and I see the expenses, and I hear the higher guidance for expenses for this year. So I guess if you could help me reconcile these positive underlying trends with this number on the page of 68% efficiency ratio. And I do recognize that you're calling out a lot of expenses, the $1.6 billion increase quarter-over-quarter, is that -- should we consider that kind of just onetime?

But as you go across Page 12, you've got to remember, and you well know this that in the stuff on the left-hand side of the page, you had a rate environment that it finally after years have come up to some level of Fed funds rate and LIBOR rates and stuff, and that helped our efficiency ratio move under 60. But even if you look at this quarter at 68 and you back out the type of expenses that you drop in the low 60s and then the NII improvement will -- because that, frankly, as you well know, comes with very little expense attached to it, and i.e. that we don't need more branches and more infrastructure or more even more commercial bankers as loan usage goes up and the spread off of our floors due to our massive deposit base. 
So I think you should expect that even our pro forma basis, you can see the low 60s, and you should expect it to move back in the levels you see here as we move through the year, pick up the NII. And then if rates start to move up, you'd even pick up more."

When you couldn't have our teammates to each other. We had to have a few more of the move in, in the issues that were there for social distance seeing us working from home and overstaffing because of high-risk employees. So we ran up a little higher and now you start to see it drift down. So that core number of headcount will drive our expenses.

That's based upon the forward curve materializing and some modest loan growth in the back half of the year. 
We've got some flexibility because we do have liquidity, can go faster or slower on in terms of investing. We'd like to put that in loan growth and not necessarily into securities, but we will invest it over time. We've got to see the amortization expense start to come down.

Through the end of Q1, securities are up $380 billion and cash and equivalents are up $150 billion to $300 billion. But as I said in the remarks, we bought treasuries, but on about $150 billion of those treasuries, we have interest rate swaps. So you can really think of the $300 billion of cash as being $450 billion in terms of our ability to fund loan growth or invest for term or other uses.

What's going to drive the company's P&L also on the consumer side, especially, if you look at by business, so the Wealth Management business actually has grown a little bit. You got the commercial business down and consumers down. Consumer is largely down because of mortgage churn, but -- but the big thing that happened is card came down. And what's been interesting to watch now -- and so because we pulled back this time last year's unemployment went to 15%, everybody pulled back their underlying criteria, Matt. We've now reinstated, as Paul said. So what's happened? We did 1 million units of new cards a quarter going into the last year's first quarter, it fell as low as 400. It's back up to 600 change already and moving north on that. And if you look by month, it's stacking back up. So that's -- and if you look at where that's coming from, obviously, the branch system, which basically was run at around 2,500 of the 4,300 branches for the last 6, 8 months, 9 months is only catching back up as it opens up and sales come in. So that bodes well on the -- obviously, on the consumer side on the cards, which are most important. Mortgages production will continue to kick back up and prepayments to slowdown at a slightly higher rate environment. You'll see that bodes well there. GWIM has done -- has some of the mortgage aspects, but on the type of lending that GWIM does to affluent wealthy people. They've done a good job, and they've actually seen that grow. And then you go to the business banking, middle market, and that's all line usage. And so that should come through if it's -- in order for the economy expanded 7% this year is which what our Bank of America team has it at, at some point, companies have to access capital to meet that final demand, and you should see that uses come up. So even in things like the car business, because there just aren't the cars to sell, you're seeing line uses down at a lower level. 
So as you think across the things that hold levels and things that Paul is talking about enable us to push a little harder just because of the sheer size of our company. But if you think about it, think about the flywheel that we have in the company as a production engine having had necessarily to be slowed down in the crisis with 15% unemployment peaks and the final demand being crushed in the second quarter of last year, then turning that crank back up and just watch that flywheel start to take off. That's what we have good confidence in terms of getting right back on loan growth. But if you add it all that together and we grew 5%, it'd be $45 billion of loans. So to Paul's point, you still have tremendous excess capacity because the deposit growth is so strong on core transactional deposits with the commercial and consumers."

So why would you do that? The reason why we do that is our clients have been growing, and we kept about 1/3 of the size. But -- and even if you took away some of the growth just due to the deposit things, it has come down around 20% the size of the company. And the idea is to keep it in synergy and synchronize it with the company is over all size, but the company has grown around it another step. And so we've told Tom and the team are working on ideas to continue to do that. We stay -- we're a little bigger now than we were at year-end, obviously, first quarter activity, but you shouldn't expect us to come down. Now those ratios aren't effective for a bit of time here.

The reason why we do this is to serve our clients and do a great job and it flows through the numbers. As Mike said earlier, the idea that we run this huge consumer business at a cost advantage, which is significant due to the digitization of all the consumer activity, due to the way customers interact with us, the way we can help them to wait and give guideposts. And frankly, the way we can take the fee structure out and that we dropped over to our fees dramatically over the years made up for it in terms of efficiency and other types of things. 
And so we get the word out. We tell everybody we win all kinds of awards and the list go on and on in terms of the different ranking agencies. And you've seen it in the Merrill Edge growth is over $300 billion now. And so our job is do a great job for our customers. And I think I'll leave it to you and your colleagues to debate the relative merits of fintech versus ours, but I will tell you, for a company making $8 billion and having 40 million new digital customers are fully active on the consumer side, 0.5 million on the digital -- on the corporate side, the impact on our ability to have expenses be flat from -- even with extra money of $1.5 billion or so in the first quarter from 6 years ago, shows the impact of the ability to digitize this company. And we learned more about it this in last year, in areas that we didn't do. So we'll keep pushing it out there. You can capital tell the story, but the reality is, is that the #1 person we want to understand is our customers, and that means attrition. Attrition of customers way down, the penetration of the wallets way up, just look on the wealth management statistics we threw and see how that they've adopted to it. These are major changes to the size of which don't exist much out there. So we'll keep pounding a way you keep telling the story. We'll keep telling the story, but the key is it's producing, it's producing the kind of earnings we're producing and the kind of efficiency we're producing, which continues to be down to our benefit going forward. 
The neatest thing about this stuff is where we go next with -- where we've been going with it. So Erica, there's just nothing close to it out there and driving -- with volumes and things. Zelle, if you look at the charts on the pages and show it, so it's the usage and the personalization and the ability to help people manage their payments and their things for the mass market and their investments. The -- so we feel good about it. We'll tell the story as often as we can. But the reality is I just would like to see us keep growing a number of customers and driving it and driving it on an integrated basis. We're putting major investments in the -- in a couple of areas, we had to improve merchant services, payments on the commercial side at the merchant level, and we're putting major investments in the 401(k) technology to push that. When #7 that business is the lowest market position of any business we have, #6 or 7 of whatever we are. So these are major investments we're making hundreds of millions of dollars a year that go into that expense base but are paid for by the efficiency of the core businesses."

Two, as I think about that $1 billion, I would say the most important driver would be the modest loan growth. And the second most important driver would be the reduction in premium amortization. So maybe that's enough guidance right there. Again, we're not going to go down to where it was in Q1. We really think 4Q '19 because we've grown so much.

A company that we can put across the platform has a wonderful market position where it plays, and we're very proud of the deal. And -- but the key is that we -- you got to go back to the whole history of merchant services. We sold half of it in a joint venture 15 years ago now or whatever it was, raised some capital come forward. We bought it back. Remember, that's one of the reasons why expense run rate moved up by $800 million, $900 million a year that people forget about is because we brought that in last year for half a year and it wasn't in 2 years ago. But the reason why we bought it back is really to invest around the platform. 
So what's exciting about it is things like the acquisition to take us in the medical area. What's exciting about it is the ability to actually sell it through this sales force without having to have a non-owned sales force selling it in our small business in our business banking colleagues that thousands of people out there and can help deliver the product. And then what's really exciting is the integration of payment scheme that we've been working on for commercial payments. So it's the integration of the B2B, Zelle to small business, in all these payment gateways, which is outside the traditional merchant business, but you have to be completely flexible along all payment schemes to actually root it much more favorable to the merchant with very low cost to them and real-time contemporary us value exchange. So what we're doing is real-time payments and Zelle in combination into the business platform through the payment gateways. These are all exciting things and you go larger and it's different elements and blockchain payments and everything else. 
So that's the core of the business on the commercial side, but it goes all the way from small business all the way up to large companies. And so that investment was part of that. The new investment is part of that, and you'll expect us to keep driving at the implementation. The good news is we're getting the network effect of Zelle and things like that when you look at those pages that Zelle's half the credit card charge volume used by our consumers to make payments now, noodle on that for a minute. I think 35 million credit card people out there charging Zelle, the reaching half of it. Checks down 25% over the last couple of years in terms of checks written volume by our consumers. It's -- so you get the network effect of that and then you get the merchants to use it with real time. So this is all part of a thing that Tom win and Mark Monaco and the team are leading test on the commercial side that you should expect to see a lot. A lot of investment has been made including a major replacement system that's coming through the P&L this year and the change in bringing the people on fully on balance sheet. And a lot of investment will be made including acquisitions like we just made."

It's a little differently by stratification of earnings power of the household. And so that's to be spent. That bodes well for economic reopening and stuff. And has it had an effect on balances in card on stuff, yes, because consumers have used to pay down their debt in part of what it has been spent -- has been spent to pay down card balances. And then with a limited travel, just not getting as much use. The good news is you watch January to February and March with the buyers and vaccine pathways come into for with the -- you're starting to see the purchase numbers go up. And the payments rate, way up as you observed last year, 30% through last year and this quarter. But you'd expect that, that might be more constant than the usage rate will go up and start to drive some balance growth, which is good news. 
So the good news is that consumers are healthy from every aspect. We have no deferrals left except in the mortgage business. So all the debate we had about those last year this time through the system, delinquencies down, consumers sitting with money in accounts and the economy open up, which bodes well, and that's what you saw in the retail sales numbers today.

Information about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website.  
So with that, I will turn it over to you, Brian. Take it away."

It's been a year since we first reported our results, which would include the health crisis impact. But what we see different now is we see an accelerating recovery versus the economic uncertainty that we would have faced the last year at this time. The most recent economic indicators reflected an economic recovery that has gained momentum and continues to be supported by fiscal monetary policies.  
From our company's perspective, we have emerged as an even stronger company and competitor than what we were when we entered the health care crisis. Compared to last year, Bank of America's balance sheet has higher capital ratios, higher reserves with lower charge-offs and record liquidity. Our diverse business model with leadership positions across all our businesses has helped us earn our way through the crisis. Our Global Markets and Global Wealth Management businesses, which would typically benefit from this healthy capital markets environment, continued to perform well this quarter. Our Consumer and Global Banking businesses also performed well. But they were -- this is after being more negatively impacted for several quarters by the interest rate environment and credit costs. These businesses now are in full recovery mode and are out generating new assets and new relationship with our clients.  
All this work by my team, and which we're very proud of here, has led to EPS in the first quarter of $0.86 per share and a return on tangible common equity of 17%. Paul is going to take you through the details in a moment.  
But simply put, we believe our decade-plus long dedication to responsible growth has put us in a position to both earn more money and deliver more back to you, our shareholders. Our announcement this morning regarding share repurchases highlights our intention to increase those repurchases over the coming quarters as the current restrictions are lifted by the Federal Reserve.  
But first, let's discuss the recovering economy. On Slides 3, 4 and 5, we've shared slides like this with you the last few quarters. They are updated for the most quarterly data. They highlight the key economic signposts. I won't go through all the details on them, but they're there for your reference.  
But a few highlights. Obviously, GDP consensus production -- projections continue to improve. And you can see our tremendous best-in-class Bank of America Research team's projections in the upper left-hand corner of Slide 3. You will note also the increases in the consumer spending from our Bank of America customers at the bottom of the slide, which is not only much higher than the prior year when payments began decline, but notably is much higher this year-to-date than year-to-date 2019, a more appropriate comparison. This is a key element of the economic optimism you're seeing reflected in the market.  
Looking back to 2017, after tax reform and other matters, we saw a step-change in money movement by our customers, moving from previously a 5% year-over-year type of growth rate to up to 9% in 2019 versus 2018. Then the pandemic hit and growth of '20 over '19 was only 1%. But so far year-to-date, we're going faster on a larger base than the 2019 9%-plus growth trend at 10% plus. The first quarter was a record dollar amount of money moved by Bank of America consumers. The trend is fully on track, even though the economy has not yet fully reopened. March was a record month of spending by Bank of America consumers and led to the highest ever quarter of consumer spending.  
As you look also on these slides, note on Slide 4, the lower level of card delinquencies has a spike from the expired deferrals in the -- for auto and the company has worked its way through the charge-offs. In addition, early-stage delinquencies that are at or near historic lows suggesting low levels of card charge-offs again next year -- the next quarter, excuse me.  
As the economy has improved, customers have continued to increase their business across our platform. When you think about it from a customer's perspective, which is what we do as a business and comparing across the pandemic period of the last 12 months, we have simply added more customers across every line of business. 
And those customers are more digitally engaged in every business as well. You're going to see later on Slide 17 that we added nearly 1 million active digital customers this quarter, pushing us past 40 million active users led by increased use by boomers and seniors. We have more deposit and cash management customers and balances in every business from consumer to small business to Merrill Lynch to Private Bank, the business bank and the commercial bank across the whole franchise. 
New investment relationships in our consumer businesses, Merrill Edge, platform now total more than 3 million accounts and net new households continue to grow both in Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank. We saw aggregated client flows across our investment platforms of $48 billion in the quarter, bringing those total investment assets over $4 trillion with a range of those capabilities from our digital-only capabilities in our consumer business all the way through the great service and capabilities provided by our 20,000 wealth advisers. 
We added new lending customers, whether through PPP and small business and business banking and along with broader traditional banking relationships, our middle market and corporate clients. And we've helped existing -- the new clients obtain funding taxes market through our sales and trading investment banking platforms. Combined sales and trading investment banking revenue of $7.3 billion is the highest in a decade and is up 28% year-over-year. Jimmy DeMare and Matthew Koder and the teams led by Tom Montag have done a great job there. 
Our customer satisfaction level across all these groups of clients rose during the pandemic and a brand loyalty of our company is at the highest it's been. We also note that our employee engagement is at highest it's been. And we have driven our success to our teammates this quarter, and you'll note in our expenses with another broad-based bonus plan, which is the fourth time we've done this. And with support provided to the communities we serve, our employees' sense of pride in our company and what it does has reached a new level of satisfaction. So with that being said, we do have some work to do in certain areas as we have for the last decade.  
I'd highlight those 3 areas with a couple of comments on each. Those areas are loan growth, net interest income and expense. While loan growth continues to be a lot of liquidity in the system and customer payments remain high, which impacts our loan balances -- and this is across the whole consumers and companies, pipeline origination are improving but remain below prepandemic levels.  
We've reinstated all our credit standards back to where they were before the pandemic. We -- and we remain highly focused on capturing loan growth as the economy expands and continues to recover. The projected economic growth should cause the need for companies to borrow, build inventory, increase hiring and invest and do what they do in their businesses.  
As you can see from Slide 4, Global Banking loans after falling in January appear to have stabilized again in March. We'll have to see how this plays out, but that's the first -- this -- the month of March was a good sign. Pipelines continue to build but line usage remains low. Card applications and mortgage originations continue to increase in each of the last 3 quarters. This, along with mortgage rates moving higher and driving lower prepayments and runoff of current mortgage loan, sets up consumer loan growth. That strong customer liquidity obviously negatively impacts loan growth, but it has a benefit to credit cost. We saw quarter 1 net charge-offs remain below prepandemic levels in dollars and percentage, further supporting reduction in our credit reserves this quarter.  
Now net interest income. We told you 6 months ago that we believe the third quarter would be the trough and has proven to be so. Despite the drawdown of loans and 2 less days of interest in this current quarter, NII was flat to fourth quarter of last year. As we move through 2021, we believe the benefits from a steepened interest rate curve should begin to work its way into our revenue driven by continued investment of our liquidity as well as picking up those lost days of interest.  
And thinking about the expected NII trajectory this year in the year ahead, I would set the stage just as follows: if the forward interest rate curve materializes and we see modest loan growth late -- in the later quarters of the year, we ought to see NII as we exit the fourth quarter of this year $1 billion a quarter higher than the most recent level of $10.3 billion in this quarter.  
The last area I would highlight is expense. We had a large expense this quarter driven by several factors. Some were seasonal impacts, some were good news in that they were volume- and revenue-driven impacts and others were not typical of our normal operating expense due to charges taken. We expect a significant decline as you look forward to the second quarter 2021 in expense. 
We've seen the headcount in our company start to work its way back down due to attrition, especially as the specialized programs begin to run their course. I'd also remind you that the first quarter is typically elevated for payroll tax expense, and this year was about $350 million.  
Next, I would say roughly $500 million of our increase is driven by the improved activity and higher revenue, which, of course, is a positive. It's what we're in the business to do. The items I'd classify as different from our typical costs were as follows. First, given the progress made in our digital engagement with our customers and other customer traffic behavior, we will continue to rationalize real estate for our teammates and our customers and recorded the impairment charge to do that of $240 million in the quarter. Second, a portion of the equity awarded last year to our Global Bank -- before last year's work for our Global Banking and Markets teammates, we had a different retirement rule. And as previously reported, we changed our retirement rule, which caused that to accelerate in full this quarter instead of being amortized over the next 4 years. 
Other costs worth noting include severance costs and a special incentive award recognizing a broad base of 200,000 teammates for their outstanding efforts during this pandemic. That award for the fourth time has built on shared success awards to 3 times prior that was given in 3 previous years. Additionally, COVID expense remains elevated as we continue to help our clients through the various assistant programs established by the government: PPP, unemployment claims, stimulus payment disbursement and PPP forgiveness. 
But broadly speaking, we have done a great job in helping customers to these programs. We've now originated almost 500,000 PPP loans and have obtained forgiveness for our clients for 200,000 of those. We processed $180 billion unemployment claims and $73 billion in EIP stimulus payments. Paul is going to share a bit of the details in the quarter's expenses. But even after absorbing these expenses, our PPNR rose from fourth quarter.  
As we ended last year, we talked about a target for this year's expense aiming 2021 fiscal year expenses to be similar to the $55 billion level in 2020. Given the charges this quarter, we would increase that target by about $1.5 billion. 
However, I just want you to keep some perspective here. We reported $57 billion in expense for the year 2015, 6 years ago, even though all the investments we have made in technology and the build-out of branches in new markets, new sales resources and just having more customers, more activities, the inflation in health care and real estate and other costs, moving our teammates' starting wages from $15 to $20 an hour during that time period. We are targeting 2021 expense at roughly to where it was in 2015, 6 years later and a lot bigger company later. That discipline in operational excellence is what we do, and you should expect us to continue that.  
So in summary, this quarter, we again drove responsible growth. We support our employees by keeping them safe and rewarding their efforts in the pandemic. We support our customers by providing strong balance sheet and resilient systems to transact. We support our communities by supplying critical funding and driving improvement toward racial and social equality with our increase in our $1 billion commitment to $1.25 billion. We've already delivered over $300 million of that commitment. At the same time, we delivered to you, our shareholders, $8 billion in earnings, generating return on tangible common equity of 17% and returned $5 billion in capital to the shareholders in the first quarter. This shows you we can both deliver for you, our shareholders, and deliver for our customers, our employees and our other stakeholders in society.  
With that, let me hand off to Paul to cover the quarter in a little bit more detail."

Good morning and hello, everyone.  I'm starting on Slide 6 and 7 together. As I've done in the past few quarters now, the majority of my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter to reflect how we are progressing through this heal",3051,"Thanks, Brian. Good morning and hello, everyone.  
I'm starting on Slide 6 and 7 together. As I've done in the past few quarters now, the majority of my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter to reflect how we are progressing through this health crisis rather than year-over-year. 
In Q1, we earned net income of $8.1 billion or $0.86 per share, which compares to $5.5 billion or $0.59 per share in Q4. The earnings improvement included strong revenue growth, which more than offset higher expense. Additionally, earnings also included a $2.7 billion reserve release, which resulted in a $1.9 billion provision benefit. 
Revenue growth was driven by strong sales and trading results, record investment banking fees and record asset management fees in our wealth management business while consumer fees faced the seasonal challenge against elevated Q4 holiday spending. With respect to returns, return on tangible common equity was 17.1 and ROA was 130 -- 113 basis points.  
Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 8. The balance sheet expanded $150 billion versus Q4 to $2.97 trillion in total assets. Deposit growth continued to drive the balance sheet higher. Deposits grew $89 billion in the quarter and are up $300 billion from Q1 '20. Note that as deposits continue to grow, loans declined $25 billion from Q4. We deployed some of this excess liquidity into debt securities, which increased $172 billion, while cash balances declined $54 billion and reverse repo also fell. It is also worth noting that our liquidity portfolio is now more than 1/3 of our total balance sheet and has surpassed $1 trillion.  
On a period-end basis, our Global Markets balance sheet increased by $129 billion, coming off year-end seasonal lows and as customers increase their activity with us. Note that on an average basis, it is only up marginally from the prior year and versus Q4, up only $40 billion. Shareholders' equity increased $1 billion. Earnings were mostly offset by $4.5 billion in net capital distributions and a decrease in OCI of $1.8 billion driven by an increase in long bond rates.  
With respect to regulatory ratios, consistent with the fourth quarter, standardized remains our binding approach for us and at 11.8%, our CET1 ratio is our binding metric. While the CET1 ratio declined 15 basis points from Q4, it is 230 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into a $35 billion capital cushion. The benefits to the ratio from an increased level of capital were more than offset by higher RWA from the liquidity deployed into mortgage-backed securities and growth in our Global Markets balance sheet.  
Our supplemental ratio at quarter end was 7% and 6.1% on a pro forma basis, excluding the relief for deposits at the Fed, and investments in treasuries. 6.1% versus the 5% minimum requirement leaves us plenty of room for growth in the balance sheet. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements.  
Let me spend a minute on loans and deposits before moving away from the balance sheet. I will focus on averages as that is what drives NII. With respect to loans, on Slide 9, you can see the downward trend across the year as customer liquidity and accommodating capital markets drove paydowns well above historic levels. I would draw your attention to the linked quarter change. Global Banking commercial loans declined $16 billion, but, as Brian noted earlier, we are seeing pipelines build and balances have stabilized for more than a month. So we are hopeful for a turnaround. 
Loan payments by consumers continue to outpace originations with loans declining $14 billion in Consumer Banking led by mortgages. Plus we saw a normal seasonality in our card products as customers pay down holiday balances with stimulus contributing to the high payment rates.  
But what is also noteworthy is the linked quarter improvement in GWIM and Global Markets. GWIM continued to benefit from security-based lending as well as custom lending. In Global Markets, we relaxed some hold limits as the economy continued to strengthen. 
With respect to deposits on Slide 10, we continue to see tremendous growth across the client base not only because of growth in the money supply, but also because we are adding new accounts and attracting liquidity from existing customers.  
Turning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q1 was $10.2 billion; $10.3 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income declined $1.9 billion from Q1 '20 driven by the rate environment and lower loan balances, but was relatively flat to Q4. Compared to Q4, we see this as a good outcome considering the headwinds of 2 fewer days of interest, lower loan levels and modestly higher premium amortization expense. These headwinds were mostly offset by the deployment of excess deposits into securities and a benefit of approximately $100 million from a legacy litigation settlement involving some securities. The net interest yield was relatively stable, declining 3 basis points from Q4, and it was flat if you exclude Global Markets.  
Reducing cash and repo, we deployed some of our excess liquidity into securities in Q1, split across treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Securities increased $172 billion from year-end. On a weighted average basis relative to what we were earning on the cash, we improved our yield on that roughly $170 billion by approximately 115 basis points. Now the improvement in yield could have been higher, however. But similar to Q4 purchases, we hedged a portion of the treasuries purchased with swaps effectively keeping those securities floating.  
As you will note, given all the deposit growth and low rates, our asset sensitivity is rising. Our asset sensitivity to rising our rates remained significant, highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships. Sensitivity is lower from the year-end levels as higher rates and deployment of liquidity into securities increased our baseline. So the sensitivity no longer assumes that liquidity is available to invest at higher rates.  
A few thoughts on NII for the remainder of the year. But first, please note that these forward-looking comments on NII assume that the forward interest rate curve materializes, that the economy continues to recover and that we have some fairly modest loan growth in the back half of the year. 
Given those assumptions, we expect some improvement in premium amortization across the next few quarters, if mortgage rates follow a forward curve. At $1.5 billion in Q1, write-off for premium continued to be a headwind as mortgage prepayments remained quite high. So forward-looking comments include a lot of material moving parts from rates, loan levels and premium amortization. But as Brian said, we believe 4Q '21 NII could rise by as much as $1 billion from this quarter's level.  
Okay. Turning to Slide 12 and expenses. Q1 expenses were $15.5 billion, $1.6 billion higher than Q4. I will add to some of the remarks Brian mentioned earlier. First, Q1 included the normal seasonal elevation of payroll tax expense of about $250 million. Second, as a result of the current period's solid revenue performance and a better outlook for revenue for the remainder of the year we accrued for higher incentives and experienced increased processing costs, this added roughly $500 million to the quarter. Third, we incurred some expense that differs from our typical operating expense. We reversed a decision made on some 2020 incentive comp awards, making certain portions of those awards retirement eligible. This accelerated approximately $300 million of expense into Q1 that would have been expensed over 4 years. 
We also recorded an impairment charge of $240 million for real estate realization, and we incurred $160 million of severance charge as we move back towards business as usual with respect to our headcount. This is based on an expectation that as roles get eliminated through process improvement, some associates might choose severance over opportunities to work in a different role in the company.  
Lastly, our COVID costs remained largely unchanged as modest declines in some employee-related costs were offset by costs associated with restarting PPP originations and forgiveness and additional unemployment claim processing. COVID costs are proving a little slower to safely reduce than we had hoped.  
Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. Government stimulus and support has helped customers get through this pandemic. That support, coupled with our customer assistance programs and years of underwriting discipline under responsible growth, has resulted in low net charge-offs. Net charge-offs this quarter were $833 million or 37 basis points of average loans and were lower than Q4. And they were 14% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019, which was the last quarter before the pandemic despite an expected increase in card losses of $229 million in Q1. With the exception of a small uptick in small business and the card losses, losses in every other category declined from Q4.  
Provision was a 1.9% benefit in the quarter as an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, and lower loan balances resulted in a $2.7 billion release of credit reserves. Total consumer reserve releases were $1.4 billion driven primarily by card while the commercial release was $1.2 billion. Our allowance as a percent of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.8%, which still remained well above the 1.27% where we began 2020 following our day 1 adoption of CECL.  
With respect to reserve setting assumptions, we continued to include a multitude of scenarios. Based upon our Q1 weighting of those scenarios, GDP is forecasted to return to its 4Q '19 level by the end of 2021. The weighted scenario also assumes that the unemployment rate at the end of 2021 will be just north of 6%, which is in line with March unemployment rate. For 2022, the weighted average scenario assumed unemployment just under 5.5% as we exit the year. To the extent the economic outlook and the remaining uncertainties continue to improve, we expect our reserve levels will move lower.  
On Slide 14, we show the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Overall, consumer net charge-offs rose $211 million from Q4. And absent the $229 million increase noted in card, other losses declined. With respect to card losses, given the reduction in late-stage delinquencies in the 180-day pipeline, we expect card losses to be lower in Q2. NPLs remained low despite a small uptick due to consumer real estate deferrals, which have limited expected loss content given healthy LTV ratios.  
Moving to commercial. Net charge-offs declined $296 million from the fourth quarter as the portfolio stabilize with reservable criticized exposure and NPLs declining in the quarter. Overall, given the environment, the asset quality of our commercial book remains solid, and 90% of the exposures are either investment grade or collateralized.  
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 15. Consumer Banking produced another strong quarter in terms of customer deposits and investment flows, reflecting the strength of our brand, the innovation around digital and deployment of specialists in our centers, all of which has enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the increase in customer liquidity. The segment earned $2.7 billion in Q1 versus $2.6 billion in Q4 as the provision benefit more than offset lower mostly seasonal revenue and higher expense.  
Revenue declined 2%, reflecting lower card income from Q4's elevated holiday spending. Expenses moved higher as a result of real estate impairment costs as well as seasonally higher payroll tax expense. This also caused an increase in our cost of deposits this quarter to 142 basis points. Absent the impairment charge, the cost of deposits would have been 131 basis points. As expected, net charge-offs rose from Q4 due to the flow through of the bold in-car delinquencies, as noted earlier, at a $1.4 billion reserve release resulted in a $617 million provision benefit in the quarter.  
On Slide 16, you can see the significant increase in consumer deposits and investments. Average deposits of $924 billion are up 25% compared to Q1 '20 with nearly 2/3 of that growth in checking. Rate paid is down to 3 basis points as 56% of the deposits are low interest checking. Lastly, note the growth throughout the quarter as average deposits were up $39 billion from Q4. We covered loans earlier, so I would just note investment balances of $324 billion are up 53% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering. 
As Brian noted and as you can see on Slide 17, we continued to see improvement in digital enrollment this quarter. 70% of our consumer households use some part of our digital platform this year. We continued to see digital payments and Zelle taking hold across all our businesses. Zelle consumer dollar volume is up 72% year-over-year. Small business is up 182% year-over-year. And 90% of our business-to-consumer payments in Global Banking are now made via Zelle. As you can see, our digital assistant, Erica, continues to add users, capabilities and usage. Plus, we are applying our success with Erica to other businesses as well. 
Okay. Turning to Wealth Management. We continued to deliver solid organic growth, serve the comprehensive banking and investing needs of clients and manage risk responsibly. We experienced strong household -- new household acquisition in a virtual environment and a very competitive market. This resulted in a record quarter with respect to total client flows, including near-record AUM flows and record AUM fees. Net income of $881 million improved 6% from Q4 as revenue growth and improvement in provision exceeded an increase in expense. 
With respect to revenue, the record AUM fees were complemented by higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses increased driven by revenue-related costs and seasonally elevated payroll tax. 
Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank both continued to grow clients as we remained a provider of choice for affluent clients. Client balances rose to a record $3.5 trillion, up $822 billion year-over-year driven by higher market levels as well as strong client flows. During Q1, our advisers added over 6,000 net new households in Merrill Lynch and nearly 700 net new relationships in the Private Bank. 
Let's skip to Slide 20, which is a new page that highlights our progress to digitally engaged wealth management clients. In Merrill and the Private Bank, our clients and advisers have both embraced the value of a digitally enabled relationship in which digital tools are critical mechanisms for fast, safe and secure interactions. 
Our Wealth clients are some of the most highly engaged clients in the franchise with 80% of Merrill households digitally active. In Q1, we saw a record number of log-ins. Clients are logging in to trade, check balances and originate loans with ease, all of which can be done through a simplified sign-in. We continue to enhance and modernize the capabilities for both the client and adviser, and these capabilities are becoming key differentiators as well as being recognized by third parties. 
Moving to Global Banking on Slide 21. The business earned nearly $2.2 billion in Q1, improving $500 million from Q4 driven by a provision benefit and solid revenue. While loan growth has been challenging, deposit growth has been strong and investment banking revenue exceeded previous records. The team produced $2.2 billion in firm-wide investment banking fees, growing year-over-year by 62% and 20% over Q4. 
Looking at revenue and comparing to Q4, despite the higher IB fees, total revenue declined 3% driven by the -- by weather-related impairments on some tax advantage investments. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $1.2 billion in Q1. Importantly, net charge-offs of $36 million fell by $278 million from Q4. 
Noninterest expense rose 14% from Q4, reflecting the incentive award changes noted earlier. Additionally, the strong IB performance and improved outlook and seasonally elevated payroll tax increased personnel costs in Q1. 
Looking at the balance sheet on Slide 22. Average deposits moved up relative to Q4 as customers remained highly liquid. Year-over-year, deposits are up an impressive 27% while rate paid is at an historic low. As noted earlier, loans declined early in the quarter but stabilized late in the quarter. 
Wholesale digital engagement continued to accelerate and usage continue to grow driven by the same ease, safety and convenience of our digital banking capabilities that our consumer -- customers enjoy. 
We present some wholesale digital highlights on Slide 23. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 24. Results reflected the highest revenue quarter in over a decade with solid year-over-year improvement and an even more significant increase relative to Q4. As I usually do, I will talk about the segment's results excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was negligible but the year-ago quarter had a $300 million gain. Global Markets produced $2.1 billion of earnings in Q1, more than double the level of Q4 and up 39% from Q1 '20. 
Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was up 26% on higher sales and trading and equity underwriting fees. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by volume-related expenses in both card and trading and an acceleration in expense from changes in the incentive awards. 
Sales and trading contributed $5.1 billion to revenue, increasing 17% year-over-year driven by a 22% improvement in FICC and a 10% increase in equities. FICC results reflected gains in commodities and strong results in credit, mortgage and municipal products versus relatively -- relative weakness in the year ago period. This was partially offset by reduced activity and trading opportunities in other macro products. The strength in equities was driven by a strong trading performance in cash. The business produced strong returns, delivering a 22% return on capital in Q1. 
Finally, on Slide 26, we show All Other, which reported profits of $257 million. Compared to Q1 '20, the improvement in net income was driven by a larger tax benefit given an expected increase in ESG activities this year. The year ago quarter also included a modest reserve build. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 12%. And excluding the tax credits driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been 23%. For the full year, absent any changes in the current tax laws or other unusual items, we expect an effective tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 12%. 
Okay. With that, let's go to Q&A."

So in terms of the second quarter, you're -- I think you're about right. We expect expenses just north of $14 billion, depending on the revenue environment and the amount of progress we make in taking down the COVID costs. 
In terms of your comment about our ability to manage expenses, we agree with you. I think as Brian noted in his opening comments, we've managed not to increase expenses for years now, and we've absorbed merit increases, investments, minimum wage, improvement in benefits, all the dramatic increase in processing volumes, digital increases. So we're -- we are sort of -- as talked about on other calls, we've been using operational excellence and other initiatives to basically fund the investments in our future. 
I think our goal here is to clearly create operating leverage over an extended period of time. We've talked about maybe expenses rising maybe at a 1% level per year. And I think that's probably the best guidance we can give you. Absent again some of the ins and outs, we had a lot of variability this quarter. And obviously, we're sitting here in the middle of a pandemic with a lot of COVID expenses that have been a little bit more sticky than we had all hoped. But they're going to come out. There's no question about that. And so we'll get back to kind of a normal level of expenses and a very reasonable growth level over the long term relative to revenue."

But the reality of what's having the impact now, frankly, is that draw rates on lines of credit and stuff are low in companies that are operating well. There's companies that still need to get through the pandemic impact just aren't using the lines, and that's bumped along the bottom. We've shown you these long-term charts. 
So we feel good about our middle market and our business banking businesses and small businesses. We feel good about they're getting set up as the economy continues to improve and the growth will come back and the services and rate we can provide are competitive. And so I don't think that will ever change. And I think it reaches further. Sometimes it reaches the step we won't do as a company, obviously, in terms of leverage -- extra amounts of leverage and things like that. But we feel we're very strong and competitive.

You just can't go back to our reserve level on day 1, which I think was 127 basis points, if I'm not mistaken, and just apply that to today's numbers.

So I think you should expect that even on a pro forma basis, you could see the low 60s, you expect it to move back in the levels you see here as we move through the year, pick up the NII. And then if rates start to move up, you'd even pick up more."

And then salespeople. Now that's what we probably lightened up last year just because the opportunities weren't there.

We've got some flexibility because we do have liquidity. We can go faster or slower on in terms of investing.

Through the end of Q1, securities were up $380 billion and cash and equivalents were up $150 billion to $300 billion. 
But as I said in the remarks, we bought treasuries, but on about $150 billion of those treasuries, we have interest rate swaps. So you can really think of the $300 billion of cash as being $450 billion in terms of our ability to fund loan growth or invest return or other uses.

We just want to make sure that we can deliver for our customers no matter what happens. And I think we've been trying to do that as we've gone through this pandemic. Again, it's all about balancing liquidity, capital and earnings."

In terms of the commercial side, there are still the affected industries that we're watching carefully. But everywhere else, I think we're back to prepandemic. And in light of the size of our company, in light of the need for loan growth, I think we're relaxed a little bit on some hold levels, particularly in Global Markets where they have more of a moving than storage mentality around loans and what they do for customers. 
So yes, we're just taking a few maybe bigger positions than we might have otherwise taken prepandemic, but there's no real change in the underwriting standards. The company is bigger. We have more liquidity. We have more capital. So we think all of this is appropriate."

What's going to drive the company's P&L also on the consumer side, especially, if you look at by business, so the Wealth Management business actually has grown a little bit. You got the commercial business",526,"Just across loan growth, just to think about it. What's going to drive the company's P&L also on the consumer side, especially, if you look at by business, so the Wealth Management business actually has grown a little bit. You got the commercial business down and consumers down. Consumer is largely down because of mortgage churn, but the big thing that happened is cards came down. 
And what's been interesting to watch now -- and so because we pulled back this time last year, unemployment went to 15%, everybody pulled back their underlying criteria, Matt. We've now reinstated, as Paul said. But so what's happened? We did 1 million units of new cards a quarter. Going into the last year's first quarter, it fell as low as 400. It's back up to 600 and change already and moving north on that. And if you look by month, it's stacking back up. So that's -- and if you look at where that's coming from, obviously, the branch system, which basically was run at around 2,500 of the 4,300 branches for the last 6, 8 months, 9 months is only catching back up as it opens up and sales come in. So that bodes well on the -- obviously, on the consumer side on the cards, which are most important. 
Mortgages production will continue to kick back up and prepayments will slow down at a slightly higher rate environment, you'll see that bodes well there. GWIM has done -- has some of the mortgage aspects. But on the type of lending that GWIM does to affluent and wealthy people, they've done a good job, and they've actually seen that grow. 
And then you go to the business banking middle market, and that's all line usage. And so that should come through if -- in order for the economy to expand, 7% this year is what -- which -- what our Bank of America team has. At some point, companies have to access capital to meet that final demand, and you should see that usage come up. So even in things like the car business, because there just aren't the cars to sell, you're seeing line usage down at lower level. 
So as you think across the things that hold levels and things that Paul is talking about enable us to push a little harder just because of the sheer size of our company. But if you think about it, that the -- think about the flywheel that we have in the company as a production engine having had necessarily to be slowed down in the crisis with 15% unemployment peaks and the final demand being crushed in the second quarter of last year, then turning that crank back up and just watch that flywheel start to take off, it's -- that's what we have good confidence in terms of getting right back on loan growth. But if you added all that together and we grew 5%, it'd be $45 billion of loans. 
So to Paul's point, you still have tremendous excess capacity because the deposit growth is so strong on core transactional deposits of the commercial loan consumers."

So Betsy -- and the 2 are not mutually exclusive at all, except way at the margin way away from where we are now. But with stock price increases and all the things that go into that calculation, as you all know, they're not all related to straight risk in terms of sheer size and stock -- just things that go in. It is harder to maintain where we were at the end of last year. And you might expect that we may move up a bucket and take advantage of that by actually expanding the business in the markets business, if -- where the opportunity is there based on the capabilities that Jimmy and the team and Tom and team have put together. 
So why would you do that? The reason why we do that is our clients have been growing, and we kept about 1/3 of the size. But -- and even if you took away some of the growth just due to the deposit things, it has come down around 20% the size of the company. And the idea is to keep it in synergy and synchronize it with the company over all size, but the company has grown around it another step. And so we've told Tom -- Tom and the team are working on ideas to continue to do that. We stay -- we're a little bigger now than we were at year-end, obviously, first quarter activity, but you shouldn't expect us to come down. 
Now those ratios aren't effective for a bit of time here. So we'll see how it plays out. But if the opportunities are there, we'll take them. The team has done a great job and managed the risk well. If you look at the trading results for the quarter, look at it for last quarter, look at throughout the pandemic, they've done a great job in managing risk, who are balancing -- and we're proud of them and the work they've done, and we're going to support them with some more capital."

The reason why we do this is to serve our clients and do a great job and it flows through the numbers. As Mike said earlier, the idea that we run this huge consumer business at a cost advantage, which is significant due to the digitization of all the consumer activity, due to the way customers interact with us, the way we can help them, the way we can give guideposts and frankly, the way we can take the fee structure out and that's -- we dropped over our fees dramatically. Over the years, we made up for it in terms of efficiency and other types of things. 
And so we get the word out. We tell everybody we win all kinds of awards and the list go on and on in terms of the different ranking agencies. And you've seen it in the Merrill Edge growth is over $300 billion now. And so our job is do a great job for our customers. And I think I'll leave it to you and your colleagues to debate the relative merits of fintech versus ours. 
But I will tell you, for a company making $8 billion and having 40 million new digital customers, are fully active on the consumer side, 0.5 million on the digital -- on the corporate side, the impact on our ability to have expenses be flat from -- even with extra money of $1.5 billion or so in the first quarter from 6 years ago, shows the impact of the ability to digitize this company. And we learned more about it this in last year in areas that we didn't do. So we'll keep pushing it out there. You can keep telling the story, but the reality is, is that the #1 person we want to understand is our customers, and that means attrition. Attrition of customers is way down, the penetration of the wallet is way up. Just look on the wealth management statistics we threw and see how they've adopted to it. These are major changes, the size of which don't exist much out there. So we'll keep pounding away, you keep telling the story, we'll keep telling the story. But the key is it's producing, it's producing the kind of earnings we're producing and the kind of efficiency we're producing, which continues to be down to our benefit going forward. 
The neatest thing about this stuff is where we go next with -- where we've been going with it. So Erica, there's just nothing close to it out there and driving -- with volumes and things. Zelle, if you look at the charts on the pages and show it. And so it's the usage and the personalization and the ability to help people manage their payments and their things for the mass market and their investments. 
The -- so we feel good about it. We'll tell the story as often as we can. But the reality is I just would like to see us keep growing the number of customers and driving it and driving it on an integrated basis. We're putting major investments in a couple of areas. We had to improve merchant services, payments on the commercial side, at the merchant level, and we're putting major investments in the 401(k) technology to push that. We're #7 in that business. That's the lowest market position of any business we have, #6 or 7 of whatever we are. So these are major investments. We're making hundreds of millions of dollars a year that go into that expense base, but are paid for by the efficiency of the core businesses."

Remember, that's one of the reasons why the expense run rate moved up by $800 million, $900 million a year that people forget about is because we brought that in last year for half a year and it wasn't in 2 years ago. But the reason why we bought it back is really to invest around the platform. 
So what's exciting about it is things like the acquisition to take us in the medical area. What's exciting about it is the ability to actually sell it through this sales force without having to have a non-owned sales force selling it in our small business, in our business banking colleagues that thousands of people out there can help deliver the product. 
And then what's really exciting is the integration of payment scheme that we've been working on for commercial payments. So it's the integration of the B2B, Zelle to small business and all these payment gateways, which is outside the traditional merchant business, but you have to be completely flexible along all payment schemes to actually root it much more favorable to the merchant with very low cost to them and real-time contemporary as value exchange. So what we're doing with real-time payments and Zelle in combination into the business platform through the payment gateways, these are all exciting things. And you go larger and it's different elements and blockchain payments and everything else. 
So that's the core of the business on the commercial side, but it goes all the way from small business all the way up to large companies. And so that investment was part of that, the new investment is part of that, and you'll expect us to keep driving at the -- the implementation. The good news is we're getting the network effect of Zelle and things like that. When you look at those pages that Zelle's half the credit card charge volume used by our consumers to make payments now, noodle on that for a minute. I think 35 million credit card people out there charging their Zelle, if -- reaching half of it. Checks down 25% over the last couple of years in terms of checks written volume by our consumers. It's -- so you get the network effect of that and then you get the merchants to use it with real time. So that -- this is all part of a thing that Tom win and Mark Monaco and team are leading. If that's Zelle on the commercial side is that you should expect to see a lot. A lot of investment has been made, including a major replacement of system, that's coming through the P&L this year and the change in bringing the people on -- fully on balance sheet. And a lot of investment will be made including acquisitions like we just made."

It's a little different by stratification of earnings power of the household. And so that's to be spent. That bodes well for economic reopening and stuff. And has it had an effect on balances in card and stuff? Yes, because consumers have used to pay down their debt in part of what it has been spent -- has been spent to pay down card balances. And then with the limited travel, it's just not getting as much use. 
The good news is you watch January to February and March with the buyers and vaccine pathways come into for -- with the -- you're starting to see the purchase numbers go up. And the payments rate, way up, as you observed last year, 30% through last year and this quarter. But you'd expect that, that might be more constant, and the usage rate will go up and start to drive some balance growth, which is good news. 
So the good news is that consumers are healthy from every aspect. We have no deferrals left except in the mortgage business. So all the debate we had about those last year. This time, through the system, delinquencies down, consumers sitting with money in their accounts and the economy open up, which bodes well, and that's what you saw in the retail sales numbers today. And you expect that number -- those numbers to even be higher in the month of April because March was a partly reopened month and the weather isn't too pleasant in the Northeast to go out and eat even if you want to eat outside in northern parts of the central country."

Today, Bank of America reported $9.2 billion in after-tax net income or $1.03 per diluted share. These results included a few items worth highlighting, and I'm on Page 2 ahead of Paul going through the details. First, as asset quality continue to improve and the economy continue to recover, we released $2.2 billion of credit reserves established in the first half of last year. The idea that a company with our credit quality and other industry participants would be releasing reserves this quarter is not new news, but the reality is at BAC we're seeing credit quality levels that are very strong. Net charge-offs fell to 25-year low as a percentage of loans, not just raw dollar amount.
Let me mention a few items I don't believe were industry-wide or expected at BAC. We recorded a $2 billion positive income tax adjustment following last month's enactment of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate to 25%. This required a remeasurement of our deferred tax asset, which just reverses the write-downs from previous years when the tax rates were lower. In addition, our expense level included 2 things I would note. These add up to about $800 million. With our strong results and the tax benefit, we took the opportunity to prefund $500 million to our charitable foundation. This accelerates our planned funding for not only the rest of this year but for next year as well. This is not new money, just utilizing some of the tax benefit to cover future expense.
We also recorded roughly $300 million of expense associated with processing transactional card claims related to state unemployment benefits. This represents, to a large degree, a catch-up as we move through claim backlogs.
Away from these items, we produced another quarter of solid earnings and showed evidence of good client activity in an economy that continue to recover from the pandemic. Now as we all know, the health care crisis has shown improvement and the economy has recovered. Progress on vaccinations, along with the continued support of fiscal monetary policies, has promoted a full and speedy recovery and return to economic health.
We like others are reopening our facilities, and we're seeing more products being sold by our teammates in addition to the continued digital engagement at very high levels. Our advisers and bankers and relationship managers are once again meeting with clients face-to-face, building even the stronger relationships. We are seeing customer demand continue to grow given the opportunities our companies see.
I want to take a minute or 2 on the economy and -- if you go to Slide 3. We have included a few slides highlighting our customer data. Let me hit a few highlights. The GDP growth estimates by our BofA Securities Research team for the second quarter stand at 10% and stand at 7% for the full year 2021. The reopenings are driving projections of an economy has continued to grow to rate above the pre-pandemic periods into '23.
Also, the unemployment rate dropped below 6% this quarter is projected by economies to continue to fall. You also note the stability to increase consumer spending from our own BAC customers, which is not only much higher than the same periods in 2020 which you would expect, but is notably 22% higher than the first half of '21 compared to 2019. And you can see that in the lower right of the page. That growth rate in '19 was already growing strongly before the pandemic.
A few comments regarding the characteristics of spending, I think, are interesting. We are halfway through the year, and the total payments through those -- through all the different means are $1.8 trillion. That's 60% of last year's level. Last year, indeed, was a record even though it was suppressed in various periods when business were shut down.
More specifically, for the second quarter, the total BAC consumer small business payments set a fourth quarterly consecutive record, reaching $976 billion, up 41% year-over-year and 23% over '19. The trend has also continued into early July. Spending accelerated as COVID vaccinations increase, business reopen and domestic travel increase. Combined spend at retailers and services comprises over 50% of debit and credit card spending a portion of the total spend. That increased 27% over 2019 second quarter but did slow a bit towards the end of the quarter as consumers moved their attention and started taking summer leisure trips and activity.
You can see that by noting a return of travel and entertainment spending, which comprise about 10% of debit credit card spend. You can see where recovery in travel remains below 2000 -- while recovering travel remains below 2019 spending levels.
Domestic travel up a bit. As of mid-June, domestic airline purchases were up 8% over 2019, while international airline purchase on our cards are still down approximately 40%, showing the difference of the progress against the war on the virus in United States versus other places.
Now let's go to Slide 4. We just put this chart in to show you that the consumers are paying their bills. We've shown this each quarter so you could see that the actual card delinquency levels continue to edge down even as people are out in circulating the count.
Before we go to Paul, I want to comment specifically on 3 areas of interest to you: loan growth, NII and expense. And we can do that on Pages 5 and 6. So first on loans. Paul and I are going to show you the average loans. Paul will show you that later. End-of-period loans, I'll show you in a minute and long-term trends, which are on Page 5.
What all these figures point to is accelerating growth during the quarter as we've spoken about on occasion. This quarter, we saw loan levels across most every business move past stabilization begin to make progress. Companies need to build inventory, hire workers to meet the growing customer demand. This virtuous circle of hiring workers and meeting customer spending will help drive the economy, and hopefully, will resolve more line usage on ones.
You can see the path on Slide 5 of loans since the pandemic started in March 2020. As you can see, all of them are turning up in recent months.
But moving to Slide 6, you see the more traditional detail for our company. Let's start on the lower right-hand side of that slide and talking about the commercial portfolio. Commercial loan balances after adjusting for the reductions in PPP loans for quarter 2 forgiveness grew $15 billion. This is led by Global Markets client borrowing activity. But beyond that and still excluding the PPP loan forgiveness, middle-market lending group and our Business Banking team finally had growth in the month of June 2021, a first since last March. 
Fueling some of this improvement is calling effective relationship managers that have increased their calling efforts. We're now aggressively calling on targeted prospects. And with vaccination progress, face-to-face meetings have nearly doubled each month over the past 90 days. Commercial loans of wealth management clients grew an impressive 5% in the quarter as these customers borrow through our custom lending products.
In small business, our practice solutions group, which supports medical dental and veterinary practices, has been building throughout the quarter and small business production overall is back to pre-pandemic levels.
Turning to consumer loans. Overall growth of end-of-period loans was $6 billion. Card loans grew with increased spending even as customer payment percentages remained high. Auto originations have grown fairly consistently, although recently lower dealer supplies have affected that.
Mortgage balance growth, which is a big part of our loan portfolio in consumer, has been a challenge in the low-rate environment with high refinancing volumes exceeding originations in past quarters. We are only modestly down this quarter as our origination volumes are finally overcoming the payoffs.
We are pleased with the trajectory through the period, and that feeds into the second half of the year. While average loans drive -- that loan balances during the third quarter will drive NII, it's good to start with a trend that has reversed the past quarter's decline.
On NII, the good news is that we correctly called the bottom 3 quarters ago. We told you that we thought the third quarter of 2020 would be the trough. Despite the volatility and lower-rate moves and significant decline in loans, we've been able to hold NII at that level or more for 3 straight quarters. We expect it to move higher, and Paul is going to discuss that later.
The other area I would comment on is expense. We saw -- on a reported basis, we saw a $0.5 billion in expense reduction from first quarter of '21 to second quarter of '21.
This quarter, we also had around $800 million in notable items for the aforementioned charitable contribution on employment claims process. Absent those notable items, expense would have been down about $1 billion and in the low $14 billion range. This is a level we are targeting to expense as we move through the rest of the year.
In the second half of the year, as we normalize our operations, we'll continue to return our business as usual, working on process improvements that allow us to reduce our head count and to continue to fund franchise investments. Head count in the second quarter, including -- excluding the summer interns, declined by roughly 2,500 or over 1% from the first quarter.
So the messages for this quarter is straightforward. The organic growth machine that we had rolling before the pandemic hit is reemerging as the economy normalizes. We start to be careful to ensure that the war on the virus [ stays won ], but we're seeing great trends. In retail and preferred and small business, we saw a strong production of core transaction accounts above pre-pandemic loans. This quarter was our best net sales growth in checking account since the second quarter 2015.
We saw cards production about 90% overall pre-pandemic. But net cards net of runoff were positive, the first time since the quarter -- first quarter of 2020 when we entered the pandemic. We saw growth in new Merrill Edge investment accounts, and Paul will talk to you about that. We saw good mortgage production. We saw a stronger digital activity.
In wealth management, we saw household growth and strong flows continue to grow even with the use of our banking platform to grow its credit side. In Global Banking, we saw loan growth and new production coming on, while line usage still remains very low. We saw investment banking closed this quarter with record pipelines.
In markets, we saw a strong first half even compared to 2020 and a strong second quarter, albeit with more normal seasonal impact. So normalizing more like '19 but still higher. And we saw head count come down as operational excellence kicks in by over 2,000 people. We have work to do to keep driving down the core expenses and getting out the net COVID expenses over time. And above all, due to responsible growth, we saw strong core credit metrics. So as the economy continues to recover, we are seeing our organic growth engine kick back in.
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul."

I'm starting on Slide 7. As I have done in the past few quarters, the majority of my comments -- or excuse me, my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter rather than year-over-year given the pandemic.Since Brian",3434,"Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 7. As I have done in the past few quarters, the majority of my comments -- or excuse me, my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter rather than year-over-year given the pandemic.
Since Brian already covered a lot of the income statement, I will just add a couple of comments on revenue and returns. Revenue was down 6% from Q1. The decline was driven by lower sales and trading results that more than offset solid consumer and wealth management revenue, which was a result of higher card income and AUM fees. It is also worth noting that while investment banking fees were down from a record Q1 level, they remained strong at more than $2 billion in Q2. Lastly, when comparing revenue against the prior year quarter, remember, Q2 '20 included a $704 million gain on the sale of some mortgage loans.
With respect to returns, our return on tangible common equity was 20% and ROA was 123 basis points, both benefiting from the positive tax adjustment and sizable reserve release.
Moving to Slide 8. Balance sheet expanded $60 billion versus Q1 to a little more than $3 trillion in total assets. Deposit growth of $24 billion supported $16 billion of loan growth, while the combination of market-based funding and long-term debt issuance supported expansion of the balance sheet and Global Markets. Other notable movements on the balance sheet included the continued deployment of excess cash into securities. Securities increased $83 billion, while cash declined $66 billion.
Driven by the additional deposit growth, our liquidity portfolio remained above $1 trillion or 1/3 of the balance sheet. Shareholders' equity increased $3 billion as earnings outpaced capital distribution. Capital distributions of $5.8 billion were limited to the average of earnings in the previous 4 quarters for regulatory guidelines and were well below the $9 billion earned in the quarter.
With respect to regulatory ratios. Consistent with Q1, standardized remained the binding approach for us and was down a little less than 30 basis points from Q1. While the CET1 ratio declined 30 basis points in Q1, it remained 200 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into a $31 billion capital cushion. While book value rose $3 billion, regulatory capital was up $1 billion as the $2 billion tax adjustment did not benefit CET1 capital.
Higher RWA from the liquidity deployed to securities growth in our markets balance sheet and higher GWIM loan activity more than offset the benefit to the ratio from higher capital.
Our supplemental leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.9%, dropping from the prior quarter primarily due to the removal of the regulatory relief. 5.9% versus a minimum requirement of 5% equates to approximately $600 billion of balance sheet capacity, which leaves us plenty of room for growth. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements.
Turning to Slide 9. Brian reviewed ending loan balances earlier, so I will focus on average balances, which are more closely linked to NII. As you look at the year-over-year trends, note that these numbers include PPP loans, which have been moving lower now for 2 quarters driven by forgiveness. You can see the change in those PPP levels on the slide.
Focusing on the linked quarter change. While loans on an ending basis were up nicely on an average basis, even with a $3 billion decline in PPP balances, loans were flat. Wealth Management and Global Markets experienced the most notable improvements. GWIM continued to benefit from security-based lending as well as custom lending while continuing to have solid mortgage performance.
In Global Markets, we looked for opportunities to lend to clients against a number of different asset types, creating mostly investment-grade exposures as a good use of our liquidity. In consumer, we saw credit card loans stabilize for the first time in more than a year as credit spending ramped up and new accounts continued to build across the quarters. Quarterly new account levels are nearly back to 2019 levels.
With respect to deposits on Slide 10, we continue to see significant growth across the client base not only because of the growth in the money supply, but also because we added new accounts and attracted increased liquidity from existing customers.
I would just note that the linked quarter growth on a spot basis included a headwind of about $34 billion from customer income tax outflow. Normally, we see deposits decline in the second quarter given tax payments. But this year, we saw strong growth even with these tax payments.
Turning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII for Q2 was $10.2 billion, $10.3 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income declined a little more than $600 million from Q2 '20 driven by the rate environment and lower loan balances but showed modest improvement from Q1. Year-over-year comparisons beginning next quarter are expected to improve nicely as Q3 '20 has proven to be the nadir for NII. And we are expecting NII improvement in Q3 and Q4.
Compared to Q1, the benefit of an additional day of interest and liquidity deployed was offset by a lower level of PPP loan forgiveness, the absence of proceeds recorded in NII from the Q1 litigation settlement and modestly higher premium amortization expense. The net interest yield declined 7 basis points from Q1 driven by the continued addition of lower-yielding debt securities in Q1 and Q2 and a larger global markets balance sheet. Remember, as part of our liquidity that remain, I would include about $150 billion of debt securities hedged to floating, which earned a bit more than cash.
As you'll note, given all the deposit growth at low rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remain significant and mostly unchanged from Q1, highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships. Let me give you a couple of thoughts around NII for the back half of the year.
Last quarter, when the forward rate environment was 30 to 40 basis points higher, we told you we were targeting NII at roughly $1 billion higher in Q4 of this year. This quarter's loan growth is encouraging and supportive of this target, and the slowdown in mortgage prepayments should also help improve NII. So while we still think getting NII $1 billion higher by 4Q is possible, admittedly, the recent significant decline in long-end rates presents a challenge. This possibility, of course, assumes loans continue to grow in the second half and rates don't move lower from here.
To improve our chances, we could decide to deploy additional liquidity at higher fixed rates in the coming weeks and months as we evaluate the trade-offs between liquidity, capital and earnings.
Turning to Slide 12 and expenses. Q2 expenses were $15 billion, $0.5 billion lower than Q1. while lower than Q1, the combination of the $500 million contribution to the foundation and the nearly $300 million increase in costs associated with unemployment claims processing kept expenses above the low $14 billion target shared with you last quarter. Outside of these 2 items, expense was lower driven by the absence of a few Q1 items: seasonal payroll taxes, the real estate impairment charge and the acceleration of expense due to incentive comp award changes. Additionally, lower incentive comp and severance costs also contributed to the decline.
Lastly, our COVID costs saw a modest decline as some pandemic-related employee programs began to roll off, but this was mitigated to a certain degree by preparation costs for associates returning to the office.
As we go to the segments, I would just note that the sizable foundation contribution was allocated to the lines of business, and therefore, negatively impact comparisons to prior quarters. As we look forward, we continue to invest at a high rate in people and in technology and in new financial centers. We are seeing the benefits of these investments. And now as we move forward, we expect that natural attrition will allow us to reduce head count as we transition back to a more normal business environment. As Brian mentioned, excluding summer interns, our head count this quarter moved down by about 2,500 people.
Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. Nothing but good news to report here. Net charge-offs this quarter fell to $595 million or 27 basis points of average loans. This is the lowest loss rate in more than 2 decades. That is 28% lower than Q1 and more than 30% below the second quarter of 2019. Our credit card loss rate was 2.67, and several loan product categories were in recovery positions this quarter.
Provision was $1.6 billion -- was a $1.6 billion benefit -- net benefit driven by the continued improvement and the macroeconomic outlook, which resulted in the $2.2 billion release of credit reserves, split fairly evenly between consumer and commercial loans. Our allowance as a percent of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.55%, which is still well above the 1.27%, which was the level as we've begun 2020 following our day 1 adoption of CECL. And as a reminder, the mix of our loans has also changed since CECL day 1. To the extent the economic outlook and remaining uncertainties continue to improve, we expect our reserve levels could move lower.
Okay. On Slide 14, we show the credit quality metrics for both the consumer and commercial portfolios. A couple of points I would make here with respect to card losses. Given the continued low level of late-stage delinquencies in the 180-day pipeline, we would expect card losses to decline again in Q3. For at least the next couple of quarters, I would expect total net charge-offs to moderate around the current level, with lower card losses partially offset by lower net recoveries and other products. With respect to commercial metrics, reservable criticized exposure and NPLs both declined in the quarter.
Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer on Slide 15. Consumer Banking produced another good quarter with strong customer deposit and investment flows and the return of card loan growth. This reflects the strength of our brand our digital innovations and the deployment of specialists in our centers, all of which enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the increase in customer liquidity.
As Brian said earlier, this was a quarter of reopening where both our high-tech and high-touch capabilities delivered growth in client activity. Given vaccination progress, we reopened certain financial centers. More of our associates were at their posts in our financial centers, and customer traffic was up. All of the above drove higher sales in our centers. At the same time, we also saw increased sales through digital channels, which suggests increases in digital engagement are here to stay.
The segment earned $3 billion in Q2, 13% higher than Q1, as revenue expense and credit costs all showed improvement. Revenue improved 1%, reflecting higher card income on increased purchase volumes and modestly higher account service charges on ATM usage. Expenses moved lower versus Q1 given the absence of the Q1 real estate impairment costs and seasonal higher payroll tax expense. We also saw some modest improvement in COVID costs as some of the elevated pandemic-related associated costs began to wind down. Our cost of deposits this quarter improved to an impressive 118 basis points. The team has done a great job of servicing more and more deposits while maintaining a strong cost discipline aided by digital engagement.
Looking back at Q2 '19. We have added 38% more deposits, while expenses have only increased a little more than 3% annually in support of all that new activity, even with COVID.
On Slide 16, you can see the significant increase in consumer deposits and investments. Average deposits of $979 billion are up $55 billion linked quarter and nearly $170 billion from Q2 '20, with more than 60% of that growth in checking. Grade paid is down [ to 2 ] basis points at 56% of the deposits are low-interest checking. We covered loans earlier but would just note that while average loans are down linked quarter, period-end loans are up modestly, excluding PPP, as growth in-card balances and vehicle lending outpaced a small decline in mortgages.
With respect to investment balances, we reached a new record of $346 billion, growing 40% year-over-year, as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering.
Okay. On Slide 17, I'll highlight a couple of points regarding the continued improvement in engagement. After crossing 40 million digital users in Q1, we added another 0.25 million users in Q2. This quarter, 70% of our consumer households use some part of our digital platform. We also reached 2.6 billion log-ins from customers in the last 90 days. And while you will note the tremendous Erica and Zelle usage, what I would draw your attention to is the digital sales growth, which is up 26% year-over-year. 85% of booked mortgages in the quarter were done digitally, while 77% of direct vehicle loans were digital.
Turning to wealth management. The continued economic reopening and strong market conditions led to records in average deposits, loans, investment balances and asset management fees in Q2. Both Merrill and the Private Bank contributed to this improvement. Growth in gross new households at Merrill continued, and the average size of the new households is larger this year than last year. And at the same time, net new households grew but at a slower pace given expensive competitive hiring practice across the industry.
We remain committed to organic growth, and our advisers and private client sales force has a stronger, more sustainable long-term strategy. Net income of nearly $1 billion improved 12% from Q1 as we saw improvement in both revenue and expense.
With respect to revenue, the record AUM fees complemented higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses dropped as the absence of seasonally elevated payroll tax in Q1 was partially offset by higher revenue-related costs. Client balances rose to a record of $3.7 trillion, up $725 billion year-over-year, driven by higher market levels as well as strong client flows.
Let's skip to Slide 20, which highlights our progress to digitally engage wealth management clients. In both Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank, we are focused on 3 pillars for digital engagement: one, digital adoption and deeper engagement; two, modernizing our platform for advisers and clients; and three, secure and easy collaboration with clients. We provided stats on Slide 20 that show record levels of digital engagement improved further in Q2. These are some of the highest levels of digital activity across our customers. More and more clients are logging in to easily trade, check balances and originate loans, all through one simplified sign-on. 70% of checks deposited by the Private Bank clients and more than half of checks from Merrill clients are being deposited digitally now.
And through leveraging Erica-based AI capabilities and through use of WebEx meetings and secure text messaging, we are making it easy and more efficient for clients to do business with us wherever and however they choose. This creates additional capacity for our advisers to spend more time with existing and potential clients.
All right. Moving to Global Banking on Slide 21. The business earned $2.4 billion in Q2, improving $251 million from Q1. Strong revenue growth and lower expenses were mitigated by a lower provision benefit than Q1. Deposit growth maintained or remained strong and increased $20 billion to a new record.
Outside of PPP loan figures, we saw modest growth across the platform, as discussed earlier. Revenue growth reflected the absence of the prior quarter impairment of energy investments as well as increased ESG investments. Revenue also included strong firm-wide IB fees of $2.1 billion, down only modestly from the record Q1 level. This performance resulted in an improvement to a #3 ranking in overall fees with a pipeline that remains strong. Strong debt issuance was more than offset by lower equity underwriting fees.
We had a provision benefit driven by a reserve release of [ $834 ] million in Q2, which was $328 million lower than the Q1 release. Net charge-offs were near 0, reflecting both low charge-offs and a notable recovery in the quarter. Noninterest expense declined 7% from Q1, reflecting lower compensation, partially offset by other costs.
We've already covered much of the balance sheet on Slide 22, so let's get to digital trends on Slide 23. We continued our investments in digital solutions that deliver the efficiencies for both clients and our employees. The solutions for clients have a compounded effect since they invariably means less manual intervention by the bank, enhancing both efficiency and satisfaction. Enhanced banking solutions are helping us capture greater market share as wholesale clients do more with their banking partners -- that more banking partners that are stable and secure and that have the capability to invest in new technologies that will provide better data and global integrated solutions.
Digitization, and in particular artificial intelligence, is helping us streamline processes and respond to clients more quickly and efficiently. As an example, our bankers are using technology powered by Erica to not only better manage credit exposure but also identify and win new business. We present some wholesale digital highlights on Slide 23.
Pushing the gold market on Slide 24. Results reflect solid but lower sales and trading activity, as noted earlier. While down from the more elevated pandemic periods, trading revenue is still 10% or so higher from Q2 '19. As I usually do, I will talk about results excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was negligible, but the year ago quarter had a $261 million loss.
Global Markets produced $934 million of earnings in Q2, down more than $1.1 billion compared to either Q1 or the year ago quarter.
Focusing on the year-over-year. Revenue was down 15% driven by the reduction in sales and trading. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by higher costs associated with processing unemployment claims and the activity related sales and trading costs. Compared to Q1 expense, the higher unemployment processing costs were mostly offset by lower compensation.
Sales and trading contributed $3.6 billion to revenue, declining 19% year-over-year. Fixed declined 38%, while equities improved 33%, recording one of the strongest equity performances in our history. FICC results reflected the much more robust trading environment in the year ago period, particularly for macro products. Q2 '21 saw credit tightened, and agency mortgages endured a difficult trading environment given the volatility of rates. The strength in equities was driven by a strong trading performance in derivatives and increased client activity, notably in derivatives and in Asia.
On Slide 25, we note half year revenue trends across the last few years. As you can see, while the pandemic elevated results in 2020, 2021 remains well above the prior years presented driven by continued client activity and volatility in the market.
Finally, on Slide 26, we show All Other, which reported profit of $1.9 billion. The $2 billion tax adjustment benefited results. Absent this benefit, we would have reported $137 million loss, which is a decline of $239 million from Q1 '21 driven by lower revenue. Revenue declined $545 million, reflecting 2 impacts: first, higher partnership losses on ESG -- on increased ESG investments. As you know, we record gross up revenue from these investments on an FTE basis in Global Banking, paid the full tax there and then backed out those entries in All Other. You can also see the increase in ESG investment in Q2 in other income on our consolidated income statement, where partnership losses are booked. While this loss impacts revenue, it is more than made up for on the tax line.
We expect our tax credits and associated losses in consolidated other income to increase by at least $100 million in Q3. And keep in mind, Q4 is normally even higher, reflecting seasonal activity. Revenue in All Other was also impacted by some refinancing activity. We called and refinanced higher cost structured notes, which pushed some AOCI back through the income statement. Our effective tax rate this quarter, excluding the $2 billion tax adjustment, was 10.7%. And further excluding tax credits driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been 25%.
For the second half of '21, absent any changes in current tax laws or any other unusual items, we expect our effective tax rate to be in a range of 10% to 12%.
Okay. With that, we're ready to go to Q&A."

The usage on lines is still low. And so that is still running in the low 30s, which is about 1,000 basis points on average lower in the banking segment. But what you see underneath that is that even Business Banking, which is the segment from $5 million to $50 million, is net growing finally and it was the most affected by the PPP runoff. And the runoff of PPP in the quarter was $6 billion, $7 billion or something like that. So we -- in Paul's -- basically flat average balances that included the overcame that. So we feel good as we look across the things. So what you really see is the net card production back to pre-pandemic. You see gross card production basically about 90% of pre-pandemic. You see autos which will pick back up as inventories become available.
And the real driver on the consumer side is mortgages. We're basically holding our own right now. And that was different than, frankly, on the refi side. We lost some balances through the last several quarters. And on the commercial side, it's really line usage. Honestly, can't go any lower.  Maybe it can. But theoretically, you can't because it's been stuck here for a good 4 or 5 quarters with the activity. But the auto dealer line usage, which is an outside of the house, for example, is very low than it traditionally is. So we expect those to pick back up. But the key is they're actually producing more customers and more clients even with the low usage, and the loans are starting to grow."

But if you take the 4Q expense, you had the higher seasonal payroll tax, you add 1%, that's a good base, I think. And then from there, just based upon whatever assumption you want to make around higher revenue expectations in areas that are closely linked to compensation and exchange fees, I think if you do that math, you'll have a pretty good number."

The transactor piece is higher. You want people to use the card to get revenue, and you saw that in the fee line to get revenue from the usage and obviously get revenue from the loans. The loans are obviously the better part of the equation.
But Betsy, you have to realize, we have about, round numbers, the same number of cards outstanding. There's $20-odd billion less balances, which people didn't get any different. They just have more cash. And so they paid off their credit cards, which is a completely responsible thing for them to do. And when they can get out and spend more money, which is starting to happen, I think you'll see them use these lines, short-term purchases.
So I don't think -- yes, the pay rate's up, but I don't think it's a fundamental difference of behavior. It's just the opportunity to use the cards for activity has been limited coming into this quarter when you finally saw things open. So we'll see where it goes, but it's -- the good news is it's going in a different direction. It had been leading up an entry point about Slide 5. And the good news is the people are high credit quality. So that means that the net interest -- the risk-adjusted margin, i.e. the margin from cards minus the charge-offs, is actually closer than what people think because the card charge-offs would drop by $300 million or $400 million a quarter."

But I think we try to operate 50 basis points above the minimum target because there's volatility. So our SLR 5.9 has got 90 basis points of cushion in it. And we we want to operate 50 basis points there, the 9.5 is 10, et cetera. So you should expect us, not immediately, to be moving towards that over time. And then as this goes through the periods, the question will be what's the ultimate decent level that we have to maintain in the future and things like that.
So -- but we can move at pace now, and we couldn't before because we was constrained to your dividends plus your buybacks could only equal your earnings. And we were a company that went into this crisis with a lot more excess capital. And we're company came out this crisis with a lot more excess capital.

Once again, in the quarter, our customers are seeing good growth opportunities in a recovering economy. Deposits continue to grow, $80 billion in the quarter.

Today, Bank of America reported $9.2 billion in after-tax net income or $1.03 per diluted share. These results included a few items worth highlighting, and I'm on Page 2 ahead of Paul going through the details. First, as asset quality continue to improve and the economy continue to recover, we released $2.2 billion of credit reserves established in the first half of last year. The idea that a company with our credit quality and other industry participants would be releasing reserves this quarter is not new news, but the reality is at BAC, we're seeing credit quality levels that are very strong.  Net charge-offs fell to 25-year low as a percentage of loans, not just raw dollar amount. 
Let me mention a few items I don't believe were industry-wide or expected at BAC. We recorded a $2 billion positive income tax adjustment following last month's enactment of an increase in U.K. corporate income tax rate to 25%. This required a remeasurement of our deferred tax asset, which just reversed the write-downs from previous years when the tax rates were lower. 
In addition, our expense level included 2 things I would note. These add up to about $800 million. With our strong results and the tax benefit, we took the opportunity to prefund $500 million to our charitable foundation. This accelerates our planned funding for not only the rest of this year, but for the next year as well. This is not new money, just utilizing some of the tax benefit to cover future expense. 
We also recorded roughly $300 million of expense associated with processing transactional card claims related to state unemployment benefits. This represents, to a large degree, a catch-up as we move through claim backlogs. 
Away from these items, we produced another quarter of solid earnings and showed evidence of good client activity in an economy that continue to recover from the pandemic. Now as we all know, the health care crisis has shown improvement and the economy has recovered. Progress on vaccinations, along with the continued support of fiscal monetary policies, has promoted a full and speedy recovery and return to economic health. 
We, like others, are reopening our facilities, and we're seeing more products being sold by our teammates in addition to the continued digital engagement at very high levels. Our advisers and bankers and relationship managers are once again meeting with clients face-to-face, building even the stronger relationships. We are seeing customer demand continue to grow given the opportunities our companies see. 
I want to take a minute or 2 on the economy and -- if you go to Slide 3. We have included a few slides highlighting our customer data. Let me hit a few highlights. The GDP growth estimates by our BofA Securities Research team for the second quarter stand at 10% and stand at 7% for the full year 2021. And the reopenings further driving projections of an economy has continued to grow at a rate above the prepandemic periods into '23. Also, the unemployment rate dropped below 6% this quarter projected by economies to continue to fall. You also note the stability to increase consumer spending from our own BAC customers, which is not only much higher than the same periods in 2020, which you would expect, but is notably 22% higher than the first half of '21 compared to 2019. And you can see that in the lower right of the page. That growth rate in '19 was already growing strongly before the pandemic. 
A few comments regarding the characteristics of spending I think are interesting. We are halfway through the year, and the total payments through those -- through all the different means are $1.8 trillion. That's 60% of last year's level. Last year, indeed, was a record even though it was suppressed in various periods when businesses were shut down. 
More specifically, for the second quarter, the total BAC consumer small business payments set a fourth quarterly consecutive record, reaching $976 billion, up 41% year-over-year and 23% over '19. The trend has also continued into early July. 
Spending accelerated as COVID vaccinations increase, business reopen and domestic travel increase. Combined spend at retailers and services comprises over 50% of debit and credit card spending, a portion of the total spend. That increased 27% over 2019 second quarter, but did slow a bit towards the end of the quarter as consumers moved their attention and started taking summer leisure trips and activity.  You can see that by noting a return of travel and entertainment spending, which comprises about 10% of debit credit card spend. You can see where recovering travel remains below 2000 -- where recovering travel remains below 2019 spending levels. 
Switching to travel, up a bit. As of mid-June, domestic airline purchases were up 8% over 2019 while international airline purchase on our cards are still down approximately 40%, showing the difference of the progress against the war on the virus in United States versus other places. 
Now let's go to Slide 4. We just put this chart in to show you that the consumers are paying their bills. We've shown this each quarter so you could see that the actual card delinquency levels continue to edge down even as people are out and circulating the economy. 
Before we go to Paul, I want to comment specifically on 3 areas of interest to you: loan growth, NII and expense. And we can do that on Pages 5 and 6. So first on loans. Paul and I are going to show you the average loans. Paul will show you that later. End-of-period loans, I'll show you in a minute and long-term trends, which are on Page 5. 
What all these figures point to is accelerating growth during the quarter, as we've spoken about on occasion. This quarter, we saw loan levels across most every business move past stabilization begin to make progress. Companies need to build inventory, hire workers to meet the growing customer demand. This virtuous circle of hiring workers and meeting customer spending will help drive the economy and hopefully will result in more line usage on all levels. You can see the path on Slide 5 of loans since the pandemic started in March 2020. As you can see, all of them are turning up in recent months. 
But moving to Slide 6, you see the more traditional detail for our company. Let's start on the lower right-hand side of that slide and talking about the commercial portfolio. Commercial loan balances after adjusting for the reductions in PPP loans for quarter 2 forgiveness grew $15 billion. This is led by Global Markets client borrowing activity. But beyond that and still excluding the PPP loan forgiveness, middle-market lending group and our Business Banking team finally had growth in the month of June 2021, a first since last March.  
Fueling some of this improvement is calling effectiveness. Relationship managers that have increased their calling efforts were now aggressively calling on targeted prospects. And with vaccination progress, face-to-face meetings have nearly doubled each month over the past 90 days. Commercial loans wealth management clients grew an impressive 5% in the quarter as these customers borrow through our custom lending products. 
In small business, our Practice Solutions group, which supports medical, dental and veterinary practices, has been building throughout the quarter, and small business production overall is back to prepandemic levels. 
Turning to consumer loans. Overall growth of end-of-period loans was $6 billion. Card loans grew with increased spending even as customer payment percentages remained high. Auto originations have grown fairly consistently, although recently lower dealer supplies have affected that. 
Mortgage balance growth, which is a big part of our loan portfolio in consumer, has been a challenge in the low-rate environment with high refinancing volumes exceeding originations in past quarters. We are only modestly down this quarter as our origination volumes are finally overcoming the payoffs. 
We are pleased with the trajectory through the period, and that feeds into the second half of the year. While average loans drive -- that loan balances during the third quarter will drive NII, it's good to start with a trend that has reversed the past quarters' declines. 
On NII, the good news is that we correctly called the bottom 3 quarters ago. We told you that we thought the third quarter of 2020 would be the trough. Despite the volatility and lower-rate moves and significant decline in loans, we've been able to hold NII at that level or more for 3 straight quarters. We expect it to move higher, and Paul is going to discuss that later. 
The other area I want to comment on is expense. We saw -- on a reported basis, we saw a $0.5 billion in expense reduction from first quarter of '21 to second quarter of '21.  This quarter, we also had about $800 million in notable items for the aforementioned charitable contribution on unemployment claims process. Absent those notable items, expense would have been down about $1 billion and in the low $14 billion range. This is a level we are targeting to expense as we move through the rest of the year. 
In the second half of the year, as we normalize our operations, we'll continue to return our business as usual, working on process improvements that allow us to reduce our headcount and to continue to fund franchise investments. Headcount in the second quarter, including -- excluding the summer interns, declined by roughly 2,500 or over 1% from the first quarter. 
So the messages for this quarter is straightforward. The organic growth machine that we had rolling before the pandemic hit is reemerging as the economy normalizes. We start to be careful to ensure that the war on the virus stays won, but we're seeing great trends. In retail and preferred and small business, we saw a strong production of core transaction accounts above prepandemic levels. This quarter was our best net sales growth in checking account since the second quarter 2015. 
We saw our card production about 90% overall prepandemic. But net cards -- net of runoff were positive, the first time since the quarter -- first quarter of 2020 when we entered the pandemic. We saw growth in new Merrill Edge investment accounts, and Paul will talk to you about that. We saw a good mortgage production. We saw a stronger digital activity. 
In wealth management, we saw household growth and strong flows continue to grow even with the use of our banking platform to grow its credit side. In Global Banking, we saw loan growth and new production coming on while line usage still remains very low. We saw investment banking closed this quarter with record pipelines. 
In markets, we saw a strong first half even compared to 2020 and a strong second quarter, albeit with more normal seasonal impact. So normalizing more like '19 but still higher. And we saw headcount come down as operational excellence kicks in by over 2,000 people. 
We have work to do to keep driving down the core expenses and getting out the net COVID expenses over time. And above all, due to responsible growth, we saw strong core credit metrics. So as the economy continues to recover, we are seeing our organic growth engine kick back in. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul."
19049,670919360,2345133,"Bank of America Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2021",2021-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 7. As I have done in the past few quarters, the majority of my comments -- or excuse me, my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter rather than year-over-year given the pandemic.  Since B",3433,"Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. 
I'm starting on Slide 7. As I have done in the past few quarters, the majority of my comments -- or excuse me, my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter rather than year-over-year given the pandemic.  
Since Brian already covered a lot of the income statement, I will just add a couple of comments on revenue and returns. Revenue was down 6% from Q1. The decline was driven by lower sales and trading results that more than offset solid consumer and wealth management revenue, which was a result of higher card income and AUM fees. 
It is also worth noting that while investment banking fees were down from a record Q1 level, they remained strong at more than $2 billion in Q2.  Lastly, when comparing revenue against the prior year quarter, remember, Q2 '20 included a $704 million gain on the sale of some mortgage loans.  
With respect to returns, our return on tangible common equity was 20% and ROA was 123 basis points, both benefiting from the positive tax adjustment and sizable reserve release. 
Moving to Slide 8. Balance sheet expanded $60 billion versus Q1 to a little more than $3 trillion in total assets. Deposit growth of $24 billion supported $16 billion of loan growth while the combination of market-based funding and long-term debt issuance supported expansion of the balance sheet in Global Markets. Other notable movements on the balance sheet included the continued deployment of excess cash into securities. Securities increased $83 billion while cash declined $66 billion. 
Driven by the additional deposit growth, our liquidity portfolio remained above $1 trillion or 1/3 of the balance sheet. Shareholders' equity increased $3 billion as earnings outpaced capital distribution. Capital distributions of $5.8 billion were limited to the average of earnings in the previous 4 quarters for regulatory guidelines and were well below the $9 billion earned in the quarter. 
With respect to regulatory ratios, consistent with Q1, standardized remained the binding approach for us and was down a little less than 30 basis points from Q1. While the CET1 ratio declined 30 basis points in Q1, it remained 200 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into a $31 billion capital cushion. 
While book value rose $3 billion, regulatory capital was up $1 billion as the $2 billion tax adjustment did not benefit CET1 capital.  Higher RWA from the liquidity deployed to securities growth in our markets balance sheet and higher GWIM loan activity more than offset the benefit to the ratio from higher capital. 
Our supplemental leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.9%, dropping from the prior quarter primarily due to the removal of the regulatory relief. 5.9% versus a minimum requirement of 5% equates to approximately $600 billion of balance sheet capacity, which leaves us plenty of room for growth. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements. 
Turning to Slide 9. Brian reviewed ending loan balances earlier, so I will focus on average balances, which are more closely linked to NII. As you look at the year-over-year trends, note that these numbers include PPP loans, which have been moving lower now for 2 quarters driven by forgiveness. You can see the change in those PPP levels on the slide. 
Focusing on the linked quarter change. While loans on an ending basis were up nicely, on an average basis even with a $3 billion decline in PPP balances, loans were flat. Wealth management and Global Markets experienced the most notable improvements. GWIM continued to benefit from security-based lending as well as custom lending while continuing to have solid mortgage performance.
In Global Markets, we looked for opportunities to lend to clients against a number of different asset types, creating mostly investment-grade exposures as a good use of our liquidity. In Consumer, we saw credit card loans stabilize for the first time in more than a year as credit spending ramped up and new accounts continued to build across the quarters. Quarterly new account levels are nearly back to 2019 levels.
With respect to deposits on Slide 10, we continued to see significant growth across the client base not only because of the growth in the money supply, but also because we added new accounts and attracted increased liquidity from existing customers.  I would just note that the linked quarter growth on a spot basis included a headwind of about $34 billion from customer income tax outflow. Normally, we see deposits decline in the second quarter given tax payments. But this year, we saw strong growth even with these tax payments.
Turning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII for Q2 was $10.2 billion, $10.3 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income declined a little more than $600 million from Q2 '20 driven by the rate environment and lower loan balances, but showed modest improvement from Q1. Year-over-year comparisons beginning next quarter are expected to improve nicely as Q3 '20 has proven to be the nadir for NII. And we are expecting NII improvement in Q3 and Q4.
Compared to Q1, the benefit of an additional day of interest and liquidity deployed was offset by a lower level of PPP loan forgiveness, the absence of proceeds recorded in NII from the Q1 litigation settlement and modestly higher premium amortization expense. The net interest yield declined 7 basis points from Q1 driven by the continued addition of lower-yielding debt securities in Q1 and Q2 and a larger Global Markets balance sheet. Remember, as part of our liquidity that remain, I would include about $150 billion of debt securities hedged to floating, which earned a bit more than cash.
As you'll note, given all the deposit growth at low rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remain significant and mostly unchanged from Q1, highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships. 
Let me give you a couple of thoughts around NII for the back half of the year.  Last quarter, when the forward interest rate environment was 30 to 40 basis points higher, we told you we were targeting NII at roughly $1 billion higher in Q4 of this year. This quarter's loan growth is encouraging and supportive of this target and the slowdown in mortgage prepayments should also help improve NII. 
So while we still think getting NII $1 billion higher by 4Q is possible, admittedly, the recent significant decline in long-end rates presents a challenge. This possibility, of course, assumes loans continue to grow in the second half and rates don't move lower from here.  To improve our chances, we could decide to deploy additional liquidity at higher fixed rates in the coming weeks and months as we evaluate the trade-offs between liquidity, capital and earnings.
Turning to Slide 12 and expenses. Q2 expenses were $15 billion, $0.5 billion lower than Q1. While lower than Q1, the combination of the $500 million contribution to the foundation and the nearly $300 million increase in costs associated with unemployment claims processing kept expenses above the low $14 billion target shared with you last quarter. Outside of these 2 items, expense was lower driven by the absence of a few Q1 items, seasonal payroll taxes, the real estate impairment charge and the acceleration of expense due to incentive comp award changes. Additionally, lower incentive comp and severance costs also contributed to the decline.
Lastly, our COVID cost saw a modest decline as some pandemic-related employee programs began to roll off, but this was mitigated to a certain degree by preparation costs for associates returning to the office.
As we go to the segments, I would just note that the sizable foundation contribution was allocated to the lines of business and therefore, negatively impact comparisons to prior quarters. As we look forward, we continue to invest at a high rate in people and in technology and in new financial centers. We are seeing the benefits of these investments. And now as we move forward, we expect that natural attrition will allow us to reduce headcount as we transition back to a more normal business environment. As Brian mentioned, excluding summer interns, our headcount this quarter moved down by about 2,500 people.
Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. Nothing but good news to report here. Net charge-offs this quarter fell to $595 million or 27 basis points of average loans. This is the lowest loss rate in more than 2 decades. That is 28% lower than Q1 and more than 30% below the second quarter of 2019. Our credit card loss rate was 2.67%, and several loan product categories were in recovery positions this quarter.
Provision was $1.6 billion -- was a $1.6 billion benefit -- net benefit driven by the continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, which resulted in the $2.2 billion release of credit reserves split fairly evenly between consumer and commercial loans. Our allowance as a percent of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.55%, which is still well above the 1.27%, which was the level as we begun 2020 following our day 1 adoption of CECL. And as a reminder, the mix of our loans has also changed since CECL day 1. To the extent the economic outlook and remaining uncertainties continue to improve, we expect our reserve levels could move lower.
Okay. On Slide 14, we show the credit quality metrics for both the consumer and commercial portfolios, a couple of points I would make here. With respect to card losses, given the continued low level of late-stage delinquencies in the 180-day pipeline, we would expect card losses to decline again in Q3. For at least the next couple of quarters, I would expect total net charge-offs to moderate around the current level with lower card losses partially offset by lower net recoveries and other products. With respect to commercial metrics, reservable criticized exposure and NPLs both declined in the quarter.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer on Slide 15. Consumer Banking produced another good quarter with strong customer deposit and investment flows and the return of card loan growth. This reflects the strength of our brand, our digital innovations and the deployment of specialists in our centers, all of which enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the increase in customer liquidity.
As Brian said earlier, this was a quarter of reopening where both our high-tech and high-touch capabilities delivered growth in client activity. Given vaccination progress, we reopened certain financial centers, more of our associates were at their posts in our financial centers and customer traffic was up. All of the above drove higher sales in our centers. At the same time, we also saw increased sales through digital channels, which suggests increases in digital engagement are here to stay.
The segment earned $3 billion in Q2, 13% higher than Q1 as revenue, expense and credit costs all showed improvement. Revenue improved 1%, reflecting higher card income on increased purchase volumes and modestly higher account service charges on ATM usage. Expenses moved lower versus Q1 given the absence of the Q1 real estate impairment costs and seasonal higher payroll tax expense. 
We also saw some modest improvement in COVID costs as some of the elevated pandemic-related associated costs began to wind down. Our cost of deposits this quarter improved to an impressive 118 basis points. The team has done a great job of servicing more and more deposits while maintaining a strong cost discipline aided by digital engagement.  Looking back at Q2 '19, we have added 38% more deposits while expenses have only increased a little more than 3% annually in support of all that new activity even with COVID.
On Slide 16, you can see the significant increase in consumer deposits and investments. Average deposits of $979 billion are up $55 billion linked quarter and nearly $170 billion from Q2 '20 with more than 60% of that growth in checking. Rate paid is down to 2 basis points as 56% of the deposits are low-interest checking. 
We covered loans earlier, but I would just note that while average loans are down linked quarter, period-end loans are up modestly, excluding PPP, as growth in card balances and vehicle lending outpaced a small decline in mortgages.
With respect to investment balances, we reached a new record of $346 billion, growing 40% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering.
Okay. On Slide 17, I'll highlight a couple of points regarding the continued improvement in engagement. After crossing 40 million digital users in Q1, we added another 0.25 million users in Q2. This quarter, 70% of our consumer households use some part of our digital platform. We also reached 2.6 billion log-ins from customers in the last 90 days. And while you will note the tremendous Erica and Zelle usage, what I would draw your attention to is the digital sales growth, which is up 26% year-over-year. 85% of booked mortgages in the quarter were done digitally while 77% of direct vehicle loans were digital.
Turning to wealth management. The continued economic reopening and strong market conditions led to records in average deposits, loans, investment balances and asset management fees in Q2. Both Merrill and the Private Bank contributed to this improvement. Growth in gross new households at Merrill continued and the average size of the new households is larger this year than last year. And at the same time, net new households grew but at a slower pace given expensive competitive hiring practice across the industry.
We remain committed to organic growth in our advisers and private client sales force as a stronger, more sustainable long-term strategy. Net income of nearly $1 billion improved 12% from Q1 as we saw improvement in both revenue and expense.
With respect to revenue, the record AUM fees complemented higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses dropped as the absence of seasonally elevated payroll tax in Q1 was partially offset by higher revenue-related costs. Client balances rose to a record of $3.7 trillion, up $725 billion year-over-year driven by higher market levels as well as strong client flows.
Let's skip to Slide 20, which highlights our progress to digitally engage wealth management clients. In both Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank, we are focused on 3 pillars for digital engagement: one, digital adoption and deeper engagement; two, modernizing our platform for advisers and clients; and three, secure and easy collaboration with clients. 
We provided stats on Slide 20 that show record levels of digital engagement improved further in Q2. These are some of the highest levels of digital activity across our customers. More and more clients are logging in to easily trade, check balances and originate loans all through one simplified sign-on. 70% of checks deposited by the Private Bank clients and more than half of checks from Merrill clients are being deposited digitally now.
And through leveraging Erica-based AI capabilities and through use of WebEx meetings and secure text messaging, we are making it easy and more efficient for clients to do business with us wherever and however they choose. This creates additional capacity for our advisers to spend more time with existing and potential clients.
All right. Moving to Global Banking on Slide 21. The business earned $2.4 billion in Q2, improving $251 million from Q1. Strong revenue growth and lower expenses were mitigated by a lower provision benefit than Q1. Deposit growth maintained or remained strong and increased $20 billion to a new record.
Outside of PPP loan figures, we saw modest growth across the platform, as discussed earlier. Revenue growth reflected the absence of the prior quarter impairment on clean energy investments as well as increased ESG investments. Revenue also included strong firm-wide IB fees of $2.1 billion, down only modestly from the record Q1 level. This performance resulted in an improvement to a #3 ranking in overall fees with a pipeline that remains strong. Strong debt issuance was more than offset by lower equity underwriting fees.
We had a provision benefit driven by a reserve release of $834 million in Q2, which was $328 million lower than the Q1 release. Net charge-offs were near 0, reflecting both low charge-offs and a notable recovery in the quarter. Noninterest expense declined 7% from Q1, reflecting lower compensation partially offset by other costs.
We've already covered much of the balance sheet on Slide 22, so let's get to digital trends on Slide 23. We continued our investments in digital solutions that deliver the efficiencies for both clients and our employees. The solutions for clients have a compounded effect since they invariably mean less manual intervention by the bank, enhancing both efficiency and satisfaction. Enhanced banking solutions are helping us capture greater market share as wholesale clients do more with their banking partners -- do more with banking partners that are stable and secure and that have the capability to invest in new technologies that will provide better data and global integrated solutions.
Digitization, and in particular, artificial intelligence, is helping us streamline processes and respond to clients more quickly and efficiently. As an example, our bankers are using technology powered by Erica to not only better manage credit exposure, but also identify and win new business. We present some wholesale digital highlights on Slide 23.
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 24. Results reflect solid but lower sales and trading activity, as noted earlier. While down from the more elevated pandemic periods, trading revenue is still 10% or so higher from Q2 '19. As I usually do, I will talk about results excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was negligible, but the year ago quarter had a $261 million loss.  Global Markets produced $934 million of earnings in Q2, down more than $1.1 billion compared to either Q1 or the year ago quarter.
Focusing on the year-over-year. Revenue was down 15% driven by the reduction in sales and trading. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by higher costs associated with processing unemployment claims and the activity related to sales and trading costs. Compared to Q1 expense, the higher unemployment processing costs were mostly offset by lower compensation.
Sales and trading contributed $3.6 billion to revenue, declining 19% year-over-year. FICC declined 38% while equities improved 33%, recording one of the strongest equity performances in our history. FICC results reflected the much more robust trading environment in the year ago period, particularly for macro products. Q2 '21 saw credit tightened and agency mortgages endured a difficult trading environment given the volatility of rates. The strength in equities was driven by a strong trading performance in derivatives and increased client activity notably in derivatives and in Asia.
On Slide 25, we note half year revenue trends across the last few years. As you can see, while the pandemic elevated results in 2020, 2021 remains well above the prior years presented driven by continued client activity and volatility in the market.
Finally, on Slide 26, we show All Other, which reported profit of $1.9 billion. The $2 billion tax adjustment benefited results. Absent this benefit, we would have reported $137 million loss, which is a decline of $239 million from Q1 '21 driven by lower revenue. 
Revenue declined $545 million, reflecting 2 impacts: first, higher partnership losses on ESG -- on increased ESG investments. As you know, we record grossed-up revenue from these investments on an FTE basis in Global Banking, paid the full tax there and then backed out those entries in All Other. You can also see the increase in ESG investment in Q2 in other income on our consolidated income statement where partnership losses are booked. While this loss impacts revenue, it is more than made up for on the tax line.  We expect our tax credits and associated losses in consolidated other income to increase by at least $100 million in Q3. And keep in mind, Q4 is normally even higher, reflecting seasonal activity. 
Revenue in All Other was also impacted by some refinancing activity. We called and refinanced higher cost structured notes, which pushed some AOCI back to the income statement. Our effective tax rate this quarter, excluding the $2 billion tax adjustment, was 10.7%. And further excluding tax credits driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been 25%. For the second half of '21 absent any changes in current tax laws or any other unusual items, we expect our effective tax rate to be in a range of 10% to 12%.
Okay. With that, we're ready to go to Q&A."

The usage on lines is still low. And so that is still running in the low 30s, which is about 1,000 basis points on average lower in the banking segment. But what you see underneath that is that even Business Banking, which is the segment from $5 million to $50 million, is net growing finally, and it was the most affected by the PPP runoff. And the runoff of PPP in the quarter was $6 billion, $7 billion or something like that. 
So we -- in Paul's basically flat average balances, that included -- he overcame that. So we feel good as we look across those things. So what you really see is the net car production back to prepandemic. You see gross car production basically about 90% of prepandemic. You see autos which will pick back up as inventories become available.
And the real driver on the consumer side is mortgages. We're basically holding our own right now. And that was different than, frankly, on the refi side. We lost some balances through the last several quarters. And on the commercial side, it's really line usage honestly can't go any lower. Maybe it can, but theoretically, it can't because it's been stuck here for a good 4 or 5 quarters with the activity. But the auto dealer line usage, which is in outside of the house, for example, is very low than it traditionally is.  So we expect those to pick back up. But the key is they're actually producing more customers and more clients even with the low usage and the loans are starting to grow."

So our rough estimate for the fourth quarter expense is a range of below $14 billion. I think if you add to that the seasonal higher payroll tax, approximately $350 million in Q1, plus add in 1% inflationary costs that we have talked about now for many quarters -- remember, if we do nothing, costs would grow by 3% or 4%, but we're driving that lower every year and quarter through OpEx, SIEM and other initiatives.  
But if you take the 4Q expense, you add the higher seasonal payroll tax, you add 1%, that's a good base, I think. And then from there, just based upon whatever assumption you want to make around higher revenue expectations in areas that are closely linked to compensation and exchange fees, I think if you do that math, you'll have a pretty good number."

I just wanted to dig in on card a little bit. There's been some discussion around how spend is up a lot, as you indicated as well, and how much of that spend is likely to be translating into revolving versus transactor. You're giving us the daily clearly, we can see that here on the slide. But it would be helpful to understand what you're seeing in the guts of the machine. And is -- has revolver started to pick up? Or does this loan growth that you show on the slide reflect just the increased spend and transactor paydown rates are similar to what they've been over the past few months?"

Obviously, significantly prepandemic, the transactor piece is higher. You want people to use the card to get revenue, and you saw that in the fee line to get revenue -- from the usage, you can also get revenue from the loans. The loans are obviously the better part of the equation.
But Betsy, you have to realize, we have about, round numbers, the same number of cards outstanding. There's $20-odd billion less balances, which people didn't get any different. They just have more cash. And so they paid off their credit cards, which is a completely responsible thing for them to do. And when they can get out and spend more money, which is starting to happen, I think you'll see them use these lines, short-term purchases.
So I don't think -- yes, the pay rate's up, but I don't think it's a fundamental difference of behavior. It's just the opportunity to use the cards for activity has been limited coming into this quarter when you finally saw things open. 
So we'll see where it goes, but it's -- the good news is it's going in different direction. It had been leading up an entry point about Slide 5. And the good news is the people are high credit quality. So that means that the net -- the risk-adjusted margin, i.e., the margin from cards minus the charge-offs, is actually closer than what people think because the card charge-offs would drop by $300 million, $400 million a quarter."

And we want to operate 50 basis points there, the 9.5 is 10, et cetera. So you should expect us not immediately to be moving towards that over time. And then as this goes through the periods, the question will be what's the ultimate decent level that we have to maintain in the future and things like that.
So -- but we can move at pace now, and we couldn't before because we're -- it was constrained to your dividends plus your buybacks not only to your earnings. And we were a company that went into this crisis with a lot more excess capital. And we're a company that came out this crisis with a lot more excess capital.

In Global Markets, we just look for opportunities to use some of our liquidity in a more constructive way than maybe buying more securities. And it was across a number of different types of opportunities in clients. But about, I would say, $6 billion-ish of it went into our decision to hold some CLOs in loan form. 
Now we concentrated those holdings in AAA and AA tranches instead of distributing the securities to investors.

Once again, in the quarter, our customers are seeing good growth opportunities in a recovering economy.

Today, Bank of America reported $9.2 billion in after-tax net income or $1.03 per diluted share. These results included a few items worth highlighting, and I'm on Page 2 ahead of Paul going through the details. First, as asset quality continue to improve and the economy continue to recover, we released $2.2 billion of credit reserves established in the first half of last year. The idea that a company with our credit quality and other industry participants would be releasing reserves this quarter is not new news, but the reality is at BAC, we're seeing credit quality levels that are very strong. Net charge-offs fell to 25-year low as a percentage of loans, not just raw dollar amount. 
Let me mention a few items I don't believe were industry-wide or expected at BAC. We recorded a $2 billion positive income tax adjustment following last month's enactment of an increase in U.K. corporate income tax rate to 25%. This required a remeasurement of our deferred tax asset, which just reversed the write-downs from previous years when the tax rates were lower.
In addition, our expense level included 2 things I would note. These add up to about $800 million. With our strong results and the tax benefit, we took the opportunity to prefund $500 million to our charitable foundation. This accelerates our planned funding for not only the rest of this year, but for the next year as well. This is not new money, just utilizing some of the tax benefit to cover future expense. 
We also recorded roughly $300 million of expense associated with processing transactional card claims related to state unemployment benefits. This represents, to a large degree, a catch-up as we move through claim backlogs. 
Away from these items, we produced another quarter of solid earnings and showed evidence of good client activity in an economy that continue to recover from the pandemic. Now as we all know, the health care crisis has shown improvement and the economy has recovered. Progress on vaccinations, along with the continued support of fiscal monetary policies, has promoted a full and speedy recovery and return to economic health. 
We, like others, are reopening our facilities, and we're seeing more products being sold by our teammates in addition to the continued digital engagement at very high levels. Our advisers and bankers and relationship managers are once again meeting with clients face-to-face, building even the stronger relationships. We are seeing customer demand continue to grow given the opportunities our companies see. 
I want to take a minute or 2 on the economy and -- if you go to Slide 3. We have included a few slides highlighting our customer data. Let me hit a few highlights. The GDP growth estimates by our BofA Securities Research team for the second quarter stand at 10% and stand at 7% for the full year 2021. And the reopenings further driving projections of an economy has continued to grow at a rate above the prepandemic periods into '23.
Also, the unemployment rate dropped below 6% this quarter projected by economies to continue to fall. You also note the stability to increase consumer spending from our own BAC customers, which is not only much higher than the same periods in 2020, which you would expect, but is notably 22% higher than the first half of '21 compared to 2019. And you can see that in the lower right of the page. That growth rate in '19 was already growing strongly before the pandemic. 
A few comments regarding the characteristics of spending I think are interesting. We are halfway through the year, and the total payments through those -- through all the different means are $1.8 trillion. That's 60% of last year's level. Last year, indeed, was a record even though it was suppressed in various periods when businesses were shut down. 
More specifically, for the second quarter, the total BAC consumer small business payments set a fourth quarterly consecutive record, reaching $976 billion, up 41% year-over-year and 23% over '19. The trend has also continued into early July. 
Spending accelerated as COVID vaccinations increased, business reopened and domestic travel increased. Combined spend at retailers and services comprises over 50% of debit and credit card spending, a portion of the total spend. That increased 27% over 2019 second quarter, but did slow a bit towards the end of the quarter as consumers moved their attention and started taking summer leisure trips and activity. You can see that by noting a return of travel and entertainment spending, which comprises about 10% of debit credit card spend. You can see where recovering travel remains below 2000 -- where recovering travel remains below 2019 spending levels. 
Moving to travel up a bit. As of mid-June, domestic airline purchases were up 8% over 2019 while international airline purchase on our cards are still down approximately 40%, showing the difference of the progress against the war on the virus in United States versus other places. 
Now let's go to Slide 4. We just put this chart in to show you that the consumers are paying their bills. We've shown this each quarter so you could see that the actual card delinquency levels continue to edge down even as people are out and circulating the economy. 
Before we go to Paul, I want to comment specifically on 3 areas of interest to you: loan growth, NII and expense. And we can do that on Pages 5 and 6. So first on loans. Paul and I are going to show you the average loans. Paul will show you that later. End-of-period loans, I'll show you in a minute and long-term trends, which are on Page 5.
What all these figures point to is accelerating growth during the quarter, as we've spoken about on occasion. This quarter, we saw loan levels across most every business move past stabilization begin to make progress. Companies need to build inventory, hire workers to meet the growing customer demand. This virtuous circle of hiring workers and meeting customer spending will help drive the economy and hopefully will result in more line usage on our loans. You can see the path on Slide 5 of loans since the pandemic started in March 2020. As you can see, all of them are turning up in recent months. 
But moving to Slide 6, you see the more traditional detail for our company. Let's start on the lower right-hand side of that slide and talking about the commercial portfolio. Commercial loan balances after adjusting for the reductions in PPP loans for quarter 2 forgiveness grew $15 billion. This is led by Global Markets client borrowing activity. But beyond that and still excluding the PPP loan forgiveness, middle-market lending group and our Business Banking team finally had growth in the month of June 2021, a first since last March.  
Fueling some of this improvement is calling effectiveness. Relationship managers that have increased their calling efforts were now aggressively calling on targeted prospects. And with vaccination progress, face-to-face meetings have nearly doubled each month over the past 90 days. Commercial loans wealth management clients grew an impressive 5% in the quarter as these customers borrow through our custom lending products. 
In small business, our Practice Solutions group, which supports medical, dental and veterinary practices, has been building throughout the quarter, and small business production overall is back to prepandemic levels. 
Turning to consumer loans. Overall growth of end-of-period loans was $6 billion. Card loans grew with increased spending even as customer payment percentages remained high. Auto originations have grown fairly consistently, although recently lower dealer supplies have affected that. 
Mortgage balance growth, which is a big part of our loan portfolio in consumer, has been a challenge in the low-rate environment with high refinancing volumes exceeding originations in past quarters. We are only modestly down this quarter as our origination volumes are finally overcoming the payoffs. 
We are pleased with the trajectory through the period, and that feeds into the second half of the year. While average loans drive -- that loan balances during the third quarter will drive NII, it's good to start with a trend that has reversed the past quarters' declines. 
On NII, the good news is that we correctly called the bottom 3 quarters ago. We told you that we thought the third quarter of 2020 would be the trough. Despite the volatility and lower-rate moves and significant decline in loans, we've been able to hold NII at that level or more for 3 straight quarters. We expect it to move higher, and Paul is going to discuss that later.
The other area I want to comment on is expense. We saw -- on a reported basis, we saw a $0.5 billion in expense reduction from first quarter of '21 to second quarter of '21. This quarter, we also had about $800 million in notable items for the aforementioned charitable contribution on unemployment claims process. Absent those notable items, expense would have been down about $1 billion and in the low $14 billion range. This is a level we are targeting to expense as we move through the rest of the year. 
In the second half of the year, as we normalize our operations, we'll continue to return our business as usual, working on process improvements that allow us to reduce our headcount and to continue to fund franchise investments. Headcount in the second quarter, including -- excluding the summer interns, declined by roughly 2,500 or over 1% from the first quarter. 
So the messages for this quarter is straightforward. The organic growth machine that we had rolling before the pandemic hit is reemerging as the economy normalizes. We start to be careful to ensure that the war on the virus stays won, but we're seeing great trends. In retail and preferred and small business, we saw a strong production of core transaction accounts above prepandemic levels. This quarter was our best net sales growth in checking account since the second quarter 2015. 
We saw our card production about 90% overall prepandemic. But net cards -- net of runoff were positive the first time since the quarter -- first quarter of 2020 when we entered the pandemic. We saw growth in new Merrill Edge investment accounts, and Paul will talk to you about that. We saw a good mortgage production. We saw a stronger digital activity. 
In wealth management, we saw household growth and strong flows continue to grow even with the use of our banking platform to grow its credit side. In Global Banking, we saw loan growth and new production coming on while line usage still remains very low. We saw investment banking closed this quarter with record pipelines. 
In markets, we saw a strong first half even compared to 2020 and a strong second quarter, albeit with more normal seasonal impact. So normalizing more like '19 but still higher. And we saw headcount come down as operational excellence kicks in by over 2,000 people. 
We have work to do to keep driving down the core expenses and getting out the net COVID expenses over time. And above all, due to responsible growth, we saw strong core credit metrics. So as the economy continues to recover, we are seeing our organic growth engine kick back in. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul."
19049,670919360,2347395,"Bank of America Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2021",2021-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 7. As I have done in the past few quarters, the majority of my comments -- or excuse me, my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter rather than year-over-year given the pandemic.  Since B",3428,"Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. 
I'm starting on Slide 7. As I have done in the past few quarters, the majority of my comments -- or excuse me, my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter rather than year-over-year given the pandemic.  
Since Brian already covered a lot of the income statement, I will just add a couple of comments on revenue and returns. Revenue was down 6% from Q1. The decline was driven by lower sales and trading results that more than offset solid consumer and wealth management revenue, which was a result of higher card income and AUM fees. 
It is also worth noting that while investment banking fees were down from a record Q1 level, they remained strong at more than $2 billion in Q2. Lastly, when comparing revenue against the prior year quarter, remember, Q2 '20 included a $704 million gain on the sale of some mortgage loans.  
With respect to returns, our return on tangible common equity was 20% and ROA was 123 basis points, both benefiting from the positive tax adjustment and sizable reserve release. 
Moving to Slide 8. Balance sheet expanded $60 billion versus Q1 to a little more than $3 trillion in total assets. Deposit growth of $24 billion supported $16 billion of loan growth while the combination of market-based funding and long-term debt issuance supported expansion of the balance sheet in Global Markets. Other notable movements on the balance sheet included the continued deployment of excess cash into securities. Securities increased $83 billion while cash declined $66 billion. 
Driven by the additional deposit growth, our liquidity portfolio remained above $1 trillion or 1/3 of the balance sheet. Shareholders' equity increased $3 billion as earnings outpaced capital distribution. Capital distributions of $5.8 billion were limited to the average of earnings in the previous 4 quarters for regulatory guidelines and were well below the $9 billion earned in the quarter.
With respect to regulatory ratios, consistent with Q1, standardized remained a binding approach for us and was down a little less than 30 basis points from Q1. While the CET1 ratio declined 30 basis points in Q1, it remained 200 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into a $31 billion capital cushion. 
While book value rose $3 billion, regulatory capital was up $1 billion as the $2 billion tax adjustment did not benefit CET1 capital. Higher RWA from the liquidity deployed to securities growth in our markets balance sheet and higher GWIM loan activity more than offset the benefit to the ratio from higher capital. 
Our supplemental leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.9%, dropping from the prior quarter primarily due to the removal of the regulatory relief. 5.9% versus a minimum requirement of 5% equates to approximately $600 billion of balance sheet capacity, which leaves us plenty of room for growth. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements. 
Turning to Slide 9. Brian reviewed ending loan balances earlier, so I will focus on average balances, which are more closely linked to NII. As you look at the year-over-year trends, note that these numbers include PPP loans, which have been moving lower now for 2 quarters driven by forgiveness. You can see the change in those PPP levels on the slide. 
Focusing on the linked quarter change. While loans on an ending basis were up nicely, on an average basis even with a $3 billion decline in PPP balances, loans were flat. Wealth management and Global Markets experienced the most notable improvements. GWIM continued to benefit from security-based lending as well as custom lending while continuing to have solid mortgage performance.
In Global Markets, we looked for opportunities to lend to clients against a number of different asset types, creating mostly investment-grade exposures as a good use of our liquidity. In Consumer, we saw credit card loans stabilize for the first time in more than a year as credit spending ramped up and new accounts continued to build across the quarters. Quarterly new account levels are nearly back to 2019 levels.
With respect to deposits on Slide 10, we continued to see significant growth across the client base not only because of the growth in the money supply, but also because we added new accounts and attracted increased liquidity from existing customers. I would just note that the linked quarter growth on a spot basis included a headwind of about $34 billion from customer income tax outflow. Normally, we see deposits decline in the second quarter given tax payments. But this year, we saw strong growth even with these tax payments.
Turning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII for Q2 was $10.2 billion, $10.3 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income declined a little more than $600 million from Q2 '20 driven by the rate environment and lower loan balances, but showed modest improvement from Q1. Year-over-year comparisons beginning next quarter are expected to improve nicely as Q3 '20 has proven to be the nadir for NII. And we are expecting NII improvement in Q3 and Q4.
Compared to Q1, the benefit of an additional day of interest and liquidity deployed was offset by a lower level of PPP loan forgiveness, the absence of proceeds recorded in NII from the Q1 litigation settlement and modestly higher premium amortization expense. The net interest yield declined 7 basis points from Q1 driven by the continued addition of lower-yielding debt securities in Q1 and Q2 and a larger Global Markets balance sheet. Remember, as part of our liquidity that remain, I would include about $150 billion of debt securities hedged to floating, which earned a bit more than cash.
As you'll note, given all the deposit growth at low rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remain significant and mostly unchanged from Q1, highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships. 
Let me give you a couple of thoughts around NII for the back half of the year. Last quarter, when the forward interest rate environment was 30 to 40 basis points higher, we told you we were targeting NII at roughly $1 billion higher in Q4 of this year. This quarter's loan growth is encouraging and supportive of this target and the slowdown in mortgage prepayments should also help improve NII. 
So while we still think getting NII $1 billion higher by 4Q is possible, admittedly, the recent significant decline in long-end rates presents a challenge. This possibility, of course, assumes loans continue to grow in the second half and rates don't move lower from here. To improve our chances, we could decide to deploy additional liquidity at higher fixed rates in the coming weeks and months as we evaluate the trade-offs between liquidity, capital and earnings.
Turning to Slide 12 and expenses. Q2 expenses were $15 billion, $0.5 billion lower than Q1. While lower than Q1, the combination of the $500 million contribution to the foundation and the nearly $300 million increase in costs associated with unemployment claims processing kept expenses above the low $14 billion target shared with you last quarter. Outside of these 2 items, expense was lower driven by the absence of a few Q1 items, seasonal payroll taxes, the real estate impairment charge and the acceleration of expense due to incentive comp award changes. Additionally, lower incentive comp and severance costs also contributed to the decline.
Lastly, our COVID costs saw a modest decline as some pandemic-related employee programs began to roll off, but this was mitigated to a certain degree by preparation costs for associates returning to the office.
As we go to the segments, I would just note that the sizable foundation contribution was allocated to the lines of business and therefore, negatively impact comparisons to prior quarters. As we look forward, we continue to invest at a high rate in people and in technology and in new financial centers. We are seeing the benefits of these investments. And now as we move forward, we expect that natural attrition will allow us to reduce headcount as we transition back to a more normal business environment. As Brian mentioned, excluding summer interns, our headcount this quarter moved down by about 2,500 people.
Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. Nothing but good news to report here. Net charge-offs this quarter fell to $595 million or 27 basis points of average loans. This is the lowest loss rate in more than 2 decades. That is 28% lower than Q1 and more than 30% below the second quarter of 2019. Our credit card loss rate was 2.67%, and several loan product categories were in recovery positions this quarter.
Provision was $1.6 billion -- was a $1.6 billion benefit -- net benefit driven by the continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, which resulted in the $2.2 billion release of credit reserves split fairly evenly between consumer and commercial loans. Our allowance as a percent of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.55%, which is still well above the 1.27%, which was the level as we begun 2020 following our day 1 adoption of CECL. And as a reminder, the mix of our loans has also changed since CECL day 1. To the extent the economic outlook and remaining uncertainties continue to improve, we expect our reserve levels could move lower.
Okay. On Slide 14, we show the credit quality metrics for both the consumer and commercial portfolios, a couple of points I would make here. With respect to card losses, given the continued low level of late-stage delinquencies in the 180-day pipeline, we would expect card losses to decline again in Q3. For at least the next couple of quarters, I would expect total net charge-offs to moderate around the current level with lower card losses partially offset by lower net recoveries and other products. With respect to commercial metrics, reservable criticized exposure and NPLs both declined in the quarter.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer on Slide 15. Consumer Banking produced another good quarter with strong customer deposit and investment flows and the return of card loan growth. This reflects the strength of our brand, our digital innovations and the deployment of specialists in our centers, all of which enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the increase in customer liquidity.
As Brian said earlier, this was a quarter of reopening where both our high-tech and high-touch capabilities delivered growth in client activity. Given vaccination progress, we reopened certain financial centers, more of our associates were at their posts in our financial centers and customer traffic was up. All of the above drove higher sales in our centers. At the same time, we also saw increased sales through digital channels, which suggests increases in digital engagement are here to stay.
The segment earned $3 billion in Q2, 13% higher than Q1 as revenue, expense and credit costs all showed improvement. Revenue improved 1%, reflecting higher card income on increased purchase volumes and modestly higher account service charges on ATM usage. Expenses moved lower versus Q1 given the absence of the Q1 real estate impairment costs and seasonal higher payroll tax expense. 
We also saw some modest improvement in COVID costs as some of the elevated pandemic-related associated costs began to wind down. Our cost of deposits this quarter improved to an impressive 118 basis points. The team has done a great job of servicing more and more deposits while maintaining a strong cost discipline aided by digital engagement. Looking back at Q2 '19, we have added 38% more deposits while expenses have only increased a little more than 3% annually in support of all that new activity even with COVID.
On Slide 16, you can see the significant increase in consumer deposits and investments. Average deposits of $979 billion are up $55 billion linked quarter and nearly $170 billion from Q2 '20 with more than 60% of that growth in checking. Rate paid is down to 2 basis points as 56% of the deposits are low-interest checking. 
We covered loans earlier, but I would just note that while average loans are down linked quarter, period end loans are up modestly, excluding PPP, as growth in card balances and vehicle lending outpaced a small decline in mortgages.
With respect to investment balances, we reached a new record of $346 billion, growing 40% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering.
Okay. On Slide 17, I'll highlight a couple of points regarding the continued improvement in engagement. After crossing 40 million digital users in Q1, we added another 0.25 million users in Q2. This quarter, 70% of our consumer households use some part of our digital platform. We also reached 2.6 billion log-ins from customers in the last 90 days. And while you will note the tremendous Erica and Zelle usage, what I would draw your attention to is the digital sales growth, which is up 26% year-over-year. 85% of booked mortgages in the quarter were done digitally while 77% of direct vehicle loans were digital.
Turning to wealth management. The continued economic reopening and strong market conditions led to records in average deposits, loans, investment balances and asset management fees in Q2. Both Merrill and the Private Bank contributed to this improvement. Growth in gross new households at Merrill continued and the average size of the new households is larger this year than last year. And at the same time, net new households grew but at a slower pace given expensive competitive hiring practice across the industry.
We remain committed to organic growth in our advisers and private client sales force as a stronger, more sustainable long-term strategy. Net income of nearly $1 billion improved 12% from Q1 as we saw improvement in both revenue and expense.
With respect to revenue, the record AUM fees complemented higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses dropped as the absence of seasonally elevated payroll tax in Q1 was partially offset by higher revenue-related costs. Client balances rose to a record of $3.7 trillion, up $725 billion year-over-year driven by higher market levels as well as strong client flows.
Let's skip to Slide 20, which highlights our progress to digitally engage wealth management clients. In both Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank, we are focused on 3 pillars for digital engagement: one, digital adoption and deeper engagement; two, modernizing our platform for advisers and clients; and three, secure and easy collaboration with clients.
We provided stats on Slide 20 that show record levels of digital engagement improved further in Q2. These are some of the highest levels of digital activity across our customers. More and more clients are logging in to easily trade, check balances and originate loans all through one simplified sign-on. 70% of checks deposited by the Private Bank clients and more than half of checks from Merrill clients are being deposited digitally now.
And through leveraging Erica-based AI capabilities and through use of WebEx meetings and secure text messaging, we are making it easy and more efficient for clients to do business with us wherever and however they choose. This creates additional capacity for our advisers to spend more time with existing and potential clients.
All right. Moving to Global Banking on Slide 21. The business earned $2.4 billion in Q2, improving $251 million from Q1. Strong revenue growth and lower expenses were mitigated by a lower provision benefit than Q1. Deposit growth maintained or remained strong and increased $20 billion to a new record.
Outside of PPP loan figures, we saw modest growth across the platform as discussed earlier. Revenue growth reflected the absence of the prior quarter impairment on clean energy investments as well as increased ESG investments. Revenue also included strong firm-wide IB fees of $2.1 billion, down only modestly from the record Q1 level. This performance resulted in an improvement to a #3 ranking in overall fees with a pipeline that remains strong. Strong debt issuance was more than offset by lower equity underwriting fees.
We had a provision benefit driven by a reserve release of $834 million in Q2, which was $328 million lower than the Q1 release. Net charge-offs were near 0, reflecting both low charge-offs and a notable recovery in the quarter. Noninterest expense declined 7% from Q1, reflecting lower compensation partially offset by other costs.
We've already covered much of the balance sheet on Slide 22, so let's get to digital trends on Slide 23. We continued our investments in digital solutions that deliver the efficiencies for both clients and our employees. The solutions for clients have a compounded effect since they invariably mean less manual intervention by the bank, enhancing both efficiency and satisfaction. Enhanced banking solutions are helping us capture greater market share as wholesale clients do more with their banking partners that are stable and secure and that have the capability to invest in new technologies that will provide better data and global integrated solutions.
Digitization, and in particular, artificial intelligence, is helping us streamline processes and respond to clients more quickly and efficiently. As an example, our bankers are using technology powered by Erica to not only better manage credit exposure, but also identify and win new business. We present some wholesale digital highlights on Slide 23.
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 24. Results reflect solid but lower sales and trading activity, as noted earlier. While down from the more elevated pandemic periods, trading revenue is still 10% or so higher from Q2 '19. As I usually do, I will talk about results excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was negligible, but the year ago quarter had a $261 million loss. Global Markets produced $934 million of earnings in Q2, down more than $1.1 billion compared to either Q1 or the year ago quarter.
Focusing on the year-over-year. Revenue was down 15% driven by the reduction in sales and trading. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by higher costs associated with processing unemployment claims and the activity related to sales and trading costs. Compared to Q1 expense, the higher unemployment processing costs were mostly offset by lower compensation.
Sales and trading contributed $3.6 billion to revenue, declining 19% year-over-year. FICC declined 38% while equities improved 33%, recording one of the strongest equity performances in our history. FICC results reflected the much more robust trading environment in the year ago period, particularly for macro products. Q2 '21 saw credit tightened and agency mortgages endured a difficult trading environment given the volatility of rates. The strength in equities was driven by a strong trading performance in derivatives and increased client activity notably in derivatives and in Asia.
On Slide 25, we note half year revenue trends across the last few years. As you can see, while the pandemic elevated results in 2020, 2021 remains well above the prior years presented driven by continued client activity and volatility in the market.
Finally, on Slide 26, we show All Other, which reported profit of $1.9 billion. The $2 billion tax adjustment benefited results. Absent this benefit, we would have reported $137 million loss, which is a decline of $239 million from Q1 '21 driven by lower revenue. 
Revenue declined $545 million, reflecting 2 impacts: first, higher partnership losses on ESG -- on increased ESG investments. As you know, we record grossed-up revenue from these investments on an FTE basis in Global Banking, pay the full tax there and then back out those entries in All Other. You can also see the increase in ESG investment in Q2 in other income on our consolidated income statement where partnership losses are booked. While this loss impacts revenue, it is more than made up for on the tax line. We expect our tax credits and associated losses in consolidated other income to increase by at least $100 million in Q3. And keep in mind, Q4 is normally even higher, reflecting seasonal activity. 
Revenue in All Other was also impacted by some refinancing activity. We called and refinanced higher cost structured notes, which pushed some AOCI back to the income statement. Our effective tax rate this quarter, excluding the $2 billion tax adjustment, was 10.7%. And further excluding tax credits driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been 25%. For the second half of '21 absent any changes in current tax laws or any other unusual items, we expect our effective tax rate to be in a range of 10% to 12%.
Okay. With that, we're ready to go to Q&A."

The usage on lines is still low. And so that is still running in the low 30s, which is about 1,000 basis points on average lower in the banking segment. But what you see underneath that is that even Business Banking, which is the segment from $5 million to $50 million, is net growing finally, and it was the most affected by the PPP runoff. And the runoff of PPP in the quarter was $6 billion, $7 billion or something like that. 
So we -- in Paul's basically flat average balances, that included -- he overcame that. So we feel good as we look across those things. So what you really see is the net car production back to prepandemic. You see gross car production basically about 90% of prepandemic. You see autos which will pick back up as inventories become available.
And the real driver on the consumer side is mortgages. We're basically holding our own right now. And that was different than, frankly, on the refi side. We lost some balances through the last several quarters. And on the commercial side, it's really line usage honestly can't go any lower. Maybe it can, but theoretically, it can't because it's been stuck here for a good 4 or 5 quarters with the activity. But the auto dealer line usage, which is in that side of the house, for example, is very low than it traditionally is. So we expect those to pick back up. But the key is we're actually producing more customers and more clients even with the low usage and the loans are starting to grow."

So our rough estimate for the fourth quarter expense is a range of low $14 billion.

Remember, if we do nothing, costs would grow by 3% or 4%, but we're driving that lower every year and quarter through OpEx, SIEM and other initiatives.  
But if you take the 4Q expense, you add the higher seasonal payroll tax, you add 1%, that's a good base, I think. And then from there, just based upon whatever assumption you want to make around higher revenue expectations in areas that are closely linked to compensation and exchange fees, I think if you do that math, you'll have a pretty good number."

And so we'd expect to keep driving that down, and that's going to be driven by everything we just talked about.
When you get to revenue-related compensation of wealth management business, that's up $0.5 billion from this quarter in '19 probably or something like that. And that's a good thing because we make money. But that will be more driven by its production capabilities and things like that.
So there's basically buildings and how many do you need and how many people -- that's driven by how many people and how much you pay our teammates who are talented and drive the business, that's driven by how many people. And we just had a -- we have been working our way down in headcount, and it then froze because of all the work we had to do around the pandemic-related programs. But now it's dropped by 1% in the quarter and that's where it pays back."

There's been some discussion around how spend is up a lot, as you indicated as well, and how much of that spend is likely to be translating into revolving versus transactor. You're giving us the daily clearly, we can see that here on the slide. But it would be helpful to understand what you're seeing in the guts of the machine. And is -- has revolver started to pick up? Or does this loan growth that you show on the slide reflect just the increased spend and transactor paydown rates are similar to what they've been over the past few months?"

You want people to use the card to get revenue, and you saw that in the fee line, you get revenue from the usage, you can also get revenue from the loans. The loans are obviously the better part of the equation.
But Betsy, you have to realize, we have about, round numbers, the same number of cards outstanding. There's $20-odd billion less balances, which people didn't get any different. They just have more cash. And so they paid off their credit cards, which is a completely responsible thing for them to do. And when they can get out and spend more money, which is starting to happen, I think you'll see them use these lines, short-term purchases.
So I don't think -- yes, the pay rate's up, but I don't think it's a fundamental difference of behavior. It's just the opportunity to use the cards for activity has been limited coming into this quarter when you finally saw things open.
So we'll see where it goes, but it's -- the good news is it's going in different direction. It had been leading up an entry point about Slide 5. And the good news is the people are high credit quality. So that means that the net -- the risk-adjusted margin, i.e., the margin from cards minus the charge-offs, is actually closer than what people think because the card charge-offs would drop by $300 million, $400 million a quarter."

Once again, in the quarter, our customers are seeing good growth opportunities in a recovering economy.

So that holds us in good stead and helps answer the question about how NII grows in the second half of the year.

Today, Bank of America reported $9.2 billion in after-tax net income or $1.03 per diluted share. These results included a few items worth highlighting, and I'm on Page 2 ahead of Paul going through the details. First, as asset quality continue to improve and the economy continue to recover, we released $2.2 billion of credit reserves established in the first half of last year. The idea that a company with our credit quality and other industry participants would be releasing reserves this quarter is not new news, but the reality is at BAC, we're seeing credit quality levels that are very strong. Net charge-offs fell to 25-year low as a percentage of loans, not just raw dollar amount. 
Let me mention a few items I don't believe were industry-wide or expected at BAC. We recorded a $2 billion positive income tax adjustment following last month's enactment of an increase in U.K. corporate income tax rate to 25%. This required a remeasurement of our deferred tax asset, which just reversed the write-downs from previous years when the tax rates were lower.
In addition, our expense level included 2 things I would note. These add up to about $800 million. With our strong results and the tax benefit, we took the opportunity to prefund $500 million to our charitable foundation. This accelerates our planned funding for not only the rest of this year, but for the next year as well. This is not new money, just utilizing some of the tax benefit to cover future expense. 
We also recorded roughly $300 million of expense associated with processing transactional card claims related to state unemployment benefits. This represents, to a large degree, a catch-up as we move through claim backlogs. 
Away from these items, we produced another quarter of solid earnings and showed evidence of good client activity in an economy that continue to recover from the pandemic. Now as we all know, the health care crisis has shown improvement and the economy has recovered. Progress on vaccinations, along with the continued support of fiscal monetary policies, has promoted a full and speedy recovery and return to economic health. 
We, like others, are reopening our facilities, and we're seeing more products being sold by our teammates in addition to the continued digital engagement at very high levels. Our advisers and bankers and relationship managers are once again meeting with clients face-to-face, building even the stronger relationships. We are seeing customer demand continue to grow given the opportunities our companies see. 
I want to take a minute or 2 on the economy and -- if you go to Slide 3. We have included a few slides highlighting our customer data. Let me hit a few highlights. The GDP growth estimates by our BofA Securities Research team for the second quarter stand at 10% and stand at 7% for the full year 2021. And the reopenings further driving projections of an economy has continued to grow at a rate above the prepandemic periods into '23.
Also, the unemployment rate dropped below 6% this quarter projected by economies to continue to fall. You also note the stability to increase consumer spending from our own BAC customers, which is not only much higher than the same periods in 2020, which you would expect, but is notably 22% higher than the first half of '21 compared to 2019. And you can see that in the lower right of the page. That growth rate in '19 was already growing strongly before the pandemic. 
A few comments regarding the characteristics of spending I think are interesting. We are halfway through the year, and the total payments through those -- through all the different means are $1.8 trillion. That's 60% of last year's level. Last year, indeed, was a record even though it was suppressed in various periods when businesses were shut down. 
More specifically, for the second quarter, the total BAC consumer small business payments set a fourth quarterly consecutive record, reaching $976 billion, up 41% year-over-year and 23% over '19. The trend has also continued into early July. 
Spending accelerated as COVID vaccinations increased, business reopened and domestic travel increased. Combined spend at retailers and services comprises over 50% of debit and credit card spending, a portion of the total spend. That increased 27% over 2019 second quarter, but did slow a bit towards the end of the quarter as consumers moved their attention and started taking summer leisure trips and activity. You can see that by noting a return of travel and entertainment spending, which comprises about 10% of debit credit card spend. You can see where recovering travel remains below 2000 -- where recovering travel remains below 2019 spending levels. 
Moving to travel up a bit. As of mid-June, domestic airline purchases were up 8% over 2019 while international airline purchase on our cards are still down approximately 40%, showing the difference of the progress against the war on the virus in United States versus other places. 
Now let's go to Slide 4. We just put this chart in to show you that the consumers are paying their bills. We've shown this each quarter so you could see that the actual card delinquency levels continue to edge down even as people are out and circulating the economy. 
Before we go to Paul, I want to comment specifically on 3 areas of interest to you: loan growth, NII and expense. And we can do that on Pages 5 and 6. So first on loans. Paul and I are going to show you the average loans. Paul will show you that later. End-of-period loans, I'll show you in a minute and long-term trends, which are on Page 5.
What all these figures point to is accelerating growth during the quarter, as we've spoken about on occasion. This quarter, we saw loan levels across most every business move past stabilization begin to make progress. Companies need to build inventory, hire workers to meet the growing customer demand. This virtuous circle of hiring workers and meeting customer spending will help drive the economy and hopefully will result in more line usage on our loans. You can see the path on Slide 5 of loans since the pandemic started in March 2020. As you can see, all of them are turning up in recent months. 
But moving to Slide 6, you see the more traditional detail for our company. Let's start on the lower right-hand side of that slide and talking about the commercial portfolio. Commercial loan balances after adjusting for the reductions in PPP loans for quarter 2 forgiveness grew $15 billion. This is led by Global Markets client borrowing activity. But beyond that and still excluding the PPP loan forgiveness, middle-market lending group and our Business Banking team finally had growth in the month of June 2021, a first since last March.  
Fueling some of this improvement is calling effectiveness. Relationship managers that have increased their calling efforts were now aggressively calling on targeted prospects. And with vaccination progress, face-to-face meetings have nearly doubled each month over the past 90 days. Commercial loans wealth management clients grew an impressive 5% in the quarter as these customers borrow through our custom lending products. 
In small business, our Practice Solutions group, which supports medical, dental and veterinary practices, has been building throughout the quarter, and small business production overall is back to prepandemic levels. 
Turning to consumer loans. Overall growth of end-of-period loans was $6 billion. Card loans grew with increased spending even as customer payment percentages remained high. Auto originations have grown fairly consistently, although recently lower dealer supplies have affected that. 
Mortgage balance growth, which is a big part of our loan portfolio in consumer, has been a challenge in the low-rate environment with high refinancing volumes exceeding originations in past quarters. We are only modestly down this quarter as our origination volumes are finally overcoming the payoffs. 
We are pleased with the trajectory through the period, and that feeds into the second half of the year. While average loans drive -- that loan balances during the third quarter will drive NII, it's good to start with a trend that has reversed the past quarters' declines. 
On NII, the good news is that we correctly called the bottom 3 quarters ago. We told you that we thought the third quarter of 2020 would be the trough. Despite the volatility and lower-rate moves and significant decline in loans, we've been able to hold NII at that level or more for 3 straight quarters. We expect it to move higher, and Paul is going to discuss that later.
The other area I want to comment on is expense. We saw -- on a reported basis, we saw a $0.5 billion in expense reduction from first quarter of '21 to second quarter of '21. This quarter, we also had about $800 million in notable items for the aforementioned charitable contribution on unemployment claims process. Absent those notable items, expense would have been down about $1 billion and in the low $14 billion range. This is a level we are targeting to expense as we move through the rest of the year. 
In the second half of the year, as we normalize our operations, we'll continue to return our business as usual, working on process improvements that allow us to reduce our headcount and to continue to fund franchise investments. Headcount in the second quarter, including -- excluding the summer interns, declined by roughly 2,500 or over 1% from the first quarter. 
So the messages for this quarter is straightforward. The organic growth machine that we had rolling before the pandemic hit is reemerging as the economy normalizes. We start to be careful to ensure that the war on the virus stays won, but we're seeing great trends. In retail and preferred and small business, we saw a strong production of core transaction accounts above prepandemic levels. This quarter was our best net sales growth in checking account since the second quarter 2015. 
We saw our card production about 90% overall prepandemic. But net cards -- net of runoff were positive the first time since the quarter -- first quarter of 2020 when we entered the pandemic. We saw growth in new Merrill Edge investment accounts, and Paul will talk to you about that. We saw a good mortgage production. We saw a stronger digital activity. 
In wealth management, we saw household growth and strong flows continue to grow even with the use of our banking platform to grow its credit side. In Global Banking, we saw loan growth and new production coming on while line usage still remains very low. We saw investment banking closed this quarter with record pipelines. 
In markets, we saw a strong first half even compared to 2020 and a strong second quarter, albeit with more normal seasonal impact. So normalizing more like '19 but still higher. And we saw headcount come down as operational excellence kicks in by over 2,000 people. 
We have work to do to keep driving down the core expenses and getting out the net COVID expenses over time. And above all, due to responsible growth, we saw strong core credit metrics. So as the economy continues to recover, we are seeing our organic growth engine kick back in. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul."
19049,670919360,2347396,"Bank of America Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2021",2021-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Bank of America Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 7. As I have done in the past few quarters, the majority of my comments -- or excuse me, my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter rather than year-over-year given the pandemic.  Since B",3428,"Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. 
I'm starting on Slide 7. As I have done in the past few quarters, the majority of my comments -- or excuse me, my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter rather than year-over-year given the pandemic.  
Since Brian already covered a lot of the income statement, I will just add a couple of comments on revenue and returns. Revenue was down 6% from Q1. The decline was driven by lower sales and trading results that more than offset solid consumer and wealth management revenue, which was a result of higher card income and AUM fees. 
It is also worth noting that while investment banking fees were down from a record Q1 level, they remained strong at more than $2 billion in Q2. Lastly, when comparing revenue against the prior year quarter, remember, Q2 '20 included a $704 million gain on the sale of some mortgage loans.  
With respect to returns, our return on tangible common equity was 20% and ROA was 123 basis points, both benefiting from the positive tax adjustment and sizable reserve release. 
Moving to Slide 8. Balance sheet expanded $60 billion versus Q1 to a little more than $3 trillion in total assets. Deposit growth of $24 billion supported $16 billion of loan growth while the combination of market-based funding and long-term debt issuance supported expansion of the balance sheet in Global Markets. Other notable movements on the balance sheet included the continued deployment of excess cash into securities. Securities increased $83 billion while cash declined $66 billion. 
Driven by the additional deposit growth, our liquidity portfolio remained above $1 trillion or 1/3 of the balance sheet. Shareholders' equity increased $3 billion as earnings outpaced capital distribution. Capital distributions of $5.8 billion were limited to the average of earnings in the previous 4 quarters for regulatory guidelines and were well below the $9 billion earned in the quarter.
With respect to regulatory ratios, consistent with Q1, standardized remained a binding approach for us and was down a little less than 30 basis points from Q1. While the CET1 ratio declined 30 basis points in Q1, it remained 200 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into a $31 billion capital cushion. 
While book value rose $3 billion, regulatory capital was up $1 billion as the $2 billion tax adjustment did not benefit CET1 capital. Higher RWA from the liquidity deployed to securities growth in our markets balance sheet and higher GWIM loan activity more than offset the benefit to the ratio from higher capital. 
Our supplemental leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.9%, dropping from the prior quarter primarily due to the removal of the regulatory relief. 5.9% versus a minimum requirement of 5% equates to approximately $600 billion of balance sheet capacity, which leaves us plenty of room for growth. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements. 
Turning to Slide 9. Brian reviewed ending loan balances earlier, so I will focus on average balances, which are more closely linked to NII. As you look at the year-over-year trends, note that these numbers include PPP loans, which have been moving lower now for 2 quarters driven by forgiveness. You can see the change in those PPP levels on the slide. 
Focusing on the linked quarter change. While loans on an ending basis were up nicely, on an average basis even with a $3 billion decline in PPP balances, loans were flat. Wealth management and Global Markets experienced the most notable improvements. GWIM continued to benefit from security-based lending as well as custom lending while continuing to have solid mortgage performance.
In Global Markets, we looked for opportunities to lend to clients against a number of different asset types, creating mostly investment-grade exposures as a good use of our liquidity. In Consumer, we saw credit card loans stabilize for the first time in more than a year as credit spending ramped up and new accounts continued to build across the quarters. Quarterly new account levels are nearly back to 2019 levels.
With respect to deposits on Slide 10, we continued to see significant growth across the client base not only because of the growth in the money supply, but also because we added new accounts and attracted increased liquidity from existing customers. I would just note that the linked quarter growth on a spot basis included a headwind of about $34 billion from customer income tax outflow. Normally, we see deposits decline in the second quarter given tax payments. But this year, we saw strong growth even with these tax payments.
Turning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII for Q2 was $10.2 billion, $10.3 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income declined a little more than $600 million from Q2 '20 driven by the rate environment and lower loan balances, but showed modest improvement from Q1. Year-over-year comparisons beginning next quarter are expected to improve nicely as Q3 '20 has proven to be the nadir for NII. And we are expecting NII improvement in Q3 and Q4.
Compared to Q1, the benefit of an additional day of interest and liquidity deployed was offset by a lower level of PPP loan forgiveness, the absence of proceeds recorded in NII from the Q1 litigation settlement and modestly higher premium amortization expense. The net interest yield declined 7 basis points from Q1 driven by the continued addition of lower-yielding debt securities in Q1 and Q2 and a larger Global Markets balance sheet. Remember, as part of our liquidity that remain, I would include about $150 billion of debt securities hedged to floating, which earned a bit more than cash.
As you'll note, given all the deposit growth at low rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remain significant and mostly unchanged from Q1, highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships. 
Let me give you a couple of thoughts around NII for the back half of the year. Last quarter, when the forward interest rate environment was 30 to 40 basis points higher, we told you we were targeting NII at roughly $1 billion higher in Q4 of this year. This quarter's loan growth is encouraging and supportive of this target and the slowdown in mortgage prepayments should also help improve NII. 
So while we still think getting NII $1 billion higher by 4Q is possible, admittedly, the recent significant decline in long-end rates presents a challenge. This possibility, of course, assumes loans continue to grow in the second half and rates don't move lower from here. To improve our chances, we could decide to deploy additional liquidity at higher fixed rates in the coming weeks and months as we evaluate the trade-offs between liquidity, capital and earnings.
Turning to Slide 12 and expenses. Q2 expenses were $15 billion, $0.5 billion lower than Q1. While lower than Q1, the combination of the $500 million contribution to the foundation and the nearly $300 million increase in costs associated with unemployment claims processing kept expenses above the low $14 billion target shared with you last quarter. Outside of these 2 items, expense was lower driven by the absence of a few Q1 items, seasonal payroll taxes, the real estate impairment charge and the acceleration of expense due to incentive comp award changes. Additionally, lower incentive comp and severance costs also contributed to the decline.
Lastly, our COVID costs saw a modest decline as some pandemic-related employee programs began to roll off, but this was mitigated to a certain degree by preparation costs for associates returning to the office.
As we go to the segments, I would just note that the sizable foundation contribution was allocated to the lines of business and therefore, negatively impact comparisons to prior quarters. As we look forward, we continue to invest at a high rate in people and in technology and in new financial centers. We are seeing the benefits of these investments. And now as we move forward, we expect that natural attrition will allow us to reduce headcount as we transition back to a more normal business environment. As Brian mentioned, excluding summer interns, our headcount this quarter moved down by about 2,500 people.
Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. Nothing but good news to report here. Net charge-offs this quarter fell to $595 million or 27 basis points of average loans. This is the lowest loss rate in more than 2 decades. That is 28% lower than Q1 and more than 30% below the second quarter of 2019. Our credit card loss rate was 2.67%, and several loan product categories were in recovery positions this quarter.
Provision was $1.6 billion -- was a $1.6 billion benefit -- net benefit driven by the continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, which resulted in the $2.2 billion release of credit reserves split fairly evenly between consumer and commercial loans. Our allowance as a percent of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.55%, which is still well above the 1.27%, which was the level as we begun 2020 following our day 1 adoption of CECL. And as a reminder, the mix of our loans has also changed since CECL day 1. To the extent the economic outlook and remaining uncertainties continue to improve, we expect our reserve levels could move lower.
Okay. On Slide 14, we show the credit quality metrics for both the consumer and commercial portfolios, a couple of points I would make here. With respect to card losses, given the continued low level of late-stage delinquencies in the 180-day pipeline, we would expect card losses to decline again in Q3. For at least the next couple of quarters, I would expect total net charge-offs to moderate around the current level with lower card losses partially offset by lower net recoveries and other products. With respect to commercial metrics, reservable criticized exposure and NPLs both declined in the quarter.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer on Slide 15. Consumer Banking produced another good quarter with strong customer deposit and investment flows and the return of card loan growth. This reflects the strength of our brand, our digital innovations and the deployment of specialists in our centers, all of which enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the increase in customer liquidity.
As Brian said earlier, this was a quarter of reopening where both our high-tech and high-touch capabilities delivered growth in client activity. Given vaccination progress, we reopened certain financial centers, more of our associates were at their posts in our financial centers and customer traffic was up. All of the above drove higher sales in our centers. At the same time, we also saw increased sales through digital channels, which suggests increases in digital engagement are here to stay.
The segment earned $3 billion in Q2, 13% higher than Q1 as revenue, expense and credit costs all showed improvement. Revenue improved 1%, reflecting higher card income on increased purchase volumes and modestly higher account service charges on ATM usage. Expenses moved lower versus Q1 given the absence of the Q1 real estate impairment costs and seasonal higher payroll tax expense. 
We also saw some modest improvement in COVID costs as some of the elevated pandemic-related associated costs began to wind down. Our cost of deposits this quarter improved to an impressive 118 basis points. The team has done a great job of servicing more and more deposits while maintaining a strong cost discipline aided by digital engagement. Looking back at Q2 '19, we have added 38% more deposits while expenses have only increased a little more than 3% annually in support of all that new activity even with COVID.
On Slide 16, you can see the significant increase in consumer deposits and investments. Average deposits of $979 billion are up $55 billion linked quarter and nearly $170 billion from Q2 '20 with more than 60% of that growth in checking. Rate paid is down to 2 basis points as 56% of the deposits are low-interest checking. 
We covered loans earlier, but I would just note that while average loans are down linked quarter, period end loans are up modestly, excluding PPP, as growth in card balances and vehicle lending outpaced a small decline in mortgages.
With respect to investment balances, we reached a new record of $346 billion, growing 40% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering.
Okay. On Slide 17, I'll highlight a couple of points regarding the continued improvement in engagement. After crossing 40 million digital users in Q1, we added another 0.25 million users in Q2. This quarter, 70% of our consumer households use some part of our digital platform. We also reached 2.6 billion log-ins from customers in the last 90 days. And while you will note the tremendous Erica and Zelle usage, what I would draw your attention to is the digital sales growth, which is up 26% year-over-year. 85% of booked mortgages in the quarter were done digitally while 77% of direct vehicle loans were digital.
Turning to wealth management. The continued economic reopening and strong market conditions led to records in average deposits, loans, investment balances and asset management fees in Q2. Both Merrill and the Private Bank contributed to this improvement. Growth in gross new households at Merrill continued and the average size of the new households is larger this year than last year. And at the same time, net new households grew but at a slower pace given expensive competitive hiring practice across the industry.
We remain committed to organic growth in our advisers and private client sales force as a stronger, more sustainable long-term strategy. Net income of nearly $1 billion improved 12% from Q1 as we saw improvement in both revenue and expense.
With respect to revenue, the record AUM fees complemented higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses dropped as the absence of seasonally elevated payroll tax in Q1 was partially offset by higher revenue-related costs. Client balances rose to a record of $3.7 trillion, up $725 billion year-over-year driven by higher market levels as well as strong client flows.
Let's skip to Slide 20, which highlights our progress to digitally engage wealth management clients. In both Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank, we are focused on 3 pillars for digital engagement: one, digital adoption and deeper engagement; two, modernizing our platform for advisers and clients; and three, secure and easy collaboration with clients.
We provided stats on Slide 20 that show record levels of digital engagement improved further in Q2. These are some of the highest levels of digital activity across our customers. More and more clients are logging in to easily trade, check balances and originate loans all through one simplified sign-on. 70% of checks deposited by the Private Bank clients and more than half of checks from Merrill clients are being deposited digitally now.
And through leveraging Erica-based AI capabilities and through use of WebEx meetings and secure text messaging, we are making it easy and more efficient for clients to do business with us wherever and however they choose. This creates additional capacity for our advisers to spend more time with existing and potential clients.
All right. Moving to Global Banking on Slide 21. The business earned $2.4 billion in Q2, improving $251 million from Q1. Strong revenue growth and lower expenses were mitigated by a lower provision benefit than Q1. Deposit growth maintained or remained strong and increased $20 billion to a new record.
Outside of PPP loan figures, we saw modest growth across the platform as discussed earlier. Revenue growth reflected the absence of the prior quarter impairment on clean energy investments as well as increased ESG investments. Revenue also included strong firm-wide IB fees of $2.1 billion, down only modestly from the record Q1 level. This performance resulted in an improvement to a #3 ranking in overall fees with a pipeline that remains strong. Strong debt issuance was more than offset by lower equity underwriting fees.
We had a provision benefit driven by a reserve release of $834 million in Q2, which was $328 million lower than the Q1 release. Net charge-offs were near 0, reflecting both low charge-offs and a notable recovery in the quarter. Noninterest expense declined 7% from Q1, reflecting lower compensation partially offset by other costs.
We've already covered much of the balance sheet on Slide 22, so let's get to digital trends on Slide 23. We continued our investments in digital solutions that deliver the efficiencies for both clients and our employees. The solutions for clients have a compounded effect since they invariably mean less manual intervention by the bank, enhancing both efficiency and satisfaction. Enhanced banking solutions are helping us capture greater market share as wholesale clients do more with their banking partners that are stable and secure and that have the capability to invest in new technologies that will provide better data and global integrated solutions.
Digitization, and in particular, artificial intelligence, is helping us streamline processes and respond to clients more quickly and efficiently. As an example, our bankers are using technology powered by Erica to not only better manage credit exposure, but also identify and win new business. We present some wholesale digital highlights on Slide 23.
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 24. Results reflect solid but lower sales and trading activity, as noted earlier. While down from the more elevated pandemic periods, trading revenue is still 10% or so higher from Q2 '19. As I usually do, I will talk about results excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was negligible, but the year ago quarter had a $261 million loss. Global Markets produced $934 million of earnings in Q2, down more than $1.1 billion compared to either Q1 or the year ago quarter.
Focusing on the year-over-year. Revenue was down 15% driven by the reduction in sales and trading. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by higher costs associated with processing unemployment claims and the activity related to sales and trading costs. Compared to Q1 expense, the higher unemployment processing costs were mostly offset by lower compensation.
Sales and trading contributed $3.6 billion to revenue, declining 19% year-over-year. FICC declined 38% while equities improved 33%, recording one of the strongest equity performances in our history. FICC results reflected the much more robust trading environment in the year ago period, particularly for macro products. Q2 '21 saw credit tightened and agency mortgages endured a difficult trading environment given the volatility of rates. The strength in equities was driven by a strong trading performance in derivatives and increased client activity notably in derivatives and in Asia.
On Slide 25, we note half year revenue trends across the last few years. As you can see, while the pandemic elevated results in 2020, 2021 remains well above the prior years presented driven by continued client activity and volatility in the market.
Finally, on Slide 26, we show All Other, which reported profit of $1.9 billion. The $2 billion tax adjustment benefited results. Absent this benefit, we would have reported $137 million loss, which is a decline of $239 million from Q1 '21 driven by lower revenue. 
Revenue declined $545 million, reflecting 2 impacts: first, higher partnership losses on ESG -- on increased ESG investments. As you know, we record grossed-up revenue from these investments on an FTE basis in Global Banking, pay the full tax there and then back out those entries in All Other. You can also see the increase in ESG investment in Q2 in other income on our consolidated income statement where partnership losses are booked. While this loss impacts revenue, it is more than made up for on the tax line. We expect our tax credits and associated losses in consolidated other income to increase by at least $100 million in Q3. And keep in mind, Q4 is normally even higher, reflecting seasonal activity. 
Revenue in All Other was also impacted by some refinancing activity. We called and refinanced higher cost structured notes, which pushed some AOCI back to the income statement. Our effective tax rate this quarter, excluding the $2 billion tax adjustment, was 10.7%. And further excluding tax credits driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been 25%. For the second half of '21 absent any changes in current tax laws or any other unusual items, we expect our effective tax rate to be in a range of 10% to 12%.
Okay. With that, we're ready to go to Q&A."

The usage on lines is still low. And so that is still running in the low 30s, which is about 1,000 basis points on average lower in the banking segment. But what you see underneath that is that even Business Banking, which is the segment from $5 million to $50 million, is net growing finally, and it was the most affected by the PPP runoff. And the runoff of PPP in the quarter was $6 billion, $7 billion or something like that. 
So we -- in Paul's basically flat average balances, that included -- he overcame that. So we feel good as we look across those things. So what you really see is the net car production back to prepandemic. You see gross car production basically about 90% of prepandemic. You see autos which will pick back up as inventories become available.
And the real driver on the consumer side is mortgages. We're basically holding our own right now. And that was different than, frankly, on the refi side. We lost some balances through the last several quarters. And on the commercial side, it's really line usage honestly can't go any lower. Maybe it can, but theoretically, it can't because it's been stuck here for a good 4 or 5 quarters with the activity. But the auto dealer line usage, which is in that side of the house, for example, is very low than it traditionally is. So we expect those to pick back up. But the key is we're actually producing more customers and more clients even with the low usage and the loans are starting to grow."

But if you take the 4Q expense, you add the higher seasonal payroll tax, you add 1%, that's a good base, I think.

When you get to revenue-related compensation of wealth management business, that's up $0.5 billion from this quarter in '19 probably or something like that. And that's a good thing because we make money. But that will be more driven by its production capabilities and things like that.

You're giving us the daily clearly, we can see that here on the slide. But it would be helpful to understand what you're seeing in the guts of the machine. And is -- has revolver started to pick up? Or does this loan growth that you show on the slide reflect just the increased spend and transactor paydown rates are similar to what they've been over the past few months?"

You want people to use the card to get revenue, and you saw that in the fee line, you get revenue from the usage, you can also get revenue from the loans. The loans are obviously the better part of the equation.
But Betsy, you have to realize, we have about, round numbers, the same number of cards outstanding. There's $20-odd billion less balances, which people didn't get any different. They just have more cash. And so they paid off their credit cards, which is a completely responsible thing for them to do. And when they can get out and spend more money, which is starting to happen, I think you'll see them use these lines, short-term purchases.
So I don't think -- yes, the pay rate's up, but I don't think it's a fundamental difference of behavior. It's just the opportunity to use the cards for activity has been limited coming into this quarter when you finally saw things open.
So we'll see where it goes, but it's -- the good news is it's going in different direction. It had been leading up an entry point about Slide 5. And the good news is the people are high credit quality. So that means that the net -- the risk-adjusted margin, i.e., the margin from cards minus the charge-offs, is actually closer than what people think because the card charge-offs would drop by $300 million, $400 million a quarter."

Once again, in the quarter, our customers are seeing good growth opportunities in a recovering economy. Deposits continue to grow $80 billion in the quarter; loan balances stabilized and grew on a period end basis for the quarter, even overcoming the PPP runoff; asset quality is at 25-year percentage loss lows, not just dollar amount.
The solid earnings continued this quarter. We -- the important thing is we're seeing increased activity by our customer base, whether it's sales of all the different products, whether it's the reopening of the branches and more appointments that lead to sales, whether it's our face-to-face meetings or commercial businesses. So that holds us in good stead and helps answer the question about how NII grows in the second half of the year.
And so -- and then on top of all that, this quarter is the first quarter in many that we've been able to -- in forever that we've been able to go back and actually use excess capital based on our earnings power and our Board's discretion. So you should expect us to get back in the share buyback game.

This quarter, the economy continued to make solid progress, and our clients continue to perform well, having adjusted to the operating environment. Many companies are making healthy",1826,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning to all, and thank you for joining us. 
This quarter, the economy continued to make solid progress, and our clients continue to perform well, having adjusted to the operating environment. Many companies are making healthy profits, and our research team expects another strong quarter of profits by American businesses. 
We reported $7.7 billion in net income or $0.85 per diluted share in the third quarter, up significantly from the year-ago period. We've now earned over $25 billion for the first 9 months of the year. 
This quarter's strong results include some themes I want to highlight ahead of Paul going through the details on the quarter. So prior to the pandemic, Bank of America was growing and creating operating leverage quarter after quarter after quarter. As I said last quarter, the pre-pandemic organic growth machine has kicked back in. You see that this quarter and is evident across all our lines of businesses. 
In addition, this quarter, we saw the return of operating leverage. We also saw another quarter of solid loan growth. The good news is that the nature of this growth has broadened in the third quarter, even as commercial banking utilization rates have improved somewhat. 
NII has improved significantly, reflecting the many quarters of growth in deposits and now loans. It also reflects a steady management of the interest rate risk and deployment of cash from our core deposit growth. At the same time, we still have a high level of asset sensitivity. 
We invested in our core deposits and that supported stability over the last year as rates and loans decline. What that did is bridge us to where we are now. This quarter, where growth in loans and other factors have led to an improvement in NII and NIM. Strong free growth has complemented that NII improvement. And with expenses moving sharply lower, we saw a notable return of operating leverage. Year-over-year, our revenues are up 12% and the expenses were flat. 
Our efficiency ratios improved to 63%. As I've done in the past, I want to spend a moment on what we see in our consumer data. Let me hit a few slides beginning first on Slide 3. 
The improvement in the vaccination and hospitalizations, all the things you know about, have seen the U.S. economy continue its reopening trajectory following the modest slowdown from the surge in cases caused by the Delta variant. While there's been some discussion around the slowdown, I would just note that U.S. economy is now as large as it was in pre pandemic. 
Our own research team, not being in transition at all, expects the U.S. economy to grow 5.5% plus this year and 5.2% next year. These growth rates are more than twice the growth rates that many of the -- that occurred in a pre-pandemic decade or longer. Unemployment rates continue to fall back to pre-pandemic levels. While the U.S. still has issues around labor supply and supply chains of materials, the economy is moving along. 
Looking at our own customer base and consumer spending, I'd offer a few insights. Third quarter total Bank of America consumer spending can see on the lower left-hand part of the slide. Payments were robust. They reached $937 billion, up 23% over 2019 for the quarter and a similar percent of growth over 2020. September was the best month of the year, and we've seen that spending rates continue through the first part of October. 
Combined spend on total -- on debit and credit cards, which is a subset of this total, about 20-odd percent of it, in that at retailers and services remain strong. In third quarter '21, we continue to see spending shift towards travel and in-person entertainment as well as fuel driven by both increased used and higher fuel prices. Year-to-date, as you can see in the charter total payments of $2.8 trillion by our consumers are 22% ahead of the 2019 levels. 
In the chart on the right, you can see how fast the growth rates occur this year. And that's another economic signpost to the steady recovery. 
Now as we turn to loan growth on Slide 4, you can see this chart that we've been presenting to you for the last several quarters. Why do we show you this? We wanted to show you that as we hit the bottom, the inflection point and what happened a couple of quarters ago. And this chart gives you a sense of the daily progression across those quarters. As you can see, every loan category has seen improvement. And if I showed you this by our lines of business, you would see similar progress across each one of them. Overall, ending loans, excluding PPP loans, which are in the forgiveness process, as you well know. Overall, those loans increased $16 billion linked quarter. 
And if you look at the commercial portfolio, they grew $11 billion quarter-over-quarter. Compared to growth in Q2, a growth this quarter was broad-based across global banking and global markets in the commercial space. C&I growth was driven in part by improved calling efforts from commercial relationship managers that we deployed across the world, including in addition to a growing demand for credit. As you might note, we've invested in hundreds of relationship managers in our commercial lines of business, and they are now -- those investments now bearing fruit. 
Loans with our wealth management clients continue to grow this quarter as these customers borrow for the reasons they borrow for liquidity and asset purchases and other things. Interestingly, in our small business area, we're seeing the business stabilize and start to grow. One of the areas is our Practice Solutions group. What that group does is lends to medical, dental and veterinary practices. They've continued to see momentum and are on the pace for the best year they've ever had. 
Now turning to consumer loans. The American consumer continues to borrow from Bank of America. Card loans grew 7% annualized from quarter 2 levels with increased spending. But as you well know, repayment rates, trends remain high. All products in the consumer side, except the home equity balances, had higher balances for the quarter. The decline in home equity balance is understandable given the prepayments in mortgage loans, et cetera. But still, we saw $1.5 billion in originations this quarter, up more than 50% from last year's third quarter. 
Now I'll turn your attention to slide in the appendix, not to cover it now, but you should take a look there. And you'll see the true loan lending business on the bottom left-hand side of that slide. And you'll see without the volatile PPP in and out that's occurred because of the program design. The loans this year and those lines of business are basically within 1% of where they were last year, and we can grow out from here. 
Moving to Slide 5. We want to show the continued reemergence of the pre-pandemic growth machine at Bank of America. We give you a few highlights. On the deposit side, we grew net consumer checking accounts which the primary transaction accounts for our consumers, 93% being primary for the 11th consecutive quarter. This drove the continued growth in deposits in our leadership position in U.S. retail deposit market share, reaching $1 trillion of deposits in our consumer segment alone. 
On credit cards, we crossed back over 1 million new card production. That's the same level as we were pre pandemic. New investment accounts have increased 9% during the pandemic. Digital progress has occurred across every business, and you'll see that in Paul's slides later. And that's increased to increased sales of products and high use of digital platforms. This bodes well for future sales levels and for future efficiency. 
Sales of banking products in Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank have remained strong. And with return to in-person meetings, we should even see them grow stronger. We have seen year-to-date assets under management flows grow and nearly triple compared to year-to-date '19. In markets and banking, we had record or near record quarters at both investment banking and equity trading revenue. 
So these are just a few examples of the customer growth we are seeing. A point or 2 on capital. This quarter's level of profits, coupled with our excess capital, allowed us not only to pay higher dividends to shareholders, but also buy back $10 billion in shares. In total, we returned $12 billion to our shareholders through these actions, proving that we can support our customers in a growing economy, support our teammates with great pay and benefits and support our communities as I'll describe it in a minute. But above all, and return capital to you, our shareholders and drive good returns for you. 
Going to Slide 6. With regard to how our teams are delivering more broadly in our communities, we gave you on Slide 6, an update on our $1.25 billion commitment. To date, we have directly funded nearly $400 million, about 1/3 of that commitment. This includes $36 million completed in equity investments in MDIs and CDFIs; $300 million in equity investment commitments to minority-focused funds to support minority and women entrepreneurs and businesses; and $70 million of directed -- philanthropic giving directed at the priorities shown on the slide, in addition to the amount we usually give on a yearly basis. 
Now it's worth noting that in addition to the equity investments, we have $2.1 billion in deposits in CDFIs and MDIs, the largest in the U.S. doing that. 
If you go to the next slide, Slide 7, this is what we're doing with our customers to help them live their financial lives even better. It highlights the products and services targeting the financial well-being of our retail clients, particularly in the low- to moderate-income areas we serve. This includes our commitment to our Pathways program, where we hire teammates from our local communities to serve our communities and be successful in our company as a company of opportunity for them. We recently opt to hire another 10,000 teammates from our communities over the next 5 years. That's because we completed the first 10,000 a year early. 
The unified ways in which our teammates in local markets do a spectacular job of approaching both banking from a global scale and banking from a local community are -- is unique and delivers every day for us. It's been a great job by our team this quarter, and I want to thank them. 
Now I'm going to turn it over to Paul. But as you know, Paul has been our CFO since 2015, has done spectacular job with our company. He's going off to help us do some interesting things in the company. And I just want to congratulate and thank Paul for support. 
And now I'll turn it over to take you through his last earnings call. Paul?"

I will start on Slide 8 by adding a couple of comments on revenue and returns. On a year-over-year basis, revenue rose 12%. The improvement was driven by a nearly $1 billion increase in NII and a nearly $1.5 billion incre",2927,"Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I will start on Slide 8 by adding a couple of comments on revenue and returns. 
On a year-over-year basis, revenue rose 12%. The improvement was driven by a nearly $1 billion increase in NII and a nearly $1.5 billion increase in noninterest income. By the way, every business segment produced year-over-year improvement in noninterest income. 
Expenses declined from Q2 and were flat with Q3 '20 despite the year-over-year improvement in revenue and related costs. Solid revenue growth, while holding expenses flat, created 1,200 basis points of operating leverage and resulted in $8.3 billion of pretax pre-provision income, up 40% year-over-year. With respect to returns, our return on tangible common equity was 16% and ROA was 99 basis points, both of which improved nicely from the year-ago period. 
Moving to Slide 9. The balance sheet expanded modestly versus Q2 to a little more than $3 trillion. After funding $9 billion of loan growth, deposit growth of $56 billion generated excess liquidity that was placed in a mixture of securities and cash. Our liquidity portfolio grew to $1.1 trillion or 1/3 of the balance sheet. Shareholders' equity declined $4.7 billion from Q2 as capital distributions outpaced earnings this quarter. 
With respect to regulatory ratios, CET1 under standardized approach was 11.1, 40 basis points lower than Q2, driven primarily by a reduction in excess capital through share repurchases and to a lesser degree, higher RWA as a result of commercial lending growth. The ratio was 160 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into a $26 billion capital cushion. 
Given our deposit growth, our supplemental leverage ratio declined to 5.6% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements. 
Turning to Slide 10, and we'll focus on average loan balances because they are more closely linked to NII. Note that loan growth over the past 2 quarters has begun to show signs of improved demand, and I will refer to quarter-over-quarter improvements on an annualized basis. Also note that these charts include PPP loans, which have been moving lower, driven by forgiveness. The footnotes detailed the change in PPP loans. 
From a peak of $25 billion last year, PPP loans have declined through forgiveness to a little more than $8 billion on an ending basis. Focusing on the linked quarter change in loans and excluding PPP loans, total consumer and commercial loans grew on an annualized basis by 9%, with commercial growing 11% and consumer improving 6%. GWIM continued to benefit from security-based lending as well as custom lending, while mortgage continued to perform solidly. In Global Markets, we again look for investment-grade opportunities with clients as a good use of liquidity. 
In Global Banking, we saw utilization move past stabilization this quarter but utilization rates are still 700 basis points lower than 2019, representing a $30 billion gap from current loan levels. In consumer, we saw credit card grow as new accounts continue to build across the quarters and credit spending continued to rebound. And importantly, in mortgage, as Brian noted, we saw growth as prepayment volumes slowed. 
With respect to deposits on Slide 11, we continued to see significant growth across the client base, adding accounts across all the deposit-taking businesses. Combining both consumer and wealth management customer balances, I would highlight that retail deposits grew $28 billion from Q2. These deposits -- these clients now entrust us to manage more than $1.3 trillion in deposits, which is more retail deposits than any other U.S. bank. 
We also saw a strong growth of $28 billion with our commercial clients. And remember, the deposits we are focused on and gathering are the operational deposits of our customers in both consumer and wholesale. 
Turning to Slide 12 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $11.1 billion, $11.2 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income increased $965 million from Q3 '20, driven by deposit growth and related investing of liquidity as well as PPP loan activity. These drivers were partially offset by lower loan levels. NII versus Q2 '21 was up $861 million. 
There were several positive contributors to the quarter-over-quarter growth. First, we had an additional day of interest. We also benefited from the continued deployment and growth of liquidity. Average loan growth also contributed to NII again this quarter, and we experienced an acceleration in the forgiveness of PPP loans, which improved NII quarter-over-quarter by a couple of hundred million. Last but not least, we had lower bond premium amortization expense, which declined from $1.6 billion to a little more than $1.4 billion. 
With respect to PPP loan forgiveness, I would emphasize that this was an acceleration or pull-forward of NII into Q3 from future periods. And as a side note, I would point out that the revenue from the PPP program has helped to defray some of the enormous cost of administering this assistance program on behalf of the government. 
Our net interest yield improved 7 basis points from Q2 to 1.68%, driven by the improvement in NII. Importantly, given continued deposit growth and low interest rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remain significant, highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships. As we move to Q4 and assuming no significant interest rate changes, we expect benefits from expected loan growth, liquidity deployment and lower premium amortization expense to more than offset the expected reduction in PPP revenue I mentioned. 
Assuming the forward curve materializes and given Q3 NII growth as well as expectations for Q4 and assuming we see any loan and deposit growth next year, we would expect NII in full year 2022 to be well above full year 2021. 
Turning to Slide 13 on expenses. Q3 expenses were $14.4 billion, an improvement of more than $600 million versus Q2. Higher revenue-related costs were more than offset by the absence of the prior quarter's contribution to our charitable foundation as well as lower cost of unemployment claims processing. Compared to the year-ago period, expenses were flat as improvements in net covered costs, the absence of elevated litigation in Q3 '20 as well as digitalization benefits and other initiative savings were offset by higher revenue related and other costs. As we look forward, we continue to see investment in technology and people at a high rate across the businesses and we are adding new financial centers in certain growth markets. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 14. As I've reported for several quarters, the picture is very good here. Net charge-offs this quarter fell again to $463 million or 20 basis points of average loans. This is the lowest loss rate in 50 years. Net charge-offs were 22% lower than Q2 and more than 42% below the same quarter in 2019. 
Our credit card loss rate was 1.7% and several loan product categories were still in recovery position this quarter. Provision was a $624 million net benefit driven primarily by asset quality improvement as delinquencies and reservable criticized commercial loans continued to move lower. We had a reserve release of $1.1 billion, split roughly 80% in commercial and 20% in consumer. 
Our allowance as a percentage of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.43%, which is still well above the level following our day 1 adoption of CECL, especially considering the mix of loans today versus then. To the extent the macroeconomic environment and asset quality improves further and remaining uncertainties dissipate, we expect our reserve levels could move lower. 
On Slide 15, we show the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. The only point I would make here is just to note the continued low level of late-stage delinquency loans, which drives expectation that card losses could decline yet again in Q4 before leveling off. 
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer on Slide 16. Before I touch on the financials, I want to highlight what a great job this team has done in turning this business around since the pandemic. All of our businesses -- of all our businesses, Consumer Banking was the most heavily impacted by the pandemic, which at its worst, drove quarterly profits to a very narrow level before rebounding. 
We incurred heavy costs to protect the health of our associates and customers, and we added contractors and other resources to support the governments and our own customer assistance programs. We added billions to credit reserves, depressing profits as worries mounted with respect to potential credit losses. Net interest income declined as interest rates fell quickly and significantly. 
Fast forward to this quarter and the segment's rebound has accelerated as earnings rebounded to more than $3 billion. Net charge-offs are at historic lows. And NII has rebounded, reflecting not only deposit growth, but also the value of their deposits and customer relationships. The business alone has now crossed over $1 trillion in deposits, up 16% year-over-year. 
Our point here is that years of investing and operating under responsible growth positioned us to not only deliver for everyone during the pandemic, but also rebound quickly to organic growth and operating leverage. We were never down and we never stopped investing. And while this is true of every segment, the rebound in our Consumer Banking earnings is just a great illustration of the resiliency of our business and our people. 
The segment earned $3 billion in Q3, 48% higher year-over-year as revenue, expense and credit costs all showed improvement. Revenue improved 10%, reflecting higher card income on increased purchase volumes and higher service charges due to client activity. Net checking accounts grew more than 700,000 year-to-date and 93% of our consumer checking accounts are primary accounts with an average checking account balance of more than $10,000. Expenses moved lower by 6% as a result of a continued reduction in COVID costs, mitigated by higher costs from minimum wage increases and other operating costs. 
On credit, we had a $242 million reserve release this quarter, however, the more direct indicator of improved asset quality is the decline in net charge-offs. Net charge-offs of $489 million were down 26% year-over-year and 22% lower quarter-over-quarter. Our credit card net loss rate for the quarter was 1.7%. Pre pandemic, it was over 3%. 
On Slide 17, you can see the increase in consumer deposits, loans and investments. We covered loans and deposit growth earlier with respect to investment balances. We reached a new record of $353 billion, growing 32% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering. Yes, balance grew as market values increased, but we also saw $21 billion of client flows. An important element of this growth has been the 9% growth in the number of accounts over the past year to more than 3 million. 
On Slide 18, let me highlight a couple of points regarding the continued improvement in digital engagement. As all of you know, enrollment is important, but usage is key. We now have nearly 41 million customers actively using our industry-leading digital platform. This quarter, 70% of households use some part of our digital platform within the past 90 days, logging in more than 2.6 billion times. And while Erica and Zelle uses has been tremendous, what I would draw your attention to is the digital sales growth, which is up 27% year-over-year. Lastly, while not reflected on this slide, I would just add digital engagement has become foundational to maintaining our customer satisfaction at historic levels. 
Turning to Wealth Management, the continued economic reopening, client flows and strong market conditions once again led to not only record investment balances and asset management fees, but also record levels of loan and deposits, all contributing to a record pretax margin in Q3. In fact, this is the 46th consecutive quarter of average loan growth in this business. Both Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank contributed to the improvement and are driving digital engagement to deliver products and services to clients. You can expect this to continue as we drive towards a modern marrow, which is adviser-led, powered by digital. Growth in our new households at Merrill and at the Private Bank continued as we continue to build pipelines and move back towards pre pandemic -- our pre-pandemic pace. 
Net income of $1.2 billion improved 64% year-over-year driven by the strong revenue performance. With respect to revenue, record AUM fees, which grew 19% year-over-year, complemented higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. 
Expenses increased in alignment with higher revenue. Client balances rose to $3.7 trillion, up 20% year-over-year, driven by higher market levels as well as strong flows of $91 billion. 
Let's skip to Slide 21 to highlight our progress in digitally engaging wealth management clients. The clients of this business continued to lead the franchise on digital adoption, utilizing not only digital tools to access their investments, but also other banking needs like mobile check deposit and lending. More and more clients logged in to easily trade, check balances and originate loans all through one simplified sign-on. And through leveraging Erica-based AI capabilities, and through use of Webex meetings and secured text messaging, we are making it easier and more efficient for clients to do business with us wherever and however they choose. This creates additional capacity for our teams to spend more time advising existing and potential clients. 
Moving to Global Banking on Slide 22. The segment had very strong performance with near record investment banking fees, another solid quarter of deposit growth and an uptick in loan demand. Strong deposit growth helped to improve NII, which complemented the continued strength in investment banking. The business earned $2.5 billion, improving $1.6 billion year-over-year, driven by both higher revenue and lower provision costs. Provision expense reflected a reserve release compared to builds in the year-ago quarter. 
Revenue grew 16% and included an 8% improvement in NI while firm-wide investment banking fees were up 23% to $2.2 billion, down only modestly from the Q1 record level. This IB performance resulted in a #4 ranking in overall fees with a pipeline that remains strong. We ranked #1 in leveraged finance and investment-grade with strong market share improvement compared to the year-ago period. We also had record M&A results. 
It is worth noting that we continued to see strong momentum in investment banking with our middle market clients. As many of you know, we have been investing in our investment banking capabilities with middle market clients for a few years now. Over that time, we have executed transactions for nearly 300 first-time IB clients and we now have investment bankers in 23 cities across the U.S. Noninterest expense increased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher revenue-related costs and continued investment in the franchise. 
We've already covered much of the balance sheet on Slide 23. So let's skip to digital trends on 24. Digital investments, strategies and tactics are an enterprise effort with learnings in one segment benefiting another. That has been particularly true in Global Banking. And as we continue to invest -- we continue our investments in digital solutions, our client adoption and uses continues to grow. 
Enhanced banking solutions have helped us capture greater market share as wholesale clients do more with banking partners that are the most stable and secure and have the capabilities to invest in new technologies that will provide better data and global integrated solutions. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 25, results reflect solid sales and trading activity led by our equities business. As I usually do, I will talk about the segment results, excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was a modest loss, but the year-ago quarter had a higher $116 million loss. 
Global Markets produced 4 -- excuse me, global market produced $941 million in earnings on par with the year-ago quarter. Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was up 3%, driven by sales and trading. Sales and trading contributed $3.6 billion to total revenue, improving 9% year-over-year. FICC declined 5%, while equities improved 33%, recording one of its stronger -- strongest performances ever. 
FICC results reflected a flat yield curve and range bound interest rates for much of the quarter with continued tight credit spreads. With interest rates moving late in the quarter, we saw an improvement in activity and revenue opportunities. The strength in equities was driven by growth in our client financing business as well as a strong trading performance and increased client activity in both cash and derivatives. The increase in expense year-over-year was driven by increased activity-related sales and trading costs. 
On Slide 26, we note year-to-date revenue trends across the last few years. As you can see, while our performance was elevated in 2020 during the pandemic, 2021 remains well above the pre-pandemic years presented, driven by continued elevation of client activity and volatility in the market as well as investments made to extend more balance sheet to clients. 
Finally, on Slide 27, we show All Other, which reported a small net loss. Revenue declined by $109 million year-over-year, reflecting higher partnership losses on ESG investments. Expense was lower year-over-year, driven by the absence of litigation accruals in the prior period. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 14%. Excluding the tax credits driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been roughly 25%. We would expect the tax rate in Q4 to be between 10% and 12%, absent any tax law changes or unusual items. 
With that, we can go to Q&A."

And what we said is we bring the expenses down, and then we'd expect them to grow. You sort of have a 3% inflationary between raises and leave aside that the market is going up, as you said, and could drive a moment in time and et cetera. But you had sort of 3% sort of embedded in CPI-type of increases in merit and rents and things like that. 
And what we said is through our efficiency, we could -- when we got to the sort of floor, which was the '19 year, the idea was then to manage that sort of 1% net growth. And we've been able to keep working at that. With the PPP and with the COVID-related costs and stuff, it's kind of threw it all around for the last 12 months, but you'll see that start to merge come out the other side. So the idea be to go revenues faster than the economy and grow expenses at a rate of net 1%, maybe 2% of the revenue growth is stronger. And that's the operating model. 
And you saw that come on quarter after quarter of operating leverage, I think, for basically 3 years plus, 14 quarters, something like that and the pandemic pushed that around. As we stabilize after the pandemic a couple of quarters ago, you're seeing it come back to the system."

This is 48th quarterly earnings conference call. So it's been a long time. But -- and I would rather never have to have senior leaders move because -- but they have a choice in life and when they retire, we have to adjust to it. But what we tried to accomplish. If you go back to last summer, we put a lot of senior executives onto the management team. 
What has happened now with Ann's retirement, Tom's retirement and Andrew's retirement as those executives now are reporting directly to me. And that's really the effort. So we're a younger, more diverse, 3 women running the 8 lines of business. Same philosophy of how we run the company. And now with a group of people who have 5 to 10 years ahead of them. And then we have 2 international colleagues on the management team for the first time and Bernie and Cathy. Cathy is needed to help us in the European context as Brexit came through. It's different and that -- so she's going to go help us in that and be a great help to us. Bernie has international. He does a great job for us. 
But the idea was to elevate people who -- and also focus on people who are thinking 10 years out as opposed to 1 or 2 in retirement. And so that's really the genesis of it. People retire and we make reactions. And Tom and Ann and Andrew have been tremendous teammates, but the best thing they did for us is develop a bench behind them that is extremely strong that can step into the jobs. And frankly, we're running a lot of the businesses as they -- over the last few years as they -- we all spent more time on driving our brand in the market and other things that are more at the company level."

And these are core checking accounts. The primary is -- keeps going up. It actually went from 92% to 93% over the last year, primary account. So the production hit this quarter was, I think, a 10-year high in terms of net accounts. And that's coming both from the digital 50% of sales round numbers. And we now have, to your point, over the last 3 years, develop full digital execution in terms of account opening for core accounts in terms of auto purchases, in terms of mortgage origination, et cetera. Which now allows a fully digital practice take place, half the sales are digital. 
The good news, honestly, is that as the branches reopened over the last -- and people -- the visits went up, you saw the count sold rise because it takes both high-touch and high-tech to be successful. So the percentage in sales of digital came down, but that's because overall sales jumped up, and obviously, they're more brands dominated. But you got it exactly right. We think that is a more efficient method of accumulation customers. We think we have about 17% market share in the Gen Z area that is heavily digitally-originated. Lot of colleges, a lot of other things going on. 
But the key is to realize that net balances per account have gone from 7,000 to 10,000 over the last couple of years. So you're seeing a bigger and bigger core position. When you go with -- and that's one thing to keep in mind is when we give you our 40 million digital customers, these customers are core customers with big balances. So Merrill Edge, for example, I think we're up to 70,000 or something average balance per account, not 3,000 or 4,000. 
But anyway, just on the cloud, the cloud is a complex question. So as you're well aware, over the -- the last 8, 10 years, Cathy and the team led an effort to internalize our cloud, which made us a lot more efficient. And so we look at -- we run percentage of our business outside due to certain executions and things like that. We have 500 different software programs that run in a SaaS basis, which is the question of cloud can be misleading is, can you get to the all the product types or capability types you can get out there because of the new companies that develop them on to cloud-based systems, and we can get to them all. 
The IBM is an effort to internalize the cloud that we can use the financial service industry and IBM is working on that. But these things have to be done carefully for purposes of security and trust and understanding our businesses. And so far, we've come to the judgment that we're continuing to internalizing saving a lot of money, and we continue to add modest amounts to the cloud. But importantly, there's no restraint on our ability to tap innovation or ingenuity based on whether it's running internally or externally."

So look, we expect deposit growth to continue, although it's going to be likely at a slower rate than what was experienced so far this year, and we expect our growth to continue in line with or slightly better than the industry. You got to remember that we're entering a phase of tapering. Taping is still QE. So deposits are really not likely to decline until many quarters. If you look back at historical data after QE ends, if they ever do. Because as the economy expands, the multiplier effect we could see growth in deposits, even though money supply is coming down. 
So we'll just have to wait and see. But what we do know is, as QE starts, we're still -- it's still going to be stimulative from a deposit standpoint. And then, as I said, if deposits do decline, it will probably many quarters a couple of years maybe after QE ends."

When looking at the consumer deposit base, sometimes I think it's dejavu all over again is a classic statement because in '15, '16, '17, it was all about the Fed's going to normalized rates and you're going to have to rais",557,"George, just a couple of things. When looking at the consumer deposit base, sometimes I think it's dejavu all over again is a classic statement because in '15, '16, '17, it was all about the Fed's going to normalized rates and you're going to have to raise prices, and we didn't have to because we've -- the reason why we don't have to is these are core transactional accounts. In a large part, not interest-bearing. And so you'll see some of that same dynamic apply, again, as the rates normalize and the monetary supply has changed. 
But in the consumer business, 56% of the balances are checking. So that would say, those are core transaction accounts, money moving and out, very little CDs, I think $50 billion, $60 billion or something like that. So the $1 trillion is all basically in checking and money market. 
So can it move around? Yes, if you look, one of the things that bodes well and -- for the economy is that if you look at a checking customer that has maybe $2,000 or $3,000 in balances with us, either sitting with 3 to 4 -- 3x what they had before the crisis, that's good news. They will spend some of that, I assume. But interesting enough, that's been growing month-over-month for the last few months. So it's not going down even though the stimulus payments to customers, in large part other than the childcare, stops. 
So one of the things that bodes well for the economy, and this isn't trying to causing to some viewpoint about it is the consumer still has a lot of money in their accounts and they're going to spend it. Going back to your deposit question. Could that mean those balances come down a little bit, but it will be overcome by the new accounts coming on in $1 million a year that carried $10,000 average balance, et cetera. So we feel good about long-term deposit growth, and it's all -- it's driven by the checking core transactions. 
Loan-to-deposit ratio, it's our customers driving it. So when the usage by the auto dealer lines is down to 25% of what it was because inventory is being down. Of course, we -- they want to borrow, we want to lend to them because that means they have the inventory to sell to the consumer. So this is a customer-driven business. And so $900 billion odd of loans against $2 trillion of deposits is largely driven by the customer activity. 
The good news is you can see in those charts that I call the smile charts on the loan growth page there that the other half of the smile is coming up, meaning that the customers are starting to draw and credit and use it, and that will bode well for the customer growing their businesses and stuff. But importantly, thinking about just the economy generally. 
One of the things I just want to -- I'll remind you of, Gerard, is we break out consumer and GWIM and a lot of people talk about retail deposits. That is $1.4 trillion -- $1.3 trillion when you combine them together. So it is a big machine, and it's all transactional. And we just don't think that moves as much on monetary supply questions as, obviously, on the institutional side."

And that -- so deploying balance sheet against that recognizing activity level sustaining, et cetera. 
And then if you go in the lending business, it's customer selection. So we were out with those 100 extra relationship managers banging away at the world, getting more customers the hard way, and you're seeing net new customers in the business banking, small business segments and stuff growing. You see that in the wealth management business. So what you'll see is that the balance sheet deployed to markets as a capital and balance sheet question. Everywhere else it's going to follow the customer, but it's the core customer growth, and that's why you put those statistics in -- that you see. 
Meanwhile, Merrill Edge is over $300 billion and becoming a fairly significant enterprise on its own. And you see some of these other aspects. So we feel good about it.

I do think it's important to remind everybody, I know you know it, but I'll remind everybody that these partnership losses are booked in other income, but they're more than offset in the tax line. So as we grow these activities in the future, there will be a small headwind to revenue growth, but not to net income growth given the tax benefits of these investments. 
As you think about modeling, everybody out there, we expect the fourth quarter loss to be $800 million on the other income line from these tax investments or even perhaps a little higher, reflecting both the sort of typical seasonal increase in the fourth quarter in partnership investments as well as there were a few deals in the third quarter that got delayed because of all the logistical stuff, and we think they're going to pop into the fourth quarter. 
Beyond that, putting the fourth quarter aside, a good modeling assumption for the normal 3 quarters of '22, I would say, absent unusual items, it will be a quarterly loss of kind of $400 million to $500 million for those ESG investments.

When you look at our sort of consumer banking, card income fees, they were up very nicely year-over-year at about 8%, driven, as you said, by the purchase volume increases despite the fact that payment rates are still relatively high. But when you look at the consolidated line, you're not going to see that. It's up only slightly versus Q3 '20 because of the decline in card income associated with processing, unemployment claims which sits in global markets. So just for some clarification there. 
In terms of balances, look, we're expecting card balances to continue to improve. The balances grew 7% quarter-over-quarter on an annualized basis, including some small growth and revolving balances, and we opened over 1 million new accounts, which now matches pre-pandemic levels. I think balance growth reflected higher spend and the reinitiated marketing efforts that we've talked about, including promo offers, while, again, payment rates remained elevators. We expect higher Q4 seasonal purchase volume, and that's going to drive additional balances in cards."

You've got the balance question on cards, but you always have to look at the spending side of it. And we said dropping credit cards, only about 20-odd percent of the way consumers spend money, other accounts cash, all the ATMs, checks written, Zelle is taking off and becoming a meaningful amount of the payment. So I think that cards are an easy form of payment. We're already seeing tap cards things at 12% of the -- 12% of the penetration already. So -- but the good news is no matter how you cut it and how you look at it, 2 good message. Card balances are growing. And -- but there's still tremendous capacity for the consumers to borrow if they want to do things. 
The second thing is that the spending levels are growing at a 10% growth rates in an economy in the U.S., which is led by the American consumer. That is a tremendous amount of spending that's going on, and it's accelerating even as the stimulus is not -- is in the rearview mirror by quite many months. So as people get back to work in higher wages and things, there's just more money to spend. 
So I think the focus on card as a spending vehicle versus a borrowing vehicle, it will be something we look at. But it's -- we like the business. We continue to generate 1 million new cards, as Paul talked about, and it will break down about who needs to borrow and what and the asset quality is unbelievable. The NIM is high as it's ever been, and that's a good business."

All that loan stayed on the books, plus we grew it on top of that, as we said earlier, I think $60 billion excluding the PPP. 
That's what's going to build into the NII projections going forward because that's 250, 300 basis point spread stuff. And remember, we're funding it with 0 cost deposits to the tune of $200 billion or $300 billion up year-over-year. So that's what drives -- that will drive it long term.

This quarter, the economy continued to make solid progress, and our clients continue to perform well, having adjusted to the operating environment. Many companies are making healthy",1833,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning to all, and thank you for joining us. 
This quarter, the economy continued to make solid progress, and our clients continue to perform well, having adjusted to the operating environment. Many companies are making healthy profits, and our research team expects another strong quarter of profits by American businesses. 
We reported $7.7 billion in net income or $0.85 per diluted share in the third quarter, up significantly from the year-ago period. We've now earned over $25 billion for the first 9 months of the year. 
This quarter's strong results include some themes I want to highlight ahead of Paul going through the details on the quarter. So prior to the pandemic, Bank of America was growing and creating operating leverage quarter after quarter after quarter. As I said last quarter, the pre-pandemic organic growth machine has kicked back in. You see that this quarter and is evident across all our lines of businesses. 
In addition, this quarter, we saw the return of operating leverage. We also saw another quarter of solid loan growth. The good news is that the nature of this growth has broadened in the third quarter, even as commercial banking utilization rates have improved somewhat. 
NII has improved significantly, reflecting the many quarters of growth in deposits and now loans. It also reflects a steady management of the interest rate risk and deployment of cash from our core deposit growth. At the same time, we still have a high level of asset sensitivity. 
We invested in our core deposits, and that supported stability over the last year as rates and loans decline. What that did is bridge us to where we are now. This quarter, where growth in loans and other factors have led to an improvement in NII and NIM, strong free growth has complemented that NII improvement. And with expenses moving sharply lower, we saw a notable return of operating leverage. Year-over-year, our revenues are up 12%, and the expenses were flat. 
Our efficiency ratios improved to 63%. As I've done in the past, I want to spend a moment on what we see in our consumer data. Let me hit a few slides beginning first on Slide 3. 
The improvement in the vaccination and hospitalizations, all the things you know about, have seen the U.S. economy continue its reopening trajectory following the modest slowdown from the surge in cases caused by the Delta variant. While there's been some discussion around the slowdown, I would just note that U.S. economy is now as large as it was in pre-pandemic. 
Our own research team, not being in transition at all, expects the U.S. economy to grow 5.5% plus this year and 5.2% next year. These growth rates are more than twice the growth rates that many of the -- that occurred in a pre-pandemic decade or longer. Unemployment rates continue to fall back to pre-pandemic levels. While the U.S. still has issues around labor supply and supply chains of materials, the economy is moving along. 
Looking at our own customer base and consumer spending, I'd offer a few insights. Third quarter total Bank of America consumer spending, you can see on the lower left-hand part of the slide, payments were robust. They reached $937 billion, up 23% over 2019 for the quarter and a similar percent of growth over 2020. September was the best month of the year, and we've seen that spending rates continue through the first part of October. 
Combined spend on total -- on debit and credit cards, which is a subset of this total, about 20-odd percent of it, in that at retailers and services remain strong. In third quarter '21, we continue to see spending shift towards travel and in-person entertainment as well as fuel driven by both increased used and higher fuel prices. Year-to-date, as you can see in the chart, our total payments of $2.8 trillion by our consumers are 22% ahead of the 2019 levels. 
In the chart on the right, you can see how fast the growth rates occur this year. And that's another economic signpost to the steady recovery. 
Now as we turn to loan growth on Slide 4, you can see this chart that we've been presenting to you for the last several quarters. Why do we show you this? We wanted to show you that as we hit the bottom, the inflection point and what happened a couple of quarters ago. And this chart gives you a sense of the daily progression across those quarters. As you can see, every loan category has seen improvement. And if I showed you this by our lines of business, you would see similar progress across each one of them. Overall, ending loans, excluding PPP loans, which are in the forgiveness process, as you well know, overall, those loans increased $16 billion linked quarter. 
And if you look at the commercial portfolio, they grew $11 billion quarter-over-quarter. Compared to growth in Q2, growth this quarter was broad-based across global banking and global markets in the commercial space. C&I growth was driven in part by improved calling efforts from commercial relationship managers that we deployed across the world, including, in addition to a growing demand for credit. As you might note, we've invested in hundreds of relationship managers in our commercial lines of business. And they are now -- those investments are now bearing fruit. 
Loans with our wealth management clients continue to grow this quarter as these customers borrow for the reasons they borrow for liquidity and asset purchases and other things. Interestingly, in our small business area, we're seeing the business stabilize and start to grow. One of the areas is our Practice Solutions group. What that group does is lends to medical, dental and veterinary practices. They've continued to see momentum and are on the pace for the best year they've ever had. 
Now turning to consumer loans. The American consumer continues to borrow from Bank of America. Card loans grew 7% annualized from quarter 2 levels with increased spending. But as you well know, repayment rates trends remain high. All products in the consumer side, except the home equity balances, had higher balances for the quarter. The decline in home equity balance is understandable given the prepayments in mortgage loans, et cetera. But still, we saw $1.5 billion in originations this quarter, up more than 50% from last year's third quarter. 
Now I'll turn your attention to slide in the appendix, not to cover it now, but you should take a look there. And you'll see the true loan lending business on the bottom left-hand side of that slide. And you'll see without the volatile PPP in and out that's occurred because of the program design. The loans this year and those lines of business are basically within 1% of where they were last year, and we can grow out from here. 
Moving to Slide 5. We want to show the continued reemergence of the pre-pandemic growth machine at Bank of America. We give you a few highlights. On the deposit side, we grew net consumer checking accounts, which the primary transaction accounts for our consumers, 93% being primary for the 11th consecutive quarter. This drove the continued growth in deposits in our leadership position in U.S. retail deposit market share, reaching $1 trillion of deposits in our consumer segment alone. 
On credit cards, we crossed back over 1 million new card production. That's the same level as we were pre-pandemic. New investment accounts have increased 9% during the pandemic. Digital progress has occurred across every business, and you'll see that in Paul's slides later. And that's increased to increased sales of products and high use of digital platforms. This bodes well for future sales levels and for future efficiency. 
Sales of banking products in Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank have remained strong. And with return to in-person meetings, we should see them -- even see them grow stronger. We have seen year-to-date assets under management flows grow, and it nearly triple compared to year-to-date '19. In markets and banking, we had record or near record quarters at both investment banking and equity trading revenue. 
So these are just a few examples of the customer growth we are seeing. A point or two on capital. This quarter's level of profits, coupled with our excess capital, allowed us not only to pay higher dividends to shareholders, but also buy back $10 billion in shares. In total, we returned $12 billion to our shareholders through these actions, proving that we can support our customers in a growing economy, support our teammates with great pay and benefits and support our communities as I'll describe it in a minute, but above all, and return capital to you, our shareholders and drive good returns for you. 
Going to Slide 6. With regard to how our teams are delivering more broadly in our communities, we gave you on Slide 6, an update on our $1.25 billion commitment. To date, we have directly funded nearly $400 million, about 1/3 of that commitment. This includes $36 million completed in equity investments in MDIs and CDFIs; $300 million in equity investment commitments to minority-focused funds to support minority and women entrepreneurs and businesses; and $70 million of directed -- philanthropic giving directed at the priorities shown on the slide, in addition to the amount we usually give on a yearly basis. 
Now it's worth noting that in addition to the equity investments, we have $2.1 billion in deposits in CDFIs and MDIs, the largest in the U.S. doing that. 
If you go to the next slide, Slide 7, this is what we're doing with our customers to help them live their financial lives even better. It highlights the products and services targeting the financial well-being of our retail clients, particularly in the low- to moderate-income areas we serve. This includes our commitment to our Pathways program, where we hire teammates from our local communities to serve our communities and be successful in our company as a company of opportunity for them. We -- recently we opt to hire another 10,000 teammates from our communities over the next 5 years. That's because we completed the first 10,000 a year early. 
The unified ways in which our teammates in local markets do a spectacular job of approaching both banking from a global scale and both banking from a local community are -- is unique and delivers every day for us. It's been a great job by our team this quarter, and I want to thank them. 
Now I'm going to turn it over to Paul. But as you know, Paul has been our CFO since 2015, has done spectacular job with our company. He's going off to help us do some interesting things in the company. And I just want to congratulate and thank Paul for support. 
And now I'll turn it over to take you through his last earnings call. Paul?"

I will start on Slide 8 by adding a couple of comments on revenue and returns. On a year-over-year basis, revenue rose 12%. The improvement was driven by a nearly $1 billion increase in NII and a nearly $1.5 billion incre",2926,"Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I will start on Slide 8 by adding a couple of comments on revenue and returns. 
On a year-over-year basis, revenue rose 12%. The improvement was driven by a nearly $1 billion increase in NII and a nearly $1.5 billion increase in noninterest income. By the way, every business segment produced year-over-year improvement in noninterest income. 
Expenses declined from Q2 and were flat with Q3 '20 despite the year-over-year improvement in revenue and related costs. Solid revenue growth, while holding expenses flat, created 1,200 basis points of operating leverage and resulted in $8.3 billion of pretax pre-provision income, up 40% year-over-year. With respect to returns, our return on tangible common equity was 16% and ROA was 99 basis points, both of which improved nicely from the year-ago period. 
Moving to Slide 9. The balance sheet expanded modestly versus Q2 to a little more than $3 trillion. After funding $9 billion of loan growth, deposit growth of $56 billion generated excess liquidity that was placed in a mixture of securities and cash. Our liquidity portfolio grew to $1.1 trillion or 1/3 of the balance sheet. Shareholders' equity declined $4.7 billion from Q2 as capital distributions outpaced earnings this quarter. 
With respect to regulatory ratios, CET1 under standardized approach was 11.1, 40 basis points lower than Q2, driven primarily by a reduction in excess capital through share repurchases and to a lesser degree, higher RWA as a result of commercial lending growth. The ratio was 160 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into a $26 billion capital cushion. 
Given our deposit growth, our supplemental leverage ratio declined to 5.6% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements. 
Turning to Slide 10, and we'll focus on average loan balances because they are more closely linked to NII. Note that loan growth over the past 2 quarters has begun to show signs of improved demand, and I will refer to quarter-over-quarter improvements on an annualized basis. Also note that these charts include PPP loans, which have been moving lower, driven by forgiveness. The footnotes detailed the change in PPP loans. 
From a peak of $25 billion last year, PPP loans have declined through forgiveness to a little more than $8 billion on an ending basis. Focusing on the linked quarter change in loans and excluding PPP loans, total consumer and commercial loans grew on an annualized basis by 9%, with commercial growing 11% and consumer improving 6%. GWIM continued to benefit from security-based lending as well as custom lending, while mortgage continued to perform solidly. In Global Markets, we again look for investment-grade opportunities with clients as a good use of liquidity. 
In Global Banking, we saw utilization move past stabilization this quarter but utilization rates are still 700 basis points lower than 2019, representing a $30 billion gap from current loan levels. In consumer, we saw credit card grow as new accounts continue to build across the quarters and credit spending continued to rebound. And importantly, in mortgage, as Brian noted, we saw growth as prepayment volumes slowed. 
With respect to deposits on Slide 11, we continued to see significant growth across the client base, adding accounts across all the deposit-taking businesses. Combining both consumer and wealth management customer balances, I would highlight that retail deposits grew $28 billion from Q2. These deposits -- these clients now entrust us to manage more than $1.3 trillion in deposits, which is more retail deposits than any other U.S. bank. 
We also saw a strong growth of $28 billion with our commercial clients. And remember, the deposits we are focused on and gathering are the operational deposits of our customers in both consumer and wholesale. 
Turning to Slide 12 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $11.1 billion, $11.2 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income increased $965 million from Q3 '20, driven by deposit growth and related investing of liquidity as well as PPP loan activity. These drivers were partially offset by lower loan levels. NII versus Q2 '21 was up $861 million. 
There were several positive contributors to the quarter-over-quarter growth. First, we had an additional day of interest. We also benefited from the continued deployment and growth of liquidity. Average loan growth also contributed to NII again this quarter, and we experienced an acceleration in the forgiveness of PPP loans, which improved NII quarter-over-quarter by a couple of hundred million. Last but not least, we had lower bond premium amortization expense, which declined from $1.6 billion to a little more than $1.4 billion. 
With respect to PPP loan forgiveness, I would emphasize that this was an acceleration or pull-forward of NII into Q3 from future periods. And as a side note, I would point out that the revenue from the PPP program has helped to defray some of the enormous cost of administering this assistance program on behalf of the government. 
Our net interest yield improved 7 basis points from Q2 to 1.68%, driven by the improvement in NII. Importantly, given continued deposit growth and low interest rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remain significant, highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships. As we move to Q4, and assuming no significant interest rate changes, we expect benefits from expected loan growth, liquidity deployment and lower premium amortization expense to more than offset the expected reduction in PPP revenue I mentioned. 
Assuming the forward curve materializes and given Q3 NII growth as well as expectations for Q4 and assuming we see any loan and deposit growth next year, we would expect NII in full year 2022 to be well above full year 2021. 
Turning to Slide 13 on expenses. Q3 expenses were $14.4 billion, an improvement of more than $600 million versus Q2. Higher revenue-related costs were more than offset by the absence of the prior quarter's contribution to our charitable foundation as well as lower cost of unemployment claims processing. Compared to the year-ago period, expenses were flat as improvements in net covered costs, the absence of elevated litigation in Q3 '20 as well as digitalization benefits and other initiative savings were offset by higher revenue related and other costs. As we look forward, we continue to see investment in technology and people at a high rate across the businesses. And we are adding new financial centers in certain growth markets. 
Turning to asset quality on Slide 14. As I've reported for several quarters, the picture is very good here. Net charge-offs this quarter fell again to $463 million or 20 basis points of average loans. This is the lowest loss rate in 50 years. Net charge-offs were 22% lower than Q2 and more than 42% below the same quarter in 2019. 
Our credit card loss rate was 1.7% and several loan product categories were still in recovery position this quarter. Provision was a $624 million net benefit driven primarily by asset quality improvement as delinquencies and reservable criticized commercial loans continued to move lower. We had a reserve release of $1.1 billion, split roughly 80% in commercial and 20% in consumer. 
Our allowance as a percentage of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.43%, which is still well above the level following our day 1 adoption of CECL, especially considering the mix of loans today versus then. To the extent the macroeconomic environment and asset quality improves further and remaining uncertainties dissipate, we expect our reserve levels could move lower. 
On Slide 15, we show the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. The only point I would make here is just to note the continued low level of late-stage delinquency loans, which drives expectation that card losses could decline yet again in Q4 before leveling off. 
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer on Slide 16. Before I touch on the financials, I want to highlight what a great job this team has done in turning this business around since the pandemic. All of our businesses -- of all our businesses, Consumer Banking was the most heavily impacted by the pandemic, which at its worst, drove quarterly profits to a very narrow level before rebounding. 
We incurred heavy costs to protect the health of our associates and customers, and we added contractors and other resources to support the governments and our own customer assistance programs. We added billions to credit reserves, depressing profits as worries mounted with respect to potential credit losses. Net interest income declined as interest rates fell quickly and significantly. 
Fast forward to this quarter and the segment's rebound has accelerated as earnings rebounded to more than $3 billion. Net charge-offs are at historic lows. And NII has rebounded, reflecting not only deposit growth, but also the value of their deposits and customer relationships. The business alone has now crossed over $1 trillion in deposits, up 16% year-over-year. 
Our point here is that years of investing and operating under responsible growth positioned us to not only deliver for everyone during the pandemic, but also rebound quickly to organic growth and operating leverage. We were never down and we never stopped investing. And while this is true of every segment, the rebound in our Consumer Banking earnings is just a great illustration of the resiliency of our business and our people. 
The segment earned $3 billion in Q3, 48% higher year-over-year as revenue, expense and credit costs all showed improvement. Revenue improved 10%, reflecting higher card income on increased purchase volumes and higher service charges due to client activity. Net checking accounts grew more than 700,000 year-to-date and 93% of our consumer checking accounts are primary accounts with an average checking account balance of more than $10,000. Expenses moved lower by 6% as a result of a continued reduction in COVID costs, mitigated by higher costs from minimum wage increases and other operating costs. 
On credit, we had a $242 million reserve release this quarter, however, the more direct indicator of improved asset quality is the decline in net charge-offs. Net charge-offs of $489 million were down 26% year-over-year and 22% lower quarter-over-quarter. Our credit card net loss rate for the quarter was 1.7%. Pre-pandemic, it was over 3%. 
On Slide 17, you can see the increase in consumer deposits, loans and investments. We covered loans and deposit growth earlier with respect to investment balances. We reached a new record of $353 billion, growing 32% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering. Yes, balance grew as market values increased, but we also saw $21 billion of client flows. An important element of this growth has been the 9% growth in the number of accounts over the past year to more than 3 million. 
On Slide 18, let me highlight a couple of points regarding the continued improvement in digital engagement. As all of you know, enrollment is important, but usage is key. We now have nearly 41 million customers actively using our industry-leading digital platform. This quarter, 70% of households use some part of our digital platform within the past 90 days, logging in more than 2.6 billion times. And while Erica and Zelle users has been tremendous, what I would draw your attention to is the digital sales growth, which is up 27% year-over-year. Lastly, while not reflected on this slide, I would just add digital engagement has become foundational to maintaining our customer satisfaction at historic levels. 
Turning to Wealth Management, the continued economic reopening, client flows and strong market conditions once again led to not only record investment balances and asset management fees, but also record levels of loan and deposits, all contributing to a record pretax margin in Q3. In fact, this is the 46th consecutive quarter of average loan growth in this business. Both Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank contributed to the improvement and are driving digital engagement to deliver products and services to clients. You can expect this to continue as we drive towards a modern marrow, which is adviser-led, powered by digital. Growth in our new households at Merrill and at the Private Bank continued as we continue to build pipelines and move back towards pre pandemic -- our pre-pandemic pace. 
Net income of $1.2 billion improved 64% year-over-year driven by the strong revenue performance. With respect to revenue, record AUM fees, which grew 19% year-over-year, complemented higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. 
Expenses increased in alignment with higher revenue. Client balances rose to $3.7 trillion, up 20% year-over-year, driven by higher market levels as well as strong flows of $91 billion. 
Let's skip to Slide 21 to highlight our progress in digitally engaging wealth management clients. The clients of this business continued to lead the franchise on digital adoption, utilizing not only digital tools to access their investments, but also other banking needs like mobile check deposit and lending. More and more clients logged in to easily trade, check balances and originate loans all through one simplified sign-on. And through leveraging Erica-based AI capabilities and through use of Webex meetings and secured text messaging, we are making it easier and more efficient for clients to do business with us wherever and however they choose. This creates additional capacity for our teams to spend more time advising existing and potential clients. 
Moving to Global Banking on Slide 22. The segment had very strong performance with near record investment banking fees, another solid quarter of deposit growth and an uptick in loan demand. Strong deposit growth helped to improve NII, which complemented the continued strength in investment banking. The business earned $2.5 billion, improving $1.6 billion year-over-year, driven by both higher revenue and lower provision costs. Provision expense reflected a reserve release compared to builds in the year-ago quarter. 
Revenue grew 16% and included an 8% improvement in NI while firm-wide investment banking fees were up 23% to $2.2 billion, down only modestly from the Q1 record level. This IB performance resulted in a #4 ranking in overall fees with a pipeline that remains strong. We ranked #1 in leveraged finance and investment-grade with strong market share improvement compared to the year-ago period. We also had record M&A results. 
It is worth noting that we continued to see strong momentum in investment banking with our middle market clients. As many of you know, we have been investing in our investment banking capabilities with middle market clients for a few years now. Over that time, we have executed transactions for nearly 300 first-time IB clients, and we now have investment bankers in 23 cities across the U.S. Noninterest expense increased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher revenue-related costs and continued investment in the franchise. 
We've already covered much of the balance sheet on Slide 23. So let's skip to digital trends on 24. Digital investments, strategies and tactics are an enterprise effort with learnings in one segment benefiting another. That has been particularly true in Global Banking. And as we continue to invest -- we continue our investments in digital solutions, our client adoption and uses continues to grow. 
Enhanced banking solutions have helped us capture greater market share as wholesale clients do more with banking partners that are the most stable and secure and have the capabilities to invest in new technologies that will provide better data and global integrated solutions. 
Switching to Global Markets on Slide 25, results reflect solid sales and trading activity led by our equities business. As I usually do, I will talk about the segment results, excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was a modest loss, but the year-ago quarter had a higher $116 million loss. 
Global Markets produced 4 -- excuse me, global market produced $941 million in earnings on par with the year-ago quarter. Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was up 3%, driven by sales and trading. Sales and trading contributed $3.6 billion to total revenue, improving 9% year-over-year. FICC declined 5%, while equities improved 33%, recording one of its stronger -- strongest performances ever. 
FICC results reflected a flat yield curve and range bound interest rates for much of the quarter with continued tight credit spreads. With interest rates moving late in the quarter, we saw an improvement in activity and revenue opportunities. The strength in equities was driven by growth in our client financing business as well as a strong trading performance and increased client activity in both cash and derivatives. The increase in expense year-over-year was driven by increased activity-related sales and trading costs. 
On Slide 26, we note year-to-date revenue trends across the last few years. As you can see, while our performance was elevated in 2020 during the pandemic, 2021 remains well above the pre-pandemic years presented, driven by continued elevation of client activity and volatility in the market as well as investments made to extend more balance sheet to clients. 
Finally, on Slide 27, we show All Other, which reported a small net loss. Revenue declined by $109 million year-over-year, reflecting higher partnership losses on ESG investments. Expense was lower year-over-year, driven by the absence of litigation accruals in the prior period. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 14%. Excluding the tax credits driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been roughly 25%. We would expect the tax rate in Q4 to be between 10% and 12%, absent any tax law changes or unusual items. 
With that, we can go to Q&A."

And what we said is we bring the expenses down, and then we'd expect them to grow. You sort of have a 3% inflationary between raises and leave aside that the market is going up, as you said, and could drive a moment in time and et cetera. But you had sort of 3% sort of embedded in CPI-type of increases in merit and rents and things like that. 
And what we said is through our efficiency, we could -- when we got to the sort of floor, which was the '19 year, the idea was then to manage that sort of 1% net growth. And we've been able to keep working at that. With the PPP and with the COVID-related costs and stuff, it's kind of threw it all around for the last 12 months, but you'll see that start to merge come out the other side. So the idea would be to grow revenues faster than the economy and grow expenses at a rate of net 1%, maybe 2% of the revenue growth is stronger. And that's the operating model. 
And you saw that come on quarter after quarter of operating leverage, I think, for basically 3 years plus, 14 quarters, something like that and the pandemic pushed that around. And as we stabilize after the pandemic a couple of quarters ago, you're seeing it come back to the system."

This is 48th quarterly earnings conference call. So it's been a long time. But -- and I would rather never have to have senior leaders move because -- but they have a choice in life and when they retire, we have to adjust to it. But what we tried to accomplish. If you go back to last summer, we put a lot of senior executives onto the management team. 
What has happened now with Ann's retirement, Tom's retirement and Andrew's retirement, as those executives now are reporting directly to me. And that's really the effort. So we're a younger, more diverse, 3 women running the 8 lines of business. Same philosophy of how we run the company. And now with a group of people who have 5 to 10 years ahead of them. And then we have 2 international colleagues on the management team for the first time and Bernie and Cathy. Cathy is needed to help us in the European context as Brexit came through. It's different and that -- so she's going to go help us in that and be a great help to us. Bernie has international. He does a great job for us. 
But the idea was to elevate people who -- and also focus on people who are thinking 10 years out as opposed to 1 or 2 in retirement. And so that's really the genesis of it. People retire, and we make reactions. And Tom and Ann and Andrew have been tremendous teammates, but the best thing they did for us is develop a bench behind them that is extremely strong that can step into the jobs. And frankly, we're running a lot of the businesses as they -- over the last few years as they -- we all spent more time on driving our brand in the market and other things that are more at the company level."

And these are core checking accounts. The primary is -- keeps going up. It actually went from 92% to 93% over the last year, primary account. So the production hit this quarter was, I think, a 10-year high in terms of net accounts. And that's coming both from the digital 50% of sales round numbers. And we now have, to your point, over the last 3 years, develop full digital execution in terms of account opening for core accounts in terms of auto purchases, in terms of mortgage origination, et cetera. Which now allows a fully digital practice take place, half the sales are digital. 
The good news, honestly, is that as the branches reopened over the last -- and people -- the visits went up, you saw the count sold rise because it takes both high-touch and high-tech to be successful. So the percentage in sales of digital came down, but that's because overall sales jumped up, and obviously, they're more brands dominated. But you got it exactly right. We think that, that is a more efficient method of accumulation customers. We think we have about 17% market share in the Gen Z area that is heavily digitally-originated. Lot of colleges, a lot of other things going on. But the key is to realize that net balances per account have gone from 7,000 to 10,000 over the last couple of years. So you're seeing a bigger and bigger core position. 
When you go with -- and that's one thing to keep in mind is when we give you our 40 million digital customers, these customers are core customers with big balances. So Merrill Edge, for example, I think we're up to 70,000 or something average balance per account, not 3,000 or 4,000. 
But anyway, just on the cloud, the cloud is a complex question. So as you're well aware, over the -- the last 8, 10 years, Cathy and the team led an effort to internalize our cloud, which made us a lot more efficient. And so we look at -- we run percentage of our business outside due to certain executions and things like that. We have 500 different software programs that run in a SaaS basis, which is the question of cloud can be misleading is, can you get to the -- all the product types or capability types you can get out there because of the new companies that develop them on to cloud-based systems, and we can get to them all. 
The IBM is an effort to internalize the cloud that we can use in the financial service industry, and IBM is working on that. But these things have to be done carefully for purposes of security and trust and understanding our businesses.

So look, we expect deposit growth to continue, although it's going to be likely at a slower rate than what was experienced so far this year, and we expect our growth to continue in line with or slightly better than the industry. You got to remember that we're entering a phase of tapering. Taping is still QE. So deposits are really not likely to decline until many quarters. If you look back at historical data after QE ends, if they ever do. Because as the economy expands, the multiplier effect we could see growth in deposits, even though money supply is coming down. 
So we'll just have to wait and see. But what we do know is, as QE starts, we're still going -- it's still going to be stimulative from a deposit standpoint. And then, as I said, if deposits do decline, it will probably many quarters, a couple of years maybe, after QE ends."

When looking at the consumer deposit base, sometimes I think it's dejavu all over again is a classic statement because in '15, '16, '17, it was all about the Fed's going to normalized rates, and you're going to have to rai",557,"George, just a couple of things. When looking at the consumer deposit base, sometimes I think it's dejavu all over again is a classic statement because in '15, '16, '17, it was all about the Fed's going to normalized rates, and you're going to have to raise prices, and we didn't have to because we've -- the reason why we don't have to is these are core transactional accounts. In a large part, not interest-bearing. And so you'll see some of that same dynamic apply, again, as the rates normalize and the monetary supply has changed. 
But in the consumer business, 56% of the balances are checking. So that would say, those are core transaction accounts, money moving and out, very little CDs, I think $50 billion, $60 billion or something like that. So the $1 trillion is all basically in checking and money market. 
So can it move around? Yes. If you look, one of the things that bodes well and -- for the economy is that if you look at a checking customer that has maybe $2,000 or $3,000 in balances with us, either sitting with 3 to 4x -- 3x what they had before the crisis, that's good news. They will spend some of that, I assume. But interesting enough, that's been growing month-over-month for the last few months. So it's not going down even though the stimulus payments to customers, in large part other than the childcare stops. 
So one of the things that bodes well for the economy, and this isn't trying to cushion to some viewpoint about it is the consumer still has a lot of money in their accounts, and they're going to spend it. Going back to your deposit question. Could that mean those balances come down a little bit, but it will be overcome by the new accounts coming on in $1 million a year that carried $10,000 average balance, et cetera. So we feel good about long-term deposit growth, and it's all -- it's driven by the checking core transactions. 
Loan-to-deposit ratio, it's our customers driving it. So when the usage by the auto dealer lines is down to 25% of what it was because inventory is being down, of course, we -- they want to borrow, we want to lend to them because that means they have the inventory to sell to the consumer. So this is a customer-driven business. And so $900 billion odd of loans against $2 trillion of deposits is largely driven by the customer activity. 
The good news is you can see in those charts that, I call the smile charts on the loan growth page there, that the other half of the smile is coming up, meaning that the customers are starting to draw and credit and use it, and that will bode well for the customer growing their businesses and stuff. But importantly, thinking about just the economy generally. 
One of the things I just want to -- I'll remind you of, Gerard, is we break out consumer and GWIM and a lot of people talk about retail deposits. That is $1.4 trillion -- $1.3 trillion when you combine them together. So it is a big machine, and it's all transactional. And we just don't think that moves as much on monetary supply questions as, obviously, on the institutional side."

And Jimmy DeMare and the team under Tom's leadership continue to do it, but stronger in the equities business. And that -- so deploying balance sheet against that recognizing activity level sustaining, et cetera. 
And then if you go in the lending business, it's customer selection. So we were out with those 100 extra relationship managers banging away at the world, getting more customers the hard way, and you're seeing net new customers in the business banking, small business segments and stuff growing. You see that in the wealth management business. So what you'll see is that the balance sheet deployed to markets as a capital and balance sheet question. Everywhere else it's going to follow the customer, but it's the core customer growth, and that's why you put those statistics in -- that you see. 
Meanwhile, Merrill Edge is over $300 billion and becoming a fairly significant enterprise on its own. And you see some of these other aspects. So we feel good about it. And like you said, Candace and the team had a great research platform and they basically are 5% plus this year and 5% next year, which sets up well."

I do think it's important to remind everybody, I know you know it, but I'll remind everybody that these partnership losses are booked in other income, but they're more than offset in the tax line. So as we grow these activities in the future, there will be a small headwind to revenue growth, but not to net income growth given the tax benefits of these investments. 
As you think about modeling, everybody out there, we expect the fourth quarter loss to be $800 million on the other income line from these tax investments or even perhaps a little higher, reflecting both the sort of typical seasonal increase in the fourth quarter in partnership investments as well as there were a few deals in the third quarter that got delayed because of all the logistical stuff, and we think they're going to pop into the fourth quarter. 
Beyond that, putting the fourth quarter aside, a good modeling assumption for the normal 3 quarters of '22, I would say, absent unusual items, it will be a quarterly loss of kind of $400 million to $500 million for those ESG investments.

Well, look, in card income, just a couple of points to make just so no one's confused. When you look at our sort of consumer banking, card income fees, they were up very nicely year-over-year at about 8%, driven, as you said, by the purchase volume increases despite the fact that payment rates are still relatively high. But when you look at the consolidated line, you're not going to see that. It's up only slightly versus Q3 '20 because of the decline in card income associated with processing, unemployment claims, which sits in global markets. So just for some clarification there. 
In terms of balances, look, we're expecting card balances to continue to improve. The balances grew 7% quarter-over-quarter on an annualized basis, including some small growth and revolving balances, and we opened over 1 million new accounts, which now matches pre-pandemic levels. I think balance growth reflected higher spend and the reinitiated marketing efforts that we've talked about, including promo offers, while, again, payment rates remained elevators. We expect higher Q4 seasonal purchase volume, and that's going to drive additional balances in cards."

You've got the balance question on cards, but you do always have to look at the spending side of it. And we said, dropping credit cards are only about 20-odd percent of the way consumers spend money, other accounts cash, all the ATMs, checks written, Zelle is taking off and becoming a meaningful amount of the payment. So I think that cards are an easy form of payment. We're already seeing tap cards, things at 12% of the spend -- 12% of penetration already. So -- but the good news is no matter how you cut it and how you look at it, 2 good message. Card balances are growing. And -- but there's still tremendous capacity for the consumers to borrow if they want to, to do things. 
The second thing is that the spending levels are growing at a 10% growth rates in an economy in the U.S., which is led by the American consumer. That is a tremendous amount of spending that's going on, and it's accelerating even as the stimulus is not -- is in the rearview mirror by quite many months. So as people get back to work in higher wages and things, there's just more money to spend. 
So I think the focus on card as a spending vehicle versus a borrowing vehicle, it will be something we look at. But it's -- we like the business. We continue to generate 1 million new cards, as Paul talked about, and it will break down about who needs to borrow and what, and the asset quality is unbelievable. The NIM is high as it's ever been, and that's a good business."

The second quarter, we said in the second half of the quarter, especially, we saw growth. All that loan stayed on the books, plus we grew it on top of that, as we said earlier, I think $60 billion excluding the PPP. 
That's what's going to build into the NII projections going forward because that's 250, 300 basis point spread stuff. And remember, we're funding with 0 cost deposits to the tune of $200 billion or $300 billion up year-over-year. So that's what drives -- that's what will drive it long term. Short term, it will be all the things you talked about, but that's going to stabilize it somewhere a point and then a -- and then it's really going to come back down to what we do on the banking side of the balance sheet, make loans, take deposits and make the spread between them.
