Thank you so much, and welcome, everyone, to Emerson's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Today, I'm joined by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senio",1915,"Good afternoon. Thank you so much, and welcome, everyone, to Emerson's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Today, I'm joined by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jamie Froedge, Executive President of Emerson Commercial & Residential Solutions; and congratulations to Lal Karsanbhai, current Executive President of Emerson Automation Solutions, who was recently announced as Emerson's next Chief Executive Officer, effective on February 5. 
As usual, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Starting on Slide 3. I'd like to briefly highlight 2 examples of the great work our global teams are doing and some recent recognition from customers and the marketplace. First, Emerson's Plantweb Optics analytics software recently received the 2021 IoT Breakthrough Award. Emerson's Plantweb Optics platform helps customers collect OT data from a variety of sources and apply practical and customized visualization and analytics, delivering key operational insights to the right people at the right time. 
Next, turning to Slide 4. Emerson recently received the 2021 Control Reader's Choice Award for our industry-leading automation control and instrumentation solutions. Emerson continues to receive positive feedback from customers and users of our products based on a relentless focus on technology, unmatched customer service and critical domain expertise in our customers' industries. 
Turning to Slide 5. We will review the highlights of a very strong quarter. First, Emerson remains steadfast in our commitment to health and safety for our employees, customers and communities. Serving our customers in critical industries, disciplined cost control and positioning to outperform as we emerge from COVID-19 remain our key thematic priorities, and we are starting to see the benefits of this focused flow-through. Next, our regionalized operations remain sturdy and stable, and we will continue to build upon our firmly rooted strategy of business localization. 
Turning to performance. Emerson delivered a very strong quarter in a challenging but stabilizing and improving demand environment. The organization delivered adjusted EPS of $0.83 in the quarter, which was up 24% from the prior year and well above expectations. We continued our execution of the broad cost reset plan with an additional $69 million of new restructuring actions. 
Cash flow was a new first quarter record for the company with operating cash flow of over $800 million and free cash flow of $686 million, up 90% and 121%, respectively. It is important to emphasize that the balance, the end market diversity and the stability of our 2 platform business strategy, was critical to enabling the strong operational and cash flow outcome. 
Even on down 2% organic revenue, segment margins grew by 230 basis points to 17.7%. This margin improvement is a strong testament to the consistent operational execution of the global organization throughout the pandemic. 
Despite lingering uncertainty and demand challenges in many key markets, sales and orders finished ahead of previous guidance. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying orders remained quite strong, finishing up 15% on a trailing 3-month basis. Importantly, our Automation Solutions business is showing signs of stabilization and improvement. Given the orders, sales and profitability improvement, we are updating full year guidance to reflect the stronger outlook. 
Please turn to Slide 7, which offers details on the results of the quarter. Both underlying orders and sales came in ahead of expectations at down 4.5% and down 2%, respectively. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales was up 12%, while Automation Solutions was down 9% but improving. 
Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring and first year purchase accounting and fees, was up 28 -- 24% to $0.83, well ahead of expectations. As previously mentioned, the organization achieved a new Q1 cash flow record driven by increased earnings and strong working capital management. Operating cash flow increased 90% to $808 million, and free cash flow increased 121% to $686 million. 
Turning to Slide 8. We will briefly bridge adjusted EPS in the quarter. Starting with adjusted EPS in Q1 of 2020 of 68 -- $0.67; nonoperating elements, including tax, interest, FX and other items for a combined nonfactor, adding $0.01 in total. The most important element was operations, which drove the vast majority of the EPS outperformance, contributing $0.13. Share repurchase added $0.02 for a total of $0.83 in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 9, we will review the P&L. Net sales were flat, and we saw a slight reduction in GP margin, which was driven by volume deleverage and mix. Meanwhile, SG&A as a percentage of sales declined by 310 basis points to 24% as aggressive cost-control actions took effect. 
EBIT and adjusted EBIT margins, which exclude restructuring and first year purchase accounting and fees, increased 350 basis points and 260 basis points, respectively, also reflecting the cost-containment actions flowing through. Lastly, the effective tax rate came in at just below 20%, slightly lower than expectations. 
Turning to Slide 10, we will review underlying sales by world area. For the quarter, the Americas continued to show the steepest declines, down 7% but importantly, they started to improve. In North America, we saw strength in residential, cold chain, life sciences, medical, food and beverage and some discrete markets more than offset by weakness in many other automation end markets. Europe grew 4%, while Asia and Middle East and Africa grew by 3%, fueled by strength in China at 7%. All Commercial & Residential Solutions world areas turned to growth. 
Please turn to Slide 11, and we will discuss the business segment performance. Total segment adjusted EBIT margin increased 230 basis points to 17.7%, reflecting aggressive cost-control measures and strong operational execution, even with slightly down underlying sales. Adjusted pretax earnings increased by a similar magnitude, 240 basis points to 15.2%. 
As previously highlighted, Q1 cash flow performance was record-setting with operating cash flow and free cash flow increasing 90% and 121%, respectively. Free cash flow represented 152% conversion of net earnings. Importantly, trade working capital dropped to 17.8% of sales driven by strong execution by operations. 
Turning to Slide 13, we will discuss the business platforms. Automation Solutions underlying sales finished down 9% for the quarter. The Americas remained the most challenged, down 20%, but showed signs of stabilization and early improvement. Overall, we saw continued momentum in life sciences, food and beverage and semiconductor markets as well as some early signs of improvement in upstream energy markets. Meanwhile, Europe and Asia, Middle East and Africa both turned to low single-digit growth driven by strength in Eastern Europe and China, respectively. 
Trailing 3-month underlying orders were down 13%, again reflecting stabilizing and early improvement trends. Geographically, the Americas continued to be the most challenged, down 27%. Asia, Middle East and Africa declined modestly by 1%, supported by China orders growing 6%. Europe declined by 3% due to weakness in energy markets, somewhat offset by chemical, power and life science projects. 
Restructuring actions totaled $64 million across the platform as we continued execution of the return to peak profitability. The platform delivered robust positive profitability improvement despite the drop in revenue. 
Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 200 basis points and 290 basis points, respectively, as the effects of the ongoing cost actions took hold. Lastly, the platform increased backlog by $600 million, of which $300 million was due to the acquisition of OSI. The ending balance was $5.3 billion. 
Turning to Slide 14. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were up 12% in the quarter. All core world areas were solidly positive, with the Americas showing the strongest growth at 14% driven by strong residential, cold chain and home products demand. This growth points to share penetration gains in many of our end markets. Europe was up 8% as heat pump demand was driven by sustainability regulations and customer technology preferences. Finally, Asia, Middle East and Africa was up 7% driven by China, up 10%. 
As mentioned, trailing 3-month underlying orders remained robust, up 15%, with all business units growing. North America increased by 16% and robust HVAC and home products demand, while China was up 17%. Restructuring actions totaled $3 million in the platform, and we're primarily focused on facility rationalization and optimization programs. 
Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margins were up 230 basis points and up 210 basis points, respectively, reflecting leverage on the increased volume and improved cost base. Finally, backlog in the business increased by approximately $200 million, ending the quarter at nearly $800 million, which is well above normal levels. 
Please turn to Slide 16, and we will introduce second quarter guidance. We now expect the underlying sales will be roughly flat year-over-year with a range of down 1% to up 1%. This potential for the company to return to positive growth is earlier than previously forecasted. The top line outlook is driven by continued momentum in residential, life science, medical, discrete and food and beverage markets and ongoing stabilization and improvement in other automation markets.  
GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS are expected to be $0.83 and $0.89, respectively, plus or minus $0.02. We expect adjusted EBIT margin to be 17.0% to 17.5% with adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 22.2% to 22.8%. Lastly, it is important to note that this guidance embeds an $0.11 change in stock price costs due to movement in the stock price. 
Slide 17 introduces our updated full year 2021 guidance framework. Management assumes that demand will continue to be challenging but stabilizing and steadily improving as global vaccine efforts mature. We also assume there are no major operational or supply chain disruptions and that oil prices remain in the $45 to $55 range. 
Given that context, we expect underlying sales growth this year with a range of flat to plus 4%. Automation Solutions is expected to be in the range of down 3% to up 1% underlying sales, while Commercial & Residential Solutions is expected to grow between 8% and 10%. As you can see, both of these platforms -- platform outlooks are improvements from November. 
We expect a slight decrease in effective tax rate as well as increases in operating cash flow and free cash flow to $3.15 billion and $2.55 billion, respectively. There is no other change to the capital allocation outlook. GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.39, plus or minus $0.10, while adjusted EPS is expected to be $3.70, plus or minus $0.10. 
We have also updated our outlook for profitability headwinds and tailwinds in the year. Since last quarter, we expect that COVID-related savings will now only be down $40 million this year, up from the previous estimate of $70 million. However, we now expect that price cost dynamics will be slightly negative as raw material costs and availability become more of a short-term challenge. Operations are working diligently to mitigate this issue. Lastly, stock price will be more of a headwind. 
And now please turn to Slide 18, and we will briefly cover the changes to the reset restructuring and COVID-related savings plan. Total company planned restructuring spend remains $200 million for the full fiscal year. As mentioned, we now expect only $40 million of the $150 million COVID-related savings from 2020 to return as business conditions start to normalize in the back half of the year. 
Accordingly, incremental 2021 savings have improved to $220 million. Total long-term annualized savings of the overall reset restructuring program are expected to exceed $650 million. 
Please turn to Slide 20, and I will now hand the call over to Mr. David Farr."

First, I want to welcome everyone to the first quarter earnings call. I want to thank you very much for the interest in this great company. I'm clearly a little bit biased on that, but it is a great company. Second, I want to thank the",1803,"Thank you, Pete. First, I want to welcome everyone to the first quarter earnings call. I want to thank you very much for the interest in this great company. I'm clearly a little bit biased on that, but it is a great company. 
Second, I want to thank the global leadership team, the executive leadership team and all the employees around the world executing and delivering a fantastic first quarter for all of our investors. The last 19 months have been hard with a cost reset for peak margins, downturn in late 2019, COVID-19 pandemic and a resulting global recession and now the return to growth. My recognition and applauding to all of you is powerful and thankful. I want to thank all of you from my heart for what you've done over the last 19 months. But now we have a new threshold of execution for the second quarter and total fiscal year. I believe this team will make it happen. They are good. 
Third, I want to recognize and congratulate Lal Karsanbhai as the new CEO of Emerson. I'm so proud of you and so excited for you and how you and your new OCE team will take Emerson to new heights as I and we have done the last 20 years. 
When Chuck Knight turned over the reins to me in late 2020, I took a deep breath, I paused, I smiled, and then I moved forward. You're ready and have what it takes to lead Emerson. You have the right stuff as does all the OCE and global leaders. I'll be your best cheerleader, your supporter, and my phone line is always open to you and your team. 
Now why now? I'm healthy, folks. I'm not sick. Nothing is wrong with me other than my right knee, which is definitely gone, no golf. So the knee replacement is on the way. I've already talked to my doctor. The Board's succession plan and process ran its course with many great candidates over the last 5 years. I want to thank all of them. They all know who they are. A couple could be in this room. 
I also want to thank Bob Sharp, who is a close friend and really wanted to be CEO of Emerson, but as he and I talked, told him was not going to happen. So we decided to figure out how to make it happen somewhere else. I wish him the best of luck. 
As we went through the first quarter, it was clear to me, the Board that we clearly had one strong obvious candidate, Lal. The others are great leaders. They're great individuals. They're great friends. They've done great things in Emerson, but Lal is the next leader. So we decided, but that's not the only issue. There are other things going on across the company. 
The company is in great shape, the P&L, the balance sheet and the cash flow. As the finance committee told Lal this morning, don't blank it up. We had a very good final quarter in fiscal 2020, as you all know. Orders have been turning up strongly. The V-shape recovery has been taken hold and is really firm at this point in time. 
We've had strong exceptional execution around the massive cost reset that we embarked upon back in 2019, a cost reset costing us over $600 million when it's all said and done. The progress is enormous. You've seen it in the margins the fourth fiscal quarter. You see them the margins in the first quarter. We're going to deliver over $650 million of savings for the company when it's all said and done. 
The global teams led by these 2 individuals, these 3 individuals in this room, Lal, Jamie and Frank are getting the job done. They don't need my help. We are going to continue to deliver. I guarantee you. That's one commitment that I made to the Board when I said yes, Lal is a god. 
The first quarter was strong on all fronts. GAAP sales were flat. Underlying sales only down 2%. And I believe in the second quarter, our GAAP sales will clearly be up, and I think our underlying sales will be up also maybe not a lot, but I think it will be positive. 
Profitability was very good. And with improving volume and cost out in the first quarter, great incremental margins on both sides. Strong margins, EPS momentum, and yes, record first quarter cash flow of $800 million and free cash flow of $700 million, extremely strong execution around earnings and the balance sheet. 
And we see a solid fiscal core, both -- in both platforms across fiscal '21. Sales will grow this year, both in GAAP and online growth standpoint. We'll have increased margins, stronger EPS, potentially even at $3.70, which was our 2019 EPS with much higher sales in 2019 plus strong cash flow. In my opinion, the number will bust the 3.2, but I'm not the CEO, so he has to live with that number. With order and sales momentum in the second half of 2021 and going into 2022, we, the OCE, believe we'll finally deliver the $4-plus EPS in '22. Based on global economic recovery, the momentum we see and the cost out, it looks very good, and we'll talk about that on the 16th. 
Cost reset, the drive to new peak margins in '22, '23, they are firmly in place. The entire next-generation team is ready to take the reins and lead Emerson forward. 
Clearly, even with the COVID-19 vaccine rolling out, we continue to be restricted on what we can do. We have to operate in a safe environment. The normal year Emerson management process is somewhat turned, not quite the same. Global travel, live customer engagement, our face-to-face planning conference, which is known to be a combat at times, organization planning process, leadership planning process are all restricted and delayed. We're doing them, but they're not the same. 
So as I thought about what I can do as the CEO in this environment is basically take my experience, my maturity, which many of you know, I mature, in this environment and help the next team. Name the new team, put it in place, get out of their way and help. That's what I'm going to do. I talked to the Board about this. It makes the most sense. 
Yes, I said 2021. Yes, I even said maybe most likely later in 2021. But the new facts and issues, and I always like to surprise with our annual investor conference coming up this month in the 20 -- 16th, I think the time is right for the new CEO to stand up, present and not have the Dave Farr game, which many you've had for over 20 years, in some cases, more than that as I worked for Mr. Knight. 
The February 16 time, the February 16 presentation with the next-generation team is very important. I'll be there to help. I'll be there to advise. I care about this company. I'm a big shareholder in this company. It's been my life for 40 years, leading it for over 20 years. The time is right. 
As you know, I've never believed in long drawn-out successions. Chuck and I had 3 days. He hit me with the keys in the chest. He took off for a year, for 6 months. I had to track him down to try to break the quarter strength on earnings. The team, the -- Lal are ready. So let's move on. 
If I talk to the Board, we all said the same thing. So again, my congrats to Lal and the OCE. And want to start a yelling match with me, you'll quickly see I'm not sick. 
Let's go to Chart 20. I do have my usual bat, my rally monkey and my rally squirrel, which is really a rally, sitting here today, helping us out, making sure I don't lose my train of thought. We have pretty good momentum in orders. We laid out boxes. We started this box game as we put our forecast out in, I think, April of 2020 with Frank, at that time, Bob and myself. We delivered -- actually -- we've laid out the box in the first quarter. You can see we came in better. The blue dot is where we thought it would be. We're above that, obviously. It's upper right-hand corner. 
Jamie's business has been very strong. He's executing. He's building backlog. That's one of his issues. He's got to get that backlog down. 
Lal's business has turned. It's not going to be quite as sharp as Jamie, clearly, it's a different business model. But he's turned. 
If you look at the next forecast, next quarter, we now have a blue dot sitting pretty much on orders above the line, with a minus 4 to plus 6. We're seeing good momentum in Europe. We're seeing good momentum in Asia. We see good momentum in Jamie's business in North America, and we're seeing some improvement in Lal's business, which I'm sure he'll talk about. 
So again, very good momentum in orders. As we lay this out, that's how we see it. Jamie's business will flatten out. It will turn down a bit. He's running at high levels at this point in time. Clearly, some unique opportunity of growth there with all his markets as he'll tell you going the right way, which is great to see. 
So if you look at Slide 21, what we're looking at right now for the growth this year as we presented the Board, we're looking at somewhere around the plus 1, minus 1 for the second quarter depends on what kind of execution Jamie can get on the backlog. He clearly has issues relative to capacity, COVID, materials, which we'll talk about. 
I think Lal's short-term business is starting to turn up, and we'll talk about that in his discrete business. Even some of the onesie, twosie orders are starting to happen. 
We have a broad second half. It's hard -- the third quarter will be a spike, as we all know, is a spike down. But the key issue for us is to look at good growth in second half. Obviously, the ratios will look really good in the third quarter. But we're looking at the second half and the overall business pace in that second half going into fiscal '22. 
What I want to do is turn it over to Lal now, so he can talk a little bit about his forecast and what he sees, some insights into the marketplace, and then we'll turn it over to Jamie and let him do the same thing. So Lal, the floor is yours."

I'm very proud of the team and what the team has accomplished in the quarter. It's a phenomenal execution of a plan that we laid out for our investors last February we committed to do, and we're now seeing it reflected in the P&L of the company. We're generating some of our own tailwinds, which I'll talk to you about, and the market is starting to recover broadly across many geographies as well, which is highly encouraging. 
This Page 22, nothing really changed appreciably in our orders as we went through the summer months. However, as we got into the late fall, we started to see an increase in activity, particularly driven by Europe and by Europe and Asia. 
I'll flip to the next chart and give you some perspectives on how we see the outlook right now. The industries that drove growth dramatically or the discrete industries driven by Germany, specifically, which had turned its economic engine on and start to accelerate both in the process space for internal consumption and then its vast export market engine. So we started to see that improve in automotive and semiconductor packaging OEM as well as broad activity across Europe around power and the specialty chemicals segment. 
In Asia driven by China, as Steve highlighted, growth of 6%. We feel very good about what we've seen there and expect that growth to accelerate into Q2 as we'll talk about in a moment. 
But the big elephant in the room is North America. And what we experienced in North America was a stabilization of the oil and gas markets, albeit at lower levels, but a forecastable level of business. With the business, what has driven the business on the continent has been power generation, mining in the southern comb and life sciences throughout, which has been a great story for us. As a result of that, we are seeing a recovery and expect to see sequential improvement in order pacing and sales pacing in the second quarter and in the second half of the year as indicated back on Chart 22. 
Let me turn then to Chart 24, and we'll give a perspective of how we see the world areas first half to second half. And across most of the world, and I can pick out 1 or 2 pockets here, we will see that improvement reflected in the environment. That discrete energy, that discrete momentum that we've built in Europe and Asia will begin in the Americas, in North America particularly. And we've seen, as David noted, early signs of distribution-based business recovery as we navigated through December into January. So that's very encouraging to see. 
I was in Odessa, Texas a few weeks ago. I saw, I met with teams and talked about the plans for $3.8 million a barrel -- 3.8 millions barrel a day production for the year, which is a stable level from where it was a year ago. So we'll see maintenance of that, increase drilling to maintain those levels in those fields. So some encouragement there. But obviously, demand will ultimately drive those -- that market. 
In Europe, I've talked about, it's really been a German story. Our discrete business is up over 30%. Our process business is up over 10% in Germany alone. And then there's increased momentum throughout the continent, very pleased with the positive first quarter, and we expect that to continue. 
And then Asia, the China bounce back was important. That was discrete-driven and process-driven as well. And we feel very good about the funnel of activity that we see as we look out right now. So I feel much better than I did in October, David and team, but -- and I look forward to a much better outlook and executing in a much better environment as we go forward."

As you can see, you heard throughout the call, the outlook for the year has improved since we last spoke. In November, we",1046,"So with that said, let's jump into the first chart there, Chart 25, that shows the updated outlook for underlying sales for the year. As you can see, you heard throughout the call, the outlook for the year has improved since we last spoke. In November, we were outlooking 4% to 7% underlying growth for the year. It was going to be about 5% to 6% in Q1, 2% to 4% in Q2 and 5% to 8% the second half. And growth in orders and sales has really accelerated in Q1, as Dave talked about, and we saw greater-than-expected strength in North America residential markets, along with accelerated improvement really in all other businesses and world areas. 
And so from a Q1 order standpoint, we saw double-digit trailing 3-month underlying orders for all of our businesses with the exception of professional tools, which came in at 2% after delivering 8% orders growth in the month of December. So it was improving as the quarter went on. The broad product line of world area of strength that we saw in Q1 orders, the backlog we built while we continue to see in our business trends in January support to increase our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
So if you go to the next chart, Chart 26. These 2 -- these next 2 charts look at the business from a product line and then a geographic perspective. First, from a product perspective, we see underlying sales growth in the heating and AC business in the 9% to 12% range for the year. Extremely strong first half driven by residential market and a more moderate second half as by the fourth quarter, inventory restocking should stabilize. Demand may settle into a pattern closer to historic cycles. 
However, we do see positive the medium and long-term trends in the residential market driven by home ownership, remodeling and a focus on efficiency and environmental concerns. Our cold chain business has exhibited a quicker growth recovery than anticipated. In November, we expected cold chain to grow more in the 3% to 6% range for the year, now at 6% to 9%, supported by a stronger Q1 than expected, which was really driven by a 20-plus percent Q1 sales in global transport, positive growth in U.S. foodservice in December. So even though food service is a tough market, coming back slower, we had positive growth in December, double-digit growth in U.S. food retail in the second half of the quarter and double-digit aftermarket growth. 
China delivered double-digit Q1 cold chain sales growth with transport up more than 40%. We anticipate solid, stable growth in the cold chain as the year evolved. Food service will continue to lag other segments, but improvement in vaccine rollout could drive upside in that space in the back half of the year. 
In November, our outlook for tools and home products was also in the 3% to 6% range. It's now 6% to 9%. Our home products business and tools we have impacted by residential demand. We will see extremely strong growth in the first half. 
Just to put some of the home and contractor growth in perspective. In Q1, our wet dry back business posted 38% trailing 3-month fixed rate orders, and our insinuator business saw 20% plus trailing 3-month fixed rate orders growth. Again, the residential markets will settle into a more moderate growth rates as the year progresses, but very strong growth first half, good overall fundamentals in the medium and long term. 
For the remainder of our professional tools products, we will see a return to quarterly sales growth in Q2, followed by double-digit growth in the second half of the year aided by comparables in Q3, but also a general improvement in market conditions globally, which we already started to see as David mentioned. For example, EMEA, Asia both turned positive in Q1, and general industrial has been steadily improving. Overall commercial building construction globally will continue to lag the recovery of most of our other served markets. 
All right. Next chart, Chart 27. Our heating and AC compression business saw 24% plus trailing 3-month Q1 orders growth with exponentially higher growth in residential. Our Q1 U.S. residential heating and AC compression businesses sales grew 69% in the quarter with growth accelerating as the quarter unfolded. 
We do expect the U.S. residential market to settle into lower growth in the second half of the first half as we've seen unique near-term growth dynamics and the rebuild of inventory in the channel. However, as I mentioned earlier, we do see some longer-term positive residential trends persisting. 
North America industrial continues to improve with commercial building construction lagging. Asia climate trailing 3-month fixed rate orders due to December were up 11%. Europe climate was up 12%, supported by continued strength in the heat pump space in Europe, along with weather conditions improving marketing conditions overall in China. Overall, Europe Q1 climate fixed sales growth was 8% with heating growth up 40%. Overall, Asia fixed rate climate sales were up a little more than 6%. The climate part was up 15%, and the heating piece inside of that was up 30%. So we see pretty solid growth dynamics for the remainder of the year in North America, Europe, China and the Middle East and several smaller markets but a slower recovery in parts of North and Southeast Asia. 
The COVID situation is dynamic. We're watching it closely around the world. We'll let you know if we start to see any changes that would reflect our current view of how the year is going to unfold. 
And just to wrap up, I want to say thank you to the entire Commercial & Residential Solutions team, the whole Emerson team for tremendous quarter. You all responded to unprecedented demand increases, worked long hours to make sure we meet our customer needs while working hard to keep our employees safe. And we saw historic increases in demand in several businesses. Our team did a great job responding. And what we all can't forget is the middle of a pandemic. And so I want you to know how much the entire leadership team appreciates all of your efforts. 
So with that, I'll pass it back to Dave. Dave?"

And they're talking about spending money around bringing lines back up, Andy, getting some incremental capacity. We have a situation right now in the supply chain for Jamie's side of the business. There's a huge capacity issue, there's not enough capacity, and we know they're going to have to -- they're going to start spending money around steel, iron ore, mining, copper, plastics, all these things. 
So what Lal's guys are hearing and we've been hearing quite a bit across the United States even now and even in Europe, they are starting to talk about small projects and spending. So I think those conversations will continue. I think you'll start seeing capital. We're going to spend more capital this year. I bet you, if we had the time, we probably even spend more, but the time is not a big issue for us. So I think that we're feeling it and we're -- Lal's seeing it. 
Where I really, really, really want to see it is the USA. And -- but I guarantee you, Jamie's customers, his facilities all need capital, and Lal's the one who is going to make it for him. 
So that's what we see. But we'll see how that unfolds this year. I think our discrete business in the U.S. probably had a good month. We don't know yet totally, but I think they had a very good month. And that will tell me that the projects are coming at the distributors of the channel. They're talking. They're ordering product. I think the professional tools will be the same way. If I turn to Jamie, he's shaking his head. So that means the channel is coming, Andy. 
So I think that I feel good about it. Now the question is the momentum, but we'll see how much. But they've got to spend some money here. They've got to get things going, productivity wise. And so I feel good about it right now."

We went through that process back in 2019. So as we took the Board through for the June through the end of, say, November time period, and we looked at the analysis of the 2 platforms, the strategic rationale around the 2 platforms. And that was obviously on the table at that point in time. And the Board hired outside help relative to these 2 issues. 
In their opinion and working outside is very clear that we may believe there's more value in the combined basis than separating the 2 businesses. And so the logic was around the investments we see going relative to this whole -- around the ESG, around sustainability, around the software, what we see happening in the global world right now. As you look at the different cycles of classic is what's going on right now in the 2 different cycles and how they leverage each other, that work was done back in the mid- to late [ 29 ], the Board made a decision. And as we went through these last 18 months, I guess it's not quite 18 but close to 18, say, 12 or 14 months, the Board never did not think about that at this point in time. They made that decision in a while back, and that's where it sits. 
And I obviously, clearly, for Lal's standpoint, the Board will continue to evaluate that in our strategy sessions with the Board -- his strategy sessions with the Board. And I fundamentally believe that will constantly be in the table as we look at the mix of the businesses, if we look at where we want to go next and where we may want to get out of. This company has been in and out of businesses. We get out of this business, we'll go here. And that's what's made Emerson unique for the 40 years I've been around. If you look at the 40 years and how we transformed this company, let alone the 20 years I did, we don't sit still. 
So I mean, I guarantee before Lal retires, the company will look different than it is today. Now how is it going to look differently? Well, that course will play its hand out with him and his team and the Board. So that's how we look at it, Jeff. We don't look at trying to status quo. It's not a word. Status quo is not a word around here, as you know."

Now as someone said earlier, Jamie has got a unique situation where he has his comparison to the third quarter is really easy, so he could spike. And he doesn't know what it's going to be like in the fourth quarter. So we're trying to be cautious. 
The other issue that we face right now and one of the reasons we had very, very strong operating cash flow in the first quarter, yes, Lal's execution was very good. Yes, Jamie's execution was very good. But we're in a situation with Jamie's business that we haven't seen before of this magnitude, where all of a sudden, he's shipping using all the inventory can and from the standpoint of getting the inventory out getting paid and maybe not paying all the suppliers on the payable side standpoint, he's in a situation right now where his trade working capital as a percent of sale is extremely low. This way that's based out. And we know some of that will reverse as this business starts slowing down in certain areas. 
So I think we want to be very cautious as they try to estimate how much was that cash pull in because of the working capital, but it was a very good quarter on earnings and execution. And I think Frank and his team, as he talked to the financial officers out there, want to be a little bit more cautious. I think if we get a better feel in the second quarter how the cash comes in, I think I wouldn't be surprised if we don't tweak it back up a little higher, John, to be all honest. 
But we're just being careful right now. But I think that the earnings and cash flow execution right now is very good. And we definitely will have cash burning as we get into that fourth quarter because of our growth rate."

I mean, some of it is direct and some of it's indirect, right? Indirectly as the OEMs work with different folks and they may put a broader air quality solution in place, it will often include an upgrade or a change out to the core compression solution. 
I think the other piece around air quality is that tight humidity control would be a big component of that. And we found that a lot of the air quality solutions work better in a tighter humidity ban. Our 7ac business that we just bought, we invested in early stage, then we bought it out. And now we're commercializing it, is a business that has 30%, 35% more energy-efficient and providing very tight humidity bands for the air-handling space for initially commercial buildings, for example. 
And we'll do some of that directly, and we'll also sell some of that through some of our large OEM partners. So there's multiple ways we play, and I think we'll continue to invest in that space as we go forward in both solutions with OEMs and maybe some that we sell direct to the end user base.

So that's in addition to the $6.4 billion KOB1 funnel that we've been talking about traditionally. We'll talk about this a little bit more in detail in a few weeks.

Thank you so much, and welcome, everyone, to Emerson's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. 
Today, I'm joined by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jamie Froedge, Executive President of Emerson Commercial & Residential Solutions; and congratulations to Lal Karsanbhai, current Executive President of Emerson Automation Solutions, who was recently announced as Emerson's next Chief Executive Officer effective on February 5. 
As usual, I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. Starting on Slide 3. I'd like to briefly highlight 2 examples of the great work our global teams are doing and some recent recognition from customers and the marketplace. First, Emerson's Plantweb Optics analytics software recently received the 2021 IoT Breakthrough Award. Emerson's Plantweb Optics platform helps customers collect OT data from a variety of sources and apply practical and customized visualization and analytics, delivering key operational insights to the right people at the right time. 
Next, turning to Slide 4. Emerson recently received the 2021 Control Reader's Choice Award for our industry-leading automation control and instrumentation solutions. Emerson continues to receive positive feedback from customers and users of our products based on a relentless focus on technology, unmatched customer service and critical domain expertise in our customers' industries. 
Turning to Slide 5, we will review the highlights of a very strong quarter. First, Emerson remains steadfast in our commitment to health and safety for our employees, customers and communities. Serving our customers in critical industries, disciplined cost control and positioning to outperform as we emerge from COVID-19 remain our key thematic priorities, and we are starting to see the benefits of this focus flow through. Next, our regionalized operations remain sturdy and stable, and we will continue to build upon our firmly rooted strategy of business localization. 
Turning to performance. Emerson delivered a very strong quarter in a challenging but stabilizing and improving demand environment. The organization delivered adjusted EPS of $0.83 in the quarter, which was up 24% from the prior year and well above expectations. We continued our execution of the broad cost reset plan with an additional $69 million of new restructuring actions. 
Cash flow was a new first quarter record for the company with operating cash flow of over $800 million and free cash flow of $686 million, up 90% and 121%, respectively. It is important to emphasize that the balance, the end market diversity and the stability of our 2 platform business strategy, was critical to enabling the strong operational and cash flow outcome. 
Even on down 2% organic revenue, segment margins grew by 230 basis points to 17.7%. This margin improvement is a strong testament to the consistent operational execution of the global organization throughout the pandemic. 
Despite lingering uncertainty and demand challenges in many key markets, sales and orders finished ahead of previous guidance. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying orders remained quite strong, finishing up 15% on a trailing 3-month basis. Importantly, our Automation Solutions business is showing signs of stabilization and improvement. Given the orders, sales and profitability improvement, we are updating full year guidance to reflect the stronger outlook. 
Please turn to Slide 7, which offers details on the results of the quarter. Both underlying orders and sales came in ahead of expectations at down 4.5% and down 2%, respectively. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales was up 12%, while Automation Solutions was down 9% but improving. 
Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring and first year purchase accounting and fees, was up 28 -- 24% to $0.83, well ahead of expectations. As previously mentioned, the organization achieved a new Q1 cash flow record driven by increased earnings and strong working capital management. Operating cash flow increased 90% to $808 million, and free cash flow increased 121% to $686 million. 
Turning to Slide 8. We will briefly bridge adjusted EPS in the quarter. Starting with adjusted EPS in Q1 of 2020 of 68 -- $0.67; nonoperating elements, including tax, interest, FX and other items, were a combined nonfactor, adding $0.01 in total. The most important element was operations, which drove the vast majority of the EPS outperformance, contributing $0.13. Share repurchase added $0.02 for a total of $0.83 in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 9, we will review the P&L. Net sales were flat, and we saw a slight reduction in GP margin, which was driven by volume deleverage and mix. Meanwhile, SG&A as a percentage of sales declined by 310 basis points to 24% as aggressive cost-control actions took effect. 
EBIT and adjusted EBIT margins, which exclude restructuring and first-year purchase accounting and fees, increased 350 basis points and 260 basis points, respectively, also reflecting the cost-containment actions flowing through. Lastly, the effective tax rate came in at just below 20%, slightly lower than expectations. 
Turning to Slide 10, we will review underlying sales by world area. For the quarter, the Americas continued to show the steepest declines, down 7%, but importantly, they started to improve. In North America, we saw strength in residential, cold chain, life sciences, medical, food and beverage and some discrete markets more than offset by weakness in many other automation end markets. Europe grew 4%; while Asia, Middle East and Africa grew by 3%, fueled by strength in China at 7%. All Commercial & Residential Solutions world areas turned to growth. 
Please turn to Slide 11, and we will discuss the business segment performance. Total segment adjusted EBIT margin increased 230 basis points to 17.7%, reflecting aggressive cost-control measures and strong operational execution even with slightly down underlying sales. Adjusted pretax earnings increased by a similar magnitude, 240 basis points to 15.2%. 
As previously highlighted, Q1 cash flow performance was record-setting with operating cash flow and free cash flow increasing 90% and 121%, respectively. Free cash flow represented a 152% conversion of net earnings. Importantly, trade working capital dropped to 17.8% of sales driven by strong execution by operations. 
Turning to Slide 13, we will discuss the business platforms. Automation Solutions underlying sales finished down 9% for the quarter. The Americas remained the most challenged, down 20%, but showed signs of stabilization and early improvement. Overall, we saw continued momentum in life sciences, food and beverage and semiconductor markets as well as some early signs of improvement in upstream energy markets. Meanwhile, Europe and Asia, Middle East and Africa both turned to low single-digit growth driven by strength in Eastern Europe and China, respectively. 
Trailing 3-month underlying orders were down 13%, again reflecting stabilizing and early improvement trends. Geographically, the Americas continued to be the most challenged, down 27%. Asia, Middle East and Africa declined modestly by 1%, supported by China orders growing 6%. Europe declined by 3% due to weakness in energy markets, somewhat offset by chemical, power and life science projects. 
Restructuring actions totaled $64 million across the platform as we continued execution of the return to peak profitability. The platform delivered robust positive profitability improvement despite the drop in revenue. 
Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 200 basis points and 290 basis points, respectively, as the effects of the ongoing cost actions took hold. Lastly, the platform increased backlog by $600 million, of which $300 million was due to the acquisition of OSI. The ending balance was $5.3 billion. 
Turning to Slide 14. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were up 12% in the quarter. All core world areas were solidly positive, with the Americas showing the strongest growth at 14% driven by strong residential, cold chain and home products demand. This growth points to share penetration gains in many of our end markets. Europe was up 8% as heat pump demand was driven by sustainability regulations and customer technology preferences. Finally, Asia, Middle East and Africa was up 7% driven by China, up 10%. 
As mentioned, trailing 3-month underlying orders remained robust, up 15%, with all business units growing. North America increased by 16% in robust HVAC and home products demand, while China was up 17%. Restructuring actions totaled $3 million in the platform and were primarily focused on facility rationalization and optimization programs. 
Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA margins were up 230 basis points and up 210 basis points, respectively, reflecting leverage on the increased volume and improved cost base. Finally, backlog in the business increased by approximately $200 million, ending the quarter at nearly $800 million, which is well above normal levels. 
Please turn to Slide 16, and we will introduce second quarter guidance. We now expect the underlying sales will be roughly flat year-over-year with a range of down 1% to up 1%. This potential for the company to return to positive growth is earlier than previously forecasted. The top line outlook is driven by continued momentum in residential, life science, medical, discrete and food and beverage markets and ongoing stabilization and improvement in other automation markets. 
GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS are expected to be $0.83 and $0.89, respectively, plus or minus $0.02. We expect adjusted EBIT margin to be 17.0% to 17.5% with adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 22.2% to 22.8%. Lastly, it is important to note that this guidance embeds an $0.11 change in stock price costs due to movement in the stock price. 
Slide 17 introduces our updated full year 2021 guidance framework. Management assumes that demand will continue to be challenging but stabilizing and steadily improving as global vaccine efforts mature. We also assume there are no major operational or supply chain disruptions and that oil prices remain in the $45 to $55 range. 
Given that context, we expect underlying sales growth this year with a range of flat to plus 4%. Automation Solutions is expected to be in the range of down 3% to up 1% underlying sales, while Commercial & Residential Solutions is expected to grow between 8% and 10%. As you can see, both of these platforms -- platform outlooks are improvements from November. 
We expect a slight decrease in effective tax rate as well as increases in operating cash flow and free cash flow to $3.15 billion and $2.55 billion, respectively. There is no other change to the capital allocation outlook. 
GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.39, plus or minus $0.10; while adjusted EPS is expected to be $3.70, plus or minus $0.10. We have also updated our outlook for profitability headwinds and tailwinds in the year. Since last quarter, we expect that COVID-related savings will now only be down $40 million this year, up from the previous estimate of $70 million. However, we now expect that price cost dynamics will be slightly negative as raw material costs and availability become more of a short-term challenge. Operations are working diligently to mitigate this issue. Lastly, stock price will be more of a headwind. 
And now please turn to Slide 18, and we will briefly cover the changes to the reset restructuring and COVID-related savings plan. Total company planned restructuring spend remains $200 million for the full fiscal year. As mentioned, we now expect only $40 million of the $150 million COVID-related savings from 2020 to return as business conditions start to normalize in the back half of the year. Accordingly, incremental 2021 savings have improved to $220 million. Total long-term annualized savings of the overall reset restructuring program are expected to exceed $650 million. 
Please turn to Slide 20, and I will now hand the call over to Mr. David Farr."

And I want to thank you very much for the interest in this great company. I'm clearly a little bit biased on that, but it is a great company. 
Second, I want to thank the global leadership team, the executive leadership team and all the employees around the world executing and delivering a fantastic first quarter for all of our investors. The last 19 months have been hard with a cost reset for peak margins, downturn in late 2019, COVID-19 pandemic and a resulting global recession and now the return to growth. My recognition and applauding to all of you is powerful and thankful. I want to thank all of you from my heart for what you've done over the last 19 months. But now we have a new threshold of execution for the second quarter and total fiscal year. I believe this team will make it happen. They are good. 
Third, I want to recognize and congratulate Lal Karsanbhai as the new CEO of Emerson. I'm so proud of you and so excited for you and how you and your new OCE team will take Emerson to new heights as I and we have done the last 20 years. When Chuck Knight turned over the reins to me in late 2020, I took a deep breath, I paused, I smiled, and then I moved forward. You're ready and have what it takes to lead Emerson. You have the right stuff as does all the OCE and global leaders. I'll be your best cheerleader, your supporter, and my phone line is always open to you and your team. Pause for a second. Phew.
Now why now? I'm healthy, folks. I'm not sick. Nothing is wrong with me other than my right knee, which is definitely gone, no golf. So the knee replacement is on the way. I've already talked to my doctor. The Board's succession plan and process ran its course with many great candidates over the last 5 years. I want to thank all of them. They all know who they are. A couple could be in this room. 
I also want to thank Bob Sharp, who is a close friend and really wanted to be CEO of Emerson, but as he and I talked, told him was not going to happen. So we decided to figure out how to make it happen somewhere else. I wish him the best of luck. 
As we went through the first quarter, it was clear to me, the Board that we clearly had one strong obvious candidate: Lal. The others are great leaders. They're great individuals. They're great friends. They've done great things in Emerson, but Lal is the next leader. So we decided. 
But that's not the only issue. There are other things going on across the company. The company is in great shape, the P&L, the balance sheet and the cash flow. As the Finance Committee told Lal this morning, don't blank it up. We had a very good final quarter in fiscal 2020, as you all know. Orders have been turning up strongly. The V-shape recovery has been taking hold and is really firm at this point in time. 
We've had strong exceptional execution around the massive cost reset that we embarked upon back in 2019, a cost reset costing us over $600 million when it's all said and done. The progress is enormous. You've seen it in the margins in the fourth fiscal quarter. You see it in the margins in the first quarter. We're going to deliver over $650 million of savings for the company when it's all said and done. 
The global teams led by these 2 individuals -- these 3 individuals in this room, Lal, Jamie and Frank, are getting the job done. They don't need my help. We are going to continue to deliver. I guarantee you. That's one commitment that I made to the Board when I said, yes, Lal is the guy. 
The first quarter was strong on all fronts. GAAP sales were flat; underlying sales, only down 2%. And I believe in the second quarter, our GAAP sales will clearly be up, and I think our underlying sales will be up also, maybe not a lot, but I think it will be positive. 
Profitability was very good and with improving volume and cost out in the first quarter, great incremental margins on both sides. Strong margins, EPS momentum and, yes, record first quarter cash flow of $800 million and free cash flow of $700 million, extremely strong execution around earnings and the balance sheet. 
And we see a solid fiscal quarter, both -- in both platforms across fiscal '21. Sales will grow this year, both in GAAP and underlying growth standpoint. We'll have increased margins, stronger EPS, potentially even that $3.70, which was our 2019 EPS with much higher sales in 2019. Plus strong cash flow. In my opinion, the number will bust the $3.2 billion, but I'm not the CEO, so he has to live with that number. With order and sales momentum in the second half of 2021 and going into 2022, we, the OCE, believe we'll finally deliver the $4-plus EPS in '22. 
Based on the global economic recovery, the momentum we see and the cost out, it looks very good, and we'll talk about that on the 16th. Cost reset, the drive to new peak margins in '22, '23, they are firmly in place. The entire next-generation team is ready to take the reins and lead Emerson forward. 
Clearly, even with the COVID-19 vaccine rolling out, we continue to be restrictive on what we can do. We have to operate in a safe environment. The normal year Emerson management process is somewhat turned, not quite the same. Global travel; live customer engagement; our face-to-face planning conference, which is known to be a combat sport at times; organization planning process; leadership planning process are all restricted and delayed. We're doing them, but they're not the same. 
So as I thought about what I can do as the CEO in this environment, it's basically take my experience, my maturity, which many of you know I'm mature, in this environment and help the next team. Name the new team, put it in place, get out of their way and help. That's what I'm going to do. I talked to the Board about this. It makes the most sense. 
Yes, I said 2021. Yes, I even said maybe most likely later in 2021. But the new facts and issues, and I always like to surprise, with our annual investor conference coming up this month in the 20 -- 16th, I think the time is ripe for the new CEO to stand up, present and not have the Dave Farr game, which many of you've had for over 20 years, in some cases, more than that as I worked for Mr. Knight. 
The February 16 time -- the February 16 presentation with the next-generation team is very important. I'll be there to help. I'll be there to advise. I care about this company. I'm a big shareholder in this company. It's been my life for 40 years, leading it for over 20 years. The time is ripe. 
As you know, I've never believed in long, drawn-out successions. Chuck and I had 3 days. He hit me with the keys in the chest. He took off for a year or for 6 months. I had to track him down to try to break the quarter string on earnings. The team, the -- Lal are ready. So let's move on. As I talked to the Board, we all said the same thing. So again, my congrats to Lal and the OCE. And if anyone wants to start a yelling match with me, you'll quickly see I'm not sick. 
Let's go to Chart 20. I do have my Stan Musial bat, my Rally Monkey and my rally squirrel, which is really a rally ferret, sitting here today, helping us out, making sure I don't lose my train of thought. We have pretty good momentum in orders. We laid out boxes. We started this box game as we put our forecast out in, I think, April of 2020 with Frank, at that time, Bob and myself. We delivered -- actually -- we laid out the box in the first quarter. You can see we came in better. The blue dot is where we thought we would be. We're above that, obviously, at the upper right-hand corner. 
Jamie's business has been very strong. He's executing. He's building backlog. That's one of his issues. He's got to get that backlog down. 
Lal's business has turned. It's not going to be quite as sharp as Jamie. Clearly, it's a different business model. But he's turned. 
If you look at the next forecast, next quarter, we now have a blue dot sitting pretty much on orders above the line, with a minus 4% to plus 6%. We're seeing good momentum in Europe. We're seeing good momentum in Asia. We see good momentum in Jamie's business in North America, and we're seeing some improvement in Lal's business, which I'm sure he'll talk about. So again, very good momentum in orders. As we lay this out, that's how we see it. 
Jamie's business will flatten out. It will turn down a bit. He's running at high levels at this point in time, clearly some unique opportunity of growth there with all his markets as he'll tell you going the right way, which is great to see. 
So if you look at Slide 21, what we're looking at right now for the growth this year, as we presented the Board, we're looking at somewhere around the plus 1, minus 1 for the second quarter, depends on what kind of execution Jamie can get on his -- on the backlog. He clearly has issues relative to capacity, COVID, materials, which we'll talk about. 
I think Lal's short-term business is starting to turn up, and we'll talk about that in his discrete business. Even some of the onesie, twosie orders are starting to happen. 
We have a broad second half. It's hard -- the third quarter will be a spike. As we all know, it's a spike down. But the key issue for us is to look at good growth in second half. Obviously, the ratios will look really good in the third quarter. But we're looking at the second half and the overall business pace in that second half going into fiscal '22. 
What I want to do is turn it over to Lal now so he can talk a little bit about his forecast and what he sees, some insights into the marketplace, and then we'll turn it over to Jamie and let him do the same thing. So Lal, the floor is yours."

I'm very proud of the team and what the team has accomplished in the quarter. It's a phenomenal execution of a plan that we laid out for our investors last February that we committed to do, and we're now seeing it reflected in the P&L of the company. We're generating some of our own tailwinds, which I'll talk to you about, and the market is starting to recover broadly across many geographies as well, which is highly encouraging. 
This Page 22, nothing really changed appreciably in our orders as we went through the summer months. However, as we got into the late fall, we started to see an increase in activity, particularly driven by Europe and Asia. 
I'll flip to the next chart and give you some perspectives on how we see the outlook right now. The industries that drove growth dramatically were the discrete industries driven by Germany, specifically, which had turned its economic engine on and started to accelerate both in the process space for internal consumption and then its vast export market engine. So we started to see that improve in automotive and semiconductor packaging OEMs as well as broad activity across Europe around power and the specialty chemicals segment. 
In Asia, driven by China, Steve highlighted growth of 6%. We feel very good about what we've seen there and expect that growth to accelerate into Q2 as we'll talk about in a moment. 
But the big elephant in the room is North America. And what we experienced in North America was a stabilization of the oil and gas markets, albeit at lower levels but a forecastable level of business. What the business -- what has driven the business in -- on the continent has been power generation, mining in the Southern Cone and life sciences throughout, which has been a great story for us. As a result of that, we are seeing a recovery and expect to see sequential improvement in order pacing and sales pacing in the second quarter and in the second half of the year as indicated back on Chart 22. 
Let me turn then to Chart 24, and we'll give a perspective of how we see the world areas first half to second half. And across most of the world, and I can pick out 1 or 2 pockets here, we will see that improvement reflected in the environment. That discrete energy -- that discrete momentum that we've built in Europe and Asia will begin in the Americas, in North America, particularly. And we've seen, as David noted, early signs of distribution-based business recovery as we navigated through December into January. So that's very encouraging to see. 
I was in Odessa, Texas a few weeks ago. I saw -- I met with teams and talked about the plans for 3.8 million barrels a day production for the year, which is a stable level from where it was a year ago. So we'll see maintenance of that, increased drilling to maintain those levels in those fields. So some encouragement there. But obviously, demand will ultimately drive those -- that market. 
In Europe, I've talked about it's really been a German story. Our discrete business is up over 30%. Our process business is up over 10% in Germany alone. And that -- and then there's increased momentum throughout the continent, very pleased with the positive first quarter, and we expect that to continue. 
And in Asia, the China bounce back was important. That was discrete-driven and process-driven as well. And we feel very good about the funnel of activity that we see as we look out right now. So I feel much better than I did in October, David and team. But -- and I look forward to a much better outlook in executing in a much better environment as we go forward."

As you can see, you heard throughout the call, the outlook for the year has improved since we last spoke. In November, we",1047,"So with that said, let's jump into the first chart there, Chart 25, that shows the updated outlook for underlying sales for the year. As you can see, you heard throughout the call, the outlook for the year has improved since we last spoke. In November, we were outlooking 4% to 7% underlying growth for the year. It was going to be about 5% to 6% in Q1, 2% to 4% in Q2 and 5% to 8% in the second half. And growth in orders and sales has really accelerated in Q1, as Dave talked about, and we saw greater-than-expected strength in North America residential markets along with accelerated improvement really in all other businesses and world areas. 
And so from a Q1 order standpoint, we saw double-digit trailing 3-month underlying orders for all of our businesses with the exception of Professional Tools, which came in at 2% after delivering 8% orders growth in the month of December. So it was improving as the quarter went on. The broad product line and world area strength that we saw in Q1 orders, the backlog we built, what we continue to see in our business trends in January support the increase in our outlook for the remainder of the year. 
So if you go to the next chart, Chart 26. These 2 -- these next 2 charts look at the business from a product line and then a geographic perspective. First, from a product perspective, we see underlying sales growth in the heating and AC business in the 9% to 12% range for the year. Extremely strong first half driven by the residential market and a more moderate second half as, by the fourth quarter, inventory restocking should stabilize. Demand may settle into a pattern closer to historic cycles. However, we do see positive medium- and long-term trends in the residential market driven by homeownership, remodeling and a focus on efficiency and environmental concerns. 
Our Cold Chain business has exhibited a quicker growth recovery than anticipated. In November, we expected Cold Chain to grow more in the 3% to 6% range for the year, now at 6% to 9%, supported by a stronger Q1 than expected, which was really driven by a 20-plus percent Q1 sales in global transport, positive growth in U.S. foodservice in December. So even though foodservice is a tough market, coming back slower, we had positive growth in December, double-digit growth in U.S. food retail in the second half of the quarter and double-digit aftermarket growth. 
China delivered double-digit Q1 Cold Chain sales growth with transport up more than 40%. We anticipate solid, stable growth in the Cold Chain as the year evolved. Foodservice will continue to lag other segments, but improvement in vaccine rollout could drive upside in that space in the back half of the year. 
In November, our outlook for Tools & Home products was also in the 3% to 6% range. It's now 6% to 9%. Our home products business and tools we have impacted by residential demand, we will see extremely strong growth in the first half. 
Just to put some of the home and contractor growth in perspective. In Q1, our wet/dry vac business posted 38% trailing 3-month fixed rate orders, and our InSinkErator business saw 20% plus trailing 3-month fixed rate orders growth. Again, the residential markets will settle into more moderate growth rates as the year progresses with very strong growth in the first half, good overall fundamentals in the medium and long term. 
For the remainder of our Professional Tools products, we will see a return to quarterly sales growth in Q2, followed by double-digit growth in the second half of the year, aided by comparables in Q3 but also a general improvement in market conditions globally, which we already started to see, as David mentioned. For example, EMEA, Asia both turned positive in Q1, and general industrial has been steadily improving. Overall, commercial building construction globally will continue to lag the recovery of most of our other served markets. 
All right. Next chart, Chart 27. Our heating and AC compression business saw 24% plus trailing 3-month Q1 orders growth with exponentially higher growth in residential. Our Q1 U.S. residential heating and AC compression businesses sales grew 69% in the quarter with growth accelerating as the quarter unfolded. 
We do expect the U.S. residential market to settle into lower growth in the second half for the first half as we've seen unique near-term growth dynamics and the rebuild of inventory in the channel. However, as I mentioned earlier, we do see some longer-term positive residential trends persisting. 
North America industrial continues to improve with commercial building construction lagging. Asia climate trailing 3-month fixed rate orders due to December were up 11%. Europe climate was up 12%, supported by continued strength in the heat pump space in Europe along with weather conditions improving marketing conditions overall in China. Overall, Europe Q1 climate fixed sales growth was 8% with heating growth up 40%. Overall, Asia fixed rate climate sales were up a little more than 6%. The climate part was up 15%, and the heating piece inside of that was up 30%. So we see pretty solid growth dynamics for the remainder of the year in North America, Europe, China and the Middle East and several smaller markets but a slower recovery in parts of North and Southeast Asia. 
The COVID situation is dynamic. We're watching it closely around the world. We'll let you know if we start to see any changes that would reflect our current view of how the year is going to unfold. 
And just to wrap up, I want to say thank you to the entire Commercial & Residential Solutions team, the whole Emerson team for a tremendous quarter. You all responded to unprecedented demand increases, worked long hours to make sure we meet our customer needs while working hard to keep our employees safe. And we saw historic increases in demand in several businesses. Our team did a great job responding. And what we all can't forget is the middle of a pandemic. And so I want you to know how much the entire leadership team appreciates all of your efforts. 
So with that, I'll pass it back to Dave. Onto you, Dave."

There's a huge capacity issue, where there's not enough capacity, and we know they're going to have to -- they're going to start spending money around steel, iron ore, mining, copper, plastics, all these things. 
So what Lal's guys are hearing and we've been hearing quite a bit across the United States even now and even in Europe, they are starting to talk about small projects and spending. So I think those conversations will continue. I think you'll start seeing capital. We're going to spend more capital this year. I bet you, if we had the time, we'd probably even spend more, but the time is not a big issue for us. So I think that we're feeling it, and we're -- Lal's seeing it. Where I really, really, really want to see it is the U.S.A. And -- but I guarantee you Jamie's customers, his facilities, all need capital, and Lal's the one who is going to make it for him. So that's what we see. But we'll see how that unfolds this year. 
I think our discrete business in the U.S. probably had a good month. We don't know yet totally, but I think they had a very good month.

And what we -- one scenario is that a dramatic portion of pent-up demand plus inventory that had to be restocked got pulled into the first 2 quarters and possibly a little bit of the third quarter. And so by the time you get to the fourth, which -- you got a tougher comp. We started to see growth come back towards the end of last fourth quarter. So it's a different comp you're chasing and could the residential markets go flat, even slightly down, slightly positive in that range. 
So you're -- I think it -- we see the Professional Tools businesses doing very well in the second half, both in terms of comps but also just demand improvement. Cold Chain is going to be steady throughout the year. So it's really a residential story. If residential has another wave here and stays strong and you have a hot summer, you have a very strong buying market in the housing market -- I think there's a lot of folks that didn't participate in the last wave of this housing remodeling and purchasing. That may be on the sidelines ready to go. They could -- then it could extend. We could have upside. But it's too early to tell. And so -- but that's going to be the key thing."

So as we took the Board through for the -- June through the end of, say, November time period and we looked at the analysis of the 2 platforms, the strategic rationale around the 2 platforms, that was obviously on the table at that point in time. And the Board hired outside help relative to these 2 issues. 
And their opinion and working with outside help, it was very clear and we fundamentally believe there's more value in the combined basis than separating the 2 businesses. And so the logic was around the investments we see going relative to this whole -- around the ESG, around sustainability, around software, what we see happening in the global world right now. As you look at the different cycles, [ the classics and ] what's going on right now in the 2 different cycles and how they leverage each other, that work was done back in the mid- to late 29 (sic) [ 2019 ]. The Board made a decision. And as we went through these last 18 months -- I guess it's not quite 18 but close to 18. I'll say 12 or 14 months. The Board never -- did not think about that at this point in time. They made that decision in a while back, and that's where it sits. 
And I -- obviously, clearly, from Lal's standpoint, the Board will continue to evaluate that in our strategy sessions with the Board -- or his strategy sessions with the Board. And I fundamentally believe that will constantly be on the table as we look at the mix of the businesses, if we look at where we want to go next and where we may want to get out of. 
This company has been in and out of businesses. We get out of this business. We'll go here. And that's what's made Emerson unique. For the 40 years I've been around, if you look at the 40 years and how we transformed this company, let alone the 20 years I did, we don't sit still. So I mean, I guarantee, before Lal retires, the company will look different than it is today. Now how is it going to look differently? Well, that course will play its hand out with him and his team and the Board. 
So that's how we look at it, Jeff. We don't look at trying to -- status quo is not a word around here, as you know."

The other issue that we face right now and one of the reasons we had very, very strong operating cash flow in the first quarter -- yes, Lal's execution was very good. Yes, Jamie's execution was very good. But we're in a situation with Jamie's business that we haven't seen before of this magnitude, where all of a sudden, he's shipping using all the inventory can and from the standpoint of getting the inventory out getting paid and maybe not paying all the suppliers on the payable side standpoint. He's in a situation right now where his trade working capital as a percent of sale is extremely low, [ just where that's based out ]. And we know some of that will reverse as his business starts slowing down in certain areas. 
So I think we want to be very cautious as they try to estimate how much was that cash pull-in because of the working capital, but it was a very good quarter on earnings and execution. And I think Frank and his team, as he talked to the financial officers out there, want to be a little bit more cautious. I think if we get a better feel in the second quarter, how the cash comes in, I think I wouldn't be surprised if we don't tweak it back up a little higher, John, to be all honest. But we're just being careful right now. But I think that the earnings and cash flow execution right now is very good.

Indirectly, as the OEMs work with different folks and they may put a broader air quality solution in place, it will often include an upgrade or a change out to the core compression solution. 
I think the other piece around air quality is that tight humidity control, I think, would be a big component of that. And we found that a lot of the air quality solutions work better in a tighter humidity band. Our 7ac business that we just bought, we invested in early stage, then we bought it out, and now we're commercializing it. It is a business that has 30%, 35% more energy efficient at providing very tight humidity bands for the air handling space for, initially, commercial buildings, for example. And we'll do some of that directly, and we'll also sell some of that through some of our large OEM partners.

Emerson Exchange is a chance for our customer base to interact with other users, industry experts and Emerson technology leaders. Despite the obvious in-person limitations of the pandemic, Emerson had a tremendously successful virtual engagement with customers, focusing on digital transformation, sustainability, technology and many other topics. This virtual framework dramatically expanded the reach of this already very popular user event. Due to the success of the hybrid format, we will likely be adopting such a format going forward. More details to follow as the time in place for the next Emerson Exchange event is finalized.

Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter, and I'd like to take you through the highlights of that over the next several slides. The strengthening recovery that Lal referred to in most of our end",1764,"Thank you, Lal. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter, and I'd like to take you through the highlights of that over the next several slides. The strengthening recovery that Lal referred to in most of our end markets, combined with the benefits from our cost reset actions drove strong operating performance and strong financial results in the second quarter. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.97, ahead of our guidance midpoint of $0.89 and representing 9% growth versus the prior year. Demand strengthened significantly with sales ahead of expectations at 2% underlying growth and March orders toward the high end of expectations at 4% underlying growth. 
Within that growth number for the orders, significantly, Automation Solutions continues its steady improvement in both orders and sales, while Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to experience robust demand across all its lines of business and in all geographies with 11% sales growth and 21% orders growth for the trailing 3 months through March. 
The cost reset benefits for the program that we implemented almost 2 years ago are being realized as planned, driving adjusted segment EBIT growth of 15% and 150 basis points of increased margin to 19.1%. Additionally, cash flow continues to be strong, up 37% year-over-year with free cash flow up nearly 50%, this represents 125% conversion of net earnings. We continue to execute on the remaining elements of our cost reset actions with the bulk of it behind us at this point, we initiated $21 million of additional restructuring in the quarter. 
Please turn to the next slide, if you would, for comments on the EPS. The EPS bridge. Operational performance was very strong in the quarter, adding $0.14 to adjusted EPS. As we guided in February, stock compensation was a significant headwind in the quarter due to the mark-to-market impact, which was caused by the difference in the share price at the end of last year's second quarter and this year's second quarter. Of course, you'll recall that last year, share prices in general were all severely depressed with the onset of COVID and we closed last year's second quarter at $48 versus $90 this year. And that headwind was within $0.01 of the guidance that we gave you in February. 
Tax currency and other miscellaneous items netted to about $0.04 of tailwind and a small impact from share repurchase. So in total, again, adjusted EPS was $0.97 versus the guide of $0.89. 
Please go to the next slide for comments on the P&L. So as I mentioned, underlying sales growth exceeded expectations at 2% and it was 6% on a reported basis, including acquisitions and currency. Gross profit slipped just a bit, 10 basis points, mainly due to business mix, given the growth in our Commercial & Residential Solutions business. 
SG&A increased by 10 basis points, but the real story here is that excluding the stock compensation impact, operationally, it was down 220 basis points, indicative of the magnitude of the cost reduction activity and the flow-through of the benefits. We had very strong leverage on SG&A, and the spend was actually down year-over-year when you exclude the impact of the stock comp. 
Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.2%, and our effective tax rate was within 1 point of last year. Share count at 603 million. And again, adjusted EPS of $0.97. 
If you please turn to the next slide, we'll talk about earnings and cash flow. Adjusted segment EBIT increased 15% with the margin increasing 150 basis points to 19.1%, as I said earlier. Leverage on the volume and cost reset benefits offset the material cost headwinds that we did see in the quarter. Again, stock comp was nearly $100 million headwind. It was partially offset by some other corporate items. Adjusted pretax earnings were down 20 basis points to 17.3%, again, as the impact of the mark-to-market on the stock comp [indiscernible] 
Operating cash flow was very strong, almost a record again at $807 million, up 37%. Free cash flow at $707 million was up 48%, driven by the strong earnings and favorable balance sheet items. Lastly, trade working capital was down to 16.8% of sales as the impact on the distortions from the COVID-related volume decline are beginning to normalize and as the businesses do a good job managing inventory as we return to growth. 
Please turn to the next slide, we'll go through Automation Solutions. Orders continue to turn upward here. We were at negative 5% on a trailing 3-month basis, making good progress, and we're on the trajectory that we have been mapping out for several months. Underlying sales were above expectations at negative 2%, and we're encouraged to see the continued sequential improvement in order rates underpinning the sales. 
China was very strong, and they were favorable comps, but also due to good strength in discrete, chemical and energy markets. Our demand in North America improved sequentially, but it did lag other world areas. However, there are no worthy pockets of growth, very encouraging signs in both discrete, life science, food and beverage and power generation. Importantly, we also continue to see increasing KOB 3 activity across our process automation customer base, driven by increased STOs and focused spend on OpEx and productivity. 
Margin in the platform increased 180 basis points of adjusted EBIT, 230 basis points at adjusted EBITDA driven by the cost reset savings. The OSI integration continues to go well. The expected synergies are being realized, and we are increasingly encouraged in validating the case that we made for the acquisition when we did it last October. Backlog is roughly flat sequentially at $5.3 billion, but it is up 14% year-to-date. 
Please turn to the next slide, where we review Commercial & Residential Solutions. The story here is very, very strong growth. Orders continue to strengthen with the March underlying trailing 3-month rate at 21%. The demand is primarily driven by having strength in residential end markets, but significantly cold chain, professional tools and other commercial and industrial markets are also picking up and contributing to the growth. All businesses in all regions were positive indicative trend. Strong growth in China, over 50%, was attributable to commercial HVAC and cold chain demand in addition to the favorable comp. Europe grew 9% on the strength of continued demand for heat pumps and other energy-efficient sustainable solutions. 
Margins improved 40 basis points at the adjusted EBIT level. Cost reduction benefits were somewhat offset by price cost headwinds, which we'll discuss a little more when we cover the guidance. Commercial & Residential backlog has increased almost 60% year-to-date to about $1 billion. This is about $400 million above what we would consider normal for this business. Operations are working through the significant challenges to meet strong customer demand across most of the businesses in this platform. 
Please go to the next slide, and we'll talk about the updated guidance for the year. Based on the strength we see in orders, the increasing pace of business, we are very encouraged and we are improving our sales outlook for the year. We now expect underlying sales in the range of 3% to 6% overall, with Automation Solutions roughly flat and Commercial & Residential up in the 12% to 14% range. The stronger volume will drive improved profitability. We now expect 17.5% adjusted EBIT margin for the entire enterprise. 
Cash flow was also projected higher at $3.3 billion operating cash flow and $2.7 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $150 million. Our tax, capital spending, dividend, share repurchase assumptions remain as they were. 
We're raising adjusted EPS guidance by $0.20 at the midpoint from $3.70 to $3.90, and we're tightening the range to plus or minus $0.05 from plus or minus $0.10. We're doing this, increasing the guidance in the face of additional headwinds to profitability because we're very encouraged by the underlying strength of the business and the read-through of the cost reset actions that the business has been working very diligently now for almost 2 years. 
The additional headwinds, you can see in the margin there on the right of the slide, mainly $50 million more of unfavorable price/cost, driven by continuing increases in raw materials costs and about another $20 million of stock comp expense versus what we estimated back in February. The speed and the magnitude of the price increases in key inputs, steel, copper, plastic resins is unprecedented. Operations are actively and effectively working to mitigate the margin impact through selected price and cost containment actions and the good work that they're doing gives us the confidence to raise the guidance despite these increased headwinds. On the plus side, we expect to retain about $10 million more in the year of the COVID-related savings than we previously estimated as basic activity like travel and everything that goes with it, comes back in more slowly than we would have thought a couple of months ago. 
If you please go to the next slide, I'll give you an update on orders. So as I mentioned earlier, our underlying trailing 3-month orders turned positive in the month of March at 4%. This is consistent with the upper range of the guidance that we provided to you in February. It's driven by ongoing strength in Commercial & Residential Solutions, as you can see, at 21%, and continued significant improvement in Automation Solutions as our global markets recover. And increasingly, we see improvement in our traditional process industries as well in North America. 
We expect general demand to remain strong for the balance of the year. We expect the Automation Solutions markets to accelerate through the second half and the Commercial & Residential HVAC demand will go up somewhat later in the year, but we would expect to see some of the other end markets, commercial, professional tools and such, recover to partially offset that tapering off in commercial residential. So all in all, we believe we have a good outlook for the second half of the year. 
If you please go to the next slide, the underlying sales growth outlook. Based on what we see and the pace of the improvement in orders, for the second half, we see growth in the high single-digits range at about 7% to 11%, and that will drive the full year growth of 3% to 6%. We expect net sales to be just a bit above $18 billion. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Lal and he'll talk about our business and end market outlook in more detail."

And essentially, what's occurred as we've navigated through the second quarter is a broader recovery in their -- in the mid-cycle elements of this platform. 
So we see a return to growth in Q3, which is very positive after 5 down quarters in this business and continued demand in short cycle as well as the acceleration in the core process automation markets in the back half of the year, yielding a 4% to 8% range in the second half and a flat year guidance on sales. 
If you turn to Page 16, I'll give you some color on what's going on in the world areas. Perhaps, before I do that though, I'll just paint it from a KOB perspective. KOB 3 has been incredibly strong, both in our discrete spaces, but more interestingly, as we navigated the second quarter into our process spaces. Frank referenced the shutdown turnaround activity, which is up double -- mid-double -- teens for the year and the STO schedules are holding in full, honestly, as we go into the summer into the fall season, which is very encouraging. 
The site walk downs are up almost 50%. And year-over-year, also very encouraging. And of course, the long-term service agreements are up almost 40% across the world in the business. Very encouraging to see and really provides the fuel for the underlying activity we're seeing in the process space. 
On a KOB 1 basis, things are not completely stopped. There's less activity. Obviously, we digested a significant LNG wave, but there's more activity on the horizon. We've entered the feed stage on 2 very important projects: the Baltic LNG and the Golden Island BASF in China, those are important opportunities for us in automation. And secondly, we were awarded the Sempra Costa Azul LNG project on the Pacific Coast, in the Baha Peninsula of Mexico, which has a significant value for us and was awarded and will be booked here in the third quarter. So there is some activity. We continue to engage on the KOB 1. And as that starts to loosen up a little bit, I think we're very well positioned. 
The tale of the tape, honestly, for the remainder of the year for this business is going to be the Americas. It's going to be a significant swing from a down 16% first half to a second half in that 10% midpoint. And we'll see that, we saw that already as we entered April, but we'll continue to see that recovery, I think, as we go through the latter half of the year into 2022. Europe, an incredibly strong first half, driven by life sciences, activity around biofuels, the number of KOB 2 type project awards, and we continue to see that strength, and I feel confident that, that strength will be there into the second half of the year. Of course, across all of these, the discrete environment has been very, very good into Asia, Europe and North America, whether it's automotive, medical or semiconductor, and we expect that strength to remain there. So overall, feeling much better about the second half here and feeling very good about how North America is shaping up for us in automation. 
Turning to Chart 17, some comments on commercial residential. What a great year this team is having. And obviously, the beneficiaries of a tremendous residential cycle. Much of it was driven by pandemic inventory levels -- pre-pandemic inventory levels, a prebuild in the cooling season that then we also benefited from a secular shift into suburbs and high family home construction and renovation. All of that has led into incredible residential strength through the year. Obviously, my expectation is that it starts to dampen as we get into the latter parts of the fiscal year. However, the mid-cycle professional tools, cold chain businesses are accelerating, and that's what we see here in this very balanced perspective for this business throughout 2021, and I'm very encouraged by what we're seeing in the later cycle pieces. 
Of course, we -- there's some good underlying technology evolutions as well that will impact the residential, be it the refrigerant changes or the heat pump moves in Europe, which are -- which will continue to drive good growth for the businesses. 
And then turning to Page 18. Again, a very balanced picture here from a world area perspective. And overall, a strong second half with the commercial industrial segment of this business continuing to improve as the residential market start to taper, as I discussed. I think all the world areas should grow, again, in the low double-digit to mid-teen range as we go into the second half. 
In the Americas, we are seeing residential demand remains strong in the near term and the commercial market is really starting to accelerate. And the cold chain piece, particularly, which is driven by transport and aftermarket, and then we see the tools momentum building in the professional channel. So very encouraged by that. 
Europe, I mentioned heat pump activity. We expect that to stay strong. And of course, a surge in construction should bolster our plumbing and electrical tools business. 
And then lastly, in Asia, China is the headline contributor to growth as some of you have already noted and demand is driven by commercial air conditioning and cold chain solutions. 
So with that, Pete, I'll turn it to Page 19, and we'll go to Q&A."

We went through a period of time, as you'll recall, of break fix environment with limited site access with limited STO type of activity. That's flipped. Obviously, the inoculation rates in this country have helped the confidence that customers have in having others on site and having their own folks, very honestly, on site. That's driven now a level of activity that is incredibly encouraging, and is, I think, above and beyond just the simple comparisons that we have. 
The discrete strength, to your point, will remain. I don't foresee that to wane at least as we go through the year in North America, but the real fuel there will be increased activity. And we're seeing that in the PO rates. We're seeing that in quotation activity and in the daily booking activity in our short to medium cycle automation businesses."

So certainly, a lot of press on supply chain, obviously, in terms of inflation, but also availability and shorter challenges. For example, you probably heard the electronics challenges on chip shortages. Frankly, our global teams, I would say, at this point, have done a remarkable job from an availability standpoint, whether it's availability of steel, plastic, resin where we've been able to move to alternatives. Certainly, on the electronics front, we've managed through our supply in terms of electronic supply from Asia pretty well. 
The inflation side, we're managing through that. I think that is something through price and productivity programs we're addressing. But to this point, we haven't seen any availability challenges. And similarly, on the logistics front, whether it's ground, ocean freight or air freight, our teams have done a really good job locking in the needed capacity to bring in material from our overseas supply chains. And frankly, at preferred rates, we haven't had to go out into the spot market yet, which is where we're seeing a lot of that inflation. So, so far, I would say we're managing through it pretty well. 
And the other piece I would want to point out is our regionalization strategy where we really have regional supply chains supporting our business has been a significant benefit where we haven't had to rely significantly on overseas supply chains to feed our plants."

We didn't know whether it was going to move forward as part of that significant eighth job LNG wave, now this is the ninth job, so very important to see that. 
In terms of what's new in the funnel, it's still in that $6.4 billion range. The hydrogen-related element in addition to that would be about $1 billion. The electrification piece, as you said, about 1 5 1 6. There's some newer stuff in there, but it's relatively smaller biofuels conversions of existing facilities or modernizations that fall into the funnel. So it's relatively static, although it is encouraging as you point out, to see some things moving to the left. 
Now in terms of OSI, phenomenal first 6 months with us ahead of plan that we put together internally and present it to our Board. I feel great about the management team, and what they're accomplishing. And most interestingly, I feel really good about the opportunity to continue to invest in the business and expand the sandbox. I think it's a very unique opportunity for us in terms of both technology and end market diversification. We want to do both. We want to do more, both organically and it's available inorganically."

What we're seeing, and we'll watch whether this is a trend or not, there are 2 things, Scott, into your question. Number one, the scale of the turnaround. They may be doing 1 or 2 units versus the entire facility. And secondly, the rate or the cycle at which the turnarounds are performed. Many of these facilities have now gone over 18, almost 24 months without a turnaround. They may question whether they can extend the cycle on turnaround and the frequency of turnarounds based on this experience. We haven't necessarily gotten that message up, and we're watching it very carefully as we go through this cycle, particularly this season over this summer into the fall.

Turning to Slide 3. I'd like to briefly highlight that Emerson has been publishing a corporate social responsibility report for many years now. We have renamed the report The Emerson Environmental, Social and Governance Report and are excited to highlight all of the goals, momentum and global standards that our organization is working towards.
In particular, our environmental sustainability framework, greening of Emerson, by Emerson and with Emerson, captures our internal sustainability efforts, our enablement of our customer sustainability journeys through our products and solutions and our collaboration efforts with various sustainability stakeholders. I encourage you to review the document next month when it is published. As always, I'm available for questions.
Please turn to Slide 4. I'd like to briefly mention our recent Emerson Exchange Virtual Series, which took place from November through March. Emerson Exchange is a chance for our customer base to interact with other users, industry experts and Emerson technology leaders. Despite the obvious in-person limitations of the pandemic, Emerson had a tremendously successful virtual engagement with customers, focusing on digital transformation, sustainability, technology and many other topics.
This virtual framework dramatically expanded the reach of this already very popular user event. Due to the success of the hybrid format, we will likely be adopting such a format going forward. More details to follow as the time and place for the next Emerson Exchange event is finalized.

Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter, and I'd like to take you through the highlights of that over the next several slides. The strengthening recovery that Lal referred to in most of our end",1765,"Thank you, Lal. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter, and I'd like to take you through the highlights of that over the next several slides. The strengthening recovery that Lal referred to in most of our end markets, combined with the benefits from our cost reset actions, drove strong operating performance and strong financial results in the second quarter.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.97, ahead of our guidance midpoint of $0.89 and representing 9% growth versus the prior year. Demand strengthened significantly with sales ahead of expectations at 2% underlying growth and March orders toward the high end of expectations at 4% underlying growth.
Within that growth number for the orders, significantly, Automation Solutions continues its steady improvement in both orders and sales, while Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to experience robust demand across all its lines of business and in all geographies with 11% sales growth and 21% orders growth for the trailing 3 months through March.
The cost reset benefits for the program that we implemented almost 2 years ago are being realized as planned, driving adjusted segment EBIT growth of 15% and 150 basis points of increased margin to 19.1%. Additionally, cash flow continues to be strong, up 37% year-over-year with free cash flow up nearly 50%. This represents 125% conversion of net earnings. We continue to execute on the remaining elements of our cost reset actions. With the bulk of it behind us at this point, we initiated $21 million of additional restructuring in the quarter.
Please turn to the next slide, if you would, for comments on the EPS, the EPS bridge. Operational performance was very strong in the quarter, adding $0.14 to adjusted EPS. As we guided in February, stock compensation was a significant headwind in the quarter due to the mark-to-market impact, which was caused by the difference in the share price at the end of last year's second quarter and this year's second quarter.
Of course, you'll recall that last year, share prices in general were all severely depressed with the onset of COVID and we closed last year's second quarter at $48 versus $90 this year. And that headwind was within $0.01 of the guidance that we gave you in February.
Tax, currency and other miscellaneous items netted to about $0.04 of tailwind and a small impact from share repurchase. So in total, again, adjusted EPS was $0.97 versus the guide of $0.89.
Please go to the next slide for comments on the P&L. So as I mentioned, underlying sales growth exceeded expectations at 2% and it was 6% on a reported basis, including acquisitions and currency. Gross profit slipped just a bit, 10 basis points, mainly due to business mix, given the growth in our Commercial & Residential Solutions business.
SG&A increased by 10 basis points, but the real story here is that excluding the stock compensation impact, operationally, it was down 220 basis points, indicative of the magnitude of the cost reduction activity and the flow-through of the benefits. We had very strong leverage on SG&A, and the spend was actually down year-over-year when you exclude the impact of the stock comp.
Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.2%, and our effective tax rate was within 1 point of last year. Share count at 603 million. And again, adjusted EPS at $0.97.
If you please turn to the next slide, we'll talk about earnings and cash flow. Adjusted segment EBIT increased 15% with the margin increasing 150 basis points to 19.1%, as I said earlier. Leverage on the volume and cost reset benefits offset the material cost headwinds that we did see in the quarter. Again, stock comp was nearly a $100 million headwind. It was partially offset by some other corporate items. Adjusted pretax earnings were down 20 basis points to 17.3%, again, as the impact of the mark-to-market on the stock comp [indiscernible].
Operating cash flow was very strong, almost a record again at $807 million, up 37%. Free cash flow at $707 million was up 48%, driven by the strong earnings and favorable balance sheet items. Lastly, trade working capital was down to 16.8% of sales as the impact and the distortions from the COVID-related volume decline are beginning to normalize and as the businesses do a good job managing inventory as we return to growth.
Please turn to the next slide, we'll go through Automation Solutions. Orders continue to turn upward here. We were at negative 5% on a trailing 3-month basis, making good progress, and we're on the trajectory that we have been mapping out for several months. Underlying sales were above expectations at negative 2%, and we're encouraged to see the continued sequential improvement in order rates underpinning the sales.
China was very strong, and they were favorable comps, but also due to good strength in discrete, chemical and energy markets. Our demand in North America improved sequentially, but it did lag other world areas. However, there are noteworthy pockets of growth, very encouraging signs in both discrete, life science, food and beverage and power generation. Importantly, we also continue to see increasing KOB3 activity across our process automation customer base, driven by increased STOs and focused spend on OpEx and productivity.
Margin in the platform increased 180 basis points of adjusted EBIT, 230 basis points at adjusted EBITDA driven by the cost reset savings. The OSI integration continues to go well. The expected synergies are being realized, and we are increasingly encouraged in validating the case that we made for the acquisition when we did it last October. Backlog is roughly flat sequentially at $5.3 billion, but it is up 14% year-to-date.
Please turn to the next slide, where we review Commercial & Residential Solutions. The story here is very, very strong growth. Orders continue to strengthen with the March underlying trailing 3-month rate at 21%. The demand is primarily driven by ongoing strength in residential end markets, but significantly cold chain, professional tools and other commercial and industrial markets are also picking up and contributing to the growth.
All businesses in all regions were positive, indicative of the trend. Strong growth in China, over 50%, was attributable to commercial HVAC and cold chain demand in addition to the favorable comp. Europe grew 9% on the strength of continued demand for heat pumps and other energy-efficient sustainable solutions.
Margins improved 40 basis points at the adjusted EBIT level. Cost reduction benefits were somewhat offset by price/cost headwinds, which we'll discuss a little more when we cover the guidance.
Commercial & Residential backlog has increased almost 60% year-to-date to about $1 billion. This is about $400 million above what we would consider normal for this business. Operations are working through the significant challenges to meet strong customer demand across most of the businesses in this platform.
Please go to the next slide, and we'll talk about the updated guidance for the year. Based on the strength we see in orders, the increasing pace of business, we are very encouraged and we are improving our sales outlook for the year. We now expect underlying sales in the range of 3% to 6% overall, with Automation Solutions roughly flat and Commercial & Residential up in the 12% to 14% range. The stronger volume will drive improved profitability. We now expect 17.5% adjusted EBIT margin for the entire enterprise.
Cash flow was also projected higher at $3.3 billion operating cash flow and $2.7 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $150 million. Our tax, capital spending, dividend, share repurchase assumptions remain as they were.
We're raising adjusted EPS guidance by $0.20 at the midpoint from $3.70 to $3.90, and we're tightening the range to plus or minus $0.05 from plus or minus $0.10. We're doing this, increasing the guidance in the face of additional headwinds to profitability, because we're very encouraged by the underlying strength of the business and the read-through of the cost reset actions that the business has been working very diligently now for almost 2 years.
The additional headwinds, you can see in the margin there on the right of the slide, mainly $50 million more of unfavorable price/cost, driven by continuing increases in raw materials costs and about another $20 million of stock comp expense versus what we estimated back in February. The speed and the magnitude of the price increases in key inputs, steel, copper, plastic resins is unprecedented.
Operations are actively and effectively working to mitigate the margin impact through selected price and cost containment actions, and the good work that they're doing gives us the confidence to raise the guidance despite these increased headwinds. On the plus side, we expect to retain about $10 million more in the year of the COVID-related savings than we previously estimated as basic activity like travel and everything that goes with it comes back in more slowly than we would have thought a couple of months ago.
If you please go to the next slide, I'll give you an update on orders. So as I mentioned earlier, our underlying trailing 3-month orders turned positive in the month of March at 4%. This is consistent with the upper range of the guidance that we provided to you in February. It's driven by ongoing strength in Commercial & Residential Solutions, as you can see, at 21%, and continued significant improvement in Automation Solutions as our global markets recover. And increasingly, we see improvement in our traditional process industries as well in North America.
We expect general demand to remain strong for the balance of the year. We expect the Automation Solutions markets to accelerate through the second half and the Commercial & Residential HVAC demand will go up somewhat later in the year, but we would expect to see some of the other end markets, commercial, professional tools and such, recover to partially offset that tapering off in Commercial & Residential. So all in all, we believe we have a good outlook for the second half of the year.
If you please go to the next slide, the underlying sales growth outlook. Based on what we see and the pace of the improvement in orders, for the second half, we see growth in the high single-digits range at about 7% to 11%, and that will drive the full year growth of 3% to 6%. We expect net sales to be just a bit above $18 billion.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Lal and he'll talk about our business and end market outlook in more detail."
269231,711315635,2270654,"Emerson Electric Co., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Emerson Electric Co.","Executives","Thank you, Frank.

I'll just cover a few charts here with the group. Again, increased momentum turning to -- on Chart 15 here. First, on Automation Solutions, we are -- we were led through the recovery in the first half by our discrete and early cycle businesses within the platform. And essentially, what's occurred as we've navigated through the second quarter is a broader recovery in their -- in the mid-cycle elements of this platform.
So we see a return to growth in Q3, which is very positive after 5 down quarters in this business and continued demand in short cycle as well as the acceleration in the core process automation markets in the back half of the year, yielding a 4% to 8% range in the second half and a flat year guidance on sales.
If you turn to Page 16, I'll give you some color on what's going on in the world areas. Perhaps, before I do that though, I'll just paint it from a KOB perspective. KOB3 has been incredibly strong, both in our discrete spaces, but more interestingly, as we navigated the second quarter into our process spaces. Frank referenced the shutdown turnaround activity, which is up double -- mid-double -- teens for the year and the STO schedules are holding in full, honestly, as we go into the summer, into the fall season, which is very encouraging.
The site walk downs are up almost 50% year-over-year, also very encouraging. And of course, the long-term service agreements are up almost 40% across the world in the business. Very encouraging to see and really provides the fuel for the underlying activity we're seeing in the process space.
On a KOB1 basis, things are not completely stopped. There's less activity. Obviously, we digested a significant LNG wave, but there's more activity on the horizon. We've entered the feed stage on 2 very important projects: the Baltic LNG and the Golden Island BASF in China. Those are important opportunities for us in automation. And secondly, we were awarded the Sempra Costa Azul LNG project on the Pacific Coast, in the Baja Peninsula of Mexico, which has a significant value for us and was awarded and will be booked here in the third quarter. So there is some activity. We continue to engage on the KOB1. And as that starts to loosen up a little bit, I think we're very well positioned.
The tale of the tape, honestly, for the remainder of the year for this business is going to be the Americas. It's going to be a significant swing from a down 16% first half to a second half in that 10% midpoint. And we'll see that, we saw that already as we entered April, and we'll continue to see that recovery, I think, as we go through the latter half of the year into 2022.
Europe, an incredibly strong first half, driven by life sciences, activity around biofuels, the number of KOB2-type project awards, and we continue to see that strength, and I feel confident that, that strength will be there into the second half of the year. Of course, across all of this, the discrete environment has been very, very good into Asia, Europe and in North America, whether it's automotive, medical or semiconductor, and we expect that strength to remain there. So overall, feeling much better about the second half here and feeling very good about how North America is shaping up for us in automation.
Turning to Chart 17, some comments on Commercial & Residential. What a great year this team is having. And obviously, the beneficiaries of a tremendous residential cycle. Much of it was driven by pandemic inventory levels -- pre-pandemic inventory levels, a prebuild in the cooling season that then we also benefited from a secular shift into suburbs and high family home construction and renovation. All of that has led into incredible residential strength through the year.
Obviously, my expectation is that it starts to dampen as we get into the latter parts of the fiscal year. However, the mid-cycle professional tools, cold chain businesses are accelerating, and that's what we see here in this very balanced perspective for this business throughout 2021, and I'm very encouraged by what we're seeing in the later cycle pieces.
Of course, we -- there's some good underlying technology evolutions as well that will impact the residential, be it the refrigerant changes or the heat pump moves in Europe, which are -- which will continue to drive good growth for the businesses.
And then turning to Page 18. Again, a very balanced picture here from a world area perspective. And overall, a strong second half with the commercial industrial segment of this business continuing to improve as the residential market start to taper, as I discussed. I think all the world areas should grow, again, in the low double-digit to mid-teen range as we go into the second half.
In the Americas, we are seeing residential demand remained strong in the near term and the commercial market is really starting to accelerate. And the cold chain piece, particularly, which is driven by transport and aftermarket, and then we see the tools momentum building in the professional channel. So very encouraged by that.
Europe, I mentioned heat pump activity. We expect that to stay strong. And of course, a surge in construction should bolster our plumbing and electrical tools business. And then lastly, in Asia, China is the headline contributor to growth as some of you have already noted, and demand is driven by commercial air conditioning and cold chain solutions.
So with that, Pete, I'll turn it to Page 19, and we'll go to Q&A."

The discrete strength, to your point, will remain. I don't foresee that to wane at least as we go through the year in North America, but the real fuel there will be increased activity.

I would expect, as capacity comes online, John, that there's a little bit of relief on price/cost. But again, that's a wait and see. So we took a more conservative approach there based on what we're seeing in the market as we've discussed with the teams. Ram, any comments there?"

So certainly, a lot of press on supply chain, obviously, in terms of inflation, but also availability and shorter challenges. For example, you probably heard the electronics challenges on chip shortages.
Frankly, our global teams, I would say, at this point, have done a remarkable job from an availability standpoint, whether it's availability of steel, plastic resin where we've been able to move to alternatives. Certainly, on the electronics front, we've managed through our supply in terms of electronics supply from Asia pretty well.
The inflation side, we're managing through that. I think that is something through price and productivity programs we're addressing. But to this point, we haven't seen any availability challenges. And similarly, on the logistics front, whether it's ground, ocean freight or air freight, our teams have done a really good job locking in the needed capacity to bring in material from our overseas supply chains.
And frankly, at preferred rates, we haven't had to go out into the spot market yet, which is where we're seeing a lot of that inflation. So, so far, I would say we're managing through it pretty well.
And the other piece I would want to point out is our regionalization strategy where we really have regional supply chains supporting our business has been a significant benefit where we haven't had to rely significantly on overseas supply chains to feed our plants."

But I think what we learned is that there's going to be a balance. I think there's going to be a way to engage with folks on the ground. We don't want to get away from that if we have the opportunity to do so. But we can also reach a much broader base of engagement with customers through the virtual platform. Customers who may not be able to devote a day or a night of travel, who may be interested in a singular subject or keynote, they now have the opportunity to dial in and listen in or see that presentation in a form that works for them.
So I think it's going to be a balance. I think some of that engagement is still going to be important because, as you know, as you saw when you were in -- when you were there with us in Nashville, there is a lot of customer-to-customer engagement where the value really comes in from those discussions.

I'm certainly excited and humbled to be joining the Investor Relations team during this dynamic time for our organization. I look forward to speaking with all our investors and partners very soon. 
Now I would like to take a moment to highlight 2 areas of real ESG impact within Emerson. 
First, on Slide 3, in keeping with environmental sustainability framework of greening of, by and with Emerson that we introduced in February, our first topic is about greening by Emerson. It is a great example of how Emerson solutions are relevant in enabling our customers' sustainability initiatives. 
Emerson recently signed a multiyear agreement with PureCycle Technologies, which has a novel technology and process for fully recycling plastic #5 polypropylene back to a clear pellet. As some of you may know, polypropylene is a common form of plastic that has not had great recycling options. Emerson is serving as their digital automation partner going forward with initial plant projects in Ohio, Georgia and a remote operation center in Florida. 
Now please join me on Slide #4. Our second topic is the greening with Emerson example. Leveraging our Helix Innovation Center in Dayton, Ohio, Emerson has collaborated with the Department of Energy and their Oak Ridge National Laboratory to advance next-generation HVACR technology. Expanding the applicability of heat pump technologies, redesigning refrigeration architectures to maximize efficiency in food retail and working to minimize energy use and leaks in commercial HVAC applications are just a few of the exciting areas of cooperation. We have a number of collaborations with the Department of Energy and their labs. 
We look forward to continuing to build these relationships and support the development of novel solutions and real sustainability road maps going forward. 
Now please turn to Slide 5, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Lal Karsanbhai."

Just a few words before I turn it over to Frank to go through the financial data. First, Pete, thank you very much. God speed and have a good luck in your new opportunity. We're all very excited for you. And thanks for all the hard work",694,"Thanks, Colleen. Just a few words before I turn it over to Frank to go through the financial data. 
First, Pete, thank you very much. God speed and have a good luck in your new opportunity. We're all very excited for you. And thanks for all the hard work. Welcome, Colleen. Great to have you here. Colleen and I had the opportunity to spend couple of years together in Automation Solutions, and we're very blessed to have her join our Investor Relations team. So welcome. Thank you. 
I'd like to express my thanks to the leadership teams and the management and our employees globally for what has been a very, very well-executed quarter. And we have a lot of energy momentum behind us, which was very exciting to see as we executed through the last 3 months. 
I'd also like to express my thank you to our shareholders. I had the opportunity over the last 6 months to meet many of you, and I look forward to meeting more of you as we go through the next part of the year. But I appreciate your continued confidence, your challenges and of course, your investment. 
A few things just that are not financially related that I want to mention to the team here. First of all, our cultural work is well underway. We will be announcing our new Chief People Officer later this month. We're all very excited about the selection process. It will be an outside hire and somebody who fundamentally will have the opportunity to come in here and really help us as we navigate some of the challenges and create many of the pathways that we have as we evolve the culture of Emerson into the future. 
Secondly, our portfolio work is complete. We have -- we are now getting ready to review it with the Board, which will occur at the October Board meeting. We discussed briefly with the Board yesterday. And essentially, what we have defined is multiple paths for our business to drive higher underlying sales growth and diversification of the portfolio. We're all very excited about the process that we underwent. It was very exhaustive, and we have turned over a lot of different stones, defining broad markets with high growth and lots of optionality in terms of M&A and organic activity. Very exciting there. 
I'll mention on the M&A side that industrial software continues to be critical as we think about share of wallet, as we think about the potential for underlying growth acceleration. And there are many pathways there. Our SI acquisition is performing incredibly well and ahead of our internal synergy board plans. So that's been very, very well done. 
But what stands out to me most above all is the execution by the team. Yes, there were market tailwinds, and we'll talk about those, particularly as the accelerated in Automation Solutions and continued across our Commercial & Residential businesses, and they are relevant but the execution was absolutely phenomenal. 
There are a lot of hurdles to overcome through the quarter, material inflation, material availability. We did a lot of expediting. We had to get very creative in qualifying suppliers, logistics and management of of cargo around the world and, of course, labor availability in the United States. But the team just did a great job. 
And lastly, before I turn it over to Frank, the cost reset work is well underway, and we're now in the tail ends of the spend. And we're seeing, despite these operational headwinds, the value of that work being reflected in the incrementals of the company. The operating leverage -- profit leverage at 34% was very strong and now most importantly, has given us the room to accelerate investment in differentiating technologies and further -- that will further, I think, drive relevance -- increased relevance at our customer base. So very exciting headroom that's created, and we started those investments, and I'll share a number of those with you, and we'll talk about that more as we go through the year. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Frank, and I'll speak towards the end of the call."

Thank you, Lal. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us. We're especially pleased with the results in the quarter, especially in light of the operations challenges that Lal just described and Ram will talk about a little later in the call. 
If you please go to Slide 6. So a continued recovery in our end markets, combined with the benefits of the cost reset actions and that drove strong operating performance and financial results in the third quarter. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.09 and up 36% from the prior year. Demand continues to strengthen with sales coming in ahead of our expectations with underlying growth of 15%, and June trailing 3-month orders were at 26%. Automation Solutions notably turned positive this quarter in both sales and orders, up 9% in sales and 17% on an underlying basis. 
Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to experience robust demand across the business and geographies with 29% sales growth and 43% orders growth on an underlying basis. 
The cost reset benefits continue to be realized as planned reading through to the margins. And along with the additional volume and leverage, they drove adjusted segment EBIT growth of 40%, 280 basis points of increased margin to 19.6%. 
Cash flow continues to be very strong with operating and free cash flow up approximately 30% year-over-year, and free cash flow conversion exceeding 150% of net earnings. We're continuing to implement the remaining elements of the cost reset program. In this quarter, we initiated $32 million of restructuring actions. The program is on schedule and delivering the projected savings as we've planned. 
Please turn to Slide 7. This is a bridge of the earnings per share increase from the prior year. The operational performance was very strong. So the noteworthy thing on this chart is the green bar. Operations added 33% to adjusted EPS, and it was balanced between the platforms. They both delivered strong profit leverage on the strength of volume increases and cost reduction benefits, as Lal mentioned. Leverage was 34% across the enterprise. 
Tax, currency, pension, stock comp netted to a $0.05 headwind, and there was a minor favorable impact from share repurchase. Again, in total, adjusted EPS was $1.09, up 36%. 
Please go to the next chart, Chart #8. So as I mentioned, underlying sales is up 15%. Gross profit increased 90 basis points to 42.4%, driven mainly by the benefits of the cost reduction actions and then the leverage on the volume across the enterprise. We did offset the impact of price cost headwinds, which we are beginning to see intensify and which we will see in the next couple of quarters, and we will talk about a little later in the call. 
Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.4%, up 310 basis points. Effective tax rate was 19.2% versus 11% in the prior year. Last year, we had several favorable discrete items, mostly around R&D credits that we described at the time. This was a $0.10 headwind year-over-year that we overcame. 
Adjusted EPS, as mentioned, was $1.09 versus $0.80 last year. 
If you go to Slide 9, please, we'll talk about earnings and cash flow. Adjusted segment EBIT again increased 40%, margin up 280 basis points. The leverage on volume and cost reset benefits offset material cost headwinds in the Climate Technologies business. 
Adjusted pretax earnings increased 350 basis points to 17.6%. Operating cash flow was very strong, up 31% at $1.1 billion. Free cash flow was $977 million, also up a little over 30%, driven by strong earnings growth and effective working capital management. 
Lastly, the trade working capital ratio improved to 15.4% of sales. 
Turning to Slide 10, we'll look at Automation Solutions. Underlying sales turned positive this quarter at 8%. Trailing 3-month orders accelerated to 17%. The improvement in the Americas is particularly encouraging and notable with continued momentum in life sciences, food and beverage and medical markets and a return to growth more broadly across the traditional process automation markets and sustainability-related business. 
We're seeing increasing KOB 3 activity across our process automation customer base mainly driven by shutdown turnaround and outage activity and OpEx spend. MRO spend is returning to pre-pandemic levels from pent-up demand and delayed STLs. CapEx spending is recovering at a slower rate with tailwinds from site-based emissions and optimization projects. The platform continues to implement the comprehensive restructuring actions that have been ongoing, and the benefits are flowing through to the financial results. 
Adjusted EBIT margin increased 320 basis points and 310 basis points at adjusted EBITDA, driven mainly by the flow-through of the cost reset savings and by the volume leverage. 
The integration of OSI continues to go very well. We're very pleased with the acquisition and the results to date, and we have increasing confidence in the synergy plan that we have. 
Backlog increased to $5.5 billion. It is up 17% year-to-date. We'll talk a bit about the project funnel and other opportunities later in the call. 
Turning to Slide 11, we'll review Commercial & Residential Solutions. Sales were up on an underlying basis, 29% versus the prior year. Orders continue to be strong and very broad-based in their strength. The June trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 43%, and it was very balanced across both Climate Technologies and tools and home products. All our businesses and geographies showed strong double-digit growth. Residential markets continue to be strong and growth has accelerated in Cold Chain and professional tools. 
The Americas were up 29% with continued strength across all end markets. Europe was up 37%, driven by continued heat pump demand and increasing sales of professional tools. Asia, Middle East and Africa was up 25%, driven by Cold Chain and various heating technologies. 
Margins improved by 170 basis points of adjusted EBIT and 120 basis points of adjusted EBITDA driven by the strong volume leverage and the cost reset savings, which more than offset the price cost headwinds that we are seeing in the business. 
Please turn to Slide 12. I'm going to pass this over to Ram, and he's going to talk a bit about operations, what we've done in the quarter to deliver the results and some of the challenges that we face."

Clearly, as you can see, our operating environment remains very challenging as commodity inflation, electronic supply and labor availability continues to impact our global operations. Steel prices are at record highs with 11 months of consecutive increases and, in our estimation, have not peaked yet. 
Plastic resin prices remain elevated as our global teams have maneuvered expeditiously defined alternatives to maintain supply. And while copper pricing has receded off record highs, it is still up over $1.40 a pound year-over-year. Our hedge positions lessened the impact to 2021, but the inflation impact in terms of copper will carry over into most of 2022. 
Electronic shortages are proliferating in most of our businesses, impacting both platforms, and supply is expected to remain constrained well into 2022. Very little component inventory on microprocessors, controllers, linear integrated circuits are available in the open market, and the number of shortages faced by our EMS suppliers is growing severely impacting lead times. 
And finally, labor availability continues to be an issue across many industries in the U.S., and our businesses are impacted as well. Our V-shaped demand recovery in many of our Commercial & Residential Solutions businesses, local competition driven by tight labor markets in many cities and rolling labor constraints as waves of COVID disruptions impact our sites has added a new level of complexity to our operational plans. 
It is important to note that price cost remains at an unfavorable $75 million as we estimated last quarter. No change, but we expect the maximum impact of the commodity inflation to be felt in the next 2 quarters. 
Now despite these challenges, turning to Slide 13, I'd like to highlight some of the outstanding work by our global supply chain and operations teams to combat these challenges and help deliver phenomenal operational results to date as they remain flexible, creative and nimble in a dynamic environment to serve the needs of our customers. 
Our supply chain teams have worked tirelessly in this environment to ensure continuity of material supply to our global plants. As you can see on the chart, many creative solutions are being implemented on a real-time basis quickly and effectively. Our regional footprint, both on the manufacturing side as well as supply chain that we spent many years developing has certainly been an advantage for us in these challenging times. 
Many of our global plants are producing at record levels while ramping up capacity to meet surge demand and, in many cases, in-sourcing critical elements of the supply chain to address sudden disruptions. 
I do want to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our global teams for delivering an outstanding operational quarter. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Lal to walk through our full year guidance and outlook."
269231,1674095772,2362465,"Emerson Electric Co., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Emerson Electric Co.","Executives","Thank you, Ram. Let's turn now to Slide 15. We are improving our sales outlook for the year based on the continued strength in our orders, the pace of business and the year-to-date profit performance. We now expect underlying sales growth to be near the t",1586,"Thank you, Ram. Let's turn now to Slide 15. We are improving our sales outlook for the year based on the continued strength in our orders, the pace of business and the year-to-date profit performance. We now expect underlying sales growth to be near the top of our May guidance of approximately 5% to 6%. Commercial Residential above their range in May at 15% to 16%, and Automation Solutions closer to the top of that range at 0% to 1%. 
The strong volume and improved cost base will flow through to margins. Our estimates are now 50 basis points above the previous guidance, increasing adjusted EBIT margin and adjusted EBITDA by 0.5% to approximately 18% and 23%, respectively. 
There's no change to the restructuring, tax rate, capital spend or dividend. 
Strong profitability and working capital performance enabled an increase in our operating cash flow and free cash flow estimates, both of which increased by $300 million. We are also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $4.07, plus or minus $0.01. Our price/cost headwind for 2021 currently remains as estimated in Q2 and Ram covered at $75 million despite the current challenges that were highlighted. We continue to manage this through containment, selective price actions, but the recent market developments that Ram described will be challenged through the next 2 quarters as we navigate them. Stock compensation impact increases to $125 million. 
So now we'll go over to Chart 16, and I'll just frame the order environment that we've experienced through the last 3 months. Emerson's trailing 3-month orders continue to be very strong and have momentum from the last update we gave you in the second quarter, with Commercial & Residential Solutions continuing to climb higher in their order run rates and Automation Solutions turned sharply positive to the high teens in June. Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to see strength in residential, Cold Chain and the professional tools business, and all 3 very near to that average band of 43%. 
Discrete and hybrid end markets in Automation Solutions continue to be very strong, while we see recovery in later cycle process automation markets, especially in North America. KOB 3 and KOB 2 are driving most of the recovery, but we are beginning to see some KOB 1 activity materialize, particularly in chemicals, power and biofuels. 
The Americas really strengthened, up 29% as deferred maintenance demand and site access drove momentum. 
Finally, as we have commented in the past quarters, life sciences momentum continues to be extremely strong. 
Let's now turn to Chart 17, and I'll review the underlying sales growth outlook. Q3 underlying sales were up 15% versus prior year, exceeding our management expectations, driven by the strength in Commercial & Residential Solutions as well as the North America recovery just discussed. Full year expectations on underlying sales are between 5% and 6% at the top end of our prior guidance of 3% to 6% and sales of approximately $18.4 billion. 
The fourth quarter is expected to land in the high single digits to low double-digit range. For the remainder of the year, we expect to see the North America business continue to recover in Automation Solutions as well as continued broad strength in commercial residential solutions. However, the impact of supply chain and labor issues will be a challenge. 
Let's now turn to Slide 18, and I'll review our outlook by geography. As Frank mentioned, for the full year, we are expecting Automation Solutions sales to be flat to 1% and Commercial & Residential Solutions to be between 15% and 16%, driving us to our overall 5% to 6% underlying sales expectations. 
So starting off in the Americas. Quarter 4 is expected to be strong in Automation Solutions at approximately 20% growth, broad-based recovery across all industries, led by continued strength in discrete and increasing strength in hybrid. Process is showing some recovery, although uneven with some strength from returning domestic oil demand, offset by reduced midstream investment and continued fiscal restraint in upstream. 
For KOB3, we expect to see continued spend for deferred maintenance and increasing spend for site access that has been pent-up from the pandemic with an expectation that we will see a strong fall shutdown turnaround season. 
In Latin America, strength in mining industries, particularly, are expected to continue. On the Commercial & Residential side of the business, ongoing momentum in the residential markets, driven by do-it-yourself trends, home starts and HVAC seasonality as well as strength in Professional Tools and Cold Chain are expected to continue. 
Europe will continue to see demand in life sciences and biofuels on the automation side. Project wins in power, midstream, downstream and sustainability will drive low to mid-single-digit growth in Q4. Commercial & Residential will see robust demand for heat pumps and Professional Tools as well as the continuation of the refrigeration market recovery in Q4. 
Turning to Asia, Middle East and Africa. Our Asia automation business is seeing healthy project activity in marine, nuclear, life sciences and semiconductors and a positive trend for site-level spending in the Middle East. On the Commercial & Residential side, we are seeing the commercial recovery across the region, specifically with commercial AC and Cold Chain solutions. Ongoing COVID restrictions continue to be a challenge across the organization, particularly in this part of the world. 
Let's now turn to Chart 19, and we'll review the business funnel for Automation Solutions. So back in February, we commented that our traditional large project funnel was $6.4 billion, and this should be something that is very familiar to those of you who watch this carefully. Since February, we have booked approximately $80 million of projects, some LNG and one most notably in Mexico. New projects added include clean fuels, hydrogen, renewable diesels, lithium mining and LNG projects, while projects removed from the funnel since February were mostly oil and gas and downstream refining projects. The August 2021 funnel is now valued at $6.3 billion and approximately 180 projects. And below in the pie, you can see the industry mix of our traditional funnel. 
We have identified new decarbonization opportunities. And though generally smaller than our traditional definition of projects for our funnel classifications, these projects are increasingly relevant to our business. They're being added into this view because they have the potential to grow in nature over time. Today, as depicted on the chart, these opportunities are worth $400 million and approximately 120 projects. 
The combination of our traditional project funnel and the new sustainability funnel is now valued at $6.7 billion. And below is the combined industry mix where we are working to diversify our funnel. 
On the right side of the chart, we are introducing the business opportunities with our recent OSI acquisition, which gave us an important foothold into the transmission and distribution automation space. These opportunities have slightly different characteristics from our traditional project funnel definition, and therefore, we are keeping it separate for our discussion purposes today. 
Generally, these opportunities are smaller and more numerous compared to our large traditional project funnel, but they are clearly strategically important. The value of these opportunities is $1.5 billion and are made up of 530 projects. To give you some perspective on the scale and how differentiated it is, approximately 15% of that $1.5 billion has a value of greater than $5 million, and 50% of it is between $1 million and $5 million. The funnel is global, although approximately $1 billion of it is in North America and Europe. 
Overall, we have strong opportunities ahead, and I'm bullish on overall project outlook as we diversify and expand into new spaces. 
Now let's turn to Chart 20. This is a very important chart. And as Frank mentioned in our financial results showcase, our robust cost reset plan is being incredibly well executed across the enterprise. As a reminder, this comprehensive plan began in late 2019 and will be fully realized by 2023. It involves over $600 million in spend and approximately $650 million in savings. 
In February, we also introduced our midrange targets of 24% adjusted EBITDA margins and $4.75 to $5 in adjusted EPS. We are very much on track to reach those targets by 2023. Importantly, however, the recent outperformance and momentum through the end of 2021 is creating some headroom for critical investments, and I'm particularly excited about this, particularly as I think about key technologies that will enable our business to outperform over the long term. As you can see, revenues, margins and cash flow are all better than February expectations and are enabling this acceleration in technology investments. I've outlined 4 examples below and will come out over the next months and in depth in February as to how we're managing and thinking about these very significant investments. Examples outlined are the Copeland K7 scroll, which is the largest new product investment in the history of our air conditioning business. This thing drives obviously increased performance and meets the 2023 efficiency regulations and is optimized for 2025 refrigerants. The Greenlee remote cutters, an award-winning tool on the right-hand side of the chart, which enhances safety for cutting underground cables. The Gemini, which has our next-generation pressure in temperature device being developed in our Measurement Solutions business, which will have next-generation electronics, unmatched safety and process insight. And lastly, our Plantweb Optics, our integrated operational performance platform, which unifies data, people and systems to drive operational performance. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator, and we'll begin the Q&A."

And I think there's a little bit of both in the funnel. I think if you look at the traditional $6.3 billion funnel, there was already embedded in that a lot of the biofuel conversions, emissions monitoring work that's being done downstream, particularly in refining and other parts. 
What's in the green bar, what's in the new opportunities, I think, are significantly incremental investments. And those are partially driven by things like green diesel, which is basically the manufacturing of diesel, but using a feedstock that is a sustainable feedstock or the investments in hydrogen. 
If you recall, back in February, we talked about $1 billion opportunity for hydrogen that was framed around 2030. However, as we now bring these projects into our -- and this is a very defined pursuit process that we run within the business. We now bring those into that pursuit, and we are pursuing those to 2023, and that's the view of the $400 million. 
I expect that to increase over time and the number, not just the number but the scale of those projects to become more and more meaningful, which is why we're talking about it today. But you're absolutely right. I think our core integrated oil customers, upstream through the midstream and downstream, they're all spending dollars, incremental dollars on emissions, sustainability, reliability, productivity, all around those automations to drive to their ESG commitments. And that can come in the frame of conversions or of optimizing current processes."

So the teams are performing incredibly well. Management, we've retained management, and they're executing the plans. 
And what we're seeing is actually higher-than-expected ability to leverage existing relationships that PWS and Ovation have across the large power companies in North America.

So validating the technology, validating the applicability and the customer relevance has been very important for us. So we're excited. 
There is an opportunity to build around this business, and there is a vision to continue to transform this into more of a pure software play in terms of evolution from perpetual into subscription, in terms of outsourcing services and focusing on software and looking around measures that are relevant for software businesses such as annual recurring revenues and things of that sort. So we're working that very aggressively within the business.

I'm certainly excited and humbled to be joining the Investor Relations team during this dynamic time for our organization. I look forward to speaking with all our investors and partners very soon.
Now I would like to take a moment to highlight 2 areas of real ESG impact within Emerson. First, on Slide 3, in keeping with environmental sustainability framework of greening of, by and with Emerson that we introduced in February, our first topic is about greening by Emerson. It is a great example of how Emerson solutions are relevant in enabling our customers' sustainability initiatives.
Emerson recently signed a multiyear agreement with PureCycle Technologies, which has a novel technology and process for fully recycling plastic #5 polypropylene back to a clear pellet. As some of you may know, polypropylene is a common form of plastic that has not had great recycling options. Emerson is serving as their born digital automation partner going forward with initial plant projects in Ohio, Georgia and a remote operation center in Florida.
Now please join me on Slide #4. Our second topic is the greening with Emerson example. Leveraging our Helix Innovation Center in Dayton, Ohio, Emerson has collaborated with the Department of Energy and their Oak Ridge National Laboratory to advance next-generation HVACR technology. Expanding the applicability of heat pump technologies, redesigning refrigeration architectures to maximize efficiency in food retail and working to minimize energy use and leaks in commercial HVAC applications are just a few of the exciting areas of cooperation. We have a number of collaborations with the Department of Energy and their labs.
We look forward to continuing to build these relationships and support the development of novel solutions and real sustainability road maps going forward. Now please turn to Slide 5, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Lal Karsanbhai."

First, Pete, thank you very much. God speed and have a good luck in your new opportunity. We're all very excited for you and thanks for all the hard work. Welcome, Colleen. Great to have you here. Colleen and I had the opportunity to spend couple of years together in Automation Solutions, and we're very blessed to have her join our Investor Relations team. So welcome. Thank you.
I'd like to express my thanks to the leadership teams and the management and our employees globally for what has been a very, very well-executed quarter. And we have a lot of energy and momentum behind us, which was very exciting to see as we executed through the last 3 months.
I'd also like to express my thank you to our shareholders. I had the opportunity over the last 6 months to meet many of you, and I look forward to meeting more of you as I go through the next part of the year. But I appreciate your continued confidence, your challenges and of course, your investment.
A few things just that are not financially related that I want to mention to the team here. First of all, our cultural work is well underway. We will be announcing our new Chief People Officer later this month. We're all very excited about the selection process. It will be an outside hire and somebody who fundamentally will have the opportunity to come in here and really help us as we navigate some of the challenges and create many of the pathways that we have as we evolve the culture of Emerson into the future.
Secondly, our portfolio work is complete. We have -- we are now getting ready to review it with the Board, which will occur at the October Board meeting. We discussed briefly with the Board yesterday. And essentially, what we have defined is multiple paths for our business to drive higher underlying sales growth and diversification of the portfolio.
We're all very excited about the process that we underwent. It was very exhaustive, and we have turned over a lot of different stones, defining broad markets with high growth and lots of optionality in terms of M&A and organic activity. Very exciting there.
I'll mention on the M&A side that industrial software continues to be critical as we think about share of wallet, as we think about the potential for underlying growth acceleration and our many pathways there. Our SI acquisition is performing incredibly well and ahead of our internal synergy board plans. So that's been very, very well done.
But what stands out to me most above all is the execution by the team. Yes, there were market tailwinds, and we'll talk about those, particularly as they accelerated in Automation Solutions and continued across our Commercial & Residential businesses and they are relevant, but the execution was absolutely phenomenal.
There were a lot of hurdles to overcome through the quarter, material inflation, material availability. We did a lot of expediting. We had to get very creative in qualifying suppliers, logistics and management of cargo around the world and of course, labor availability in the United States. But the team just did a great job.
And lastly, before I turn it over to Frank, the cost reset work is well underway, and we're now in the tail ends of the spend. And we're seeing, despite these operational headwinds, the value of that work being reflected in the incrementals of the company.
The operating leverage -- profit leverage at 34% was very strong and now most importantly, has given us the room to accelerate investment in differentiating technologies and further -- that will further, I think, drive relevance -- increased relevance at our customer base. So very exciting headroom that's created, and we started those investments. And I'll share a number of those with you, and we'll talk about that more as we go through the year.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Frank, and I'll speak towards the end of the call."
269231,1674095772,2362541,"Emerson Electric Co., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Emerson Electric Co.","Executives","All right. Thank you, Lal.

Thank you, Lal. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us. We're especially pleased with the results in the quarter, especially in light of the operations challenges that Lal just described and Ram will talk about a little later in the call.
If you please go to Slide 6. So a continued recovery in our end markets, combined with the benefits of the cost reset actions, and it drove strong operating performance and financial results in the third quarter.
Adjusted EPS was $1.09, up 36% from the prior year. Demand continues to strengthen with sales coming in ahead of our expectations with underlying growth of 15%, and June trailing 3-month orders were at 26%. Automation Solutions notably turned positive this quarter in both sales and orders, up 9% in sales and 17% on an underlying basis.
Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to experience robust demand across the business and geographies with 29% sales growth and 43% orders growth on an underlying basis. The cost reset benefits continued to be realized as planned reading through to the margins. And along with the additional volume and leverage, they drove adjusted segment EBIT growth of 40%, 280 basis points of increased margin to 19.6%.
Cash flow continues to be very strong with operating and free cash flow up approximately 30% year-over-year and free cash flow conversion exceeding 150% of net earnings. We're continuing to implement the remaining elements of the cost reset program. In this quarter, we initiated $32 million of restructuring actions. The program is on schedule and delivering the projected savings as we've planned.
Please turn to Slide 7. This is a bridge of the earnings per share increase from the prior year. The operational performance was very strong. So the noteworthy thing on this chart is the green bar. Operations added 33% to adjusted EPS, and it was balanced between the platforms. They both delivered strong profit leverage on the strength of volume increases and cost reduction benefits, as Lal mentioned. Leverage was 34% across the enterprise.
Tax, currency, pension, stock comp netted to a $0.05 headwind, and there was a minor favorable impact from share repurchase. Again, in total, adjusted EPS was $1.09, up 36%.
Please go to the next chart, Chart #8. So as I mentioned, underlying sales is up 15%. Gross profit increased 90 basis points to 42.4%, driven mainly by the benefits of the cost reduction actions and then the leverage on the volume across the enterprise. We did offset the impact of price/cost headwinds, which we are beginning to see intensify and which we will see in the next couple of quarters and we will talk about a little later in the call.
Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.4%, up 310 basis points. Effective tax rate was 19.2% versus 11% in the prior year. Last year, we had several favorable discrete items, mostly around R&D credits that we described at the time. This was a $0.10 headwind year-over-year that we overcame. Adjusted EPS, as mentioned, was $1.09 versus $0.80 last year.
If you go to Slide 9, please, we'll talk about earnings and cash flow. Adjusted segment EBIT again increased 40%, margin up 280 basis points. The leverage on volume and cost reset benefits offset material cost headwinds in the Climate Technologies business.
Adjusted pretax earnings increased 350 basis points to 17.6%. Operating cash flow was very strong, up 31% at $1.1 billion. Free cash flow was $977 million, also up a little over 30%, driven by strong earnings growth and effective working capital management. Lastly, the trade working capital ratio improved to 15.4% of sales.
Turning to Slide 10, we'll look at Automation Solutions. Underlying sales turned positive this quarter at 8%. Trailing 3-month orders accelerated to 17%. The improvement in the Americas is particularly encouraging and notable with continued momentum in life sciences, food and beverage and medical markets and a return to growth more broadly across the traditional process automation markets and sustainability-related business.
We're seeing increasing KOB 3 activity across our process automation customer base mainly driven by shutdown turnaround and outage activity and OpEx spend. MRO spend is returning to pre-pandemic levels from pent-up demand and delayed STOs. CapEx spending is recovering at a slower rate with tailwinds from site-based emissions and optimization projects. The platform continues to implement the comprehensive restructuring actions that have been ongoing, and the benefits are flowing through to the financial results.
Adjusted EBIT margin increased 320 basis points and 310 basis points at adjusted EBITDA, driven mainly by the flow-through of the cost reset savings and by the volume leverage. The integration of OSI continues to go very well. We're very pleased with the acquisition and the results to date, and we have increasing confidence in the synergy plan that we have.
Backlog increased to $5.5 billion. It is up 17% year-to-date. We'll talk a bit about the project funnel and other opportunities later in the call.
Turning to Slide 11, we'll review Commercial & Residential Solutions. Sales were up on an underlying basis 29% versus the prior year. Orders continue to be strong and very broad-based in their strength. The June trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 43%, and it was very balanced across both Climate Technologies and Tools & Home products. All our businesses and geographies showed strong double-digit growth. Residential markets continue to be strong and growth has accelerated in Cold Chain and Professional Tools.
The Americas were up 29% with continued strength across all end markets. Europe was up 37%, driven by continued heat pump demand and increasing sales of professional tools. Asia, Middle East and Africa was up 25%, driven by Cold Chain and various heating technologies. Margins improved by 170 basis points of adjusted EBIT and 120 basis points of adjusted EBITDA driven by the strong volume leverage and the cost reset savings, which more than offset the price/cost headwinds that we are seeing in the business.
Please turn to Slide 12. I'm going to pass this over to Ram, and he's going to talk a bit about operations, what we've done in the quarter to deliver the results and some of the challenges that we face."

Clearly, as you can see, our operating environment remains very challenging as commodity inflation, electronic supply and labor availability continues to impact our global operations. Steel prices are at record highs with 11 months of consecutive increases and in our estimation, have not peaked yet.
Plastic resin prices remain elevated as our global teams have maneuvered expeditiously defined alternatives to maintain supply. And while copper pricing has receded off record highs, it is still up over $1.40 a pound year-over-year. Our hedge positions lessened the impact to 2021, but the inflation impact in terms of copper will carry over into most of 2022.
Electronics shortages are proliferating in most of our businesses, impacting both platforms, and supply is expected to remain constrained well into 2022. Very little component inventory on microprocessors, controllers, linear integrated circuits are available in the open market, and the number of shortages faced by our EMS suppliers is growing, severely impacting lead times.
And finally, labor availability continues to be an issue across many industries in the U.S., and our businesses are impacted as well. Our V-shaped demand recovery in many of our Commercial & Residential Solutions businesses, local competition driven by tight labor markets in many cities and rolling labor constraints as waves of COVID disruptions impact our sites has added a new level of complexity to our operational plans.
It is important to note that price/cost remains at an unfavorable $75 million as we estimated last quarter. No change, but we expect the maximum impact of the commodity inflation to be felt in the next 2 quarters.
Now despite these challenges, turning to Slide 13, I'd like to highlight some of the outstanding work by our global supply chain and operations teams to combat these challenges and help deliver phenomenal operational results to date as they remain flexible, creative and nimble in a dynamic environment to serve the needs of our customers.
Our supply chain teams have worked tirelessly in this environment to ensure continuity of material supply to our global plants. As you can see on the chart, many creative solutions are being implemented on a real-time basis quickly and effectively. Our regional footprint, both on the manufacturing side as well as supply chain that we spent many years developing, has certainly been an advantage for us in these challenging times.
Many of our global plants are producing at record levels while ramping up capacity to meet surge demand and in many cases, in-sourcing critical elements of the supply chain to address sudden disruptions. I do want to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our global teams for delivering an outstanding operational quarter.
With that, I'll turn it over to Lal to walk through our full year guidance and outlook."
269231,1674095772,2362541,"Emerson Electric Co., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Emerson Electric Co.","Executives","Thank you, Ram. Let's turn now to Slide 15. We are improving our sales outlook for the year based on the continued strength in our orders, the pace of business and the year-to-date profit performance. We now expect underlying sales growth to be near the t",1590,"Thank you, Ram. Let's turn now to Slide 15. We are improving our sales outlook for the year based on the continued strength in our orders, the pace of business and the year-to-date profit performance. We now expect underlying sales growth to be near the top of our May guidance of approximately 5% to 6%, Commercial Residential above their range in May at 15% to 16% and Automation Solutions closer to the top of that range at 0% to 1%.
The strong volume and improved cost base will flow through to margins. Our estimates are now 50 basis points above the previous guidance, increasing adjusted EBIT margin and adjusted EBITDA by 0.5% to approximately 18% and 23%, respectively. There's no change to the restructuring, tax rate, capital spend or dividend.
Strong profitability and working capital performance enabled an increase in our operating cash flow and free cash flow estimates, both of which increased by $300 million. We are also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $4.07, plus or minus $0.01.
Our price/cost headwind for 2021 currently remains as estimated in Q2 and Ram covered at $75 million despite the current challenges that were highlighted. We continue to manage this through containment, selective price actions, but the recent market developments that Ram described will be challenged through the next 2 quarters as we navigate them. Stock compensation impact increases to $125 million.
So now we'll go over to Chart 16, and I'll just frame the order environment that we've experienced through the last 3 months. Emerson's trailing 3-month orders continue to be very strong and have momentum from the last update we gave you in the second quarter, with Commercial & Residential Solutions continuing to climb higher in their order run rates and Automation Solutions turned sharply positive to the high teens in June. Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to see strength in Residential, Cold Chain and the Professional Tools business, and all 3 very near to that average band of 43%.
Discrete and hybrid end markets in Automation Solutions continue to be very strong, while we see recovery in later cycle process automation markets, especially in North America. KOB 3 and KOB 2 are driving most of the recovery, but we are beginning to see some KOB 1 activity materialize, particularly in chemicals, power and biofuels.
The Americas really strengthened, up 29% as deferred maintenance demand and site access drove momentum. Finally, as we have commented in the past quarters, life sciences momentum continues to be extremely strong.
Let's now turn to Chart 17, and I'll review the underlying sales growth outlook. Q3 underlying sales were up 15% versus prior year, exceeding our management expectations, driven by the strength in Commercial & Residential Solutions as well as the North America recovery just discussed. Full year expectations on underlying sales are between 5% and 6%, at the top end of our prior guidance of 3% to 6% and sales of approximately $18.4 billion.
The fourth quarter is expected to land in the high single digits to low double-digit range. For the remainder of the year, we expect to see the North America business continue to recover in Automation Solutions as well as continued broad strength in commercial residential solutions. However, the impact of supply chain and labor issues will be a challenge.
Let's now turn to Slide 18, and I'll review our outlook by geography. As Frank mentioned, for the full year, we are expecting Automation Solutions sales to be flat to 1% and Commercial & Residential Solutions to be between 15% and 16%, driving us to our overall 5% to 6% underlying sales expectations.
So starting off in the Americas. Quarter 4 is expected to be strong in Automation Solutions at approximately 20% growth, broad-based recovery across all industries, led by continued strength in discrete and increasing strength in hybrid. Process is showing some recovery, although uneven with some strength from returning domestic oil demand, offset by reduced midstream investment and continued fiscal restraint in upstream. For KOB 3, we expect to see continued spend for deferred maintenance and increasing spend for site access that has been pent-up from the pandemic with an expectation that we will see a strong fall shutdown turnaround season.
In Latin America, strength in mining industries particularly are expected to continue. On the Commercial & Residential side of the business, ongoing momentum in the residential markets, driven by do-it-yourself trends, home starts and HVAC seasonality as well as strength in Professional Tools and Cold Chain are expected to continue. 
Europe will continue to see demand in life sciences and biofuels on the automation side. Project wins in power, midstream, downstream and sustainability will drive low to mid-single-digit growth in Q4. Commercial & Residential will see robust demand for heat pumps and professional tools as well as the continuation of the refrigeration market recovery in Q4.
Turning to Asia, Middle East and Africa. Our Asia automation business is seeing healthy project activity in marine, nuclear, life sciences and semiconductors and a positive trend for site-level spending in the Middle East. On the Commercial & Residential side, we are seeing the commercial recovery across the region, specifically with commercial AC and cold chain solutions. Ongoing COVID restrictions continue to be a challenge across the organization, particularly in this part of the world.
Let's now turn to Chart 19, and we'll review the business funnel for Automation Solutions. So back in February, we commented that our traditional large project funnel was $6.4 billion, and this should be something that is very familiar to those of you who watch this carefully.
Since February, we have booked approximately $80 million of projects, some LNG and one most notably in Mexico. New projects added include clean fuels, hydrogen, renewable diesels, lithium mining and LNG projects, while projects removed from the funnel since February were mostly oil and gas and downstream refining projects. The August 2021 funnel is now valued at $6.3 billion in approximately 180 projects. And below in the donut pies, you can see the industry mix of our traditional funnel.
We have identified new decarbonization opportunities. And though generally smaller than our traditional definition of projects for our funnel classifications, these projects are increasingly relevant to our business. They're being added into this view because they have the potential to grow in nature over time. Today, as depicted on the chart, these opportunities are worth $400 million in approximately 120 projects.
The combination of our traditional project funnel and the new sustainability funnel is now valued at $6.7 billion. And below is the combined industry mix where we are working to diversify our funnel.
On the right side of the chart, we are introducing the business opportunities with our recent OSI acquisition, which gave us an important foothold into the transmission and distribution automation space. These opportunities have slightly different characteristics from our traditional project funnel definition, and therefore, we are keeping it separate for our discussion purposes today.
Generally, these opportunities are smaller and more numerous compared to our large traditional project funnel, but they are clearly strategically important. The value of these opportunities is $1.5 billion and are made up of 530 projects. To give you some perspective on the scale and how differentiated it is, approximately 15% of that $1.5 billion has a value of greater than $5 million, and 50% of it is between $1 million and $5 million.
The funnel is global, although approximately $1 billion of it is in North America and Europe. Overall, we have strong opportunities ahead, and I'm bullish on overall project outlook as we diversify and expand into new spaces.
Now let's turn to Chart 20. This is a very important chart. And as Frank mentioned in our financial results showcase, our robust cost reset plan is being incredibly well executed across the enterprise. As a reminder, this comprehensive plan began in late 2019 and will be fully realized by 2023. It involves over $600 million in spend and approximately $650 million in savings.
In February, we also introduced our midrange targets of 24% adjusted EBITDA margins and $4.75 to $5 in adjusted EPS. We are very much on track to reach those targets by 2023. Importantly, however, the recent outperformance and momentum through the end of 2021 is creating some headroom for critical investments. And I'm particularly excited about this, particularly as I think about key technologies that will enable our business to outperform over the long term.
As you can see, revenues, margins and cash flow are all better than February expectations and are enabling this acceleration in technology investments. I've outlined 4 examples below and will come out over the next months and in depth in February as to how we're managing and thinking about these very significant investments.
Examples outlined are the Copeland K7 scroll, which is the largest new product investment in the history of our air conditioning business. This thing drives obviously increased performance and meets the 2023 efficiency regulations and is optimized for 2025 refrigerants.
The Greenlee remote cutters, an award-winning tool on the right-hand side of the chart, which enhances safety for cutting underground cables. The Gemini, which is our next-generation pressure and temperature device being developed in our Measurement Solutions business, which will have next-generation electronics, unmatched safety and process insight. And lastly, our Plantweb Optics, our integrated operational performance platform, which unifies data, people and systems to drive operational performance.
And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator, and we'll begin the Q&A. Thank you."

I think there's a little bit of both in the funnel. I think if you look at the traditional $6.3 billion funnel, there was already embedded in that a lot of the biofuel conversions, emissions monitoring work that's being done downstream, particularly in refining and other parts.
What's in the green bar, what's in the new opportunities, I think, are significantly incremental investments. And those are partially driven by things like green diesels, which is basically the manufacturing of diesel but using a feedstock that is a sustainable feedstock, or the investments in hydrogen.
If you recall, back in February, we talked about a $1 billion opportunity for hydrogen that was framed around 2030. However, as we now bring these projects into our -- and this is a very defined pursuit process that we run within the business. We now bring those into that pursuit, and we are pursuing those to 2023, and that's the view of the $400 million.
I expect that to increase over time and the number, not just the number, but the scale of those projects to become more and more meaningful, which is why we're talking about it today. But you're absolutely right. I think our core integrated oil customers, upstream through the midstream and downstream, they're all spending dollars, incremental dollars on emissions, sustainability, reliability, productivity, all around those automations to drive to their ESG commitments. And that can come in the frame of conversions or of optimizing current processes."

In terms of the steel and copper pricing, certainly, the copper hedges will flow through, through the year. We've modeled that out.

We were actually up there for a growth planning session just earlier -- late July. So the teams are performing incredibly well. Management, we've retained management, and they're executing the plans.
And what we're seeing is actually higher-than-expected ability to leverage existing relationships that PWS and Ovation have across the large power companies in North America. But more importantly, the opportunity to greatly geographically expand this business at a far rate -- a far higher rate than we expected at the time of the acquisition.
So validating the technology, validating the applicability and the customer relevance has been very important for us. So we're excited. 
There is an opportunity to build around this business, and there is a vision to continue to transform this into more of a pure software play in terms of evolution from perpetual into subscription, in terms of outsourcing services and focusing on software and looking around measures that are relevant for software businesses such as annual recurring revenues and things of that sort. So we're working that very aggressively within the business.
In terms of growth rates, I would suggest high single digits on the Systems & Solutions business. And I would say, Jeff, that the data management layer grew slightly above that, but on average.

Now in terms of the overall study, look, this management team believes that the path to the higher multiple and to the total shareholder return performance is driving an increase in the underlying sales growth of the company. And we need to fall into this bucket of 4% to 6%.

But the Professional Tools area, the Ridges and the Greenlees, they're really driven by infrastructure spend, capital cycles, not dissimilar to what we see in our mid-cycle automation businesses. And so those, I think, have sustained opportunity as we go well into 2022.
The one we're watching very carefully, as I look at climate, is the air conditioning residential cycle. And we're watching those orders. We're staying very close with our OEM customers, the Tranes and Carriers of the world in terms of communicating, understanding their demand.

Good morning, and thank you for joining Emerson's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End Earnings Conference Call. Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishan. I encourage everyone to follow along with the slide presentation, which is available on our website. 
Please join me on Slide 2. As always, this presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risks and uncertainty. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on non-GAAP measures. As I turn to Slide 3, I would like to highlight 2 areas where Emerson is making a difference. First, Mike Train, our Chief Sustainability Officer, will be attending this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26 in Glasgow. Mike will be a panelist at the adjacent Sustainable Innovation Forum participating in 2 notable discussions. The first discussion will be how to support small to medium enterprises to adopt net 0 pathways. And second, on supporting breakthrough innovation to green, hard-to-abate sectors. Mike has worked this year to drive many greening of, by and with Emerson initiatives. 
One notable green by example in the recent announcement between Biotech and Emerson to accelerate production of distribution of low-cost, low-carbon hydrogen. In the agreement, Emerson will deliver advanced automation technology, software and products in support of biotech building hundreds of fully autonomous hydrogen units to enable hydrogen fuel cell commercial trucking fleet and abatement projects in steel and cement. 
Another exciting initiative is our $100 million commitment to corporate venture capital, Emerson Ventures, designed to accelerate innovation by providing insight into cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to solve real customer challenges. The investment commitment will advance the development of disruptive discrete automation solutions environmentally sustainable technologies and industrial software in key industries. A formal announcement and more information will be seen in tomorrow's press release. 
Finally, our investor conference historically has been in February. However, due to the recent announcement with AspenTech, we have decided to move our investor conference to May. It will be located at the New York Stock Exchange on May 17, 2022. I'd like to now turn the presentation over to Emerson's President and CEO and Lal Karsanbhai for his opening comments."
269231,1685041266,2422829,"Emerson Electric Co., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Emerson Electric Co.","Executives","Thank you, Colleen, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was a phenomenal year for Emerson. It developed very differently, obviously, than we planned a year ago. For one, I was named CEO and brought a new value-creation agenda to the table. But equally import",968,"Thank you, Colleen, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was a phenomenal year for Emerson. It developed very differently, obviously, than we planned a year ago. For one, I was named CEO and brought a new value-creation agenda to the table. But equally important, we operated in an environment, which was both rewarding and challenging for the organization. 
Through it all, our teams around the world did a fabulous job. I want to express my sincere gratitude to all the Emerson employees around the world. Thank you. I would also like to thank Emerson's Board of Directors and our shareholders for your support and confidence in the management team. 
2021 was characterized by strong demand in our residential air conditioning business as well as our hybrid and discrete markets in automation. Furthermore, we have experienced a recovery in process automation markets. The automation KOB3 mix for 2021 was up 2 points to 59%. And Emerson September 3-month trailing orders were plus 16%. 
We grew 5.3% underlying and leveraged at 38% operationally, inclusive of a $140 million swing in our price/cost assumptions from November through to the end of the fiscal year. The earnings quality of this company continues to be excellent with free cash flow conversion of 129%. The fourth quarter, however, was challenged significantly by supply chain, logistics and labor challenges. And that is not the similar from anything you've heard before. 
This was experienced in the form of material cost inflation, notably steel, electronics and resins and lead time extensions. In addition, we experienced logistics challenges in availability of lanes and costs. And lastly, U.S. manufacturing labor, which was characterized by higher turnover rates, absenteeism and overtime costs. 
In the quarter, we missed sales by $175 million. And alongside a challenging price/cost environment in our climate business, it resulted in a negative $0.14 impact to EPS for the quarter and a $0.19 impact to 2021 EPS. Having said that, the company grew 7% in the fourth quarter and had 19% operating leverage. 
Turning to '22 and some initial thoughts. The first half of the year will not look dissimilar from the fourth quarter with slight sequential improvement as we go to Q2. Price/cost and supply chain challenges unwind in the second half of the year against the backdrop of continued strong demand. The price/cost assumption in the year will be a positive $100 million for 2022. 
I'm very optimistic for 2022. The operating environment has unpredictability, but it is significantly more stable than a year ago and demand is much stronger. The residential A/C cycle would moderate as we go through 2022. However, we expect automation markets to continue to strengthen, driven by digital transformation and modernization, replacement in MRO markets and select LNG and sustainability-driven KOB 1. Most notably, methane emissions reduction projects and carbon capture. 
I have confidence that we will deliver 30% incrementals on our underlying sales in 2022. This addresses execution, and as you know, that's 1 of the 3 pillars we identified as a management team for accelerated value creation. We have equally taken significant steps in our journey to modernize our culture and advance ESG initiatives. The Board named Jim Turley as the company's Independent Chair of the Board. We named Mike Train as the company's first Chief Sustainability Officer, and we hired Elizabeth Adif as Emerson's first Chief People Officer. I'm very proud of the diversity targets we set for the enterprise. The changes to our long-term compensation and annual bonus structure to include ESG measures and the commitments we have made to accelerate greenhouse gas intensity reductions. 
Lastly, turning to the portfolio. Please turn to Slide 4. We recently concluded a comprehensive portfolio review, which culminated in a 2-day session with our Board of Directors in early October. We left the meeting with the firing portfolio road map and pathways. The key elements were as follows: Firstly, in terms of the portfolio today and how we are thinking about it. Diversification is critical. We will continue to divest upstream oil and gas hardware assets. 
Secondly, we will action low growth or commoditized businesses. And lastly, we will action disconnected assets. All 3 of these actions will take place over time with intentionality for patients and a keen awareness of cycles and meeting the value creation proposition to our shareholders. 
Secondly, we identified 4 large profitable, high-growth end markets, each with at least $20 billion of size and projected to grow higher than 4% a year into the future, supported by macros. The 4 end markets will be the hunting ground for our M&A activity. Lastly, we defined 2 possible end states for the portfolio and the journey that we'll embark up and have embarked on. 
One of the 4 markets is industrial software, a $60 billion segment that we identified growing at 9%. The AspenTech transaction is an exciting step for Emerson and a very important transformational step for this corporation. AspenTech is one of the best run industrial software companies in the space with highly differentiated technology and a phenomenal leadership team led by Antonio Pietri, for who I have the greatest personal admiration. 
The AspenTech company will be a highly diversified business with transmission and distribution as its largest served market and is uniquely positioned to enable our energy customers to transition to a lower carbon future. I'm optimistic of the synergy opportunities that exist and believe the new AspenTech, which will be 55% owned by Emerson shareholders will be a differentiated platform for future industrial software M&A. I'm very excited about this as I hope you can tell. 
We expect to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2022 following the completion and approval of the customary regulatory items. With that, I will now turn the call over to Frank Dellaquila, Emerson's Chief Financial Officer."

So we're really pleased with the financial results for fiscal 2021. As Lal said, we ended the year with a great deal of uncertainty and far exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. The underlying demand environment developed much as we thought it would. There was continued strength in global discrete and hybrid automation markets and the North America process markets began to gain momentum later in the year. 
The global demand in our commercial residential markets were strong and broad-based, particularly in the U.S. residential air conditioning market, and it far exceeded the expectations that we had going into the year. Our operations team successfully worked through labor and supply chain issues, particularly toward the end of the year and deliver the strong results that we're able to report to you today. 
Toward the end of the year, the intensifying combination of rising material costs, supply chain challenges and labor constraints in the U.S. did begin to weigh on sales volume and profitability. We've worked through that in the fourth quarter. We will continue to work through that in the first half of fiscal '22. 
Despite these fourth quarter challenges, we're pleased to report that we achieved the key financial targets that we committed to you in August regarding underlying growth adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow, and you can see all of that in the table. This was achieved in the face of an unexpected increase in key raw materials, mainly steel and copper, that resulted in an unfavorable price/cost swing of $140 million during the year versus the expectation and the guidance that we gave you a year ago. We're very grateful for the extraordinary effort of our operations teams at every level and the manufacturing employees who made this happen under some of the most challenging conditions that we've seen. 
Please turn to Slide 7. This slide highlights our strong 2021 results. The continued recovery in our end markets drove strong full year underlying growth of more than 5%. Net sales were up 9% year-over-year, including a 1 point impact from acquisitions, mainly LSI, which closed at the beginning of the fiscal year. Adjusted segment EBIT benefited from strong leverage in operations. 38% as Lal just mentioned, adjusted EBIT from underlying volume and the benefit of cost reset actions that were begun 2 years ago. 
These cost reductions more than offset price/cost headwinds, which, as I said, were $140 million versus our expectation at the beginning of the year, and the supplies chain challenges that raise costs and reduced availability. Cash flow was robust, up 18% year-over-year, attributable to the strong earnings growth and working capital efficiency. Free cash flow conversion of net earnings was 129%. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $4.10, exceeding our guide by $0.03 at the midpoint and up 19% for the year. Automation Solutions underlying growth was flat year-over-year. Growth turned positive in the second half driven by strong discrete and hybrid markets while the later cycle process automation markets delivered sequential improvement as we move through the year. Adjusted EBIT increased 230 basis points due to the strong leverage driven by cost reset benefits. 
Commercial & Residential saw exceptional growth of 6% underlying year-over-year to future broad strength across the residential and commercial markets with mid-teens growth in all world areas. Adjusted EBIT increased 20 basis points versus prior year. Price/cost headwinds worsened in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter as we anticipated on the call in August but were offset for the full year by strong underlying leverage and spending restraints. 
Please turn to Slide 8. Operational performance was strong throughout the year, adding $0.59 to adjusted EPS, overcoming a $0.19 headwind from supply chain and $90 million of unfavorable price/cost. Operations leveraged at more than 35% on volume and cost actions. Nonoperating items contributed $0.02 net overcoming a significant headwind from the stock comp mark-to-market accounting. Share repurchase totaled $500 million as we guided and added about $0.03. In total, adjusted EPS was 4.10%, as I said, an increase of 19%. 
Please turn to Slide 9. Regarding the fourth quarter, strong end market demand drove underlying growth of 7% with net sales up 9%. This growth was achieved despite a $175 million impact from supply chain, logistics and labor constraints that affected both platforms in somewhat different ways. Adjusted segment EBIT dropped 10 basis points reflecting a 200 basis point impact from supply chain volume constraints across the company and from the increasingly negative price cost headwinds in commercial and residential. 
Free cash flow declined 39%, mainly due to higher working capital to support the growth versus the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.21, exceeding the guidance midpoint by $0.03 and up 10% and versus the prior year. Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 3%, with strong recovery in the Americas, particularly in the power generation and chemical markets, partially offset by declines in other world areas. Sales were reduced by about $125 million or 4 points due to supply chain constraints. Our backlog was up 16% year-to-date and now sits at $5.4 billion, $100 million less than at the end of the third quarter. 
Typically, our backlog would reduce more in Q4. However, due to strong orders and supply chain constraints. Backlog remains elevated above the levels we would otherwise have expected. Strong leverage and cost reductions drove a 170 basis point improvement in adjusted EBIT. Commercial and residential underlying sales increased 13% and driven by continued strength in North America residential HVAC and home products as well as heat pump demand in Europe. Sales were reduced by about $50 million or 3 points due to supply chain constraints which together with sharply increasing material cost headwinds, which were expected, perhaps a little worse than we expected in August but are expected, drove a 340 basis points decline in adjusted EBIT. 
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Ram to provide color around the price cost and some of the other operational issues that we're dealing with."

Clearly, as you can see, the operating environment is a challenge as commodity inflation, electronic supply, logistics constraints and labor availability continues to impact our global operations. Net material in",715,"Thank you, Frank. Please turn to Slide 10. Clearly, as you can see, the operating environment is a challenge as commodity inflation, electronic supply, logistics constraints and labor availability continues to impact our global operations. Net material inflation headwinds accelerated through fiscal 2021, as you can see on the chart, primarily driven by steel prices with majority of the impact being felt by our Climate Technologies business. North American cold-rolled steel pricing increased once again in October, extending the streak of monthly price increases to 14 months. However, the magnitude of the increases have declined in recent months and more importantly, hot-rolled steel prices dropped around $20 a ton in October, a positive sign for us. 
We do anticipate steel prices to start to flatten out over the next few months and net material inflation to peak in the first half of fiscal '22. We continue to stay focused and diligent on our pricing plans by executing on our contractual material pass-through agreements, surcharges for freight and more aggressive annual general price increases. We remain confident that price/cost will turn green and will be a strong positive for the second half of fiscal '22. 
Our current plans indicate that price cost will be approximately a $100 million tailwind for the fiscal year. Turning to the next slide. On the commodity front, while steel prices are at elevated levels today, as I mentioned earlier, they are showing some signs of flattening providing optimism that we will see North American cold-rolled steel prices start to decline in the coming months. Plastic resin prices have remained elevated due to high price and elastic demand and weather-related supply challenges. Copper prices have also surged as of late, but our hedge positions will dampen the impact to the fiscal year. 
Now while COVID-related restrictions are improving in Southeast Asia, capacity at key electronic suppliers remains constrained. Several key component suppliers have extended lead times and pushed out delivery forecast, which has increased shortages and decommits to our EMS suppliers. Furthermore, we are closely watching the impact of industrial power outages in China, which have become a common occurrence at manufacturers and has led to an increase in silicon prices. For us, electronic shortages are impacting multiple business units in both platforms and supply is expected to remain a challenge into fiscal '22. 
Extended logistics lead times, particularly on Ocean Freight, has had an impact on our global operations. port congestion in the U.S., weather and cobot related disruptions in China being the key drivers. These dynamics are highlighting how critical regionalization is even on lower variation parts and components and the work we have done over the past many years to regionalize are clearly proving the importance of this strategy. This is exemplified by several of our businesses with strong regional supply bases, which have performed very well and avoided expensive airfreight and significant expediting costs. Finally, hiring and retention challenges continue in many of our U.S. plants, predominantly in the Midwest as competition for available labor is intense. High levels of turnover and absenteeism in these locations have impacted productivity and driven increased over time. 
Now on Slide 12. Despite the unprecedented challenges, our supply chain and operations teams have worked tirelessly to continue to meet the needs of our global customers many creative solutions are being implemented on a real-time basis to ensure continuity of material supply to our global plants and availability of freight lines to make our shipment commitments. Our teams have leveraged strong supplier relationships, utilized prequalified alternate sources, leverage contractual agreements and stepped in to assist our suppliers where needed. 
Our regional manufacturing footprint and the enhanced resiliency of our supply network to multi-sourcing that we spent years developing has certainly been an advantage for us in these challenging times. Accelerated actions around hiring and production shifts to plans with stable workforces, as ensured we continue to meet our customers' needs. Many of our global plants are producing at record levels as our disciplined investments in factory automation have allowed us to unlock additional capacity to combat labor availability challenges. 
Finally, I want to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our global teams for delivering an outstanding operational year. With that, I'll turn it over to Lal to walk through our fiscal '22 outlook."
269231,1685041266,2422829,"Emerson Electric Co., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Emerson Electric Co.","Executives","Thanks, Ram. Let's please turn to Slide 14, and I'll give the team some color on the current environment. And looking forward to 2022, demand continues to be strong across both the platforms. The trailing 3-month orders for Automation Solutions were up 20",780,"Thanks, Ram. Let's please turn to Slide 14, and I'll give the team some color on the current environment. And looking forward to 2022, demand continues to be strong across both the platforms. The trailing 3-month orders for Automation Solutions were up 20% versus the prior year, driven, as I said, prior by continued automation investments in discrete and hybrid markets. And we believe that will continue into '22 and of course, the strengthening of the Process automation spend. 
While KOB2 and KOB3 drove most of the orders growth in 2021, the new infrastructure bookings for LNG and decarbonization will improve, I believe, through 2022, providing further upside. Increased site access will drive increased walk down and shutdown turnaround activity in the business. To give you perspective, 2021 walk downs were up 50% year-over-year with more than 5,000 globally with each walk down driving substantial KOB3 pull-through. 
Shutdown turnaround bookings were up -- in '21 10% year-over-year, driven by strong spring season that extended into the early summer. 2022 shutdown turnaround outage activity spend is expected to be up mid-single digits, led by chemicals and refining, leading to high single-digit bookings growth. 
Turning to Commercial & Residential Solutions. The U.S. and Europe order rates continue to be strong heading into 2022, while Asia has begun to moderate. Overall, the trailing 3-month orders were 9% in September. And thinking a little bit further into 2022, many of our key climate technologies end markets will continue to have momentum, including aftermarket refrigeration, commercial HVAC food, retail and foodservice driven by new store builds and quick service restaurants and residential heat pumps. 
Turning to Slide 15. Looking ahead to 2022, it will be a year characterized by strong underlying demand and an improving operating environment. The late cycle process automation business will continue its recovery with mid-single-digit annual growth. Meanwhile, discrete and hybrid momentum will endure with high single-digit and mid-single-digit growth, respectively. Growth will moderate in residential markets as demand stabilizes, but improving commercial and industrial environments will benefit commercial residential solutions. 
In carbonization and sustainability projects, as noted earlier, will provide further growth opportunities as budgets get allocated towards these projects. Based on this macro landscape, we believe we continue to expect demand to be strong in 2022. Supply chain and price/cost headwinds continue through the first half, pressuring first quarter leverage returned to significant tailwinds in the second half and end positive in the year. The team has done a significant amount of work progressing our restructuring programs. 
Emerson's 2021 adjusted EBITDA of 23.1% surpassed our previous record. Over 90% of our restructuring spend communicated in our investor conference is complete. And over 70% of the savings have been realized with remaining longer-term facility projects left to be completed. Great work team. 
Let's turn to Slide 16 and talk about guidance. So given this landscape, we expect underlying sales growth of 6% to 8% in 2022 and net sales growth of 46%. The Underlying sales growth for Automation Solutions will be 6% to 8%, while commercial and residential solutions will be 6% to 9%. As Ron discussed, we expect price/cost to turn into tailwinds for the year of approximately $100 million. $150 million of restructuring activities includes the minimal remaining spend on our cost reset program and additional programs, including footprint activities that have been identified and are planned in the fiscal year. Historically, our adjusted EPS excludes restructuring and other items like first year purchasing accounting in the calculation. 
Looking at the 2021 column of the bridge to the right, our prior adjusted EPS of $4.10 increases to $4.51 when we're moving the impact of intangibles amortization expense of $0.41. For 2022, the amortization expense is expected to be approximately $0.42 in driving us our adjusted EPS to between $4.82 and $4.97. Additional details on the calculation are provided in the appendix as well as accounting tables in the press release. Please note that all guidance does not include the impact of the AspenTech transaction, which is expected to close, as I said earlier, in the second quarter of calendar year 2022. 
Turning to Slide 17. We expect the first quarter 2020 through underlying sales growth of 7% to 9%, with broad underlying strength across Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions. Automation Solutions will experience underlying sales growth in the mid- to high single digits, while Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales growth will be in the high single digits to low double-digit range. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $0.98 and $1.02. Amortization for the quarter is expected to be roughly $0.10. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Colleen Mettler. Thank you."

Very honestly, we're we're in an environment where $100 oil is not uncertain right now and we're seeing some restraints in the U.S. shale and discipline at OPEC and things of that sort. That's going to free up significant capacity, particularly at NOCs and some of the larger integrated companies to move forward on a lot of the programs that will drive the decarbonization initiatives. 
We've seen that already with many flaring type of projects in the United States, and we'll continue to see that with carbon capture and others accelerating. So I'm highly optimistic about that. On the LNG side, there are 2 significant programs that we're pursuing, which will be awarded likely. And towards the second half of the year. One is the Baltic investment and, of course, the Qatar North field expansion being the 2 largest. Those are very significant in terms of capacity additions and investment in automation for us, so both in pursuit. 
Turning to Commercial Residential. Yes, I see the residential air conditioning market moderating as we go through the year and -- but with upheld by the commercial strength in the marketplace, which obviously for us is very relevant.

Having said that, the platform for investment and diversification which has been a core component of the Aspen Board for a long time will continue to be important here.

We're going to be keenly aware of the value proposition to the shareholders and impacts to free cash flow and impacts the value creation as we go through the journey. The end game, of course, is to create a portfolio that's more connected, a portfolio that has an underlying sales potential that is higher and consequently can deliver through cycles double-digit EPS. That's the objective here. And for that, we need to expose the portfolio to more of those markets and between the strong balance sheet of the company. the strong balance sheet that AspenTech will have as well. And the divestiture work on this side, I think we get there over a number of years. But there were meaningful conversations with our Board great debate.

Regarding the restructuring, I'll take a quick stab and then either Ram or Lal can come in. And your question was around continued restructuring spend. So as we go through this, we identify additional opportunities in both businesses. some of it is footprint consolidation. I mean the cost reduction in March is kind of another ending March, and then we identified obviously very significant opportunities that we've executed on for the most part when we talked about driving to previous peak margins. But there's more to do in a complex business. We're continually trying to improve the cost position. And frankly, much of what we do in terms of CapEx and restructuring over the next couple of years will be around capacity expansion for the growth that we expect to see in both businesses. So we may be engaged in some restructuring that's a little bit higher than historical levels, but it's all around continuing improving the cost position and putting in the capacity in the right places."

Please join me on Slide 2. As always, this presentation may include forward-looking statements, which contain a degree of business risk and uncertainty. Please take time to read the safe harbor statement and note on non-GAAP measures. 
As I turn to Slide 3, I would like to highlight 2 areas where Emerson is making a difference. First, Mike Train, our Chief Sustainability Officer, will be attending this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, in Glasgow. Mike will be a panelist at the adjacent Sustainable Innovation Forum, participating in 2 notable discussions. The first discussion will be how to support small to medium enterprises to adopt net zero pathways; and the second, on supporting breakthrough innovation to green, hard-to-abate sectors. Mike has worked this year to drive many greening of, by and with Emerson initiatives.  
One notable greening -- green by example is in the recent announcement between BayoTech and Emerson to accelerate production of (sic) [ and ] distribution of low-cost, low-carbon hydrogen. In the agreement, Emerson will deliver advanced automation technology, software and products in support of BayoTech building hundreds of fully autonomous hydrogen units to enable hydrogen fuel cell commercial trucking fleet and abatement projects in steel and cement.  
Another exciting initiative is our $100 million commitment to corporate venture capital, Emerson Ventures, designed to accelerate innovation by providing insight into cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to solve real customer challenges. The investment commitment will advance the development of disruptive, discrete automation solutions, environmentally sustainable technologies and industrial software in key industries. A formal announcement and more information will be seen in tomorrow's press release.  
Finally, our investor conference historically has been in February. However, due to the recent announcement with AspenTech, we have decided to move our investor conference to May. It will be located at the New York Stock Exchange on May 17, 2022. 
I'd like to now turn the presentation over to Emerson's President and CEO, Lal Karsanbhai, for his opening comments."

2021 was a phenomenal year for Emerson. It developed very differently, obviously, than we planned a year ago. For one, I was named CEO and brought a new value-creation agenda to the table. But equally important, we operated in an environment which was both rewarding and challenging for the organization.  
Through it all, our teams around the world did a fabulous job. I want to express my sincere gratitude to all the Emerson employees around the world. Thank you. I would also like to thank Emerson's Board of Directors and our shareholders for your support and confidence in the management team.  
2021 was characterized by strong demand in our residential air conditioning business as well as our hybrid and discrete markets in automation. Furthermore, we have experienced a recovery in process automation markets. The automation KOB 3 mix for 2021 was up 2 points to 59%. And Emerson's September 3-month trailing orders were plus 16%.  
We grew 5.3% underlying and leverage at 38% operationally, inclusive of a $140 million swing in our price/cost assumptions from November through to the end of the fiscal year. The earnings quality of this company continues to be excellent with free cash flow conversion of 129%. 
The fourth quarter, however, was challenged significantly by supply chain, logistics and labor challenges. And that is not dissimilar from anything you've heard before. This was experienced in the form of material cost inflation, notably steel, electronics and resins, and lead time extensions. In addition, we experienced logistics challenges in availability of lanes and costs. And lastly, U.S. manufacturing labor, which was characterized by higher turnover rates, absenteeism and overtime costs.  
In the quarter, we missed sales by $175 million. And alongside a challenging price/cost environment in our climate business, it resulted in a negative $0.14 impact to EPS for the quarter and a $0.19 impact to 2021 EPS. Having said that, the company grew 7% in the fourth quarter and had 19% operating leverage.  
Turning to '22 and some initial thoughts. 
The first half of the year will not look dissimilar from the fourth quarter with slight sequential improvement as we go to Q2. Price/cost and supply chain challenges unwind in the second half of the year against the backdrop of continued strong demand. The price/cost assumption in the year will be a positive $100 million for 2022.  
I'm very optimistic for 2022. The operating environment has unpredictability, but it is significantly more stable than a year ago and demand is much stronger. The residential A/C cycle will moderate as we go through 2022. However, we expect automation markets to continue to strengthen driven by digital transformation and modernizations, replacement in MRO markets and select LNG and sustainability-driven KOB 1, most notably methane emissions reduction projects and carbon capture.  I have confidence that we will deliver 30% incrementals on our underlying sales in 2022. This addresses execution, and as you know, that's one of the 3 pillars we identified as a management team for accelerated value creation. 
We have equally taken significant steps in our journey to modernize our culture and advance ESG initiatives. The Board named Jim Turley as the company's Independent Chair of the Board, we named Mike Train as the company's first Chief Sustainability Officer, and we hired Elizabeth Adefioye as Emerson's first Chief People Officer. 
I'm very proud of the diversity targets we set for the enterprise, the changes to our long-term compensation and annual bonus structure to include ESG measures and the commitments we have made to accelerate greenhouse gas intensity reductions.  
Lastly, turning to the portfolio. Please turn to Slide 4. 
We recently concluded a comprehensive portfolio review, which culminated in a 2-day session with our Board of Directors in early October. We left the meeting with a defined portfolio road map and pathways. The key elements were as follows. 
Firstly, in terms of the portfolio today and how we are thinking about it. Diversification is critical. We will continue to divest upstream oil and gas hardware assets. Secondly, we will action low-growth or commoditized businesses. And lastly, we will action disconnected assets. All 3 of these actions will take place over time with intentionality, with patience and a keen awareness of cycles and meeting the value-creation proposition to our shareholders.  
Secondly, we identified 4 large, profitable, high-growth end markets, each with at least $20 billion of size and projected to grow higher than 4% a year into the future supported by macros. The 4 end markets will be the hunting ground for our M&A activity. 
Lastly, we defined 2 possible end states for the portfolio and the journey that we'll embark up and have embarked on.  
One of the 4 markets is industrial software, a $60 billion segment that we identified growing at 9%. The AspenTech transaction is an exciting step for Emerson and a very important transformational step for this corporation. AspenTech is one of the best-run industrial software companies in the space with highly differentiated technology and a phenomenal leadership team led by Antonio Pietri for who I have the greatest personal admiration.  
The AspenTech company will be a highly diversified business with transmission and distribution as its largest served market and is uniquely positioned to enable our energy customers to transition to a lower-carbon future. I'm optimistic of the synergy opportunities that exist and believe the new AspenTech, which will be 55% owned by Emerson shareholders, will be a differentiated platform for future industrial software M&A. I'm very excited about this, as I hope you can tell. We expect to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2022 following the completion and approval of the customary regulatory items. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Frank Dellaquila, Emerson's Chief Financial Officer."

So we're really pleased with the financial results for fiscal 2021. As Lal said, we ended the year with a great deal of uncertainty and far exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. 
The underlying demand environment developed much as we thought it would. There was continued strength in global discrete and hybrid automation markets, and the North America process markets began to gain momentum later in the year. The global demand in our commercial/residential markets was strong and broad based, particularly in the U.S. residential air conditioning market, and it far exceeded the expectations that we had going into the year. 
Our operations team successfully worked through labor and supply chain issues, particularly toward the end of the year, and delivered strong results that we're able to report to you today. Toward the end of the year, the intensifying combination of rising material costs, supply chain challenges and labor constraints in the U.S. did begin to weigh on sales volume and profitability. We've worked through that in the fourth quarter. We will continue to work through that in the first half of fiscal '22.  
Despite these fourth quarter challenges, we're pleased to report that we achieved the key financial targets that we committed to you in August regarding underlying growth, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow, and you can see all of that in the table. This was achieved in the face of an unexpected increase in key raw materials, mainly steel and copper, that resulted in an unfavorable price/cost swing of $140 million during the year versus the expectation and the guidance that we gave you a year ago. We're very grateful for the extraordinary effort of our operations teams at every level and the manufacturing employees who made this happen under some of the most challenging conditions that we have seen.  
Please turn to Slide 7. This slide highlights our strong 2021 results. 
The continued recovery in our end markets drove strong full year underlying growth of more than 5%. Net sales were up 9% year-over-year, including a 1 point impact from acquisitions, mainly OSI, which closed at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Adjusted segment EBIT benefited from strong leverage in operations, 38%, as Lal just mentioned, and adjusted EBIT from underlying volume and the benefit of cost reset actions that were begun 2 years ago.  
These cost reductions more than offset price/cost headwinds, which, as I said, were $140 million versus our expectation at the beginning of the year, and the supplies chain challenges that raised costs and reduced availability. 
Cash flow was robust, up 18% year-over-year attributable to the strong earnings growth and working capital efficiency. Free cash flow conversion of net earnings was 129%.  
Adjusted earnings per share was $4.10, exceeding our guide by $0.03 at the midpoint and up 19% for the year. Automation Solutions grew -- underlying growth was flat year-over-year. Growth turned positive in the second half driven by strong discrete and hybrid markets, while the later-cycle process automation markets delivered sequential improvement as we moved through the year. 
Adjusted EBIT increased 230 basis points due to the strong leverage driven by cost reset benefits.  Commercial & Residential saw exceptional growth, up 6% underlying year-over-year due to broad strength across the residential and commercial markets with mid-teens growth in all world areas. 
Adjusted EBIT increased 20 basis points versus prior year. Price/cost headwinds worsened in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter, as we anticipated on the call in August, but were offset for the full year by strong underlying leverage and spending restraints.  
Please turn to Slide 8. 
Operational performance was strong throughout the year, adding $0.59 to adjusted EPS, overcoming a $0.19 headwind from supply chain and $90 million of unfavorable price/cost. Operations leveraged at more than 35% on volume and cost actions. Nonoperating items contributed $0.02 in that, overcoming a significant headwind from the stock comp mark-to-market accounting. Share repurchase totaled $500 million, as we guided, and added about $0.03. In total, adjusted EPS was $4.10, as I said, an increase of 19%.  
Please turn to Slide 9. 
Regarding the fourth quarter, strong end market demand drove underlying growth of 7% with net sales up 9%. This growth was achieved despite a $175 million impact from supply chain, logistics and labor constraints that affected both platforms in somewhat different ways. 
Adjusted segment EBIT dropped 10 basis points, reflecting a 200 basis point impact from supply chain volume constraints across the company and from the increasingly negative price/cost headwind in commercial/residential.  
Free cash flow declined 39% mainly due to higher working capital to support the growth versus the prior year. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $1.21, exceeding the guidance midpoint by $0.03 and up 10% and versus the prior year. 
Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 3% with strong recovery in the Americas, particularly in the power generation and chemical markets, partially offset by declines in other world areas. Sales were reduced by about $125 million or 4 points due to supply chain constraints. Our backlog was up 16% year-to-date and now sits at $5.4 billion, $100 million less than at the end of the third quarter.  Typically, our backlog would reduce more in Q4. However, due to strong orders and supply chain constraints, backlog remains elevated above the levels we would otherwise have expected. Strong leverage and cost reductions drove a 170 basis point improvement in adjusted EBIT. 
Commercial & Residential underlying sales increased 13% and driven by continued strength in North America residential HVAC and home products as well as heat pump demand in Europe. Sales were reduced by about $50 million or 3 points due to supply chain constraints, which, together with sharply increasing material cost headwinds, which were expected, perhaps a little worse than we expected in August but are expected, drove a 340 basis points decline in adjusted EBIT.  
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Ram to provide color around the price/cost and some of the other operational issues that we're dealing with."

Clearly, as you can see, the operating environment is a challenge as commodity inflation, electronic supply, logistics constraints and labor availability continues to impact our global operations. Net material",710,"Thank you, Frank. Please turn to Slide 10. 
Clearly, as you can see, the operating environment is a challenge as commodity inflation, electronic supply, logistics constraints and labor availability continues to impact our global operations. Net material inflation headwinds accelerated through fiscal 2021, as you can see on the chart, primarily driven by steel prices, with majority of the impact being felt by our Climate Technologies business. 
North American cold-rolled steel pricing increased once again in October, extending the streak of monthly price increases to 14 months. However, the magnitude of the increases have declined in recent months, and more importantly, hot-rolled steel prices dropped around $20 a ton in October, a positive sign for us. We do anticipate steel prices to start to flatten out over the next few months and net material inflation to peak in the first half of fiscal '22. 
We continue to stay focused and diligent on our pricing plans by executing on our contractual material pass-through agreements, surcharges for freight and more aggressive annual general price increases. We remain confident that price/cost will turn green and will be a strong positive for the second half of fiscal '22. Our current plans indicate that price/cost will be approximately a $100 million tailwind for the fiscal year. 
Turning to the next slide. On the commodity front, while steel prices are at elevated levels today, as I mentioned earlier, they are showing some signs of flattening, providing optimism that we will see North American cold-rolled steel prices start to decline in the coming months. Plastic resin prices have remained elevated due to high price, inelastic demand and weather-related supply challenges. Copper prices have also surged as of late, but our hedge positions will dampen the impact to the fiscal year.  
Now while COVID-related restrictions are improving in Southeast Asia, capacity at key electronic suppliers remains constrained. Several key component suppliers have extended lead times and pushed out delivery forecasts, which has increased shortages and decommits to our EMS suppliers. Furthermore, we are closely watching the impact of industrial power outages in China, which have become a common occurrence at manufacturers and has led to an increase in silicon prices. For us, electronic shortages are impacting multiple business units in both platforms, and supply is expected to remain a challenge into fiscal '22.  
Extended logistics lead times, particularly on ocean freight, has had an impact on our global operations, port congestion in the U.S., weather and COVID-related disruptions in China being the key drivers. These dynamics are highlighting how critical regionalization is even on lower-variation parts and components, and the work we have done over the past many years to regionalize are clearly proving the importance of this strategy. This is exemplified by several of our businesses with strong regional supply bases which have performed very well and avoided expensive airfreight and significant expediting costs.  
Finally, hiring and retention challenges continue in many of our U.S. plants, predominantly in the Midwest, as competition for available labor is intense. High levels of turnover and absenteeism in these locations have impacted productivity and driven increased overtime.  
Now on Slide 12, despite the unprecedented challenges, our supply chain and operations teams have worked tirelessly to continue to meet the needs of our global customers. Many creative solutions are being implemented on a real-time basis to ensure continuity of materials supply to our global plants and availability of freight lines to make our shipment commitments. Our teams have leveraged strong supplier relationships, utilized prequalified alternate sources, leveraged contractual agreements and stepped in to assist our suppliers where needed.  
Our regional manufacturing footprint and the enhanced resiliency of our supply network through multi-sourcing that we spent years developing has certainly been an advantage for us in these challenging times. Accelerated actions around hiring and production shifts to plants with stable workforces has ensured we continue to meet our customers' needs. Many of our global plants are producing at record levels as our disciplined investments in factory automation have allowed us to unlock additional capacity to combat labor availability challenges.  
Finally, I want to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our global teams for delivering an outstanding operational year. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Lal to walk through our fiscal '22 outlook."

Let's please turn to Slide 14, and I'll give the team some color on the current environment. And looking forward to 2022, demand continues to be strong across both of the platforms. The trailing 3-month orders for Automation Solutions were",788,"Thanks, Ram. Let's please turn to Slide 14, and I'll give the team some color on the current environment. 
And looking forward to 2022, demand continues to be strong across both of the platforms. The trailing 3-month orders for Automation Solutions were up 20% versus the prior year driven, as I said prior, by continued automation investments in discrete and hybrid markets, and we believe that will continue into '22, and, of course, the strengthening of the process automation spend. While KOB 2 and KOB 3 drove most of the orders growth in 2021, the new infrastructure bookings for LNG and decarbonization will improve, I believe, through 2022, providing further upside. 
Increased site access will drive increased walkdown and shutdown turnaround activity in the business. To give you perspective, 2021 walkdowns were up 50% year-over-year with more than 5,000 globally, with each walkdown driving substantial KOB 3 pull-through.  
Shutdown turnaround bookings were up -- for -- in '21 10% year-over-year driven by strong spring season that extended into the early summer. 2022 shutdown turnaround outage activity spend is expected to be up mid-single digits, led by chemicals and refining, leading to high single-digit bookings growth.  
Turning to Commercial & Residential Solutions. The U.S. and Europe order rates continue to be strong heading into 2022, while Asia has begun to moderate. Overall, the trailing 3-month orders were 9% in September. And thinking a little bit further into 2022, many of our key climate technologies end markets will continue to have momentum, including aftermarket refrigeration, commercial HVAC, food retail and foodservice driven by new store builds and quick service restaurants and residential heat pumps.  
Turning to Slide 15. 
Looking ahead to 2022, it will be a year characterized by strong underlying demand and an improving operating environment. The late-cycle process automation business will continue its recovery with mid-single-digit annual growth. Meanwhile, discrete and hybrid momentum will endure with high single-digit and mid-single-digit growth, respectively. Growth will moderate in residential markets as demand stabilizes, but improving commercial and industrial environments will benefit Commercial & Residential Solutions. Decarbonization and sustainability projects, as noted earlier, will provide further growth opportunities as budgets get allocated towards these projects. 
Based on this macro landscape, we believe -- we continue to expect demand to be strong in 2022. Supply chain and price/cost headwinds continue through the first half, pressuring first quarter leverage but turn to significant tailwinds in the second half and end positive in the year. 
The team has done a significant amount of work progressing our restructuring programs. Emerson's 2021 adjusted EBITDA of 23.1% surpassed our previous record. Over 90% of our restructuring spend communicated in our investor conference is complete, and over 70% of the savings have been realized with remaining longer-term facility projects left to be completed. Great work as a team.  
Let's turn to Slide 16 and talk about guidance. 
So given this landscape, we expect underlying sales growth of 6% to 8% in 2022 and net sales growth of 4% to 6%. Underlying sales growth for Automation Solutions will be 6% to 8%, while Commercial & Residential Solutions will be 6% to 9%. As Ram discussed, we expect price/cost to turn into tailwind for the year of approximately $100 million. 
$150 million of restructuring activities includes the minimal remaining spend on our cost reset program and additional programs, including footprint activities, that have been identified and are planned in the fiscal year. Historically, our adjusted EPS excludes restructuring and other items like first year purchasing accounting in the calculation.  
Looking at the 2021 column of the bridge to the right, our prior adjusted EPS of $4.10 increases to $4.51 when removing the impact of intangibles amortization expense of $0.41. For 2022, the amortization expense is expected to be approximately $0.42 driven by -- driving, excuse me, our adjusted EPS to between $4.82 and $4.97. Additional details on the calculation are provided in the appendix as well as accounting tables in the press release. 
Please note that all guidance does not include the impact of the AspenTech transaction, which is expected to close, as I said earlier, in the second quarter of calendar year 2022.  
Turning to Slide 17. 
We expect a first quarter 2022 underlying sales growth of 7% to 9% with broad underlying strength across Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions. Automation Solutions will experience underlying sales growth in the mid to high single digits, while Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales growth will be in the high single digits to low double-digit range. 
Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $0.98 and $1.02. Amortization for the quarter is expected to be roughly $0.10.  
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Colleen Mettler. Thank you."

Very honestly, we're in an environment where $100 oil is not uncertain right now, and we're seeing some restraints in the U.S. shale and discipline at OPEC and things of that sort. That's going to free up significant capacity, particularly at NOCs and some of the larger integrated companies, to move forward on a lot of the programs that will drive the decarbonization initiatives. We've seen that already with many flaring type of projects in the United States, and we'll continue to see that with carbon capture and others accelerating. So I'm highly optimistic about that. 
On the LNG side, there are 2 significant programs that we're pursuing which will be awarded likely, Andy, towards the second half of the year. One is the Baltic LNG investment and, of course, the Qatar North Field expansion being the 2 largest. Those are very significant in terms of capacity additions and investment in automation for us. So both in pursuit.  
Turning to commercial/residential. Yes, I see the residential air conditioning market moderating as we go through the year, and -- but with -- upheld by the commercial strength in the marketplace, which obviously for us is very relevant.

No, I think we're going to play this out, as I had mentioned earlier, over time.

We're going to be keenly aware of the value proposition to the shareholders and impacts to free cash flow and impacts to value creation as we go through the journey. 
The end game, of course, is to create a portfolio that's more connected, a portfolio that has an underlying sales potential that is higher and consequently can deliver, through cycles, double-digit EPS. That's the objective here. And so for that, we need to expose the portfolio to more of those markets. 
And between the strong balance sheet of the company, the strong balance sheet that AspenTech will have as well and the divestiture work on this side, I think we can -- we get there over a number of years. But there were meaningful conversations with our Board. There were great debates. Obviously, this was a body of work over a number of months, almost 4 months, that our partners did alongside management. And -- but we have pathways now and optionality.

The price/cost, given the way it has rolled and will roll through, very lumpy, very distortive within the quarters, so we're just very focused on getting to that goal for the year, delivering up margins and -- for the enterprise and delivering the operating leverage. 
Regarding the restructuring, I'll take a quick stab and then either Ram or Lal can come in. And your question was around continued restructuring spend. 
So as we go through this, we identify additional opportunities in both businesses. some of it is footprint consolidation. I mean the cost reduction in March -- it was kind of a never-ending March. We identified obviously very significant opportunities that we've executed on for the most part when we talked about driving to previous peak margins. But there's more to do in a complex business. We're continually trying to improve the cost position. 
And frankly, much of what we do in terms of CapEx and restructuring over the next couple of years will be around capacity expansion for the growth that we expect to see in both businesses. So we may be engaged in some restructuring that's a little bit higher than our historical levels. But it's all around continuing -- improving the cost position and putting in the capacity in the right places."
