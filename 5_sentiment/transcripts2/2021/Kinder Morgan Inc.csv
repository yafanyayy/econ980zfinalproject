Before we begin, as usual, I'd like to remind you that KMI's earnings release today and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release, as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking statements. 
Before turning the call over to Steve and the rest of the team, I'll just make a short statement before -- because we now have actual results for the full year 2020 and have released our preliminary outlook for 2021, this is a good time in my judgment to examine both our current results and future outlook at Kenya Morgan. It seems to me that the clear takeaway is the strength of the cash flow, which allows us in both years to fund our dividend and all discretionary CapEx from internally generated funds and still have significant cash left to pay down debt and buy back shares. This remains at the core of our financial strategy and should be comforting to our shareholder base, as it demonstrates our ability to return value to our shareholders even under adverse conditions like we experienced in 2020. 
I would make 2 additional important points. Number one, there is a long runway for the products we move through our pipelines, particularly natural gas. And as the world transitions to a future of lower emissions, my second point is that our assets are well positioned to participate in that transition. We'll discuss all these subjects in detail at our upcoming virtual investor conference on January 27, and I look forward to your participation. Steve?"

So I'll give you a brief look back on what we accomplished in 2020, a look ahead on 2021 and beyond, which, as Rich said, we'll cover in greater detail at our annual Investor Day next week. Then I'll turn it over to our President, Kim Dang,",1308,"Thanks, Rich. So I'll give you a brief look back on what we accomplished in 2020, a look ahead on 2021 and beyond, which, as Rich said, we'll cover in greater detail at our annual Investor Day next week. Then I'll turn it over to our President, Kim Dang, to cover the business updates. Our CFO, David Michaels, as usual, will take you through the financials, and then we'll take your questions. 
2020 has shown us how important it is to have our priorities and principles straight. We kept our focus throughout the year on keeping our coworkers safe and on keeping our essential assets running for the people, businesses and communities that depend on us. 
Like everyone in our sector, we didn't shut down. We kept running, adjusting our operating procedures on the fly to keep people safe while we helped utilities and factories and other businesses keep running and serving our communities during the pandemic. The pandemic and the downturn in U.S. energy markets impacted us for sure, but we were still able to maintain our financial principles, which remain the same: First, maintaining a strong balance sheet, we managed to reduce net debt by almost another $1 billion, taking our overall net debt reduction over the last 5 years to well over $10 billion -- $10.8 billion since Q1 of 2015 and achieving and maintaining our BBB flat credit rating; second, we maintained our capital discipline through our return criteria, a good track record of execution and by self-funding our investments. 
On that front, we evaluated all of our 2020 expansion capital projects and have reduced CapEx by about $700 million from our 2020 budget for about 30% in response to the changing conditions in our markets, while still completing our largest project, the Permian Highway Pipeline, in the face of substantial opposition and in the middle of the global pandemic. 
We're also maintaining our cost discipline. We achieved about $190 million of expense and sustaining capital savings for 2020. That includes deferrals, we view about $119 million or so as permanent reductions for the year. The result of this work on our capital budget and our costs is that our DCF, less discretionary capital spend, has actually improved versus our plan. And when compared to 2019 as well, about $200 million better versus our plan and about $665 million better than 2019, notwithstanding what was going on in U.S. energy. 
So we more than offset the degradation to our DCF with spending and capital investment cuts in 2020. And the following is noteworthy too, I think. Our DCF less discretionary capital was $2.2 billion in 2019. It grew to $2.9 billion in 2020 and is $3.65 billion in our budget for 2021. Finally, we're returning value to shareholders with a 5% year-over-year dividend increase to $1.05 annualized for 2020, providing an increase to well-covered dividend that the Board plans to raise to $1.08 declared in 2021 and as contemplated in our approved 2021 budget. 
So a strong balance sheet, capital and cost discipline, returning value to our shareholders, those are the principles we continue to operate by. So in addition to completing the Permian Highway Pipeline, we also achieved some other milestones, which we believe are going to lead to long-term distinction. We're already an efficient operator, but we're getting more efficient and cost effective, as I mentioned. We believe that's one of the keys to success in our business for the long term. 
During 2020, we completed a full review of how we're organized and how we operate. We centralized certain functions in order to be more efficient and effective, and we made appropriate changes to how we manage and how we're staffed. And we are achieving, as a result, substantial savings as we described in our guidance release in December and which we'll also cover next week. 
We're also building what we believe is a more effective organization for the future. The centralization of certain functions will enable us to spread our best practices throughout the organization, in project management and permitting, safety, pipeline integrity, ESG and other core functions. 
We also published our third ESG report during the fourth quarter. We've incorporated ESG reporting and risk management into our existing management processes. Sustainalytics has ranked us #1 in our sector for how we manage ESG risk. And our updated MSCI rating also improved dramatically. These things are all important to our long-term success: Being a responsible, effective and efficient operator with the ability to complete large projects under extremely difficult circumstances. That we were able to do all of this during a pandemic and a difficult U.S. energy market backdrop is a testament to the strength and resilience of our people, our leaders and our culture. 
All this positions us well for the future, and we'll be talking about this in more detail at the conference, but here are a few thoughts on what the opportunities look like. First, there are the things that we're already doing that are likely to grow as time goes on. First on that list is our largest business, natural gas, which will continue to be needed to serve domestic needs and export facilities for a long time to come, and it will continue to reduce GHG emissions as we expand its use around the country and the globe. 
Related to that is the enabling role that our natural gas assets play in supporting intermittent renewable resources in the generation stack. Most important to us is the value of what we do, which is less about providing the commodity and more about providing the transportation and storage capacity or deliverability, that value increases as more intermittent resources are relied on for power generation. 
Natural gas is clean, affordable and reliable. And pipelines deliver that commodity by the safest, most efficient, most environmentally sound means. Also, we're making our low methane emissions performance part of our marketing as responsibly produced and transported natural gas. That's a very good synergy between our ESG performance, which is in part about lowering methane emissions; and our commercial opportunities, distinguishing ourselves as an environmentally responsible provider. This is important, for example, not only to our domestic customers, but to our customers serving international markets. 
Also, among the energy transition businesses that we participate in today is the storage, handling and blending of liquid renewable transportation fuels in our products pipelines and terminals segments. We've handled ethanol and biodiesel for a long time. Today, we're handling about 240,000 barrels a day of a 900,000 barrels a day ethanol market, for example. We also handle renewable diesel today. That's part of our business -- that is a part of our business that is ripe for expansion on attractive returns. 
Moving out the next concentric circle of opportunities is a set of things that we can largely use our existing assets and expertise to accomplish. Those include things like blending hydrogen in our existing natural gas network and transporting and sequestering CO2. A further step out would be businesses that we might participate in if the returns are attractive, such as hydrogen production, renewable diesel production and carbon capture from industrial and power plant sources. As always, we will be disciplined investing when returns are attractive in operations that we are confident we can build and manage safely, reliably and efficiently. We will not be chasing press releases. 
Energy transitions for a variety of reasons take a very long time. We'll look hard as we leave. You'll hear more details from Kim and the business unit presidents about all this at next week [Audio Gap] cost operations that are safe and environmentally sound and the ability to get things done in difficult circumstances. We'll probably [Audio Gap] we'll evolve to meet the challenges and opportunities. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."
34952431,701073806,2176999,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 20, 2021",2021-01-20,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Steve. I'm going to go through our business units today. First, starting with natural gas. Transport volumes were down 2% or approximately 600,000 dekatherms per day versus the fourth quarter of 2019.

Transport volumes were down 2% or approximately 600,000 dekatherms per day versus the fourth quarter of 2019. That was driven primarily by declines in Rockies' production and increases in transportation alternatives out of the Permian Basin. These declines were partially offset by higher volume, driven by increased demand for LNG exports and industrial customers. 
Our physical deliveries to LNG facilities off of our pipes averaged almost 5 million dekatherms per day. That's a 50% increase versus the fourth quarter 2019 and that's a big increase versus the third quarter of this year, and it's above Q1 2020, which was largely unaffected by the pandemic. For 2020, Kinder Morgan pipes moved well over 40% of the volumes to LNG export facilities. 
Exports to Mexico were up about 4% when you compare it to the fourth quarter of 2019. For 2020, our share of Mexico deliveries ran over 55%. Overall deliveries to power plants were down about 2%. 
Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 20% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. For gathering volumes, I think the more informative comparison is versus the immediately prior quarter for the third quarter of 2020. When compared to the third quarter of 2020, volumes were down about 3%. KinderHawk, which serves the Haynesville, was down due to lack of drilling and declines in existing wells. However, we're still expecting based on our conversations with producers to see new drilling in that basin this year. 
Eagle Ford volumes were also down. The bright spot again this quarter was our Highland system in the Bakken. Volumes there were up well over 20% versus the third quarter of this year. 
On the project side, as Steve said, we completed PHP. We placed that into service on January 1 this year, which is a really amazing accomplishment by our team. We fought through multiple legal attempts to delay or stop the pipeline, including 1 request for a temporary restraining order; and 3 preliminary injunction request. Permits took longer than they have historically, and therefore we received a key permit approximately 4.5 months later than what we anticipated. 
Yet despite the legal, the permit and the other challenges we faced, the pipe -- we put the pipeline in service just 3 months later than our original schedule. 
In our products pipeline segment, refined products volumes were down about 13% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of the continued pandemic impact. The 13% is very close to the fourth quarter EIA number. 
Our gasoline volumes were off about 10%. Jet volumes remained weak of 47%. The diesel was up about 7%. Looking at the most recent data, volumes in December were down about 17% versus December of 2019. That's not surprising given the rise in COVID cases. So right now, our projected January volumes are currently estimated to be down about 13% versus January of 2020. Next week in the investor conference, we'll take you through all of our 2020 budget assumptions and detail, including our refined product volume assumptions. 
Crude and condensate volumes were down about 26% in the quarter versus 2019 and down about 6% over the third quarter. The one bright spot, similar to what we saw in natural gas gathering, was in the Bakken, where a gathering -- crude gathering volumes were up slightly. 
In terminals, refined product volume throughput continued to reflect reduced demand due to the pandemic, but they've recovered since the second half of this year. The impact of throughput volumes on this segment is mitigated by our fixed take-or-pay contracts for tank capacity. Our liquids utilization percentage, which reflects the percent of tanks we have under contract, remains high at 95%. If you exclude the tanks out of service for required inspection, utilization is 98%. 
Given the pandemic, we did see some weakness in our Jones Act tanker business, but that was offset by incremental earnings from expansion projects. The bulk side of the business, which accounts for roughly 20% of the terminals earnings, saw a strong rebound in steel volumes. Industry-wide mill utilization improved to over 70% from the lows of 50% in the second quarter. 
In CO2, oil production was down approximately 16%, and CO2 sales volumes were down about 35%. Our team has done a tremendous job here of adjusting to the current environment, finding cost savings and cutting noneconomic CapEx, that more than offset the degradation in segment performance. As a result, full year 2020 DCF, less CapEx for the segment of $466 million, was over $100 million better than in 2019 and over $40 million better than budget. 
The last thing I'll point out for you is that for the full year, we were only off $10 million versus the DCF guidance that we gave you in April when the pandemic began. There were lots of puts and takes for sure, and EBITDA was slightly weaker, but amazingly close overall. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to David Michels."

So for the fourth quarter of 2020, we're declaring a dividend of $0.2625 per share, or $1.05 annualized, which is flat with last quarter and 5% up from the fourth quarter of 2019.

So for the fourth quarter of 2020, we're declaring a dividend of $0.2625 per share, or $1.05 annualized, which is flat with last quarter and 5% up from the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Moving on to the fourth quarter 2020 performance versus the fourth quarter 2019, in the fourth quarter of 2019 there were a few items that were categorized as certain items: The certain items captured in gain/loss on divestitures and impairments; earnings loss from equity investments and higher income expenses, all nearly offset within the fourth quarter of 2019. That leaves us with $237 million of lower revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus the fourth quarter of 2019, offset by lower O&M expenses, lower depreciation expense and lower interest expense, which explains why net income attributable to KMI of $607 million is about flat with Q4 2019. 
Our adjusted earnings of $604 million is 3% -- is about flat with Q4 2019. And our adjusted earnings per share of $0.27 for the quarter was up $0.01 for -- from the prior year. 
Moving on to DCF. Natural gas was down $59 million for the quarter. Lower contributions were driven by the sale of our Cochin pipeline, along with lower contributions from multiple gathering and processing assets. And those were partially offset by greater contributions from our Texas Intrastate systems as well as expansion project contributions. The products segment was down $64 million, driven by lower refined product volumes and lower crude and condensate volumes driven mainly due to the continued demand impacts from the pandemic. 
The terminal segment was down $32 million, which was driven by the sale of KML, lower refined products and lower contributions from our Jones Act vessels, contributions from expansion projects placed in service partially offset those items. 
Our CO2 segment was down $18 million, and that was due to lower oil and CO2 sales volumes, partially offset by lower operating costs and improved year-over-year realized pricing. That brings us to adjusted EBITDA of $183 million or 9% lower than Q4 2019. Below EBITDA, interest expense was $63 million favorable, which was driven by lower floating rate -- excuse me, by a lower floating rate benefiting our interest rate swaps, as well as lower overall debt balance and lower rates on our long-term debt. 
Sustaining capital was a favorable $30 million, driven largely by deferrals in the terminals segment. The other item includes increased cash pension contributions in the Q4 2020 versus Q4 of last year of 2019. Total DCF of $1.25 billion is down $104 million or 8%. DCF per share of $0.55 was down $0.04 from last year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with a 4.6x debt-to-EBITDA level, which is the same as last quarter and up from 4.3 as of year-end 2019. We ended the year with $1.2 billion of cash on hand, which will allow us to easily manage our maturing debt during the year -- or this year. We've already used some of that cash to repay $750 million of debt maturing in the first quarter, so that leaves us with just $1.65 billion of debt maturing for the rest of the year. So we have very strong liquidity, we have an undrawn $4 billion credit facility and we also expect to generate $1.2 billion of DCF after CapEx and dividends in 2021. 
Our net debt ended the quarter and ended the year at $32.0 billion, which is down [ $900 million  ]and almost $90 million from year-end and down $556 million from last quarter. And as Steve mentioned, our net debt is now down $10.8 billion since the first quarter of 2015. 
To reconcile the quarterly change in net debt, we had $1.25 billion of DCF. We paid dividends of $600 million. We contributed or paid -- our contributed JV contributions to growth capital of $250 million. We received proceeds from asset sales of $200 million, and we had a working capital use of $50 million in the quarter, which explains the majority of that $556 million change in net debt. 
From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, we generated DCF of $4.597 billion. We had the Pembina share sale in Q1 of $900 million. We had the $200 million of asset sales, paid dividends of $2.37 billion. We had growth capital on JV contributions of $1.65 billion. We had taxes on the Trans Mountain sale and Pembina shares of $260 million. We repurchased $50 million of KMI shares, and we had a working capital use of $385 million for the year, which explains the majority of the $989 million reduction in net debt for the year. 
And that completes the financial quarterly review. Back to you, Steve."

And you've laid out some pieces for kind of dividend growth expectations. But just wondering, capital allocation philosophy overall, if you could refresh us on how you're thinking about that when it comes to dividend increases versus buybacks? 
And also it seems like the market's continually looking for lower leverage here, so that the multiple can be attributed more to the equity side than the debt side. So just wondering how those different things work together. And the industry still seems ripe for consolidation, so wondering if you could refresh us on that."

Yes, sure. I mean, I think we covered here, we've done a lot of work on the balance sheet, have ourselves in what we believe is a very good position with a BBB flat rating, with all the net debt reduction that we've done over the years, including this year. And we feel like we're in a very good place there. And as we've examined that, and applying additional debt reduction to achieve an upgrade or whatever, we don't really see much of a cost of capital benefit for our equity investors resulting from that. So we do think we're in a very good place there. 
And so that gives us the opportunity to then think about expansion capital projects. We exhaust a good returning, high returning, nice margin above our weighted average cost of capital on those returns. Those opportunities are less than they were in years past. And so we're funding the ones that make sense to fund. And that leaves us with a substantial amount of cash available after that. 
And so we've increased the dividend from $1 to $1.05 and now $1.08 expectation for 2021, and leaving room for as much as $450 million in share repurchases. So I think we've done the right things by the balance sheet. We're funding the things that add the value to the firm in terms of additional projects where those make sense. We're not stretching that. If they don't make sense, we're not doing them. 
And then we don't sit on the cash that we have. We look for ways to return that to our shareholders. And as you know, I mean the valuation between those 2, dividend versus share buybacks, the dividend, there's a good, reliable return of value to shareholders in that. There's not as much flexibility on it. So we've opted to have some flexibility to do share buybacks. And that's how we've laid it out. 
In terms of the consolidation opportunities, our answer is pretty much the same there. We continue to look at those opportunities. The industry has been ripe for consolidation for years, one might say. Not sure what the catalyzing event turns out to be there, but it's something that we look at and evaluate. It's got to meet a number of criteria. 
It has to deliver real value to our investors, of course, has to be in businesses that we're confident that we can run safely, reliably and efficiently. Of course, it has to be accretive, and it also can't mess up our balance sheet, which as we've looked at it, we've got to at least be leverage-neutral, and if anything, maybe leverage accretive. And so our discipline there continues to be very robust."

So I will -- there's a lot of diversity, as you know, Jeremy, and how people are evaluating this. I think the ratings show that we are doing an effective job of communicating our ESG measures and managing our ESG risk. Our rating is based on how we're managing ESG risk. It's not based on having a really great ESG report. It's about how we manage that risk. 
I think a lot of people recognized the need for natural gas and the value that natural gas has brought to the environment over the years. If you look back in 2017, we were 6 gigatons of annual emissions, CO2 equivalent emissions. We're now down to 5.1. And a big part of that -- and in an economy that's grown over that period, a big part of that has been the role that natural gas has played in power generation. And so yes, there are people who recognize the role of natural gas, and also how we're doing with our ESG risk management. And we are in ESG funds as a result of that. 
Now that's not a universally held view, but it is something that we're proud of and that we continue to elaborate on with investors and continue to respond to questions and concerns as they are raised by the investment community. 
You make a very good -- or you asked a very good question about scope 3 emissions. One of the real advantages, and it's an extremely stubborn advantage of hydrocarbons, is that it's a very energy-dense form of energy. And so that means that with a relatively small footprint and a relatively small amount of capital, you can get an awful lot of energy for -- from the power plant, for example, a natural gas power plant. And it takes acres and acres and acres of solar panels and windmills to make that up. And because of the lack of energy density, an awful lot of manufacturing: A lot of mining, a lot of manufacturing a lot of disposal costs associated with building that up. 
And so once we get to a point, a point that we're not at just yet, but once we get to a point, I think where the public discourse around ESG expands to include those measurements on renewables, it brings natural gas much closer in terms of environmental impact. 
Look, we work with renewable companies. We work with utilities who are increasing their renewable portfolios. We believe that our business plays an important enabling role there. But there is a lot more to, I would say, the natural gas story, once you take everything into account."

But just curious about sort of the trends at the end of December with early January, how are you tracking thus far? Is it kind of in line with what you expected or cautiously optimistic? Just any commentary around that would be helpful."

I noted that the volumes in January are down 13% versus January of 2020. I think that's a slightly weaker -- or slightly weaker than what we planned. Our hope is that once you get the vaccine, distributed that some of those volumes will come back. When you look at how much volumes are off comparing 1 month versus the month in the prior year, you go back to October and November, we were down like, I think, in October, it was like 11%, maybe. And so hopefully, once we get the vaccine distributed more widely, we'll see some improvement in those numbers, but slightly weaker than what we budgeted, but very early. 
On the other hand, I'd say on the other hand, there are some green shoots. The -- on CO2 with the stronger oil prices, there's a little bit of upside on price. If those prices were to hold, volumes that [ BlackRock ] have been pretty strong and stable over the last couple of months. We've seen a small amount of incremental CO2 sales volumes versus what we're expecting. So there are a number of puts and takes there [indiscernible]"

But beyond that, we're not saying much more than opportunistic, meaning we're not programmatic, and we're not specifying a target for the market out there. But we've got the capacity.

I think we finished the fourth quarter a little bit better than we were thinking. The year is off to a good start. 
The Eagle Ford has still been weak. If you look at the Permian, the rig count there, that's where most of the rigs have been added since we came off the lows in August. And by our calculations, you're getting close to a rig level in the Permian that could get you back to flat volumes to where we were pre-pandemic. That won't happen immediately. That will take time, that will take time to get there.
And so, I think with respect to producers and their guidance, I'd say a couple of things. One, I think they have to feel like that are -- based on our conversation, they need to feel like that these -- the prices, especially on the crude side are going to stay strong for a long period of time. And right now you've got the Saudis and others are holding a lot of barrels off the market. 
And so that creates price uncertainty. I also think the producers are very focused on free cash flow. And so it's not clear how much they would ramp up CapEx in response to -- in response to increasing prices. So I think a lot more to come there as we get into the year."

When you think about responsibly sourced natural gas, that's something we're out there marketing today. When you think about blending hydrogen in to the extent that, that becomes available, or moving renewable natural gas, which is something that we already do today, the quantities are very small. But when it comes to originating and doing that kind of business, we're already very well fixed to do that within our existing business units. 
That extends also to things like additional renewable liquid fuels, like renewable diesel, where both in our products group and in our terminals group, we are actively looking at and pursuing opportunities there today. And it's in businesses that we understand, that we know how to do, that we can help our customers get where they're going.
When it comes to the further step outs, I think our approach is going to be, again, very conservative. We're going to look at the things that are adjacent to us, that we think makes sense for us to do. And we think that we can do that with folks in our organization and with us taking a -- continuing a hard look at some of those opportunities.
We wouldn't rule out M&A. But I think that's an area where you can move to more quickly than is prudent. And we're going to be prudent in how we approach it. And so I think it's more -- it's more organic. But M&A or acquisitions wouldn't be off the table for the right opportunity.

I mean what we -- we were moving kind of interim service, this may not be what you're getting at -- we were moving on interim service on PHP as we were commissioning compressor stations and the like. So we were delivering November and December, delivering volumes on PHP until we got it fully commissioned and put it in service and took nominations under the long-term firm contract. It's fully underpinned by long-term firm contracts, starting on January 1. 
Now we are -- we're also buying and selling gas. You made mention of interruptible. I think I know what should be in there. I mean it is technically interruptible. A lot of that -- that business is interruptible, but it's generally not interrupted. But we are buying and selling and optimizing on our Texas Intrastate network, some of which -- this is a unique element of the Texas market, some of which, of course, like the interstate market, is on long-term transportation arrangements, including sometimes transportation arrangements that are PHP shippers, for example, hold downstream in order to get to an ultimate delivery point. And then other transportation arrangements that we make with producers and with end users to connect production to power plants, industrial facilities, utilities, et cetera. 
And so what I would point to there is we now have an additional 2 Bcf a day hitting our system. A little less than that. It's not quite running 100% full. We got 2 Bcf a day coming from a couple of years ago when we brought GCX in service, another 2 Bcf coming from Whistler. What that is going to mean for us, I think, ultimately, is a great amount of natural gas that we provide a lot of the last mile connectivity to on our system in Texas. 
So generally, I think that's a bullish development. You're right, the Waha spread has come in as that fully contracted pipeline system is up and running. And I think it will take a while even with the development that Kim described, of additional rigs coming back out there. I think it was 2022 prices were up fairly significantly from what we're currently seeing in 2021. 
Eventually, we'd expect that system to fill back up, basis to widen back out and, call it the middle of the decade, we would need some additional incremental transportation capacity.

And so if the recent recently published regulations on 45-Q do make certain parts of the carbon capture opportunity, more economic win used in combination with enhanced oil recovery. And so the allowance, the tax credit allowance for EOR at the rate now approved makes things like gas processing, ethanol facilities more economic and may be economic. 
And that's an opportunity for us. There's nothing specific right now or deal-specific to talk about there. But it's gotten a lot closer and may actually be economic. And so as we look at it from our business standpoint, from our business perspective, we do have in our treating business today, which is just standard long existing aiming technology to separate CO2 from -- whether it's a gas stream or a process facility separated, it then also has to be captured. And the purer the stream, the better, right? So it's pure in things like processing facilities and ethanol facilities. It's got to be captured. It's got to be powered up. It's got to be transported, which is where we come in, and it's got to be put in the ground and stay there, which is also where we come in. And better still you get oil from it, and that helps make the whole thing work. 
And so we're beginning to see some of those applications creep into economic territory. And then marching up from there, to things like capturing it from power plants and from other industrial uses that gets more expensive and then direct air capture, is extremely expensive, given the very low concentration. So CO2 in the atmosphere, about 0.04% versus from a flue stream run from between 3% and 20%. So 75 to hundreds of times more economics from the flue stream. So we're just kind of on the edges of that now, starting to see some things that are getting interesting.

And so we'd expect to be talking to people ahead of that in order to be able to get something in service by, call it, the middle of this decade. 
We think that we -- the advantage that we bring there are severalfold. One is that we've got a great, I think, the best Texas Gulf Coast market. And increasingly, that means getting it to LNG markets. Mexico, getting into the export markets, but also finding end uses in the growing petrochemical and industrial market along the Texas Gulf Coast. So we get people there, and then we've shown that in far more difficult circumstances than what we would anticipate for a Permian pass, we've been able to get projects done.

Meaning oil and gas would be treated differently from other linear infrastructure that's typically used under Nationwide Rule 12. 
And what I would say, the impact of that is likely to be, if it happens, is that it takes us more time and more effort to accomplish what we could have accomplished more quickly, but it doesn't prohibit it. 
So for example, that's the permitting structure that allowed us to cross certain waterways with our construction activity. And that might become more individualized examinations of those crossings rather than having them grouped under a single permit umbrella, which adds time and cost, but it doesn't eliminate our ability to demonstrate that we're making those crossings in an environmentally responsible way, right? So it's losing the advantage of a permitting process where NEPA has been taking care of environmental impact statement, et cetera, has been taken care of.

Point B is more of a policy one.

Just curious how you're thinking about how that would kind of -- what the impact is on your business going forward, if that kind of plays out?

On the cost side, no, those cost adjustments that we made as part of the organizational efficiency and effectiveness project, I think it's fair to think of those as permanent. Those are costs we took out of the structure, labor costs and other costs that we took out. 
Every budget is a bottoms-up review and cost requirements change, plus or minus, depending on what the emerging -- whether it's regulatory requirements or maintenance requirements or other things are. But we did some permanent, long-lasting work there. So I think that's the right way to think about that. And we'll give you some more detail in the conference. 
Some of that came through about 50-50 sort of split between the segments and between the corporate costs, like G&A and the like. On the policy question, yes, it's something that we watch with some concern. It's not something that we are directly involved in, in terms of how states are thinking about their end uses and users of natural gas. 
I would point out though, as you say -- as you pointed out, that it is in limited areas where this has become an issue. It's a cross prospective. And so dealing with new construction, new homebuilding, et cetera. And that's a long turnover in that market, as you know. 
But the other thing is, I think on closer examination, people are going to be more concerned about it. When you think about developers to like to be showing houses that have natural gas, water heaters and furnaces and natural gas ranges and the like, they're not going to like that. That's less about what Kinder Morgan thinks than it is about people who are building things and producing jobs in the states at issue. 
We've seen, in real life, restaurant owners react in a very negative way to it. And actually one community pushed back an attempt to eliminate natural gas usage. And we've also seen in another jurisdiction that I won't mention, that a lot of obstacles to getting natural gas infrastructure cited. And then when it became apparent that natural gas wasn't going to be available to end users in the state, a complete about phase in terms of asking the incumbent utilities to figure out a way to get additional natural gas in and not have moratoria in place. 
And so I think -- I do think that there are many hands still to be played there. And from our perspective, while it is narrow, it's worth watching. And it's also one where, I think, we benefit and society benefits from giving it much closer examination."

On things like responsibly sourced natural gas, we're already there. And we're talking to customers about it. And as I said, some of our LNG customers are very interested in it because it does matter. If you're a low emissions -- low-methane emissions transportation storage provider, which we are, we met our one future goal 7 years ahead of schedule, and the allocation to our sector was 0.30%, we're at 0.03%. So I mean, we've really -- we've got a lot of good things to show our customers in that regard. 
Serving as a backstop for renewables, our capacity as a backstop, our gas storage, is probably the cheapest and most efficacious energy storage versus batteries. We're right there right now. Renewable diesel, we're right there right now. The discussions we're having in California were, of course, the whole market is aided there by low-carbon fuel standards. 
Dax would tell you, our customers saying ""what can you do for us today?"" And we're talking about renewable diesel hubs there that -- where we can build out some capability at good returns and provide a good service to our customers. And they're really in a hurry to get something there.
It's a little bit longer. It's not in a night thing in other parts of the country.  But as low carbon fuel standards spread, those things are going to be of greater interest. 
On the other hand, things like hydrogen, hydrogen is promising. It's been the fuel of tomorrow for decades. And it takes a while to -- and it takes, I think, some subsidy to get it to a point where it's really -- actually it was $19 in MMBTU today. And so, will it ultimately serve a compelling fraction of the energy needs? Yes, but it is -- if you think about it, it's taking a very high-quality energy, like electricity, which is consumed primary energy to get there, to get it to electricity, taking electricity, using it to separate hydrogen from water and electrolysis, and then taking out the hydrogen molecules in a transport fuel context, for example, putting them into a fuel cell and converting it back to what? Electricity.
So there's a lot to be done there to make that a sensible thing to do. But it could become sensible with the right supports and credits and the like. And today, as Kim pointed out, we can blend -- whomever is willing to invest in, I think there are opportunities to invest in it, we can blend that into our existing system today, and I think that's an attractive proposition to those who are trying to lead the energy transition effort. 
And so if it were in existence next year, we could move it in our pipelines next year. So that's not -- so Timm it does come down to CO2 capture. There are some things that are moving into actionable territory right now. There are other things that are good ways off. And that's why it's important to be discerning about these things as we go. And that's the way we're going to approach it. The things we can do today, the things that we can do tomorrow with the assets and businesses that we have today, and then what's the further step out from there and making sure that we're disciplined about how we approach that. So different innings on different energies."

In terms of how broad the opportunity is likely to be, I would say looking at it right now, it looks like it will be pretty broad. I mean, it doesn't look like -- to your point, there's really a dominant player there. One might emerge, of course, as it could be the case in any business. But there doesn't appear to be one now.

Before turning the call over to Steve and the rest of the team, I'll just make a short statement before -- because we now have actual results for the full year 2020 and have released our preliminary outlook for 2021, this is a good time in my judgment to examine both our current results and future outlook at Kinder Morgan. It seems to me that the clear takeaway is the strength of the cash flow, which allows us in both years to fund our dividend and all discretionary CapEx from internally generated funds and still have significant cash left to pay down debt and buy back shares. This remains at the core of our financial strategy and should be comforting to our shareholder base, as it demonstrates our ability to return value to our shareholders, even under adverse conditions like we experienced in 2020.  
I would make 2 additional important points. Number one, there is a long runway for the products we move through our pipelines, particularly natural gas. And as the world transitions to a future of lower emissions, my second point is that our assets are well positioned to participate in that transition. We'll discuss all these subjects in detail at our upcoming virtual investor conference on January 27, and I look forward to your participation. Steve?"

So I'll give you a brief look back on what we accomplished in 2020, a look ahead on 2021 and beyond, which, as Rich said, we'll cover in greater detail at our annual Investor Day next week. Then I'll turn it over to our President, Kim Dang,",1325,"Thanks, Rich. So I'll give you a brief look back on what we accomplished in 2020, a look ahead on 2021 and beyond, which, as Rich said, we'll cover in greater detail at our annual Investor Day next week. Then I'll turn it over to our President, Kim Dang, to cover the business updates. Our CFO, David Michels, as usual, will take you through the financials, and then we'll take your questions. 
2020 has shown us how important it is to have our priorities and principles straight. We kept our focus throughout the year on keeping our coworkers safe and on keeping our essential assets running for the people, businesses and communities that depend on us.  
Like everyone in our sector, we didn't shut down. We kept running, adjusting our operating procedures on the fly to keep people safe while we helped utilities and factories and other businesses keep running and serving our communities during the pandemic. The pandemic and the downturn in U.S. energy markets impacted us, for sure, but we were still able to maintain our financial principles, which remain the same: First, maintaining a strong balance sheet, we managed to reduce net debt by almost another $1 billion, taking our overall net debt reduction over the last 5 years to well over $10 billion, $10.8 billion since Q1 of 2015, and achieving and maintaining our BBB flat credit rating; second, we maintained our capital discipline through our return criteria, a good track record of execution and by self-funding our investments.  
On that front, we evaluated all of our 2020 expansion capital projects and have reduced CapEx by about $700 million from our 2020 budget for about 30% in response to the changing conditions in our markets, while still completing our largest project, the Permian Highway Pipeline, in the face of substantial opposition and in the middle of the global pandemic. 
We're also maintaining our cost discipline. We achieved about $190 million of expense and sustaining capital savings for 2020. That includes deferrals. We view about $119 million or so as permanent reductions for the year. The result of this work on our capital budget and our costs is that our DCF, less discretionary capital spend, has actually improved versus our plan. And when compared to 2019 as well, about $200 million better versus our plan and about $665 million better than 2019, notwithstanding what was going on in U.S. energy.  
So we more than offset the degradation to our DCF with spending and capital investment cuts in 2020. And the following is noteworthy, too, I think. Our DCF, less discretionary capital, was $2.2 billion in 2019. It grew to $2.9 billion in 2020 and is $3.65 billion in our budget for 2021. Finally, we're returning value to shareholders with a 5% year-over-year dividend increase to $1.05 annualized for 2020, providing an increase to well-covered dividend that the Board plans to raise to $1.08 declared in 2021 and as contemplated in our approved 2021 budget.  
So a strong balance sheet, capital and cost discipline, returning value to our shareholders, those are the principles we continue to operate by. So in addition to completing the Permian Highway Pipeline, we also achieved some other milestones, which we believe are going to lead to long-term distinction. We're already an efficient operator, but we're getting more efficient and cost effective, as I mentioned. We believe that's one of the keys to success in our business for the long term.  
During 2020, we completed a full review of how we're organized and how we operate. We centralized certain functions in order to be more efficient and effective, and we made appropriate changes to how we manage and how we're staffed. And we're achieving, as a result, substantial savings as we described in our guidance release in December and which we'll also cover next week.  
We're also building what we believe is a more effective organization for the future. The centralization of certain functions will enable us to spread our best practices throughout the organization, in project management and permitting, safety, pipeline integrity, ESG and other core functions.  
We also published our third ESG report during the fourth quarter. We've incorporated ESG reporting and risk management into our existing management processes. Sustainalytics has ranked us #1 in our sector for how we manage ESG risk. And our updated MSCI rating also improved dramatically. These things are all important to our long-term success: Being a responsible, effective and efficient operator with the ability to complete large projects under extremely difficult circumstances. That we were able to do all of this during a pandemic and a difficult U.S. energy market backdrop is a testament to the strength and resilience of our people, our leaders and our culture.  
All this positions us well for the future, and we'll be talking about this in more detail at the conference, but here are a few thoughts on what the opportunities look like. First, there are the things that we're already doing that are likely to grow as time goes on. First on that list is our largest business, natural gas, which will continue to be needed to serve domestic needs and export facilities for a long time to come, and it will continue to reduce GHG emissions as we expand its use around the country and the globe.  
Related to that is the enabling role that our natural gas assets play in supporting intermittent renewable resources in the generation stack. Most important to us is the value of what we do, which is less about providing the commodity and more about providing the transportation and storage capacity or deliverability. That value increases as more intermittent resources are relied on for power generation.  
Natural gas is clean, affordable and reliable. And pipelines deliver that commodity by the safest, most efficient, most environmentally sound means. Also, we're making our low methane emissions performance part of our marketing as responsibly produced and transported natural gas. That's a very good synergy between our ESG performance, which is in part about lowering methane emissions; and our commercial opportunities, distinguishing ourselves as an environmentally responsible provider. This is important, for example, not only to our domestic customers, but to our customers serving international markets.  
Also, among the energy transition businesses that we participate in today is the storage, handling and blending of liquid renewable transportation fuels in our products pipelines and terminals segments. We've handled ethanol and biodiesel for a long time. Today, we're handling about 240,000 barrels a day of a 900,000 barrel a day ethanol market, for example. We also handle renewable diesel today. That's part of our business -- that is a part of our business that is ripe for expansion on attractive returns. 
Moving out, the next concentric circle of opportunities is a set of things that we can largely use our existing assets and expertise to accomplish. Those include things like blending hydrogen in our existing natural gas network and transporting and sequestering CO2. A further step out would be businesses that we might participate in if the returns are attractive, such as hydrogen production, renewable diesel production and carbon capture from industrial and power plant sources. As always, we will be disciplined, investing when returns are attractive in operations that we are confident we can build and manage safely, reliably and efficiently. We will not be chasing press releases.  
Energy transitions for a variety of reasons take a very long time. We'll look hard as we lead. You'll hear more details from Kim and the business unit presidents about all this at next week's conference. 
We believe the winners in our sector will have strong balance sheets, low cost operations that are safe and environmentally sound and the ability to get things done in difficult circumstances. We're proud of our team and our culture. And as always, we'll evolve to meet the challenges and opportunities. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

I'm going to go through our business units today. First, starting with natural gas. Transport volumes were down 2% or approximately 600,000 dekatherms per day versus the fourth quarter of 2019.

Transport volumes were down 2% or approximately 600,000 dekatherms per day versus the fourth quarter of 2019. That was driven primarily by declines in Rockies' production and increases in transportation alternatives out of the Permian Basin. These declines were partially offset by higher volume, driven by increased demand for LNG exports and industrial customers.  
Our physical deliveries to LNG facilities off of our pipes averaged almost 5 million dekatherms per day. That's a 50% increase versus the fourth quarter 2019. That's a big increase versus the third quarter of this year, and it's above Q1 2020, which was largely unaffected by the pandemic. For 2020, Kinder Morgan pipes moved well over 40% of the volumes to LNG export facilities.  
Exports to Mexico were up about 4% when you compare it to the fourth quarter of 2019. For 2020, our share of Mexico deliveries ran over 55%. Overall deliveries to power plants were down about 2%.  
Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 20% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. For gathering volumes, I think the more informative comparison is versus the immediately prior quarter, so the third quarter of 2020. When compared to the third quarter of 2020, volumes were down about 3%. KinderHawk, which serves the Haynesville, was down due to lack of drilling and declines in existing wells. However, we're still expecting, based on our conversations with producers, to see new drilling in that basin this year.  
Eagle Ford volumes were also down. The bright spot again this quarter was our Highland system in the Bakken. Volumes there were up well over 20% versus the third quarter of this year.  
On the project side, as Steve said, we completed PHP. We placed that into service on January 1 of this year, which is a really amazing accomplishment by our team. We fought through multiple legal attempts to delay or stop the pipeline, including 1 request for a temporary restraining order and 3 preliminary injunction requests. Permits took longer than they have historically, and therefore, we received a key permit approximately 4.5 months later than what we anticipated. Yet, despite the legal, the permit and the other challenges we faced, the pipe -- we put the pipeline in service just 3 months later than our original schedule.  
In our products pipeline segment, refined products volumes were down about 13% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of the continued pandemic impact. The 13% is very close to the fourth quarter EIA number.  
Our gasoline volumes were off about 10%. Jet volumes remained weak of 47%. The diesel was up about 7%. Looking at the most recent data, volumes in December were down about 17% versus December of 2019. That's not surprising given the rise in COVID cases. So right now, projected January volumes are currently estimated to be down about 13% versus January of 2020.  
Next week, in the investor conference, we'll take you through all of our 2020 budget assumptions and detail, including our refined product volume assumptions.  
Crude and condensate volumes were down about 26% in the quarter versus 2019 and down about 6% over the third quarter. The one bright spot, similar to what we saw in natural gas gathering, was in the Bakken, where a gathering -- crude gathering volumes were up slightly.  
In terminals, refined product volume throughput continued to reflect reduced demand due to the pandemic, but they've recovered since the second half of this year. The impact of throughput volumes on this segment is mitigated by our fixed take-or-pay contracts for tank capacity. Our liquids utilization percentage, which reflects the percent of tanks we have under contract, remains high at 95%. If you exclude the tanks out of service for required inspection, utilization is 98%.  
Given the pandemic, we did see some weakness in our Jones Act tanker business, but that was offset by incremental earnings from expansion projects. The bulk side of the business, which accounts for roughly 20% of the terminals earnings, saw a strong rebound in steel volumes. Industry-wide mill utilization improved to over 70% from the lows of 50% in the second quarter.  
In CO2, oil production was down approximately 16%, and CO2 sales volumes were down about 35%. Our team has done a tremendous job here of adjusting to the current environment, finding cost savings and cutting noneconomic CapEx to more than offset the degradation in segment performance. As a result, full year 2020 DCF, less CapEx for the segment of $466 million, was over $100 million better than 2019 and over $40 million better than budget. 
The last thing I'll point out for you is that for the full year, we were only off $10 million versus the DCF guidance that we gave you in April when the pandemic began. There were lots of puts and takes for sure, and EBITDA was slightly weaker, but amazingly close overall.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to David Michels."

So for the fourth quarter of 2020, we're declaring a dividend of $0.2625 per share, or $1.05 annualized, which is flat with last quarter and 5% up from the fourth quarter of 2019.  Moving on to the fourth quarter 2020 performa",784,"All right. Thank you, Kim. So for the fourth quarter of 2020, we're declaring a dividend of $0.2625 per share, or $1.05 annualized, which is flat with last quarter and 5% up from the fourth quarter of 2019.  
Moving on to the fourth quarter 2020 performance versus the fourth quarter 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, there were a few items that were categorized as certain items: The certain items captured in gain/loss on divestitures and impairments; earnings loss from equity investments and higher income expenses, all nearly offset within the fourth quarter of 2019. That leaves us with $237 million of lower revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus the fourth quarter of 2019, offset by lower O&M expenses, lower depreciation expense and lower interest expense, which explains why net income attributable to KMI of $607 million is about flat with Q4 2019.  
Our adjusted earnings of $604 million is 3% -- is about flat with Q4 2019. And our adjusted earnings per share of $0.27 for the quarter was up $0.01 for -- from the prior year.  
Moving on to DCF. Natural gas was down $59 million for the quarter. Lower contributions were driven by the sale of our Cochin pipeline, along with lower contributions from multiple gathering and processing assets. And those were partially offset by greater contributions from our Texas Intrastate systems as well as expansion project contributions. The products segment was down $64 million, driven by lower refined product volumes and lower crude and condensate volumes, driven mainly due to the continued demand impacts from the pandemic.  
The terminal segment was down $32 million, which was driven by the sale of KML, lower refined products and lower contributions from our Jones Act vessels. Contributions from expansion projects placed in service partially offset those items.  
Our CO2 segment was down $18 million, and that was due to lower oil and CO2 sales volumes, partially offset by lower operating costs and improved year-over-year realized pricing. That brings us to adjusted EBITDA of $183 million or 9% lower than Q4 2019. Below EBITDA, interest expense was $63 million favorable, which was driven by lower floating rate -- excuse me, by a lower floating rate benefiting our interest rate swaps, as well as lower overall debt balance and lower rates on our long-term debt.  
Sustaining capital was a favorable $30 million, driven largely by deferrals in the terminals segment. The other item includes increased cash pension contributions in the Q4 2020 versus Q4 of last year of 2019. Total DCF of $1.25 billion is down $104 million or 8%. DCF per share of $0.55 was down $0.04 from last year.  
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with a 4.6x debt-to-EBITDA level, which is the same as last quarter and up from 4.3 as of year-end 2019. We ended the year with $1.2 billion of cash on hand, which will allow us to easily manage our maturing debt during the year this year. We've already used some of that cash to repay $750 million of debt maturing in the first quarter, so that leaves us with just $1.65 billion of debt maturing for the rest of the year. So we have very strong liquidity, we have an undrawn $4 billion credit facility and we also expect to generate $1.2 billion of DCF after CapEx and dividends in 2021.  
Our net debt ended the quarter and ended the year at $32.0 billion, which is down $900-and-almost-90 million from year-end and down $556 million from last quarter. And as Steve mentioned, our net debt is now down $10.8 billion since the first quarter of 2015.  
To reconcile the quarterly change in net debt, we had $1.25 billion of DCF. We paid dividends of $600 million. We contributed or paid -- or contributed JV contributions to growth capital of $250 million. We received proceeds from asset sales of $200 million, and we had a working capital use of $50 million in the quarter, which explains the majority of that $556 million change in net debt.  
From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, we generated DCF of $4.597 billion. We had the Pembina share sale in Q1 of $900 million. We had the $200 million of asset sales, paid dividends of $2.37 billion. We had growth capital on JV contributions of $1.65 billion. We had taxes on the Trans Mountain sale and Pembina shares of $260 million. We repurchased 50 million of KMI shares, and we had a working capital use of $385 million for the year, which explains the majority of the $989 million reduction in net debt for the year.  
And that completes the financial quarterly review. Back to you, Steve."

I mean, as I think we covered here, we've done a lot of work on the balance sheet, have ourselves in what we believe is a very good position with the BBB flat rating, with all the net debt reduction that we've done over the years, including this year. And we feel like we're in a very good place there. And as we've examined that, and applying additional debt reduction to achieve an upgrade or whatever, we don't really see much of a cost of capital benefit for our equity investors resulting from that. So we do think we're in a very good place there. 
And so that gives us the opportunity to then think about expansion capital projects. We exhaust a good returning, high returning, nice margin above our weighted average cost of capital on those returns. Those opportunities are less than they were in years past. And so we're funding the ones that make sense to fund. And that leaves us with a substantial amount of cash available after that. 
And so we've increased the dividend from $1 to $1.05 and now $1.08 expectation for 2021, and leaving room for as much as $450 million in share repurchases. So I think we've done the right things by the balance sheet. We're funding the things that add the value to the firm in terms of additional projects where those make sense. We're not stretching that. If they don't make sense, we're not doing them. 
And then we don't sit on the cash that we have. We look for ways to return that to our shareholders. And as you know, I mean the valuation between those 2, dividend versus share buybacks, the dividend, there's a good, reliable return of value to shareholders in that. There's not as much flexibility on it. So we've opted to have some flexibility to do share buybacks. And that's how we've laid it out. 
In terms of the consolidation opportunities, our answer is pretty much the same there. We continue to look at those opportunities. The industry has been ripe for consolidation for years, one might say. Not sure what the catalyzing event turns out to be there, but it's something that we look at and evaluate. 
It's got to meet a number of criteria. It has to deliver real value to our investors, of course. Has to be in businesses that we're confident that we can run safely, reliably and efficiently, of course. It has to be accretive, and it also can't mess up our balance sheet, which as we've looked at it, we've got to at least be leverage-neutral, and if anything, maybe leverage-accretive. And so our discipline there continues to be very robust."

Just wondering, in your conversations with the ESG raters, with ESG investors, do you think they see the role for natural gas and energy transition the same way that you guys have outlined it here? Do they buy into that? 
And do you guys have internal views, I guess, on Scope 3 emissions, how natural gas compares to renewables? And when you have these conversations with those stakeholders, do they see things similar to you guys?"

So I will -- there's a lot of diversity, as you know, Jeremy, and how people are evaluating this. I think the ratings show that we are doing an effective job of communicating our ESG measures and managing our ESG risk. Our rating is based on how we're managing ESG risk. It's not based on having a really great ESG report. It's about how we manage that risk. 
I think a lot of people recognized the need for natural gas and the value that natural gas has brought to the environment over the years. If you look back in 2017, we were 6 gigatons of annual emissions, CO2 equivalent emissions. We're now down to 5.1. And a big part of that -- and in an economy that's grown over that period, a big part of that has been the role that natural gas has played in power generation. And so yes, there are people who recognize the role of natural gas, and also how we're doing with our ESG risk management. And we are in ESG funds as a result of that. 
Now that's not a universally held view, but it is something that we're proud of and that we continue to elaborate on with investors and continue to respond to questions and concerns as they are raised by the investment community. 
You make a very good -- or you asked a very good question about Scope 3 emissions. One of the real advantages, and it's an extremely stubborn advantage of hydrocarbons, is that it's a very energy-dense form of energy. And so that means that with a relatively small footprint and a relatively small amount of capital, you can get an awful lot of energy for -- from the power plant, for example, a natural gas power plant. And it takes acres and acres and acres of solar panels and windmills to make that up. And because of the lack of energy density, an awful lot of manufacturing: A lot of mining, a lot of manufacturing a lot of disposal costs associated with building that up. 
And so once we get to a point, a point that we're not at just yet, but once we get to a point, I think, where the public discourse around ESG expands to include those measurements on renewables, it brings natural gas much closer in terms of environmental impact. 
Look, we work with renewable companies. We work with utilities who are increasing their renewable portfolios. We believe that our business plays an important enabling role there. But there is a lot more to, I would say, the natural gas story, once you take everything into account."

On the other hand, I'd say on the other hand, there are some green shoots. The -- on CO2 with the stronger oil prices, there's a little bit of upside on price, if those prices were to hold.

The Eagle Ford has still been weak. If you look at the Permian, the rig count there, that's where most of the rigs have been added since we came off the lows in August. And by our calculations, you're getting close to a rig level in the Permian that could get you back to flat volumes to where we were pre-pandemic. That won't happen immediately. That will take time to get there. And so I think with respect to producers and their guidance, I'd say a couple of things, one, I think they have to feel like that -- based on our conversations, they need to feel like that these -- the prices, especially on the crude side, are going to stay strong for a long period of time. 
And right now, you've got the Saudis and others holding a lot of barrels off the market. And so that creates price uncertainty. I also think the producers are very focused on free cash flow. And so it's not clear how much they would ramp up CapEx in response to increasing prices. So I think a lot more to come there as we get into the year."

When you think about responsibly sourced natural gas, it's something we're out there marketing today. When you think about blending hydrogen in, to the extent that, that becomes available, or moving renewable natural gas, which is something that we already do today, the quantities are very small. But when it comes to originating and doing that kind of business, we're already very well fixed to do that within our existing business units. 
That extends also to things like additional renewable liquid fuels, like renewable diesel, where both in our products group and in our terminals group, we are actively looking at and pursuing opportunities there today. And it's in businesses that we understand, that we know how to do and that we can help our customers get where they're going.
When it comes to the further step outs, I think our approach is going to be, again, very conservative. We're going to look at the things that are adjacent to us, that we think makes sense for us to do.

Wouldn't rule out M&A. But I think that's an area where you can move to more quickly than is prudent. And we're going to be prudent in how we approach it. And so I think it's more organic.

I mean, what we -- we were moving kind of interim service -- this may not be what you're getting at.

I mean, what we -- we were moving kind of interim service -- this may not be what you're getting at. We were moving on interim service on PHP as we were commissioning compressor stations and the like. So we were delivering November and December, delivering volumes on PHP until we got it fully commissioned and put it in service and took nominations under the long-term firm contracts. It's fully underpinned by long-term firm contracts, starting on January 1. 
Now we are -- we're also buying and selling gas. You made mention of interruptible. I think I know what you mean there. I mean, it is technically interruptible. A lot of that -- those -- that business is interruptible, but it's generally not interrupted. But we are buying and selling and optimizing on our Texas Intrastate network, some of which -- this is a unique element of the Texas market, some of which, of course, like the Interstate market, is on long-term transportation arrangements, including sometimes transportation arrangements that are PHP shippers, for example, hold downstream in order to get to an ultimate delivery point. And then other transportation arrangements that we make with producers and with end users to connect production to power plants, industrial facilities, utilities, et cetera. 
And so what I would point to there is we now have an additional 2 Bcf a day hitting our system. A little less than that. It's not quite running 100% full. We got 2 Bcf a day coming from a couple of years ago when we brought GCX in service, another 2 Bcf coming from Whistler. What that is going to mean for us, I think, ultimately, is a great amount of natural gas that we provide a lot of the last mile connectivity to on our system in Texas. So generally, I think that's a bullish development. 
You're right. The Waha spread has come in as that fully contracted pipeline system is up and running. And I think it will take a while, even with the development that Kim described, of additional rigs coming back out there. I think it was 2022 prices were up fairly significantly from what we're currently seeing in 2021. Eventually, we'd expect that system to fill back up, basis to widen back out and call it the middle of the decade, we would need some additional incremental transportation capacity. 
But overall, the new facility coming in is under contract. What it does is bring a lot more to natural gas to our system, which is a good thing for our existing business on that system. Did I answer your question?"

And so if the recently published regulations on 45Q do make certain parts of the carbon capture opportunity, more economic win used in combination with enhanced oil recovery. And so the allowance, the tax credit allowance for EOR at the rate now approved makes things like gas processing, ethanol facilities more economic and may be economic. And that's an opportunity for us. There's nothing specific right now or deal-specific to talk about there. But it's gotten a lot closer and may actually be economic. 
And so as we look at it from our business standpoint, from our business perspective, we do have in our treating business today, which is just standard, long existing, aiming technology to separate CO2 from -- whether it's a gas stream or a process facility separated, it then also has to be captured. And the purer the stream, the better, right? So it's purer in things like processing facilities and ethanol facilities. 
It's got to be captured. It's got to be powered up. It's got to be transported, which is where we come in. And it's got to be put in the ground and stay there, which is also where we come in. And better still, you get oil from it, and that helps make the whole thing work. And so we're beginning to see some of those applications creep into economic territory. 
And then marching up from there to things like capturing it from power plants and from other industrial uses that gets more expensive and then direct air capture is extremely expensive, given the very low concentration. So CO2 in the atmosphere, about 0.04% versus from a flue stream run from between 3% and 20%. So 75 to hundreds of times more economic from the flue stream. So we're just kind of on the edges of that now, starting to see some things that are getting interesting.

And so we'd expect to be talking to people ahead of that in order to be able to get something in service by, call it, the middle of this decade. 
We think that we -- the advantage that we bring there are severalfold. One is that we've got a great, I think, the best Texas Gulf Coast pipeline network. We've got to get the supply to market, and increasingly, that means getting it to LNG markets, Mexico, getting it to the export markets, but also finding end uses in the growing petrochemical and industrial market along the Texas Gulf Coast.

And what I would say, the impact of that is likely to be -- if it happens, is that it takes us more time and more effort to accomplish what we could have accomplished more quickly, but it doesn't prohibit it. 
So for example, that's the permitting structure that allowed us to cross certain waterways with our construction activity. And that might become more individualized examinations of those crossings rather than having them grouped under a single permit umbrella, which adds time and cost, but it doesn't eliminate our ability to demonstrate that we're making those crossings in an environmentally responsible way, right? 
So it's losing the advantage of a permitting process where NEPA has been taking care of, environmental impact statement, et cetera, has been taken care of, and one fell swoop versus having to do it on an individual project basis. So it adds time. It doesn't eliminate the opportunity."

I would point out, though, as you say -- as you pointed out, that it is in limited areas where this has become an issue. It's a [ course ] prospective. And so dealing with new construction, new homebuilding, et cetera. And that's a long internal growth in that market, as you know. 
But the other thing is, I think on closer examination, people are going to be more concerned about it. When you think about developers who like to be showing houses that have natural gas, water heaters and furnaces and natural gas ranges and the like, they're not going to like that. That's less about what Kinder Morgan thinks than it is about people who are building things and producing jobs in the states at issue. 
We've seen, in real life, restaurant owners react in a very negative way to it. And actually, one community pushed back an attempt to eliminate natural gas usage. And we've also seen in another jurisdiction that I won't mention that a lot of obstacles to getting natural gas infrastructure cited. And then when it became apparent that natural gas wasn't going to be available to end users in the state, a complete about-face in terms of asking the incumbent utilities to figure out a way to get additional natural gas in and not have moratoria in place. 
And so I think -- I do think that there are many hands still to be played there. And from our perspective, while it is narrow, it's worth watching. And it's also one where, I think, we benefit and society benefits from giving it much closer examination."

On things like responsibly sourced natural gas, we're already there, and we're talking to customers about it. And as I've said, some of our LNG customers are very interested in it because it does matter. If you're a low emissions -- low-methane emissions transportation storage provider, which we are, we met our one future goal 7 years ahead of schedule, and the allocation to our sector was 0.30%. We're at 0.03%. So, I mean, we've really -- we've got a lot of good things to show our customers in that regard. 
Serving as a backstop for renewables, our capacity as a backstop, our gas storage, has probably the cheapest and most efficacious energy storage versus batteries. We're right there right now. Renewable diesel, we're right there right now. The discussions we're having in California were, of course, the whole market is aided there by a low-carbon fuel standard. 
Dax would tell you, our customers are saying, ""What can you do for us today?"" We're talking about renewable diesel hubs there that -- where we can build out some capability at good returns and provide a good service to our customers. And they're really in a hurry to get something there. 
It's a little bit longer. It's not in a night thing in other parts of the country.  But as low carbon fuel standards spread, those things are going to be of greater interest. 
On the other hand, things like hydrogen, hydrogen is promising. It's been the fuel of tomorrow for decades. And it takes a while to -- and it takes, I think, some subsidies to get it to a point where it's really [ actionable ] it's $19 in MMBtu today. And so will it ultimately serve a compelling fraction of the energy needs? Yes, but it is -- if you think about it, it's taking a very high-quality energy, like electricity, which is consumed primary energy to get there, to get it to electricity, taking electricity, using it to separate hydrogen from water and electrolysis, and then taking the hydrogen molecules in a transport fuel context, for example, putting them into a fuel cell and converting it back to what? Electricity.
So there's a lot to be done there to make that a sensible thing to do, but it could become sensible with the right supports and credits and the like. And today, as Kim pointed out, we can blend -- whoever is willing to invest in, and I think there are opportunities to invest in it, we can blend that into our existing system today. And I think that's an attractive proposition to those who are trying to lead the energy transition effort. 
And so if it were in existence next year, we could move it on our pipelines next year. So that's not -- so, Timm, it does come down to, and as I mentioned, on CO2 capture. There are some things that are moving into actionable territory right now. There are other things that are a good ways off. And that's why it's important to be discerning about these things as we go, and that's the way we're going to approach it. 
The things we can do today, the things that we can do tomorrow with the assets and businesses that we have today, and then what's the further step out from there and making sure that we're disciplined about how we approach that. So different innings on different energies."

Before turning the call over to Steve and the rest of the team, I'll just make a short statement before -- because we now have actual results for the full year 2020 and have released our preliminary outlook for 2021, this is a good time in my judgment to examine both our current results and future outlook at Kinder Morgan. It seems to me that the clear takeaway is the strength of the cash flow, which allows us in both years to fund our dividend and all discretionary CapEx from internally generated funds and still have significant cash left to pay down debt and buy back shares. This remains at the core of our financial strategy and should be comforting to our shareholder base, as it demonstrates our ability to return value to our shareholders, even under adverse conditions like we experienced in 2020.  
I would make 2 additional important points. Number one, there is a long runway for the products we move through our pipelines, particularly natural gas. And as the world transitions to a future of lower emissions, my second point is that our assets are well positioned to participate in that transition. We'll discuss all these subjects in detail at our upcoming virtual investor conference on January 27, and I look forward to your participation. Steve?"

So I'll give you a brief look back on what we accomplished in 2020, a look ahead on 2021 and beyond, which, as Rich said, we'll cover in greater detail at our annual Investor Day next week. Then I'll turn it over to our President, Kim Dang,",1325,"Thanks, Rich. So I'll give you a brief look back on what we accomplished in 2020, a look ahead on 2021 and beyond, which, as Rich said, we'll cover in greater detail at our annual Investor Day next week. Then I'll turn it over to our President, Kim Dang, to cover the business updates. Our CFO, David Michels, as usual, will take you through the financials, and then we'll take your questions.
2020 has shown us how important it is to have our priorities and principles straight. We kept our focus throughout the year on keeping our coworkers safe and on keeping our essential assets running for the people, businesses and communities that depend on us. 
Like everyone in our sector, we didn't shut down. We kept running, adjusting our operating procedures on the fly to keep people safe while we helped utilities and factories and other businesses keep running and serving our communities during the pandemic. The pandemic and the downturn in U.S. energy markets impacted us, for sure, but we were still able to maintain our financial principles, which remain the same: First, maintaining a strong balance sheet, we managed to reduce net debt by almost another $1 billion, taking our overall net debt reduction over the last 5 years to well over $10 billion, $10.8 billion since Q1 of 2015, and achieving and maintaining our BBB flat credit rating; second, we maintained our capital discipline through our return criteria, a good track record of execution and by self-funding our investments.  
On that front, we evaluated all of our 2020 expansion capital projects and have reduced CapEx by about $700 million from our 2020 budget for about 30% in response to the changing conditions in our markets, while still completing our largest project, the Permian Highway Pipeline, in the face of substantial opposition and in the middle of the global pandemic.
We're also maintaining our cost discipline. We achieved about $190 million of expense and sustaining capital savings for 2020. That includes deferrals. We view about $119 million or so as permanent reductions for the year. The result of this work on our capital budget and our costs is that our DCF, less discretionary capital spend, has actually improved versus our plan. And when compared to 2019 as well, about $200 million better versus our plan and about $665 million better than 2019, notwithstanding what was going on in U.S. energy.  
So we more than offset the degradation to our DCF with spending and capital investment cuts in 2020. And the following is noteworthy, too, I think. Our DCF, less discretionary capital, was $2.2 billion in 2019. It grew to $2.9 billion in 2020 and is $3.65 billion in our budget for 2021. Finally, we're returning value to shareholders with a 5% year-over-year dividend increase to $1.05 annualized for 2020, providing an increase to well-covered dividend that the Board plans to raise to $1.08 declared in 2021 and as contemplated in our approved 2021 budget.  
So a strong balance sheet, capital and cost discipline, returning value to our shareholders, those are the principles we continue to operate by. So in addition to completing the Permian Highway Pipeline, we also achieved some other milestones, which we believe are going to lead to long-term distinction. We're already an efficient operator, but we're getting more efficient and cost effective, as I mentioned. We believe that's one of the keys to success in our business for the long term. 
During 2020, we completed a full review of how we're organized and how we operate. We centralized certain functions in order to be more efficient and effective, and we made appropriate changes to how we manage and how we're staffed. And we're achieving, as a result, substantial savings as we described in our guidance release in December and which we'll also cover next week.  
We're also building what we believe is a more effective organization for the future. The centralization of certain functions will enable us to spread our best practices throughout the organization, in project management and permitting, safety, pipeline integrity, ESG and other core functions.  
We also published our third ESG report during the fourth quarter. We've incorporated ESG reporting and risk management into our existing management processes. Sustainalytics has ranked us #1 in our sector for how we manage ESG risk. And our updated MSCI rating also improved dramatically. These things are all important to our long-term success: Being a responsible, effective and efficient operator with the ability to complete large projects under extremely difficult circumstances. That we were able to do all of this during a pandemic and a difficult U.S. energy market backdrop is a testament to the strength and resilience of our people, our leaders and our culture.  
All this positions us well for the future, and we'll be talking about this in more detail at the conference, but here are a few thoughts on what the opportunities look like. First, there are the things that we're already doing that are likely to grow as time goes on. First on that list is our largest business, natural gas, which will continue to be needed to serve domestic needs and export facilities for a long time to come, and it will continue to reduce GHG emissions as we expand its use around the country and the globe.  
Related to that is the enabling role that our natural gas assets play in supporting intermittent renewable resources in the generation stack. Most important to us is the value of what we do, which is less about providing the commodity and more about providing the transportation and storage capacity or deliverability. That value increases as more intermittent resources are relied on for power generation.  
Natural gas is clean, affordable and reliable. And pipelines deliver that commodity by the safest, most efficient, most environmentally sound means. Also, we're making our low methane emissions performance part of our marketing as responsibly produced and transported natural gas. That's a very good synergy between our ESG performance, which is in part about lowering methane emissions; and our commercial opportunities, distinguishing ourselves as an environmentally responsible provider. This is important, for example, not only to our domestic customers, but to our customers serving international markets.  
Also, among the energy transition businesses that we participate in today is the storage, handling and blending of liquid renewable transportation fuels in our products pipelines and terminals segments. We've handled ethanol and biodiesel for a long time. Today, we're handling about 240,000 barrels a day of a 900,000 barrel a day ethanol market, for example. We also handle renewable diesel today. That's part of our business -- that is a part of our business that is ripe for expansion on attractive returns.
Moving out, the next concentric circle of opportunities is a set of things that we can largely use our existing assets and expertise to accomplish. Those include things like blending hydrogen in our existing natural gas network and transporting and sequestering CO2. A further step out would be businesses that we might participate in if the returns are attractive, such as hydrogen production, renewable diesel production and carbon capture from industrial and power plant sources. As always, we will be disciplined, investing when returns are attractive in operations that we are confident we can build and manage safely, reliably and efficiently. We will not be chasing press releases.  
Energy transitions for a variety of reasons take a very long time. We'll look hard as we lead. You'll hear more details from Kim and the business unit presidents about all this at next week's conference.
We believe the winners in our sector will have strong balance sheets, low cost operations that are safe and environmentally sound and the ability to get things done in difficult circumstances. We're proud of our team and our culture. And as always, we'll evolve to meet the challenges and opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

I'm going to go through our business units today. First, starting with natural gas. Transport volumes were down 2% or approximately 600,000 dekatherms per day versus the fourth quarter of 2019.

Transport volumes were down 2% or approximately 600,000 dekatherms per day versus the fourth quarter of 2019. That was driven primarily by declines in Rockies' production and increases in transportation alternatives out of the Permian Basin. These declines were partially offset by higher volume, driven by increased demand for LNG exports and industrial customers.  
Our physical deliveries to LNG facilities off of our pipes averaged almost 5 million dekatherms per day. That's a 50% increase versus the fourth quarter 2019. That's a big increase versus the third quarter of this year, and it's above Q1 2020, which was largely unaffected by the pandemic. For 2020, Kinder Morgan pipes moved well over 40% of the volumes to LNG export facilities.  
Exports to Mexico were up about 4% when you compare it to the fourth quarter of 2019. For 2020, our share of Mexico deliveries ran over 55%. Overall deliveries to power plants were down about 2%.  
Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 20% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. For gathering volumes, I think the more informative comparison is versus the immediately prior quarter, so the third quarter of 2020. When compared to the third quarter of 2020, volumes were down about 3%. KinderHawk, which serves the Haynesville, was down due to lack of drilling and declines in existing wells. However, we're still expecting, based on our conversations with producers, to see new drilling in that basin this year.  
Eagle Ford volumes were also down. The bright spot again this quarter was our Hiland system in the Bakken. Volumes there were up well over 20% versus the third quarter of this year. 
On the project side, as Steve said, we completed PHP. We placed that into service on January 1 of this year, which is a really amazing accomplishment by our team. We fought through multiple legal attempts to delay or stop the pipeline, including 1 request for a temporary restraining order and 3 preliminary injunction requests. Permits took longer than they have historically, and therefore, we received a key permit approximately 4.5 months later than what we anticipated. Yet, despite the legal, the permit and the other challenges we faced, the pipe -- we put the pipeline in service just 3 months later than our original schedule. 
In our products pipeline segment, refined products volumes were down about 13% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of the continued pandemic impact. The 13% is very close to the fourth quarter EIA number.  
Our gasoline volumes were off about 10%. Jet volumes remained weak of 47%. The diesel was up about 7%. Looking at the most recent data, volumes in December were down about 17% versus December of 2019. That's not surprising given the rise in COVID cases. So right now, projected January volumes are currently estimated to be down about 13% versus January of 2020.  
Next week, in the investor conference, we'll take you through all of our 2020 budget assumptions and detail, including our refined product volume assumptions.  
Crude and condensate volumes were down about 26% in the quarter versus 2019 and down about 6% over the third quarter. The one bright spot, similar to what we saw in natural gas gathering, was in the Bakken, where a gathering -- crude gathering volumes were up slightly.  
In terminals, refined product volume throughput continued to reflect reduced demand due to the pandemic, but they've recovered since the second half of this year. The impact of throughput volumes on this segment is mitigated by our fixed take-or-pay contracts for tank capacity. Our liquids utilization percentage, which reflects the percent of tanks we have under contract, remains high at 95%. If you exclude the tanks out of service for required inspection, utilization is 98%. 
Given the pandemic, we did see some weakness in our Jones Act tanker business, but that was offset by incremental earnings from expansion projects. The bulk side of the business, which accounts for roughly 20% of the terminals earnings, saw a strong rebound in steel volumes. Industry-wide mill utilization improved to over 70% from the lows of 50% in the second quarter.  
In CO2, oil production was down approximately 16%, and CO2 sales volumes were down about 35%. Our team has done a tremendous job here of adjusting to the current environment, finding cost savings and cutting noneconomic CapEx to more than offset the degradation in segment performance. As a result, full year 2020 DCF, less CapEx for the segment of $466 million, was over $100 million better than 2019 and over $40 million better than budget.
The last thing I'll point out for you is that for the full year, we were only off $10 million versus the DCF guidance that we gave you in April when the pandemic began. There were lots of puts and takes for sure, and EBITDA was slightly weaker, but amazingly close overall.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to David Michels."

So for the fourth quarter of 2020, we're declaring a dividend of $0.2625 per share, or $1.05 annualized, which is flat with last quarter and 5% up from the fourth quarter of 2019.  
Moving on to the fourth quarter 2020 performance versus the fourth quarter 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, there were a few items that were categorized as certain items: The certain items captured in gain/loss on divestitures and impairments; earnings loss from equity investments and higher income expenses, all nearly offset within the fourth quarter of 2019. That leaves us with $237 million of lower revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus the fourth quarter of 2019, offset by lower O&M expenses, lower depreciation expense and lower interest expense, which explains why net income attributable to KMI of $607 million is about flat with Q4 2019.  
Our adjusted earnings of $604 million is 3% -- is about flat with Q4 2019. And our adjusted earnings per share of $0.27 for the quarter was up $0.01 for -- from the prior year.  
Moving on to DCF. Natural gas was down $59 million for the quarter. Lower contributions were driven by the sale of our Cochin pipeline, along with lower contributions from multiple gathering and processing assets. And those were partially offset by greater contributions from our Texas Intrastate systems as well as expansion project contributions. The products segment was down $64 million, driven by lower refined product volumes and lower crude and condensate volumes, driven mainly due to the continued demand impacts from the pandemic.  
The terminal segment was down $32 million, which was driven by the sale of KML, lower refined products and lower contributions from our Jones Act vessels. Contributions from expansion projects placed in service partially offset those items.  
Our CO2 segment was down $18 million, and that was due to lower oil and CO2 sales volumes, partially offset by lower operating costs and improved year-over-year realized pricing. That brings us to adjusted EBITDA of $183 million or 9% lower than Q4 2019. Below EBITDA, interest expense was $63 million favorable, which was driven by lower floating rate -- excuse me, by a lower floating rate benefiting our interest rate swaps, as well as lower overall debt balance and lower rates on our long-term debt.  
Sustaining capital was a favorable $30 million, driven largely by deferrals in the terminals segment. The other item includes increased cash pension contributions in the Q4 2020 versus Q4 of last year of 2019. Total DCF of $1.25 billion is down $104 million or 8%. DCF per share of $0.55 was down $0.04 from last year.  
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with a 4.6x debt-to-EBITDA level, which is the same as last quarter and up from 4.3 as of year-end 2019. We ended the year with $1.2 billion of cash on hand, which will allow us to easily manage our maturing debt during the year this year. We've already used some of that cash to repay $750 million of debt maturing in the first quarter, so that leaves us with just $1.65 billion of debt maturing for the rest of the year. So we have very strong liquidity, we have an undrawn $4 billion credit facility and we also expect to generate $1.2 billion of DCF after CapEx and dividends in 2021.  
Our net debt ended the quarter and ended the year at $32.0 billion, which is down $900-and-almost-90 million from year-end and down $556 million from last quarter. And as Steve mentioned, our net debt is now down $10.8 billion since the first quarter of 2015. 
To reconcile the quarterly change in net debt, we had $1.25 billion of DCF. We paid dividends of $600 million. We contributed or paid -- or contributed JV contributions to growth capital of $250 million. We received proceeds from asset sales of $200 million, and we had a working capital use of $50 million in the quarter, which explains the majority of that $556 million change in net debt.  
From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, we generated DCF of $4.597 billion. We had the Pembina share sale in Q1 of $900 million. We had the $200 million of asset sales, paid dividends of $2.37 billion. We had growth capital on JV contributions of $1.65 billion. We had taxes on the Trans Mountain sale and Pembina shares of $260 million. We repurchased 50 million of KMI shares, and we had a working capital use of $385 million for the year, which explains the majority of the $989 million reduction in net debt for the year.  
And that completes the financial quarterly review. Back to you, Steve."

And you've laid out some pieces for kind of dividend growth expectations. But just wondering, capital allocation philosophy overall, if you could refresh us on how you're thinking about that when it comes to dividend increases versus buybacks?
And also, it seems like the market's continually looking for lower leverage here, so that the multiple can be attributed more to the equity side than the debt side. So just wondering how those different things work together. And the industry still seems ripe for consolidation, so wondering if you could refresh us on that."

Yes, sure. I mean, as I think we covered here, we've done a lot of work on the balance sheet, have ourselves in what we believe is a very good position with the BBB flat rating, with all the net debt reduction that we've done over the years, including this year. And we feel like we're in a very good place there. And as we've examined that, and applying additional debt reduction to achieve an upgrade or whatever, we don't really see much of a cost of capital benefit for our equity investors resulting from that. So we do think we're in a very good place there.
And so that gives us the opportunity to then think about expansion capital projects. We exhaust a good returning, high returning, nice margin above our weighted average cost of capital on those returns. Those opportunities are less than they were in years past. And so we're funding the ones that make sense to fund. And that leaves us with a substantial amount of cash available after that.
And so we've increased the dividend from $1 to $1.05 and now $1.08 expectation for 2021, and leaving room for as much as $450 million in share repurchases. So I think we've done the right things by the balance sheet. We're funding the things that add the value to the firm in terms of additional projects where those make sense. We're not stretching that. If they don't make sense, we're not doing them.
And then we don't sit on the cash that we have. We look for ways to return that to our shareholders. And as you know, I mean the valuation between those 2, dividend versus share buybacks, the dividend, there's a good, reliable return of value to shareholders in that. There's not as much flexibility on it. So we've opted to have some flexibility to do share buybacks. And that's how we've laid it out.
In terms of the consolidation opportunities, our answer is pretty much the same there. We continue to look at those opportunities. The industry has been ripe for consolidation for years, one might say. Not sure what the catalyzing event turns out to be there, but it's something that we look at and evaluate.
It's got to meet a number of criteria. It has to deliver real value to our investors, of course. Has to be in businesses that we're confident that we can run safely, reliably and efficiently, of course. It has to be accretive, and it also can't mess up our balance sheet, which as we've looked at it, we've got to at least be leverage-neutral, and if anything, maybe leverage-accretive. And so our discipline there continues to be very robust."

So I will -- there's a lot of diversity, as you know, Jeremy, and how people are evaluating this. I think the ratings show that we are doing an effective job of communicating our ESG measures and managing our ESG risk. Our rating is based on how we're managing ESG risk. It's not based on having a really great ESG report. It's about how we manage that risk.
I think a lot of people recognized the need for natural gas and the value that natural gas has brought to the environment over the years. If you look back in 2017, we were 6 gigatons of annual emissions, CO2 equivalent emissions. We're now down to 5.1. And a big part of that -- and in an economy that's grown over that period, a big part of that has been the role that natural gas has played in power generation. And so yes, there are people who recognize the role of natural gas, and also how we're doing with our ESG risk management. And we are in ESG funds as a result of that.
Now that's not a universally held view, but it is something that we're proud of and that we continue to elaborate on with investors and continue to respond to questions and concerns as they are raised by the investment community.
You make a very good -- or you asked a very good question about Scope 3 emissions. One of the real advantages, and it's an extremely stubborn advantage of hydrocarbons, is that it's a very energy-dense form of energy. And so that means that with a relatively small footprint and a relatively small amount of capital, you can get an awful lot of energy for -- from the power plant, for example, a natural gas power plant. And it takes acres and acres and acres of solar panels and windmills to make that up. And because of the lack of energy density, an awful lot of manufacturing: A lot of mining, a lot of manufacturing a lot of disposal costs associated with building that up.
And so once we get to a point, a point that we're not at just yet, but once we get to a point, I think, where the public discourse around ESG expands to include those measurements on renewables, it brings natural gas much closer in terms of environmental impact.
Look, we work with renewable companies. We work with utilities who are increasing their renewable portfolios. We believe that our business plays an important enabling role there. But there is a lot more to, I would say, the natural gas story, once you take everything into account."

The Eagle Ford has still been weak. If you look at the Permian, the rig count there, that's where most of the rigs have been added since we came off the lows in August. And by our calculations, you're getting close to a rig level in the Permian that could get you back to flat volumes to where we were pre-pandemic. That won't happen immediately. That will take time to get there. And so I think with respect to producers and their guidance, I'd say a couple of things, one, I think they have to feel like that -- based on our conversations, they need to feel like that these -- the prices, especially on the crude side, are going to stay strong for a long period of time.
And right now, you've got the Saudis and others holding a lot of barrels off the market. And so that creates price uncertainty. I also think the producers are very focused on free cash flow. And so it's not clear how much they would ramp up CapEx in response to increasing prices. So I think a lot more to come there as we get into the year."

That extends also to things like additional renewable liquid fuels, like renewable diesel, where both in our products group and in our terminals group, we are actively looking at and pursuing opportunities there today.

But what I'll tell you is that we -- John and the team were really nicely positioned for what you were just talking about, meaning that we were going to have vessels rolling off charter right as charter rates were improving, which is where things were headed based on the overall supply and demand fundamentals there.
And then the pandemic happened. And so as you saw in other refined products volumes and demand for refined products movements, we saw that come off and come off relatively hard. And so that created kind of an unexpected pivot in the overall picture.
Now over the longer term, there aren't new Jones Act vessels that would compete with our MRs anyway that are being built right now. We think that, that market does come back into balance over time. But it has created some short-term weakness in demand. Beginning to see some nice uptick in inquiries and calls for quotes as we've gotten into 2021. But we did take a reduction there.
Now I would say, overall, Jones Act vessels are running probably -- again, this is a pandemic number, Jean Ann, so not representative of, call it, normal refined products operations, but, call it, 25% off higher. We're about half of that, meaning about 12.5%. So better, but we have some expirations coming up over the course of 2021.

I mean, what we -- we were moving kind of interim service -- this may not be what you're getting at. We were moving on interim service on PHP as we were commissioning compressor stations and the like. So we were delivering November and December, delivering volumes on PHP until we got it fully commissioned and put it in service and took nominations under the long-term firm contracts. It's fully underpinned by long-term firm contracts, starting on January 1.
Now we are -- we're also buying and selling gas. You made mention of interruptible. I think I know what you mean there. I mean, it is technically interruptible. A lot of that -- those -- that business is interruptible, but it's generally not interrupted. But we are buying and selling and optimizing on our Texas Intrastate network, some of which -- this is a unique element of the Texas market, some of which, of course, like the Interstate market, is on long-term transportation arrangements, including sometimes transportation arrangements that are PHP shippers, for example, hold downstream in order to get to an ultimate delivery point. And then other transportation arrangements that we make with producers and with end users to connect production to power plants, industrial facilities, utilities, et cetera.
And so what I would point to there is we now have an additional 2 Bcf a day hitting our system. A little less than that. It's not quite running 100% full. We got 2 Bcf a day coming from a couple of years ago when we brought GCX in service, another 2 Bcf coming from Whistler. What that is going to mean for us, I think, ultimately, is a great amount of natural gas that we provide a lot of the last mile connectivity to on our system in Texas. So generally, I think that's a bullish development.
You're right. The Waha spread has come in as that fully contracted pipeline system is up and running. And I think it will take a while, even with the development that Kim described, of additional rigs coming back out there. I think it was 2022 prices were up fairly significantly from what we're currently seeing in 2021. Eventually, we'd expect that system to fill back up, basis to widen back out and call it the middle of the decade, we would need some additional incremental transportation capacity.
But overall, the new facility coming in is under contract. What it does is bring a lot more to natural gas to our system, which is a good thing for our existing business on that system. Did I answer your question?"

And so if the recently published regulations on 45Q do make certain parts of the carbon capture opportunity, more economic win used in combination with enhanced oil recovery. And so the allowance, the tax credit allowance for EOR at the rate now approved makes things like gas processing, ethanol facilities more economic and may be economic. And that's an opportunity for us. There's nothing specific right now or deal-specific to talk about there. But it's gotten a lot closer and may actually be economic.
And so as we look at it from our business standpoint, from our business perspective, we do have in our treating business today, which is just standard, long existing, aiming technology to separate CO2 from -- whether it's a gas stream or a process facility separated, it then also has to be captured. And the purer the stream, the better, right? So it's purer in things like processing facilities and ethanol facilities.
It's got to be captured. It's got to be powered up. It's got to be transported, which is where we come in. And it's got to be put in the ground and stay there, which is also where we come in. And better still, you get oil from it, and that helps make the whole thing work. And so we're beginning to see some of those applications creep into economic territory.
And then marching up from there to things like capturing it from power plants and from other industrial uses that gets more expensive and then direct air capture is extremely expensive, given the very low concentration. So CO2 in the atmosphere, about 0.04% versus from a flue stream run from between 3% and 20%. So 75 to hundreds of times more economic from the flue stream. So we're just kind of on the edges of that now, starting to see some things that are getting interesting.

So we get people there, and then we've shown that in far more difficult circumstances than what we would anticipate for a Permian pass, we've been able to get projects done.
So we think we're in a good position. That's not a guarantee, of course. But we think it's a ways off. It's not that we're not having any conversations with people. There are some very long-term planners out there, as you know, in the producer community. And so we continue to talk about it. But it's a ways off. Tom?"

It's been in place for decades. It gets refreshed every 5 years. And you're right, there's some examination of splitting it, meaning oil and gas would be treated differently from other linear infrastructure that's typically used under Nationwide Rule 12. And what I would say, the impact of that is likely to be -- if it happens, is that it takes us more time and more effort to accomplish what we could have accomplished more quickly, but it doesn't prohibit it.
So for example, that's the permitting structure that allowed us to cross certain waterways with our construction activity. And that might become more individualized examinations of those crossings rather than having them grouped under a single permit umbrella, which adds time and cost, but it doesn't eliminate our ability to demonstrate that we're making those crossings in an environmentally responsible way, right?
So it's losing the advantage of a permitting process where NEPA has been taking care of, environmental impact statement, et cetera, has been taken care of, and one fell swoop versus having to do it on an individual project basis. So it adds time. It doesn't eliminate the opportunity."

That's point A.
Point B is more of a policy one. We're starting to see some states take a bit of policy-driven action regarding the future of demands for their gas-regulated utilities and trying to really restrict cap or limit demand or even shrink demand growth out of gas utilities. Just curious how you're thinking about how that would kind of -- what the impact is on your business going forward, if that kind of plays out. And it's really -- looks like it's more some of the East Coast states and some of the West Coast states that are the ones looking at it."

On the cost side, no, those cost adjustments that we made as part of the organizational efficiency and effectiveness project, I think it's fair to think of those as permanent. Those are costs we took out of the structure, labor costs and other costs that we took out.
Every budget is a bottoms-up review, and cost requirements change, plus or minus, depending on what the emerging -- whether it's regulatory requirements or maintenance requirements or other things are. But we did some permanent, long-lasting work there. So I think that's the right way to think about that. And we'll give you some more detail in the conference. Some of that came through about 50-50 sort of split between the segments and between the corporate costs, like G&A and the like.
On the policy question, yes, it's something that we watch with some concern. It's not something that we are directly involved in, in terms of how states are thinking about their end uses and users of natural gas. I would point out, though, as you say -- as you pointed out, that it is in limited areas where this has become an issue. It's a [ course ] prospective. And so dealing with new construction, new homebuilding, et cetera. And that's a long internal growth in that market, as you know.
But the other thing is, I think on closer examination, people are going to be more concerned about it. When you think about developers who like to be showing houses that have natural gas, water heaters and furnaces and natural gas ranges and the like, they're not going to like that. That's less about what Kinder Morgan thinks than it is about people who are building things and producing jobs in the states at issue.
We've seen, in real life, restaurant owners react in a very negative way to it. And actually, one community pushed back an attempt to eliminate natural gas usage. And we've also seen in another jurisdiction that I won't mention that a lot of obstacles to getting natural gas infrastructure cited. And then when it became apparent that natural gas wasn't going to be available to end users in the state, a complete about-face in terms of asking the incumbent utilities to figure out a way to get additional natural gas in and not have moratoria in place.
And so I think -- I do think that there are many hands still to be played there. And from our perspective, while it is narrow, it's worth watching. And it's also one where, I think, we benefit and society benefits from giving it much closer examination."

On things like responsibly sourced natural gas, we're already there, and we're talking to customers about it. And as I've said, some of our LNG customers are very interested in it because it does matter. If you're a low emissions -- low-methane emissions transportation storage provider, which we are, we met our one future goal 7 years ahead of schedule, and the allocation to our sector was 0.30%. We're at 0.03%. So, I mean, we've really -- we've got a lot of good things to show our customers in that regard.
Serving as a backstop for renewables, our capacity as a backstop, our gas storage, has probably the cheapest and most efficacious energy storage versus batteries. We're right there right now. Renewable diesel, we're right there right now. The discussions we're having in California were, of course, the whole market is aided there by a low-carbon fuel standard.
Dax would tell you, our customers are saying, ""What can you do for us today?"" We're talking about renewable diesel hubs there that -- where we can build out some capability at good returns and provide a good service to our customers. And they're really in a hurry to get something there.
It's a little bit longer. It's not in a night thing in other parts of the country.  But as low carbon fuel standards spread, those things are going to be of greater interest.
On the other hand, things like hydrogen, hydrogen is promising. It's been the fuel of tomorrow for decades. And it takes a while to -- and it takes, I think, some subsidies to get it to a point where it's really [ actionable ] it's $19 in MMBtu today. And so will it ultimately serve a compelling fraction of the energy needs? Yes, but it is -- if you think about it, it's taking a very high-quality energy, like electricity, which is consumed primary energy to get there, to get it to electricity, taking electricity, using it to separate hydrogen from water and electrolysis, and then taking the hydrogen molecules in a transport fuel context, for example, putting them into a fuel cell and converting it back to what? Electricity.
So there's a lot to be done there to make that a sensible thing to do, but it could become sensible with the right supports and credits and the like. And today, as Kim pointed out, we can blend -- whoever is willing to invest in, and I think there are opportunities to invest in it, we can blend that into our existing system today. And I think that's an attractive proposition to those who are trying to lead the energy transition effort.
And so if it were in existence next year, we could move it on our pipelines next year. So that's not -- so, Timm, it does come down to, and as I mentioned, on CO2 capture. There are some things that are moving into actionable territory right now. There are other things that are a good ways off. And that's why it's important to be discerning about these things as we go, and that's the way we're going to approach it.
The things we can do today, the things that we can do tomorrow with the assets and businesses that we have today, and then what's the further step out from there and making sure that we're disciplined about how we approach that. So different innings on different energies."

Before turning the call over to Steve and the rest of the team, I'll just make a short statement before -- because we now have actual results for the full year 2020 and have released our preliminary outlook for 2021, this is a good time in my judgment to examine both our current results and future outlook at Kinder Morgan. It seems to me that the clear takeaway is the strength of the cash flow, which allows us in both years to fund our dividend and all discretionary CapEx from internally generated funds and still have significant cash left to pay down debt and buy back shares. This remains at the core of our financial strategy and should be comforting to our shareholder base, as it demonstrates our ability to return value to our shareholders, even under adverse conditions like we experienced in 2020.  
I would make 2 additional important points. Number one, there is a long runway for the products we move through our pipelines, particularly natural gas. And as the world transitions to a future of lower emissions, my second point is that our assets are well positioned to participate in that transition. We'll discuss all these subjects in detail at our upcoming virtual investor conference on January 27, and I look forward to your participation. Steve?"

So I'll give you a brief look back on what we accomplished in 2020, a look ahead on 2021 and beyond, which, as Rich said, we'll cover in greater detail at our annual Investor Day next week. Then I'll turn it over to our President, Kim Dang,",1325,"Thanks, Rich. So I'll give you a brief look back on what we accomplished in 2020, a look ahead on 2021 and beyond, which, as Rich said, we'll cover in greater detail at our annual Investor Day next week. Then I'll turn it over to our President, Kim Dang, to cover the business updates. Our CFO, David Michels, as usual, will take you through the financials, and then we'll take your questions.
2020 has shown us how important it is to have our priorities and principles straight. We kept our focus throughout the year on keeping our coworkers safe and on keeping our essential assets running for the people, businesses and communities that depend on us. 
Like everyone in our sector, we didn't shut down. We kept running, adjusting our operating procedures on the fly to keep people safe while we helped utilities and factories and other businesses keep running and serving our communities during the pandemic. The pandemic and the downturn in U.S. energy markets impacted us, for sure, but we were still able to maintain our financial principles, which remain the same: First, maintaining a strong balance sheet, we managed to reduce net debt by almost another $1 billion, taking our overall net debt reduction over the last 5 years to well over $10 billion, $10.8 billion since Q1 of 2015, and achieving and maintaining our BBB flat credit rating; second, we maintained our capital discipline through our return criteria, a good track record of execution and by self-funding our investments.  
On that front, we evaluated all of our 2020 expansion capital projects and have reduced CapEx by about $700 million from our 2020 budget for about 30% in response to the changing conditions in our markets, while still completing our largest project, the Permian Highway Pipeline, in the face of substantial opposition and in the middle of the global pandemic.
We're also maintaining our cost discipline. We achieved about $190 million of expense and sustaining capital savings for 2020. That includes deferrals. We view about $119 million or so as permanent reductions for the year. The result of this work on our capital budget and our costs is that our DCF, less discretionary capital spend, has actually improved versus our plan. And when compared to 2019 as well, about $200 million better versus our plan and about $665 million better than 2019, notwithstanding what was going on in U.S. energy.  
So we more than offset the degradation to our DCF with spending and capital investment cuts in 2020. And the following is noteworthy, too, I think. Our DCF, less discretionary capital, was $2.2 billion in 2019. It grew to $2.9 billion in 2020 and is $3.65 billion in our budget for 2021. Finally, we're returning value to shareholders with a 5% year-over-year dividend increase to $1.05 annualized for 2020, providing an increase to well-covered dividend that the Board plans to raise to $1.08 declared in 2021 and as contemplated in our approved 2021 budget.  
So a strong balance sheet, capital and cost discipline, returning value to our shareholders, those are the principles we continue to operate by. So in addition to completing the Permian Highway Pipeline, we also achieved some other milestones, which we believe are going to lead to long-term distinction. We're already an efficient operator, but we're getting more efficient and cost effective, as I mentioned. We believe that's one of the keys to success in our business for the long term. 
During 2020, we completed a full review of how we're organized and how we operate. We centralized certain functions in order to be more efficient and effective, and we made appropriate changes to how we manage and how we're staffed. And we're achieving, as a result, substantial savings as we described in our guidance release in December and which we'll also cover next week.  
We're also building what we believe is a more effective organization for the future. The centralization of certain functions will enable us to spread our best practices throughout the organization, in project management and permitting, safety, pipeline integrity, ESG and other core functions.  
We also published our third ESG report during the fourth quarter. We've incorporated ESG reporting and risk management into our existing management processes. Sustainalytics has ranked us #1 in our sector for how we manage ESG risk. And our updated MSCI rating also improved dramatically. These things are all important to our long-term success: Being a responsible, effective and efficient operator with the ability to complete large projects under extremely difficult circumstances. That we were able to do all of this during a pandemic and a difficult U.S. energy market backdrop is a testament to the strength and resilience of our people, our leaders and our culture.  
All this positions us well for the future, and we'll be talking about this in more detail at the conference, but here are a few thoughts on what the opportunities look like. First, there are the things that we're already doing that are likely to grow as time goes on. First on that list is our largest business, natural gas, which will continue to be needed to serve domestic needs and export facilities for a long time to come, and it will continue to reduce GHG emissions as we expand its use around the country and the globe.  
Related to that is the enabling role that our natural gas assets play in supporting intermittent renewable resources in the generation stack. Most important to us is the value of what we do, which is less about providing the commodity and more about providing the transportation and storage capacity or deliverability. That value increases as more intermittent resources are relied on for power generation.  
Natural gas is clean, affordable and reliable. And pipelines deliver that commodity by the safest, most efficient, most environmentally sound means. Also, we're making our low methane emissions performance part of our marketing as responsibly produced and transported natural gas. That's a very good synergy between our ESG performance, which is in part about lowering methane emissions; and our commercial opportunities, distinguishing ourselves as an environmentally responsible provider. This is important, for example, not only to our domestic customers, but to our customers serving international markets.  
Also, among the energy transition businesses that we participate in today is the storage, handling and blending of liquid renewable transportation fuels in our products pipelines and terminals segments. We've handled ethanol and biodiesel for a long time. Today, we're handling about 240,000 barrels a day of a 900,000 barrel a day ethanol market, for example. We also handle renewable diesel today. That's part of our business -- that is a part of our business that is ripe for expansion on attractive returns.
Moving out, the next concentric circle of opportunities is a set of things that we can largely use our existing assets and expertise to accomplish. Those include things like blending hydrogen in our existing natural gas network and transporting and sequestering CO2. A further step out would be businesses that we might participate in if the returns are attractive, such as hydrogen production, renewable diesel production and carbon capture from industrial and power plant sources. As always, we will be disciplined, investing when returns are attractive in operations that we are confident we can build and manage safely, reliably and efficiently. We will not be chasing press releases.  
Energy transitions for a variety of reasons take a very long time. We'll look hard as we lead. You'll hear more details from Kim and the business unit presidents about all this at next week's conference.
We believe the winners in our sector will have strong balance sheets, low cost operations that are safe and environmentally sound and the ability to get things done in difficult circumstances. We're proud of our team and our culture. And as always, we'll evolve to meet the challenges and opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

Transport volumes were down 2% or approximately 600,000 dekatherms per day versus the fourth quarter of 2019. That was driven primarily by declines in Rockies' production and increases in transportation alternatives out of the Permian Basin. These declines were partially offset by higher volume, driven by increased demand for LNG exports and industrial customers.  
Our physical deliveries to LNG facilities off of our pipes averaged almost 5 million dekatherms per day. That's a 50% increase versus the fourth quarter 2019. That's a big increase versus the third quarter of this year, and it's above Q1 2020, which was largely unaffected by the pandemic. For 2020, Kinder Morgan pipes moved well over 40% of the volumes to LNG export facilities.  
Exports to Mexico were up about 4% when you compare it to the fourth quarter of 2019. For 2020, our share of Mexico deliveries ran over 55%. Overall deliveries to power plants were down about 2%.  
Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 20% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. For gathering volumes, I think the more informative comparison is versus the immediately prior quarter, so the third quarter of 2020. When compared to the third quarter of 2020, volumes were down about 3%. KinderHawk, which serves the Haynesville, was down due to lack of drilling and declines in existing wells. However, we're still expecting, based on our conversations with producers, to see new drilling in that basin this year.  
Eagle Ford volumes were also down. The bright spot again this quarter was our Hiland system in the Bakken. Volumes there were up well over 20% versus the third quarter of this year. 
On the project side, as Steve said, we completed PHP. We placed that into service on January 1 of this year, which is a really amazing accomplishment by our team. We fought through multiple legal attempts to delay or stop the pipeline, including 1 request for a temporary restraining order and 3 preliminary injunction requests. Permits took longer than they have historically, and therefore, we received a key permit approximately 4.5 months later than what we anticipated. Yet, despite the legal, the permit and the other challenges we faced, the pipe -- we put the pipeline in service just 3 months later than our original schedule. 
In our products pipeline segment, refined products volumes were down about 13% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of the continued pandemic impact. The 13% is very close to the fourth quarter EIA number.  
Our gasoline volumes were off about 10%. Jet volumes remained weak of 47%. The diesel was up about 7%. Looking at the most recent data, volumes in December were down about 17% versus December of 2019. That's not surprising given the rise in COVID cases. So right now, projected January volumes are currently estimated to be down about 13% versus January of 2020.  
Next week, in the investor conference, we'll take you through all of our 2020 budget assumptions and detail, including our refined product volume assumptions.  
Crude and condensate volumes were down about 26% in the quarter versus 2019 and down about 6% over the third quarter. The one bright spot, similar to what we saw in natural gas gathering, was in the Bakken, where a gathering -- crude gathering volumes were up slightly.  
In terminals, refined product volume throughput continued to reflect reduced demand due to the pandemic, but they've recovered since the second half of this year. The impact of throughput volumes on this segment is mitigated by our fixed take-or-pay contracts for tank capacity. Our liquids utilization percentage, which reflects the percent of tanks we have under contract, remains high at 95%. If you exclude the tanks out of service for required inspection, utilization is 98%. 
Given the pandemic, we did see some weakness in our Jones Act tanker business, but that was offset by incremental earnings from expansion projects. The bulk side of the business, which accounts for roughly 20% of the terminals earnings, saw a strong rebound in steel volumes. Industry-wide mill utilization improved to over 70% from the lows of 50% in the second quarter.  
In CO2, oil production was down approximately 16%, and CO2 sales volumes were down about 35%. Our team has done a tremendous job here of adjusting to the current environment, finding cost savings and cutting noneconomic CapEx to more than offset the degradation in segment performance. As a result, full year 2020 DCF, less CapEx for the segment of $466 million, was over $100 million better than 2019 and over $40 million better than budget.
The last thing I'll point out for you is that for the full year, we were only off $10 million versus the DCF guidance that we gave you in April when the pandemic began. There were lots of puts and takes for sure, and EBITDA was slightly weaker, but amazingly close overall.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to David Michels."

So for the fourth quarter of 2020, we're declaring a dividend of $0.2625 per share, or $1.05 annualized, which is flat with last quarter and 5% up from the fourth quarter of 2019.  Moving on to the fourth quarter 2020 performa",784,"All right. Thank you, Kim. So for the fourth quarter of 2020, we're declaring a dividend of $0.2625 per share, or $1.05 annualized, which is flat with last quarter and 5% up from the fourth quarter of 2019.  
Moving on to the fourth quarter 2020 performance versus the fourth quarter 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, there were a few items that were categorized as certain items: The certain items captured in gain/loss on divestitures and impairments; earnings loss from equity investments and higher income expenses, all nearly offset within the fourth quarter of 2019. That leaves us with $237 million of lower revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus the fourth quarter of 2019, offset by lower O&M expenses, lower depreciation expense and lower interest expense, which explains why net income attributable to KMI of $607 million is about flat with Q4 2019.  
Our adjusted earnings of $604 million is 3% -- is about flat with Q4 2019. And our adjusted earnings per share of $0.27 for the quarter was up $0.01 for -- from the prior year.  
Moving on to DCF. Natural gas was down $59 million for the quarter. Lower contributions were driven by the sale of our Cochin pipeline, along with lower contributions from multiple gathering and processing assets. And those were partially offset by greater contributions from our Texas Intrastate systems as well as expansion project contributions. The products segment was down $64 million, driven by lower refined product volumes and lower crude and condensate volumes, driven mainly due to the continued demand impacts from the pandemic.  
The terminal segment was down $32 million, which was driven by the sale of KML, lower refined products and lower contributions from our Jones Act vessels. Contributions from expansion projects placed in service partially offset those items.  
Our CO2 segment was down $18 million, and that was due to lower oil and CO2 sales volumes, partially offset by lower operating costs and improved year-over-year realized pricing. That brings us to adjusted EBITDA of $183 million or 9% lower than Q4 2019. Below EBITDA, interest expense was $63 million favorable, which was driven by lower floating rate -- excuse me, by a lower floating rate benefiting our interest rate swaps, as well as lower overall debt balance and lower rates on our long-term debt.  
Sustaining capital was a favorable $30 million, driven largely by deferrals in the terminals segment. The other item includes increased cash pension contributions in the Q4 2020 versus Q4 of last year of 2019. Total DCF of $1.25 billion is down $104 million or 8%. DCF per share of $0.55 was down $0.04 from last year.  
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the year with a 4.6x debt-to-EBITDA level, which is the same as last quarter and up from 4.3 as of year-end 2019. We ended the year with $1.2 billion of cash on hand, which will allow us to easily manage our maturing debt during the year this year. We've already used some of that cash to repay $750 million of debt maturing in the first quarter, so that leaves us with just $1.65 billion of debt maturing for the rest of the year. So we have very strong liquidity, we have an undrawn $4 billion credit facility and we also expect to generate $1.2 billion of DCF after CapEx and dividends in 2021.  
Our net debt ended the quarter and ended the year at $32.0 billion, which is down $900-and-almost-90 million from year-end and down $556 million from last quarter. And as Steve mentioned, our net debt is now down $10.8 billion since the first quarter of 2015. 
To reconcile the quarterly change in net debt, we had $1.25 billion of DCF. We paid dividends of $600 million. We contributed or paid -- or contributed JV contributions to growth capital of $250 million. We received proceeds from asset sales of $200 million, and we had a working capital use of $50 million in the quarter, which explains the majority of that $556 million change in net debt.  
From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, we generated DCF of $4.597 billion. We had the Pembina share sale in Q1 of $900 million. We had the $200 million of asset sales, paid dividends of $2.37 billion. We had growth capital on JV contributions of $1.65 billion. We had taxes on the Trans Mountain sale and Pembina shares of $260 million. We repurchased 50 million of KMI shares, and we had a working capital use of $385 million for the year, which explains the majority of the $989 million reduction in net debt for the year.  
And that completes the financial quarterly review. Back to you, Steve."

And you've laid out some pieces for kind of dividend growth expectations. But just wondering, capital allocation philosophy overall, if you could refresh us on how you're thinking about that when it comes to dividend increases versus buybacks?

So just wondering how those different things work together. And the industry still seems ripe for consolidation, so wondering if you could refresh us on that."

Yes, sure. I mean, as I think we covered here, we've done a lot of work on the balance sheet, have ourselves in what we believe is a very good position with the BBB flat rating, with all the net debt reduction that we've done over the years, including this year. And we feel like we're in a very good place there. And as we've examined that, and applying additional debt reduction to achieve an upgrade or whatever, we don't really see much of a cost of capital benefit for our equity investors resulting from that. So we do think we're in a very good place there.
And so that gives us the opportunity to then think about expansion capital projects. We exhaust a good returning, high returning, nice margin above our weighted average cost of capital on those returns. Those opportunities are less than they were in years past. And so we're funding the ones that make sense to fund. And that leaves us with a substantial amount of cash available after that.
And so we've increased the dividend from $1 to $1.05 and now $1.08 expectation for 2021, and leaving room for as much as $450 million in share repurchases. So I think we've done the right things by the balance sheet. We're funding the things that add the value to the firm in terms of additional projects where those make sense. We're not stretching that. If they don't make sense, we're not doing them.
And then we don't sit on the cash that we have. We look for ways to return that to our shareholders. And as you know, I mean the valuation between those 2, dividend versus share buybacks, the dividend, there's a good, reliable return of value to shareholders in that. There's not as much flexibility on it. So we've opted to have some flexibility to do share buybacks. And that's how we've laid it out.
In terms of the consolidation opportunities, our answer is pretty much the same there. We continue to look at those opportunities. The industry has been ripe for consolidation for years, one might say. Not sure what the catalyzing event turns out to be there, but it's something that we look at and evaluate.
It's got to meet a number of criteria. It has to deliver real value to our investors, of course. Has to be in businesses that we're confident that we can run safely, reliably and efficiently, of course. It has to be accretive, and it also can't mess up our balance sheet, which as we've looked at it, we've got to at least be leverage-neutral, and if anything, maybe leverage-accretive. And so our discipline there continues to be very robust."

So I will -- there's a lot of diversity, as you know, Jeremy, and how people are evaluating this. I think the ratings show that we are doing an effective job of communicating our ESG measures and managing our ESG risk. Our rating is based on how we're managing ESG risk. It's not based on having a really great ESG report. It's about how we manage that risk.
I think a lot of people recognized the need for natural gas and the value that natural gas has brought to the environment over the years. If you look back in 2017, we were 6 gigatons of annual emissions, CO2 equivalent emissions. We're now down to 5.1. And a big part of that -- and in an economy that's grown over that period, a big part of that has been the role that natural gas has played in power generation. And so yes, there are people who recognize the role of natural gas, and also how we're doing with our ESG risk management. And we are in ESG funds as a result of that.
Now that's not a universally held view, but it is something that we're proud of and that we continue to elaborate on with investors and continue to respond to questions and concerns as they are raised by the investment community.
You make a very good -- or you asked a very good question about Scope 3 emissions. One of the real advantages, and it's an extremely stubborn advantage of hydrocarbons, is that it's a very energy-dense form of energy. And so that means that with a relatively small footprint and a relatively small amount of capital, you can get an awful lot of energy for -- from the power plant, for example, a natural gas power plant. And it takes acres and acres and acres of solar panels and windmills to make that up. And because of the lack of energy density, an awful lot of manufacturing: A lot of mining, a lot of manufacturing a lot of disposal costs associated with building that up.
And so once we get to a point, a point that we're not at just yet, but once we get to a point, I think, where the public discourse around ESG expands to include those measurements on renewables, it brings natural gas much closer in terms of environmental impact.
Look, we work with renewable companies. We work with utilities who are increasing their renewable portfolios. We believe that our business plays an important enabling role there. But there is a lot more to, I would say, the natural gas story, once you take everything into account."

The Eagle Ford has still been weak. If you look at the Permian, the rig count there, that's where most of the rigs have been added since we came off the lows in August. And by our calculations, you're getting close to a rig level in the Permian that could get you back to flat volumes to where we were pre-pandemic. That won't happen immediately. That will take time to get there. And so I think with respect to producers and their guidance, I'd say a couple of things, one, I think they have to feel like that -- based on our conversations, they need to feel like that these -- the prices, especially on the crude side, are going to stay strong for a long period of time.
And right now, you've got the Saudis and others holding a lot of barrels off the market. And so that creates price uncertainty. I also think the producers are very focused on free cash flow. And so it's not clear how much they would ramp up CapEx in response to increasing prices. So I think a lot more to come there as we get into the year."

When you think about responsibly sourced natural gas, it's something we're out there marketing today. When you think about blending hydrogen in, to the extent that, that becomes available, or moving renewable natural gas, which is something that we already do today, the quantities are very small. But when it comes to originating and doing that kind of business, we're already very well fixed to do that within our existing business units.
That extends also to things like additional renewable liquid fuels, like renewable diesel, where both in our products group and in our terminals group, we are actively looking at and pursuing opportunities there today. And it's in businesses that we understand, that we know how to do and that we can help our customers get where they're going.
When it comes to the further step-outs, I think our approach is going to be, again, very conservative. We're going to look at the things that are adjacent to us, that we think makes sense for us to do. And we think that we can do that with folks in our organization and with us taking and continuing to take a hard look at some of those opportunities.
Wouldn't rule out M&A. But I think that's an area where you can move to more quickly than is prudent. And we're going to be prudent in how we approach it. And so I think it's more organic. But M&A or acquisitions wouldn't be off the table for the right opportunity. But I'm purposefully emphasizing organic, using the tools, the assets, the people and the opportunities that we have."

And then the pandemic happened. And so as you saw in other refined products volumes and demand for refined products movements, we saw that come off and come off relatively hard. And so that created kind of an unexpected pivot in the overall picture.
Now over the longer term, there aren't new Jones Act vessels that would compete with our MRs anyway that are being built right now. We think that, that market does come back into balance over time. But it has created some short-term weakness in demand. Beginning to see some nice uptick in inquiries and calls for quotes as we've gotten into 2021. But we did take a reduction there.
Now I would say, overall, Jones Act vessels are running probably -- again, this is a pandemic number, Jean Ann, so not representative of, call it, normal refined products operations, but, call it, 25% off higher. We're about half of that, meaning about 12.5%. So better, but we have some expirations coming up over the course of 2021.

I mean, what we -- we were moving kind of interim service -- this may not be what you're getting at. We were moving on interim service on PHP as we were commissioning compressor stations and the like. So we were delivering November and December, delivering volumes on PHP until we got it fully commissioned and put it in service and took nominations under the long-term firm contracts. It's fully underpinned by long-term firm contracts, starting on January 1.
Now we are -- we're also buying and selling gas. You made mention of interruptible. I think I know what you mean there. I mean, it is technically interruptible. A lot of that -- those -- that business is interruptible, but it's generally not interrupted. But we are buying and selling and optimizing on our Texas Intrastate network, some of which -- this is a unique element of the Texas market, some of which, of course, like the Interstate market, is on long-term transportation arrangements, including sometimes transportation arrangements that are PHP shippers, for example, hold downstream in order to get to an ultimate delivery point. And then other transportation arrangements that we make with producers and with end users to connect production to power plants, industrial facilities, utilities, et cetera.
And so what I would point to there is we now have an additional 2 Bcf a day hitting our system. A little less than that. It's not quite running 100% full. We got 2 Bcf a day coming from a couple of years ago when we brought GCX in service, another 2 Bcf coming from Whistler. What that is going to mean for us, I think, ultimately, is a great amount of natural gas that we provide a lot of the last mile connectivity to on our system in Texas. So generally, I think that's a bullish development.
You're right. The Waha spread has come in as that fully contracted pipeline system is up and running. And I think it will take a while, even with the development that Kim described, of additional rigs coming back out there. I think it was 2022 prices were up fairly significantly from what we're currently seeing in 2021. Eventually, we'd expect that system to fill back up, basis to widen back out and call it the middle of the decade, we would need some additional incremental transportation capacity.
But overall, the new facility coming in is under contract. What it does is bring a lot more to natural gas to our system, which is a good thing for our existing business on that system. Did I answer your question?"

Steve, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned carbon capture as a potential business opportunity for Kinder Morgan. And it sounded like in your prepared remarks, that the economics for carbon capture are not favorable at this time. So I was just curious what it would take to make this a more attractive business for Kinder Morgan.
And the reason I ask is Kinder has a real expertise in CO2, and this seems like a natural outgrowth of your business and something that you would have a competitive advantage in. So I'd love to just get your overall thoughts on that carbon capture opportunity."

And so if the recently published regulations on 45Q do make certain parts of the carbon capture opportunity, more economic win used in combination with enhanced oil recovery. And so the allowance, the tax credit allowance for EOR at the rate now approved makes things like gas processing, ethanol facilities more economic and may be economic. And that's an opportunity for us. There's nothing specific right now or deal-specific to talk about there. But it's gotten a lot closer and may actually be economic.
And so as we look at it from our business standpoint, from our business perspective, we do have in our treating business today, which is just standard, long existing, aiming technology to separate CO2 from -- whether it's a gas stream or a process facility separated, it then also has to be captured. And the purer the stream, the better, right? So it's purer in things like processing facilities and ethanol facilities.
It's got to be captured. It's got to be powered up. It's got to be transported, which is where we come in. And it's got to be put in the ground and stay there, which is also where we come in. And better still, you get oil from it, and that helps make the whole thing work. And so we're beginning to see some of those applications creep into economic territory.
And then marching up from there to things like capturing it from power plants and from other industrial uses that gets more expensive and then direct air capture is extremely expensive, given the very low concentration. So CO2 in the atmosphere, about 0.04% versus from a flue stream run from between 3% and 20%. So 75 to hundreds of times more economic from the flue stream. So we're just kind of on the edges of that now, starting to see some things that are getting interesting.
Jesse, any that -- anything you want to add?"

And so we'd expect to be talking to people ahead of that in order to be able to get something in service by, call it, the middle of this decade.
We think that we -- the advantage that we bring there are severalfold. One is that we've got a great, I think, the best Texas Gulf Coast pipeline network. We've got to get the supply to market, and increasingly, that means getting it to LNG markets, Mexico, getting it to the export markets, but also finding end uses in the growing petrochemical and industrial market along the Texas Gulf Coast. So we get people there, and then we've shown that in far more difficult circumstances than what we would anticipate for a Permian pass, we've been able to get projects done.
So we think we're in a good position. That's not a guarantee, of course. But we think it's a ways off. It's not that we're not having any conversations with people.

And you're right, there's some examination of splitting it, meaning oil and gas would be treated differently from other linear infrastructure that's typically used under Nationwide Rule 12. And what I would say, the impact of that is likely to be -- if it happens, is that it takes us more time and more effort to accomplish what we could have accomplished more quickly, but it doesn't prohibit it.
So for example, that's the permitting structure that allowed us to cross certain waterways with our construction activity. And that might become more individualized examinations of those crossings rather than having them grouped under a single permit umbrella, which adds time and cost, but it doesn't eliminate our ability to demonstrate that we're making those crossings in an environmentally responsible way, right?
So it's losing the advantage of a permitting process where NEPA has been taking care of, environmental impact statement, et cetera, has been taken care of, and one fell swoop versus having to do it on an individual project basis. So it adds time. It doesn't eliminate the opportunity."

That's point A.
Point B is more of a policy one. We're starting to see some states take a bit of policy-driven action regarding the future of demands for their gas-regulated utilities and trying to really restrict cap or limit demand or even shrink demand growth out of gas utilities. Just curious how you're thinking about how that would kind of -- what the impact is on your business going forward, if that kind of plays out.

On the cost side, no, those cost adjustments that we made as part of the organizational efficiency and effectiveness project, I think it's fair to think of those as permanent. Those are costs we took out of the structure, labor costs and other costs that we took out.
Every budget is a bottoms-up review, and cost requirements change, plus or minus, depending on what the emerging -- whether it's regulatory requirements or maintenance requirements or other things are. But we did some permanent, long-lasting work there. So I think that's the right way to think about that. And we'll give you some more detail in the conference. Some of that came through about 50-50 sort of split between the segments and between the corporate costs, like G&A and the like.
On the policy question, yes, it's something that we watch with some concern. It's not something that we are directly involved in, in terms of how states are thinking about their end uses and users of natural gas. I would point out, though, as you say -- as you pointed out, that it is in limited areas where this has become an issue. It's a [ course ] prospective. And so dealing with new construction, new homebuilding, et cetera. And that's a long internal growth in that market, as you know.
But the other thing is, I think on closer examination, people are going to be more concerned about it. When you think about developers who like to be showing houses that have natural gas, water heaters and furnaces and natural gas ranges and the like, they're not going to like that. That's less about what Kinder Morgan thinks than it is about people who are building things and producing jobs in the states at issue.
We've seen, in real life, restaurant owners react in a very negative way to it. And actually, one community pushed back an attempt to eliminate natural gas usage. And we've also seen in another jurisdiction that I won't mention that a lot of obstacles to getting natural gas infrastructure cited. And then when it became apparent that natural gas wasn't going to be available to end users in the state, a complete about-face in terms of asking the incumbent utilities to figure out a way to get additional natural gas in and not have moratoria in place.
And so I think -- I do think that there are many hands still to be played there. And from our perspective, while it is narrow, it's worth watching. And it's also one where, I think, we benefit and society benefits from giving it much closer examination."

On things like responsibly sourced natural gas, we're already there, and we're talking to customers about it. And as I've said, some of our LNG customers are very interested in it because it does matter. If you're a low emissions -- low-methane emissions transportation storage provider, which we are, we met our one future goal 7 years ahead of schedule, and the allocation to our sector was 0.30%. We're at 0.03%. So, I mean, we've really -- we've got a lot of good things to show our customers in that regard.
Serving as a backstop for renewables, our capacity as a backstop, our gas storage, has probably the cheapest and most efficacious energy storage versus batteries. We're right there right now. Renewable diesel, we're right there right now. The discussions we're having in California were, of course, the whole market is aided there by a low-carbon fuel standard.
Dax would tell you, our customers are saying, ""What can you do for us today?"" We're talking about renewable diesel hubs there that -- where we can build out some capability at good returns and provide a good service to our customers. And they're really in a hurry to get something there.
It's a little bit longer. It's not in a night thing in other parts of the country.  But as low carbon fuel standards spread, those things are going to be of greater interest.
On the other hand, things like hydrogen, hydrogen is promising. It's been the fuel of tomorrow for decades. And it takes a while to -- and it takes, I think, some subsidies to get it to a point where it's really [ actionable ] it's $19 in MMBtu today. And so will it ultimately serve a compelling fraction of the energy needs? Yes, but it is -- if you think about it, it's taking a very high-quality energy, like electricity, which is consumed primary energy to get there, to get it to electricity, taking electricity, using it to separate hydrogen from water and electrolysis, and then taking the hydrogen molecules in a transport fuel context, for example, putting them into a fuel cell and converting it back to what? Electricity.
So there's a lot to be done there to make that a sensible thing to do, but it could become sensible with the right supports and credits and the like. And today, as Kim pointed out, we can blend -- whoever is willing to invest in, and I think there are opportunities to invest in it, we can blend that into our existing system today. And I think that's an attractive proposition to those who are trying to lead the energy transition effort.
And so if it were in existence next year, we could move it on our pipelines next year. So that's not -- so, Timm, it does come down to, and as I mentioned, on CO2 capture. There are some things that are moving into actionable territory right now. There are other things that are a good ways off. And that's why it's important to be discerning about these things as we go, and that's the way we're going to approach it.
The things we can do today, the things that we can do tomorrow with the assets and businesses that we have today, and then what's the further step out from there and making sure that we're disciplined about how we approach that. So different innings on different energies."

To kick the call off, in addition to detailing our first quarter results, we made 2 important announcements in our earnings release today. We've revised our full year 2021 estimate for DCF and EBITDA substantially upward. Steve, Kim and David will explain the underpinnings of that change. We also increased our dividend to an annualized rate of $1.08 per share as we promised when we released our original outlook for 2021 back in December. In my judgment, this increase is an indicator of 2 significant parts of our corporate financial policy. First, it shows we are intent on returning value to our shareholders. Second, it demonstrates the consistent strength of our cash flow. 
To put this in perspective, this is the fourth consecutive annual increase in our dividend since 2017 when we were paying an annual dividend of $0.05 per share. And we have accomplished that while maintaining a real focus on our balance sheet, having reduced our debt from its peak of almost $43 billion in 2015 to $30.7 billion today, a decrease of over $12 billion, quite an improvement. And we're doing all this while continuing to pursue opportunities with our natural gas assets to firm up deliverability and supply to our customers, opportunities that were highlighted by the recent winter storm in Texas, and also while examining opportunities in the energy transition effort. 
At Kinder Morgan, we remain guided by what we believe is a sound corporate philosophy: fund our capital needs internally, maintain a healthy balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. We think this is a recipe for long-term financial success for KMI and its shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Kean, our CEO."

Also helpful were our investments in backup generators at key compressor stations on our system. 
Another real key for us was our team. Our operations team deployed in advance to keep our facilities running and quickly repair them if they went down. We deployed additional generators and tested our generators before the storm got here. Our people were at locations that are normally automated, and they were there in the bitter cold, and undoubtedly, many of them have their own families at home without power and water. Our team went to key compressor stations, storage facilities, and delivery points to keep gas flowing, including a key delivery point to the city of Austin. Our people kept us going. Our investments and especially our team winterized us against a terrible storm. 
We also purchased additional gas, some at very high prevailing prices, to serve power plants and gas utilities. The result of all this was that we enabled our wholesale customers to serve needs that would have otherwise gone unmet, mitigating the tragedy that too many Texans endured. We performed well operationally and commercially across our entire gas network, but our financial performance was especially strong in our Texas intrastate pipeline and storage network. And as I'll mention in a minute, in our CO2 business for reasons I'll explain. 
A key difference between our Texas intrastate system and our interstate gas pipeline systems is that we have a purchase and sale business in Texas, supported by high deliverability storage assets. In contrast, our interstate pipelines are nearly exclusively selling unbundled transportation and storage services. We do that in Texas, too, but we also have a purchase and sale business. That business is generally done with reference to an index price. For example, we sell gas at the Houston Ship Channel index plus something and buy at Houston Ship Channel minus something. 
In normal circumstances, we're effectively getting a transport margin on our purchases and sales and using our proprietary storage to extract margin from price differences across time periods. When prices are in a normal range, this is a very stable business. And we view our Texas intrastates as roughly 80% or so take-or-pay. 
In February, supply and demand conditions caused prices to go up by more than 100x and back down by the same order of magnitude over the course of a week. Market volatility like we experienced that week reveals the value of reliable pipeline and storage assets and a reliable operations team. It reveals the value of having gas in storage and previous purchase arrangements in place. 
It also reveals the value of preparation. In such circumstances in which supply and demand conditions causing prices to go up by more than 100x, we were able to perform well financially as well as operationally. Many of our additional sales, whether as a result of higher takes under our existing contracts or incremental sales that we were able to do during that week, took place at prevailing market prices, which during that week at the Houston Ship Channel range from $180 mmbtu to $400 versus $3 earlier in the same month. 
What does this mean for our business longer term? We transact with sophisticated customers who have choices. One of those choices is to purchase firm services from us on a long-term basis, and many of them do. While we view the events in our financial results as largely nonrecurring, we are already pursuing more long-term firm capacity sales and some associated capital investments that will help our customers to be even better positioned for future extreme weather and create incremental value for Kinder Morgan. 
There is substantial interest in our services following the storm, which should help us in our base business and in new origination. The results could be long term additional and more consistent earnings and investment without the extraordinary and rare gain that we experienced in the first quarter. The big lesson that should be taken away is that an appropriate amount of contracting for firm deliverability should be in everyone's portfolio. And February's event reveals the value of storage and firm transport capacity. And we would hope that any changes made in the market structure would adequately compensate and incent parties to do so. 
I mentioned our CO2 business also. This is a bit of a different effect. That's our biggest power consuming business in the state of Texas. Our power contract with our provider enables us to shed load and be compensated at the prevailing power prices. When they started to see where power prices were headed, Jessie Arenivas and his team started looking at shedding load. So we shut down oil production and shed the load back into the market, where it could be allocated to higher priority human needs. The contract work as designed, and particularly with prices as high as $9,000 a megawatt hour, we earned a substantial financial benefit while letting those megawatts be made available to serve human needs. 
Also notable, for the longer term, Jesse and his team were able to restore production quickly and fully following the storm. That's a great accomplishment. They had some practice when oil prices went drastically down last year, and we've gotten better at it since then. Our flexibility is greater. This is great flexibility that we've now built into a part of our business that consumes about 340 megawatts in the state of Texas. So good flexibility to have in the power market in the state of Texas. 
So we're very proud of our whole team's performance, but we have lessons to learn too. And we'll use those lessons to get even better at severe weather performance for us and for our customers. So what will we do with the proceeds? Initially, of course, it's a reduction to our net debt. But as we repeated many times, our financial principles remain the same. First, maintain a strong balance sheet. Second, we maintain our capital discipline through our return criteria, a good track record of execution and by self-funding our investments. And as I mentioned, we may see some incremental investment opportunities as a result of the storm. We don't expect those to be significant for 2021. 
Finally, we are returning value to our shareholders with a dividend increase that Rich mentioned. It's a well-covered dividend. And our approach to share repurchases remains exactly the same. We'll be selective, not programmatic. We'll base our decisions on the returns versus the alternative uses for the cash that we generate, including projects or assets. So strong balance sheet, capital and cost discipline, returning value to shareholders. Those are our principles. 
One other item before I turn it over to Kim, we announced the formation of an energy transition ventures team during the first quarter. We put together a team with financial, commercial and engineering talent to focus on analyzing and quantifying opportunities for additional assets and service offerings tailored to the ongoing energy transition. including things like renewable natural gas and carbon capture and sequestration. This group reports to Jesse Arenivas, who continues as President of our CO2 business, and is headed by Anthony Ashley, who previously served as Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. 
While still in our early, early days for this effort, they've already identified and are working on a number of specific opportunities. More to come. 
Also, as I said last time, our business units continue to focus on the energy transition opportunities that fit in with their operations, such as midstream services for renewable diesel and including our -- using our gas transportation and storage services to support renewable power. We are also marketing our low methane emissions performance as responsibly produced and transported natural gas. That's a good synergy between our ESG performance, our low methane emissions and our commercial opportunities. 
We participated in our first one of these transactions with Colorado Springs Utilities, which they announced in the first quarter. And we're working on another as we speak. We believe the winners in our sector will have strong balance sheets, low-cost operations that are reliable, safe and environmentally sound and the ability to get things done in difficult circumstances. We're proud of our team and our culture. And as always, we'll be prepared to meet the challenges and opportunities to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

First, I'm going to go through the business fundamentals for the quarter, and then I'll talk at a very high level about our full year forecast. And starting with the natural gas fundamentals. Transport volumes were down about 3% or",1269,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. First, I'm going to go through the business fundamentals for the quarter, and then I'll talk at a very high level about our full year forecast. 
And starting with the natural gas fundamentals. Transport volumes were down about 3% or approximately 1.1 million dekatherms per day versus the first quarter of '20. And that was driven primarily by declines in Rockies production, increase in transportation alternatives and lower production out of the Permian, those 2 things impacting our volumes on EPNG and contract expiration on our joint venture pipe coming out of the Fayetteville. These declines were partially offset by higher volumes, which were driven by increased deliveries to LNG export facilities, winter weather in the northeast and the PHP in service. 
Physical deliveries to LNG facilities off of our pipeline averaged approximately 4.7 million dekatherms per day. That's greater than a 25% increase versus the first quarter of 2020. LNG volumes were down from the approximately 5 million dekatherms per day in the fourth quarter of '20. And that was due to the impact of winter storm Uri and some coastal fog in February. 
During the storm, total LNG exports dropped to under 2 million dekatherms per day. In the first quarter, Kinder Morgan pipes moved approximately 47% of the volume going to LNG export facilities. Exports to Mexico on our pipes were up about 3% when compared to the first quarter of '20. Our share of Mexico deliveries in the first quarter ran about 55%. And deliveries to power plants, they were down due to higher natural gas prices. Deliveries to LDCs were up due to colder weather. 
One, on our natural gas gathering volumes, they were down about 25% in the quarter compared to the first quarter of '20. But for gathering volumes, I think the more informative comparison is the sequential quarter. So compared to the fourth quarter volumes, first quarter volumes were down about 11%. Approximately 2/3 of that 11% reduction are related to KinderHawk, which is our gathering asset in the Haynesville. But given that there are 45 rigs deployed in that basin, we expect that our volumes will increase sequentially each quarter for the balance of the year, although it will be a little bit slower than what we budgeted. 
Eagle Ford volumes were also down versus the fourth quarter, and we expect that those will be down versus our budget. The Eagle Ford remains a very tough market, given the oversupply of takeaway options. On the positive side, we expect volumes in the Bakken and Altamont to be on plan or better for the year. 
In our Products Pipeline segment, refined products volumes were down about 10% for the quarter versus the first quarter of 2020. And that's just the result of the continued pandemic impact. Gasoline volumes were up 6% versus the first quarter of '20. That's an improvement from the fourth quarter when they were off about 10% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Jet volumes remain weak off about 29%, but that's a big improvement from the fourth quarter when they were off 47% versus the fourth quarter And diesel volumes were up 6%, and that's relatively flat to the percentage in the fourth quarter. 
Total volumes moving through our pipes did improve each month during the quarter. March volumes were up slightly versus 2020, and they were down about 6% versus 2019. Currently, we're forecasting refined products to be down versus our plan, and I'll go through that a little bit later in my comments. 
Crude and condensate volumes were down about 28% in the quarter versus the first quarter of 2020. Sequentially, they were up 2%. Our Terminals business fundamentals have been impacted by 2 events: the winter storm and the continued impact of the pandemic. The winter storm was short lived, with the impact limited to the first quarter. The pandemic is lingering, and it continues to impact our petroleum product volumes as well as demand for our Jones Act tankers. However, as we've mentioned in prior quarters, the impact of reduced petroleum product demand on our tankage is more muted than in our product pipeline, given the fixed take-or-pay contracts for tank capacity. 
Our liquids utilization percentage, which reflects the tanks that we have under contract remains high at 95%. If you exclude tanks out of service for required inspection, utilization is about 98%. 
On the tankers, we have a number of ships that have contract expirations this year, and the market is relatively weak, given the weakness in refined product volumes. The reduction in crude oil production and the tightening WTI Brent spread also impacts this market, but to a much lesser extent, given a smaller percentage of the fleet engaged in that service. We expect this market to improve with the recovery in petroleum product demand. But that may take in for later this year because charter activity tends to lag underlying supply and demand fundamentals. 
The CO2 segment was up in the quarter due to our decision to curtail production and deliver power back to the grid that Steve mentioned. Excluding the storm impact, oil production was down approximately 15%. CO2 sales volumes were down 26%. Our net realized oil price was down about $3.50 per barrel. However, compared to our budget, we're currently anticipating the oil volumes, CO2 volumes and net realized oil price will exceed budget for the year. 
Now let me give you a very high-level update on our full year forecast. As we said in the release, we're currently projecting full year DCF of $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion versus our budget of $4.45 billion. We estimate that the Uri impact, and this is across all of our segments, was roughly where [indiscernible] and angina, $1 billion, leaving a variance again very roughly of $200 million to $350 million versus our budget. I know $200 million doesn't add up perfectly, but that's because these are very large rounded numbers. 
Let me start with the $200 million variance. We estimate that sustaining CapEx will be approximately $75 million higher than our budget due to the decision to replace some pipe and rule South Texas as opposed to continuing to spend money running inspection tools and repairing the pipe. We were also able to obtain the pipe at very attractive pricing. What I'll classify as pandemic-related impacts is roughly $80 million, and that includes weaker petroleum products volumes and lower renewal rates on Jones Act tankers. Those 2 items explain about 75% of the variance, but there are a lot of other moving parts. A couple of the other larger items include lower gathering volumes, primarily in the Eagle Ford, and the impact on DCF of [indiscernible] impairment. Those 2 items are roughly offset by positive performance in the CO2 segment, from higher CO2 and oil volumes and price. Finally, the sale of our 12.5% interest on NGPL creates a negative variance versus our budget. 
The difference in that low and the high end of the guidance range primarily relates to assumptions on petroleum products volumes, Jones Act tanker renewals, natural gas GMP volumes and the resolution of certain Uri contractual disputes. I think it's obvious, but just in case, the lower end of the guidance range assumes a more conservative outcome on these items. For example, The high end of the guidance range assumes petroleum products volume 3% below plan for the balance of the year versus the low end of the guidance assumes they're about 5% below plan for the balance of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to David Michels."

So for the first quarter of 2021, as Rich mentioned, we are declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share, which is 3% up from last quarter.

So for the first quarter of 2021, as Rich mentioned, we are declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share, which is 3% up from last quarter. Now looking at the financial performance for the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year, we generated revenues of $5.2 billion, up $2.1 billion. We had partial offsets in our -- a partial offset in our cost of sales with an increase of $1.3 billion there. So our gross margin was up $759 million, mostly driven by our strong performance during the winter storm. 
Our O&M costs declined as a result of the CO2 segment power load shed that Steve walked through. And that's the main item in the $106 million favorable O&M amount. In the first quarter of 2020, we also took impairments in our CO2 segment of $950 million, which explains most of the $975 million favorable in the item -- the line item called gain and loss on divestitures and impairments. 
This past quarter, we wrote off the value of our Ruby subordinated note, which was a reduction of $117 million in the earnings from equity investments. And that was driven by greater uncertainty regarding the recoverability of that note receivable. We also reflected a $206 million gain on the sale of a partial interest in NGPL, and that appears in the other net line item. So overall, we generated net income of $0.62 per share, which is very favorable versus the $0.14 loss in the first quarter of 2020. On an adjusted earnings per share basis, and then that's where we show earnings per share before certain items, we generated $0.60 per share versus $0.24 per share a year ago. 
Moving to our segment EBITDA and distributable cash flow performance. Our natural gas segment is up $915 million for the quarter, mostly explained by favorable intrastate margins as well as increased revenue on our Tennessee Gas Pipeline, both as a result of the February winter storm performance. We also had favorable contributions from PHP, which was placed in service at the beginning of the year. And these are all partially offset by lower contributions from our FEP pipeline resulting from the 2020 contract rollovers. 
Product segment was down $10 million, driven by lower refined product volumes on SFPP, lower crude oil volumes on KMCC and lower recontracting rates at HH, partially offset by greater contributions from our transmix business. 
Our Terminal segment was down $30 million. And that's -- [indiscernible] we're referring product volumes due to continued pandemic-related demand impacts as well as winter storm-related demand impacts. As has been mentioned, our Jones Act tanker contributions were also down lower due to the lower fleet utilization resulting from the pandemic-related market weakness. Storm-related refinery outages also drove decreased contributions from our pet coke facilities. And these were all somewhat offset by our expansion project contributions. 
Our CO2 segment was up $116 million this quarter versus a year ago, again due to the shedding load to deliver power to the grid. And partially offset by lower -- and that was partially offset by lower crude and CO2 volumes versus Q1 2020 and lower realized crude prices versus Q1 2020. 
Our G&A corporate and corporate charges were higher by $8 million. And there, we had lower capitalized overhead expenses, partially offset by our organizational efficiency savings. A JV depreciation, we had less JV DD&A from our Ruby investment there. And that's after Ruby recognized an entity-level asset impairment in the quarter resulting in lower depreciation. That brings us to adjusted EBITDA, which was $966 million or 52% higher than Q1 2020. 
Moving down below EBITDA. Interest expense was favorable by $52 million. They're lower LIBOR rates benefiting our interest rate swaps drove nice favorability as well as a lower debt balance and lower rates on our long-term debt. For the quarter, sustaining capital was favorable by $34 million, and that was driven by lower terminals and natural gas segment CapEx. But all of that is timing, and we expect to spend more sustaining capital for the full year versus 2020. 
In other, we had some lower pension cash contributions versus a year ago. This year, we have a little bit more back-end loaded cash contributions to our pension plan versus more equally spread quarterly contributions last year. So our total DCF was $2.329 billion, and was up $1.068 billion or 85%. And our DCF per share was $1.02, up $0.47 from last year's $0.55 per share. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 3.9x, down nicely from the 4.6x at year-end. And we currently project to end 2021 at 3.9 to 4.0x, and that's consistent with the ranges that Kim walked through. And that's largely a result of the largely nonrecurring winter storm benefits contributing to our EBITDA, but it also is a result of lower-than-budgeted debt balance due to the greater than budgeted cash flow. Our longer-term leverage target of 4.5x has not changed. 
We also have a very favorable liquidity position. We ended the quarter with almost $1.4 billion of cash on hand and only have $500 million of consolidated debt maturing for the rest of the year. So our net debt, which includes our cash on hand, ended the quarter at $30.7 billion, down $1.348 billion for the year -- from the year. And now, our net debt has declined by $12.1 billion or almost 30% since Q1 of 2015, as Rich mentioned, but is worth reiterating. 
So our quarter change to reconcile the change in debt of $1.35 billion for the quarter. We generated $2.329 billion in DCF. We paid dividends of $600 million. We made $200 million of contributions to our growth projects as well as 2 JVs. We received $413 million from the NGPL sale, and we had $600 million of -- approximately $600 million of working capital uses, primarily interest expense payments, AR increases and a rate case settlement on SFPP. That explains the majority of the net debt change and completes our first quarter financial review. So I'll turn it back to Steve."

Tom Martin and his team -- and Tom and his team really just -- they did an extraordinary job during the storm. The way their team worked, the integration between scheduling and commercial and operations and gas control is just stellar.

I appreciate the color there and look forward to future updates on it. Maybe as a follow-up question, in your prepared remarks and part of your response to Jeremy, you had mentioned the potential for the business. And maybe there's some capital but unlikely to happen this year, certainly in any size. And so when I think about the 1Q results, which clearly, you haven't expected when you sort of set the budget out for this year, does this give you some more confidence around the completion of the $450 million buyback target? I know you had said in your prepared remarks that it's opportunistic and so forth. But can you walk us through the decision-making process on the opportunistic framework if you're not really changing your capital budget at this point right now and you sort of have this excess cash that you weren't expecting initially. I'm just wondering if you can give us some color around the thought process."

We have the events of Uri, and that provides additional capacity. And then the offset -- partial offset is some of the negatives or the headwinds that Kim pointed out when she went through her analysis, some of which go away when you get on the other side of pandemic recovery whenever you want to call that. 
Having said all that though, We're really in the same place that we've been in terms of communicating on these scenarios as we were in 2017, which is We have capacity, but we're going to use it opportunistically. We're not going to set an amount out for you. We didn't include -- it didn't include actual buyback amounts in our budget. We just pointed to capacity. We're going to do it opportunistically, and we're going to do it based on returns and base through our -- and compared to our alternative uses of capital. 
So I know everybody wants a lot more specificity than that, but we're not giving prices, we're not giving amounts just like we haven't for the last 4 years. And that's still where we are. But we do have the additional capacity as pointed out."

Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking statements.
To kick the call off, in addition to detailing our first quarter results, we made 2 important announcements in our earnings release today. We've revised our full year 2021 estimate for DCF and EBITDA substantially upward. Steve, Kim and David will explain the underpinnings of that change. We also increased our dividend to an annualized rate of $1.08 per share as we promised when we released our original outlook for 2021 back in December. 
In my judgment, this increase is an indicator of 2 significant parts of our corporate financial policy. First, it shows we are intent on returning value to our shareholders. Second, it demonstrates the consistent strength of our cash flow. To put this in perspective, this is the fourth consecutive annual increase in our dividend since 2017, when we were paying an annual dividend of $0.50 per share. And we have accomplished that while maintaining a real focus on our balance sheet, having reduced our debt from its peak of almost $43 billion in 2015 to $30.7 billion today, a decrease of over $12 billion, quite an improvement. 
Now we're doing all this while continuing to pursue opportunities with our natural gas assets to firm up deliverability and supply to our customers, opportunities that were highlighted by the recent winter storm in Texas, and also while examining opportunities in the energy transition effort.
At Kinder Morgan, we remain guided by what we believe is a sound corporate philosophy, fund our capital needs internally, maintain a healthy balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. We think this is a recipe for long-term financial success for KMI and its shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Kean, our CEO."

I'll focus on our performance during Winter Storm Uri, which is what drove our financial results in the quarter. Then I'll turn it over to our President, Kim Dang, to cover the business updates. Our CFO, David Michels, will tak",1495,"All right. Thank you, Rich. I'll focus on our performance during Winter Storm Uri, which is what drove our financial results in the quarter. Then I'll turn it over to our President, Kim Dang, to cover the business updates. Our CFO, David Michels, will take you through the financials, and then we'll take your questions.  
So starting with the performance during the February winter storm. We were prepared, and that preparation served us well. Our previous investments in our assets, particularly on our gas storage assets, were a huge help. We were on maximum withdrawal for days at several of our fields. Also helpful were our investments in backup generators at key compressor stations on our system. 
Another real key for us was our team. Our operations team deployed in advance to keep our facilities running and quickly repair them if they went down. We deployed additional generators and tested our generators before the storm got here. Our people were at locations that are normally automated, and they were there in the bitter cold, and undoubtedly, many of them have their own families at home without power and water. 
Our team went to key compressor stations, storage facilities, and delivery points to keep gas flowing, including a key delivery point to the city of Austin. Our people kept us going. Our investments and especially our team winterized us against a terrible storm.  
We also purchased additional gas, some at very high prevailing prices, to serve power plants and gas utilities. The result of all this was that we enabled our wholesale customers to serve needs that would have otherwise gone unmet, mitigating the tragedy that too many Texans endured. We performed well operationally and commercially across our entire gas network, but our financial performance was especially strong in our Texas intrastate pipeline and storage network. And as I'll mention in a minute, in our CO2 business for reasons I'll explain.  
A key difference between our Texas intrastate system and our interstate gas pipeline systems is that we have a purchase and sale business in Texas, supported by high deliverability storage assets. In contrast, our interstate pipelines are nearly exclusively selling unbundled transportation and storage services. We do that in Texas, too, but we also have a purchase and sale business. That business is generally done with reference to an index price. For example, we sell gas at the Houston Ship Channel index plus something and buy at Houston Ship Channel minus something.  
In normal circumstances, we're effectively getting a transport margin on our purchases and sales and using our proprietary storage to extract margin from price differences across time periods. When prices are in a normal range, this is a very stable business. And we view our Texas Intrastates as roughly 80% or so take-or-pay. 
In February, supply and demand conditions caused prices to go up by more than 100x and back down by the same order of magnitude over the course of a week. Market volatility like we experienced that week reveals the value of reliable pipeline and storage assets and a reliable operations team. It reveals the value of having gas in storage and previous purchase arrangements in place. 
It also reveals the value of preparation in such circumstances in which supply and demand conditions causing prices to go up by more than 100x, we were able to perform well financially as well as operationally. Many of our additional sales, whether as a result of higher takes under our existing contracts or incremental sales that we were able to do during that week, took place at prevailing market prices. which during that week at the Houston Ship Channel, range from $180 MMBtu to $400 versus $3 earlier in the same month.  
What does this mean for our business longer term? We transact with sophisticated customers who have choices. One of those choices is to purchase firm services from us on a long-term basis, and many of them do. While we view the events in our financial results as largely nonrecurring, we are already pursuing more long-term firm capacity sales and some associated capital investments that will help our customers to be even better positioned for future extreme weather and create incremental value for Kinder Morgan. 
There is substantial interest in our services following the storm, which should help us in our base business and in new origination. The results could be long term additional and more consistent earnings and investment without the extraordinary and rare gain that we experienced in the first quarter. 
The big lesson that should be taken away is that an appropriate amount of contracting for firm deliverability should be in everyone's portfolio. And February's event reveals the value of storage and firm transport capacity. And we would hope that any changes made in the market structure would adequately compensate and incent parties to do so.  
I mentioned our CO2 business also. This is a bit of a different effect. That's our biggest power consuming business in the state of Texas. Our power contract with our provider enables us to shed load and be compensated at the prevailing power prices. 
When they started to see where power prices were headed, Jesse Arenivas and his team started looking at shedding load. So we shut down oil production and shed the load back into the market, where it could be allocated to higher priority human needs. The contract work, as designed and particularly with prices as high as $9,000 a megawatt hour, we earned a substantial financial benefit, while letting those megawatts be made available to serve human needs.
Also notable, for the longer term, Jesse and his team were able to restore production quickly and fully following the storm. That's a great accomplishment. They had some practice when oil prices went drastically down last year, and we've gotten better at it since then. Our flexibility is greater. This is great flexibility that we've now built into a part of our business that consumes about 340 megawatts in the state of Texas. So good flexibility to have in the power market in the state of Texas.  
So we're very proud of our whole team's performance, but we have lessons to learn too. And we'll use those lessons to get even better at severe weather performance for us and for our customers. So what will we do with the proceeds? Initially, of course, it's a reduction to our net debt. But as we repeated many times, our financial principles remain the same. First, maintain a strong balance sheet. Second, we maintain our capital discipline through our return criteria, a good track record of execution and by self-funding our investments. And as I mentioned, we may see some incremental investment opportunities as a result of the storm. We don't expect those to be significant for 2021.
Finally, we are returning value to our shareholders with a dividend increase that Rich mentioned. It's a well-covered dividend. And our approach to share repurchases remains exactly the same. We'll be selective, not programmatic, We'll base our decisions on the returns versus the alternative uses for the cash that we generate, including projects or assets. So strong balance sheet, capital and cost discipline, returning value to shareholders. Those are our principles.  
One other item before I turn it over to Kim, we announced the formation of an energy transition ventures team during the first quarter. We put together a team with financial, commercial and engineering talent to focus on analyzing and quantifying opportunities for additional assets and service offerings tailored to the ongoing energy transition, including things like renewable natural gas and carbon capture and sequestration. 
This group reports to Jesse Arenivas, who continues as President of our CO2 business, and is headed by Anthony Ashley, who previously served as Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. While still in our early days for this effort, they've already identified and are working on a number of specific opportunities. More to come. 
Also, as I said last time, our business units continue to focus on the energy transition opportunities that fit in with their operations, such as midstream services for renewable diesel and including our -- using our gas transportation and storage services to support renewable power. We are also marketing our low methane emissions performance as responsibly produced and transported natural gas. That's a good synergy between our ESG performance, our low methane emissions and our commercial opportunities.  
We participated in our first one of these transactions with Colorado Springs Utilities, which they announced in the first quarter. And we're working on another as we speak. We believe the winners in our sector will have strong balance sheets, low-cost operations that are reliable, safe and environmentally sound and the ability to get things done in difficult circumstances.

First, I'm going to go through the business fundamentals for the quarter, and then I'll talk at a very high level about our full year forecast.  Starting with the natural gas fundamentals. Transport volumes were down about 3% or app",1273,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. First, I'm going to go through the business fundamentals for the quarter, and then I'll talk at a very high level about our full year forecast.  
Starting with the natural gas fundamentals. Transport volumes were down about 3% or approximately 1.1 million dekatherms per day versus the first quarter of '20. And that was driven primarily by declines in Rockies production, increase in transportation alternatives and lower production out of the Permian, those 2 things impacting our volumes on EPNG and contract expiration on our joint venture pipe coming out of the Fayetteville.  
These declines were partially offset by higher volumes, which were driven by increased deliveries to LNG export facilities, winter weather in the northeast and the PHP in service. Physical deliveries to LNG facilities off of our pipeline averaged approximately 4.7 million dekatherms per day. That's greater than a 25% increase versus the first quarter of 2020. LNG volumes were down from the approximately 5 million dekatherms per day in the fourth quarter of '20. And that was due to the impact of Winter Storm Uri and some coastal fog in February. 
During the storm, total LNG exports dropped to under 2 million dekatherms per day. In the first quarter, Kinder Morgan pipes moved approximately 47% of the volume going to LNG export facilities. Exports to Mexico on our pipes were up about 3% when compared to the first quarter of '20. Our share of Mexico deliveries in the first quarter ran about 55%. Deliveries to power plants, they were down due to higher natural gas prices. Deliveries to LDCs were up due to colder weather.  
One, on our natural gas gathering volumes, they were down about 25% in the quarter compared to the first quarter of '20. But for gathering volumes, I think the more informative comparison is the sequential quarter. So compared to the fourth quarter volumes, first quarter volumes were down about 11%. 
Approximately 2/3 of that 11% reduction are related to KinderHawk, which is our gathering asset in the Haynesville. But given that there are 45 rigs deployed in that basin, we expect that our volumes will increase sequentially each quarter for the balance of the year, although it will be a little bit slower than what we've budgeted.
Eagle Ford volumes were also down versus the fourth quarter, and we expect that those will be down versus our budget. The Eagle Ford remains a very tough market, given the oversupply of takeaway options. On the positive side, we expect volumes in the Bakken and Altamont to be on plan or better for the year.  
In our Products Pipeline segment, refined products volumes were down about 10% for the quarter versus the first quarter of 2020. And that's just the result of the continued pandemic impact. Gasoline volumes were up 6% versus the first quarter of '20. That's an improvement from the fourth quarter when they were off about 10% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Jet volumes remain weak off about 29%, but that's a big improvement from the fourth quarter when they were off 47% versus the fourth quarter of '20. And diesel volumes were up 6%, and that's relatively flat to the percentage in the fourth quarter. 
Total volumes moving through our pipes did improve each month during the quarter. March volumes were up slightly versus 2020, and they were down about 6% versus 2019. Currently, we're forecasting refined products to be down versus our plan, and I'll go through that a little bit later in my comments. 
Crude and condensate volumes were down about 28% in the quarter versus the first quarter of 2020. Sequentially, they were up 2%. Our Terminals business fundamentals have been impacted by 2 events: the winter storm and the continued impact of the pandemic. The winter storm was short lived, with the impact limited to the first quarter. The pandemic is lingering, and it continues to impact our petroleum product volumes as well as demand for our Jones Act tankers. 
However, as we've mentioned in prior quarters, the impact of reduced petroleum product demand on our tankage is more muted than in our product pipeline, given the fixed take-or-pay contracts for tank capacity. Our liquids utilization percentage, which reflects the tanks that we have under contract remains high at 95%. If you exclude tanks out of service for required inspection, utilization is about 98%.
On the tankers, we have a number of ships that have contract expirations this year, and the market is relatively weak, given the weakness in refined product volumes. The reduction in crude oil production and the tightening WTI Brent spread also impacts this market, but to a much lesser extent, given a smaller percentage of the fleet engaged in that service. We expect this market to improve with the recovery in petroleum product demand. But that may take in for later this year because charter activity tends to lag underlying supply and demand fundamentals.
Now the CO2 segment was up in the quarter due to our decision to curtail production and deliver power back to the grid that Steve mentioned. Excluding the storm impact, oil production was down approximately 15%. CO2 sales volumes were down 26%. Our net realized oil price was down about $3.50 per barrel. However, compared to our budget, we're currently anticipating the oil volumes, CO2 volumes and net realized oil price will exceed budget for the year.  
Now let me give you a very high-level update on our full year forecast. As we said in the release, we're currently projecting full year DCF of $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion versus our budget of $4.45 billion. We estimate that the Uri impact, and this is across all of our segments, was roughly worst season [ hand grenade ] $1 billion, leaving a variance, again, very roughly, of $200 million to $350 million versus our budget. I know $200 million doesn't add up perfectly, but that's because these are very large rounded numbers.
Let me start with the $200 million variance. We estimate that sustaining CapEx will be approximately $75 million higher than our budget due to the decision to replace some pipe in rural South Texas as opposed to continuing to spend money running inspection tools and repairing the pipe. We were also able to obtain the pipe at very attractive pricing.  
What I'll classify as pandemic-related impacts is roughly $80 million, and that includes weaker petroleum products volumes and lower renewal rates on Jones Act tankers. Those 2 items explain about 75% of the variance, but there are a lot of other moving parts. A couple of the other larger items include lower gathering volumes, primarily in the Eagle Ford, and the impact on DCF of a Ruby impairment. Those 2 items are roughly offset by positive performance in the CO2 segment, from higher CO2 and oil volumes and price.
Finally, the sale of our 12.5% interest on NGPL creates a negative variance versus our budget. The difference in that low and the high end of the guidance range primarily relates to assumptions on petroleum products volumes, Jones Act tanker renewals, natural gas GMP volumes and the resolution of certain Uri contractual disputes. I think it's obvious, but just in case, the lower end of the guidance range assumes a more conservative outcome on these items. 
For example, The high end of the guidance range assumes petroleum products volume 3% below plan for the balance of the year versus the low end of the guidance assumes they're about 5% below plan for the balance of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to David Michels."

So for the first quarter of 2021, as Rich mentioned, we are declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share, which is 3% up from last quarter. Now looking at the financial performance for the first quarter of this year versus the first",1029,"All right. Thank you, Kim. So for the first quarter of 2021, as Rich mentioned, we are declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share, which is 3% up from last quarter. Now looking at the financial performance for the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year, we generated revenues of $5.2 billion, up $2.1 billion. We had partial offsets in our -- a partial offset in our cost of sales with an increase of $1.3 billion there. So our gross margin was up $759 million, mostly driven by our strong performance during the winter storm.  
Our O&M costs declined as a result of the CO2 segment power load shed that Steve walked through. And that's the main item in the $106 million favorable O&M amount. In the first quarter of 2020, we also took impairments in our CO2 segment of $950 million, which explains most of the $975 million favorable in the item -- the line item called gain and loss on divestitures and impairments.  
This past quarter, we wrote off the value of our Ruby subordinated note, which was a reduction of $117 million in the earnings from equity investments. And that was driven by greater uncertainty regarding the recoverability of that note receivable. We also reflected a $206 million gain on the sale of a partial interest in NGPL, and that appears in the other net line item. So overall, we generated net income of $0.62 per share, which is very favorable versus the $0.14 loss in the first quarter of 2020.
On an adjusted earnings per share basis, and then that's where we show earnings per share before certain items, we generated $0.60 per share versus $0.24 per share a year ago.
Moving to our segment EBDA and distributable cash flow performance. Our natural gas segment was up $915 million for the quarter, mostly explained by favorable intrastate margins as well as increased revenue on our Tennessee Gas Pipeline, both as a result of the February winter storm performance. 
We also had favorable contributions from PHP, which was placed in service at the beginning of the year. And these are all partially offset by lower contributions from our FEP pipeline resulting from the 2020 contract rollovers.  
Product segment was down $10 million, driven by lower refined product volumes on SFPP, lower crude oil volumes on KMCC and lower recontracting rates at HH, partially offset by greater contributions from our transmix business. 
Our Terminal segment was down $30 million. And that's [ rural ] refined product volumes due to continued pandemic-related demand impacts as well as winter storm-related demand impacts. As has been mentioned, our Jones Act tanker contributions were also down lower due to the lower fleet utilization resulting from the pandemic-related market weakness. Storm-related refinery outages also drove decreased contributions from our pet coke facilities. And these were all somewhat offset by our expansion project contributions.  
Our CO2 segment was up $116 million this quarter versus a year ago. Again, due to the shedding load to deliver power to the grid. And partially offset by lower -- and that was partially offset by lower crude and CO2 volumes versus Q1 2020 and lower realized crude prices versus Q1 2020.
Our G&A at corporate and corporate charges were higher by $8 million. And there we had lower capitalized overhead expenses, partially offset by our organizational efficiency savings. JV depreciation, we had less JV DD&A from our Ruby investment there. And that's after Ruby recognized an entity-level asset impairment in the quarter resulting in lower depreciation. That brings us to adjusted EBITDA, which was $966 million or 52% higher than Q1 2020.  
Moving down below EBITDA. Interest expense was favorable by $52 million. They're lower LIBOR rates benefiting our interest rate swaps drove nice favorability as well as a lower debt balance and lower rates on our long-term debt. 
For the quarter, sustaining capital was favorable by $34 million, and that was driven by lower terminals and natural gas segment CapEx. But all of that is timing, and we expect to spend more sustaining capital for the full year versus 2020.  
In other, we had some lower pension cash contributions versus a year ago. This year, we have a little bit more back-end loaded cash contributions to our pension plan versus more equally spread quarterly contributions last year. So our total DCF was $2.329 billion, and was up $1.068 billion or 85%. And our DCF per share was $1.02, up $0.47 from last year's $0.55 per share.  
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 3.9x, down nicely from the 4.6x at year-end. And we currently project to end 2021 at 3.9x to 4.0x, and that's consistent with the ranges that Kim walked through. And that's largely a result of the largely nonrecurring winter storm benefits contributing to our EBITDA, but it also is a result of lower-than-budgeted debt balance due to the greater than budgeted cash flow. 
Our longer-term leverage target of 4.5x has not changed. We also have a very favorable liquidity position. We ended the quarter with almost $1.4 billion of cash on hand and only have $500 million of consolidated debt maturing for the rest of the year. So our net debt, which includes our cash on hand, ended the quarter at $30.7 billion, down $1.348 billion for the year -- from the year. And now, our net debt has declined by $12.1 billion or almost 30% since Q1 of 2015, as Rich mentioned, but is worth reiterating.
So our quarter change to reconcile the change in debt of $1.35 billion for the quarter. We generated $2.329 billion in DCF. We paid dividends of $600 million. We made $200 million of contributions to our growth projects as well as to JVs. We received $413 million from the NGPL sale, and we had $600 million of -- approximately $600 million of working capital uses, primarily interest expense payments, AR increases and a rate case settlement on SFPP. 
That explains the majority of the net debt change and completes our first quarter financial review. So I'll turn it back to Steve."

But we do believe that part of the answer here to where the administration wants to go is going to be carbon capture and sequestration. We sequester carbon today, as you know.

John Schlosser, in his business, he deals with biofuels and renewable diesel today, as does Dax Sanders in the products business dealing with those. We think we're working on projects there, too. Tom Martin and his team -- and Tom and his team really just -- they did an extraordinary job during the storm. The way their team worked, the integration between scheduling and commercial and operations and gas control was just stellar. 
But part of what they're doing is out marketing responsibly-sourced gas and things like that as well as backup for renewable generation as it increases in penetration. The Energy Transition Ventures group is really more focused on things that we don't do today or are not immediate extensions of our business. Carbon capture is not a part of our business today. That's something that goes there. Renewable natural gas is something that they're looking at.

As far as flows westbound to California, I don't really have any specific insight there other than from what we hear, there's expectations of warmer summer so that could have some additional volumes flowing to California, maybe different than what we saw last year or certainly what we expected at the beginning of the year or late last year."

So there may be some ways to narrow the exposure there. 
But yes, there's a lot of this -- so that part of it is kind of driven by customer commitments and people coming out with their plans for how they're going to reduce their own CO2 emissions or they're going to become more green in whatever way. 
And so there's that driver as well as, as you said, the LCFS and the RINs.

Before we begin, as usual, I'd like to remind you that KMI's earnings release today and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. Before making any investment decision, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking statements.
With that out of the way, let me just say that like a broken record, each quarter, I open our call with comments on the strong cash flow we're generating and how we're using and intend to use that cash flow. Whether you look at our cash flow for the second quarter, for year-to-date, our projections for the full year, it's apparent that we continue to be a strong generator of cash flow. It's also apparent that we continue to live comfortably within that cash flow.
The question investors should ask on a continuous basis is whether we are wise stewards of that cash. We have said repeatedly that we would use our funds to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay a good and growing dividend, invest in new projects or acquisitions when they met our relatively high return hurdle rates and opportunistically repurchase our shares.
This quarter, we announced 2 fairly significant acquisitions. The first was our purchase of the Stagecoach natural gas storage and pipeline assets in the Northeast for approximately $1.2 billion. These assets expand our services to our customers by helping connect natural gas supply with Northeast demand areas. The acquisition is immediately accretive to our shareholders, and I believe it will be an important and profitable asset for KMI for many years to come.
Our second acquisition is to make an attractive platform investment in the rapidly growing renewable natural gas market by purchasing Kinetrex for approximately $300 million. Steve will talk about this acquisition in detail. We believe there is a bright future for this business and other related energy transition businesses that we are exploring.
Now let me conclude with 2 important points. Both of these acquisitions meet our hurdle rates that I referred to earlier, and both are being paid for with our internally generated cash. I believe both fit within the long-term financial strategy that I speak to each quarter, and I can assure you that our Board looks at all alternatives in a manner completely consistent with that financial strategy.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

We closed that transaction earlier this month. I",920,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to make a couple of additional comments about the 2 acquisitions and then turn it over to Kim and David.
On the Stagecoach storage and transportation assets were $1.2 billion. We closed that transaction earlier this month. It adds 41 Bcf of certificated and pretty flexible working gas storage capacity and 185 miles of pipeline. We're excited about this transaction for several reasons. As we discussed on the first quarter call, we think storage value is going to increase over time. Its value was certainly revealed during Winter Storm Uri, and we've seen that start to show up in our commercial transactions.
Storage will also become more valuable as more intermittent renewable resources are added to the grid. The Stagecoach assets are well interconnected with our Tennessee Gas Pipeline system as well as other third-party systems in a part of the country that is constrained from an infrastructure standpoint, and frankly, where it is difficult to get new infrastructure permitted and built. We're excited about this transaction and believe it will pay off nicely for our shareholders.
The second transaction, which we announced at the end of last week, was accomplished by our newly formed Energy Transition Ventures Group. We put that together in the first quarter of this year. We're acquiring Kinetrex, a renewable natural gas business, subject to regulatory approval and a couple of other closing conditions. At signing, Kinetrex had secured 3 new signed development projects that we will build out over the next 18 months, resulting in a purchase price plus capital at a less than 6x EBITDA multiple by the time we get to 2023.
With Kinetrex, we're picking up a rare platform investment in a highly fragmented market. It gives us a nice head start of working on hundreds, if not thousands, of potential renewable natural gas project candidates in the U.S.
A few more points on this deal. As several of you pointed out in your comments post announcement, the value is dependent on RINs value. You don't make money on the gas sale, with an important exception that I'll get to in a minute. Importantly, the particular RINs that this business generates are D3 RINs, which can be used to satisfy other RINs obligations as well. D3s are for advanced biofuels, and promoting more of those in the transportation fuel market has had bipartisan support and even more support from the environmental community than conventional ethanol.
While there is some regulatory flexibility in EPA's hands, there is an underlying statutory framework, again with bipartisan support, combined with widely acknowledged greenhouse gas benefits that further protects the value of this category of RINs in particular.
Having said that, we believe we'll have the opportunity to mitigate our exposure to RINs pricing volatility. Based on conversations with potential customers, not signed deals yet but conversations so far, there is significant interest in renewable natural gas in the so-called ""voluntary market."" These are customers who are outside of the transport fuel market who are interested in reducing their carbon footprint and we believe would transact on a long-term fixed price basis.
There are also potential customers interested in sharing the risk and reward of the RINs value. So we will look for appropriate ways to lock in the value of the environmental attributes on attractive terms.
When we talked about our Energy Transition Ventures Group in the past, we've talked about transacting on attractive returns for our shareholders, not lost leaders and not doing things for show. This deal is a great example of that. In the team's short existence so far, they've acted on an attractive opportunity, and they continue to work on a number of other specific project opportunities. So very good progress in a short period of time.
These 2 deals illustrate a couple of key points, broader points, about our business. The larger deal, Stagecoach, is a further investment in our existing natural gas business, where we own the largest transportation and storage network in the country. That reflects our view that our existing business will be needed for decades to come. Hydrocarbons, and especially natural gas, have very stubborn advantages and will play an essential role in meeting the growing need for energy around the world. That's something we are well positioned for with our assets and especially considering our considerable connectivity with export markets, especially in natural gas but also in refined products.
At the same time, we do see opportunities in the energy evolution, I'm putting emphasis on evolution, and we're positioning ourselves there as well. We're doing this in our base business, where our gas delivery capability provides the needed backup for renewables at far lower cost and longer duration than batteries. We're doing it in responsibly sourced that is low methane emissions natural gas. We had our second such transaction this quarter. We're doing it in our refined products businesses where we handle renewable transportation fuels, and we are actively developing additional business in that part of our business as well.
The Kinetrex transaction, while relatively small, positions us to develop a new business line in the renewable energy space at attractive returns and with a bit of a head start. The takeaway from all of this is that we continue to see strong long-term value in the assets and service offerings we have today while also pivoting in an appropriate and value-creating way to the faster-growing parts of the energy business.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

First, I'm going to start with our business fundamentals, and then I'll talk very high level about our forecast for the full year.Starting with the natural gas business fundamentals for the quarter. Transport volumes were up 4% or a",759,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. First, I'm going to start with our business fundamentals, and then I'll talk very high level about our forecast for the full year.
Starting with the natural gas business fundamentals for the quarter. Transport volumes were up 4% or approximately 1.5 dekatherms per day versus the second quarter of 2020. And that was driven primarily by LNG, Mexico exports, partially offset by lower volumes on CIG. And that's due to declines in Rockies production and Fayetteville Express contract expirations.
Physical deliveries to LNG off of our pipeline averaged approximately 5 million dekatherms per day. That's a huge increase versus the second quarter of 2020. LNG volumes also increased versus the first quarter of this year by approximately 8%. Our market share of LNG export volumes is about 48%. Exports to Mexico were up about 20% versus the second quarter of 2020. Our share of Mexico volumes is about 54%. Overall, deliveries to power plants were relatively flat. Deliveries to LDCs were down slightly, while deliveries to industrial facilities were up 4%.
Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 12% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of '20. For gathering volumes, though, I think the more informative comparison is the sequential quarter. So compared to the first quarter of this year, volumes were up about 6%. And here, we saw nice increases in Hiland volumes, which were up about 10%; and  the Haynesville volumes, reports were up about 13%.
In our products pipeline segment, refined products were up 37% for the quarter versus the second quarter of '20. Volumes are also up about 17% versus the first quarter of this year. So we saw substantial improvement both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Compared to the pre-pandemic levels, and we're using the second quarter of 2019 as the reference point, road fuels, and that's gasoline and diesel combined, are essentially flat, and jet fuel is still down about 26%.
Crude and condensate volumes were up 6% in the quarter versus the second quarter of '20, and sequentially, they were up very slightly. In our Terminals business segment, our liquids utilization remains high. If you exclude the tanks out of service or required inspections, approximately 98% of our tanks are leased. Most of the revenue that we receive comes from fixed monthly charges we receive for tanks under lease, but we do receive a marginal amount of revenue from throughput, and we saw throughput increase significantly, about 22% in total on our liquids terminals, 26% if you're just looking at refined products. But that still remains a little bit below 2019, 6% on total liquids volumes, 5% when you're just looking at gasoline and diesel.
We continue to experience some weakness in our marine tanker business. But as we said last quarter, we expect that this market will improve, but it may take until late this year as the charter activity tends to lag the underlying supply and demand fundamentals.
On the bulk side, volumes increased by 23%, and that was driven by coal and steel. Mill utilization of our largest steel customer exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Coal export economics improved for both met and thermal coal.
In the CO2 segment, crude volumes were down about 9%. CO2 volumes were down about 10% year-over-year. Increased oil and NGL prices did offset some of the volume degradation. But if you compare to our budget, we're currently anticipating the oil volumes will exceed our budget by approximately 5%, and that's driven primarily by some nice performance on SACROC. CO2 volumes, we also expect to exceed our budget.
So overall, we're seeing increased natural gas volumes and demand from LNG and Mexico exports as well as industrial demand on the Gulf Coast. We're seeing increased gathering volumes in the Bakken and the Haynesville and nice recovery of refined products volumes. Crude oil volumes are above our expectations in our CO2 segment, and we're getting some price help. We still experienced some weakness in our Jones Act tankers, and the Eagle Ford remains highly competitive.
Now let me give you a very high-level update of our full year forecast. As we said in the release, we're currently projecting full year DCF of $5.4 billion. That's above the high end of the range that we gave you last quarter. The range we gave you last quarter was $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion. The outperformance versus the high end of the range is driven by our Stagecoach acquisition, higher commodity prices and better refined products volumes.
And with that, I'll turn it over to David."

For the second quarter of 2021, we're declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share, which is $1.08 annualized, and that's up 3% from the second quarter of 2020. This quarter, we generated revenue of $3.15 billion, which is up $590 million from the second quarter of 2020. We also had higher cost of sales with an increase there of $495 million. So netting those 2 together, gross margin was up $95 million.
This quarter, we also took an impairment of our South Texas gathering and processing assets of $1.6 billion. So with that impact, we generated a loss -- net loss of $757 million for the quarter.
Looking at adjusted earnings, which is before certain items, primarily the South Texas asset impairment this quarter and the midstream goodwill impairment a year ago, we generated income of $516 million this quarter, up $135 million from the second quarter of 2020.
Moving on to the segment EBDA and distributable cash flow performance. Natural gas -- our natural gas segment was up $48 million for the quarter, and that was up primarily due to favorable margins in our Texas Intrastate business; greater contributions from our PHP asset, which is now in service; and increased volumes on our Bakken gas gathering systems. Partially offsetting those items were lower volumes on our South Texas and KinderHawk gathering and processing assets and lower contributions from FEP due to contract roll-offs.
Our product segment was up $66 million driven by a nice recovery in refined product volume. Terminals was up $17 million, also driven by the nice refined product volume recovery, partially offset by lower utilization of our Jones Act tankers. Our CO2 segment was down $5 million due to lower crude oil and CO2 volumes and some increased well work costs. Those are partially offset by higher realized crude oil and NGL pricing.
Our G&A and corporate charges were lower by $7 million. This is where we benefited from our organizational efficiency savings as well as some lower noncash pension expenses, partially offset by some lower capitalized G&A costs. Our JV DD&A category was lower by $27 million primarily due to Ruby. And that brings us to our adjusted EBITDA of $1.670 billion, which is 7% higher than the second quarter of 2020.
Moving below EBITDA. Interest expense was $16 million favorable driven by our lower LIBOR rates benefiting our interest rate swaps as well as a lower debt balance and lower rates on our long-term debt. And those are partially offset by lower capitalized interest expenses versus last year. Our cash taxes for the quarter were unfavorable $40 million, mostly due to Citrus, our products Southeast pipeline and Texas margin tax deferrals, which were taken in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, just timing. And for the full year, our cash taxes are in line with our budget.
Our sustaining capital was unfavorable $51 million for the quarter driven by higher spend in our natural gas, CO2 and Terminals segments, but that higher spend is in line with what we had budgeted for the quarter. Our total DCF of $1.025 billion is up 2%, and our DCF per share of $0.45 per share is up $0.01 from last year.
On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 3.8x debt-to-EBITDA, which is down nicely from 4.6x at year-end. Kim already mentioned that we updated our full year guidance, which now has DCF and EBITDA above the top end of the range that we provided in the first quarter. For debt-to-EBITDA, we expect to end the year at 4.0x. That includes the acquisitions of Stagecoach, which we closed on July 9; and Kinetrex, which we expect to close in the third quarter.
As a reminder, that level -- that -- our year-end debt-to-EBITDA level has the benefits of the largely nonrecurring EBITDA generated during Winter Storm Uri earlier in the year, and our longer-term leverage target of around 4.5x has not changed.
On to reconciliation of our net debt. The net debt for the quarter ended at $30 billion, almost $30.2 billion, down $1.847 billion from year-end and about $500 million down from Q1. Our net debt has now declined by over $12 billion or about 30% since our peak levels.
To reconcile the change in the quarter in net debt, we generated $1.025 billion of DCF. We paid out approximately $600 million of dividends. We spent approximately $100 million of growth capital and contributions to our joint ventures. And we had $175 million of working capital source of cash flows, primarily interest expense accrual. That explains the majority of the change for the quarter. For the change year-to-date, we generated $3.354 billion of distributable cash flow. We spent $1.2 billion on dividends. We've spent $300 million on growth CapEx and JV contributions. We received $413 million on our partial interest sale of NGPL. And we have experienced a working capital use of approximately $425 million, and that explains the majority of the change for the year.
That completes the financial review, and I will turn it back to Steve."

And we think what we bring to the table in terms of competitive advantages, our existing network and our existing footprint. And I would describe that just in terms of the obvious physical assets, the pipelines and storage that we have, but also the customer access and customer contacts that we have that will enable us, I think, in some decent-sized chunks to develop and originate some additional business really in both categories: the voluntary market as well as the transport market.
We've got good project management expertise. We're actually looking at whether or not we can make some of the equipment that's being deployed in these areas.

And we update that, as you know, every January, when we do our investor conference. And we'll do that again. But it is -- we see it as being lower in terms of the rollout post 2021.
And so the background there, as I think you know well, is that 10 years ago or a little bit more, we built a number of pipelines that were kind of point-to-point pipelines. And they were built on the strength of long-term contractual commitments in a very high-basis environment. And so as you get to the end of those 10- or 10-plus-year contracts and they start to roll off, they're rolling off into a more challenged-basis environment for those particular pipes. And so that has had the effect of kind of masking or dampening, however you want to see it, some of the, I think, strong underlying performance in our natural gas pipeline segment. So that's what's been going on. And as I said, I think we see that as being lower from here.
In terms of your broader question, it is -- we invest all of our capital on a return. Everyone -- each one stands on its own from a return standpoint. We've been getting good returns. As we show in our our performance update there, very attractive returns on the capital that we've deployed.
In terms of the overall puts and takes, though, there are puts and takes across a diversified asset portfolio like ours. And those puts and takes and the uncertainty around them in further out-periods are hard enough to quantify or uncertain enough to quantify for me to give you a specific answer to your question about base business then plus, right?
And so generally, what we do is give you the best view we can of the fundamental drivers underpinning our business economically and commercially so that our investors can make their own -- come to their own expectations about that future. But we don't guide beyond the current budget year or updates to the guidance like we're giving you today.

And for our business, we've tried to distinguish ourselves with our customers as a storage provider and a transport provider and a good operating partner to be able to capture as much of that business as we can. We have a very good share of that business moving through our pipes today, and we look to expand it. And the map of where those facilities are coming in is lined up very nicely with our natural gas pipeline footprint.
And just to put a little more context on it. As we look at -- and this is a different time frame now, 2020 to 2030, the growth that we see in natural gas happening over that 10-year period, 80% of that is Texas and Louisiana, and a lot of that is the export market.

And then just overall, on the broader picture, natural gas, midstream infrastructure, our pipeline network and our storage network continues to attract good value. Coming out of the winter storm, for example, not just in Texas, but really along our system, we've successfully transacted for incremental and also attractive, that is increasing renewal rates, particularly on our storage assets, especially in Texas, but also elsewhere on our system. It was a bit of a, I think, a wake-up call to the market generally that there is real value in having that delivery flexibility and real value in holding firm transport capacity.

I'll start, and then I'll ask Jesse to comment more specifically on the deal front. You made the right point in your opening on the question, which is that the near-term opportunity really is along existing infrastructure and primarily processing and also ethanol plants because the CO2 stream is pure -- or fairly pure there. And so it still needs to be compressed and get it into the pipe, et cetera.
The other thing about it is the pipe itself, right? The CO2 moves most efficiently in a liquid state, which means high pressure. So that's 1,800 to 2,200 psi. And what that means is you're not going to repurpose a lot of gas pipe or oil pipe for that, for example, when you tend to operate in, call it, 600 psi to maybe 1,450 on the newer gas pipes. And so that has been a barrier, right? If you've got to build new heavy-wall pipe in order to get it to a place where you can sequester it, that's a barrier. EOR is a valuable application of that CO2. And so that does make that the near-term opportunity.
So having said that, I'll ask Jesse to comment on timing and current deal activity."

Question 2 is a follow-up one. Somebody earlier asked a little bit about the asset mix and asset disposals. And Steve, I think you made the comment about everything for a price. Well, it's -- where does Elba fit into that? Because it seems like the infrastructure funds market or others are paying pretty healthy multiples minority stakes in LNG -- contracted LNG facilities.

And in terms of its -- how it fits in the overall portfolio, it is kind of integrated with our broader system. We have the Elpress pipeline, which we have opportunities on as well. We have the potential to do more at Elba in terms of storage and the like. And it's interconnected with our SNG system. And so it fits nicely within the portfolio of assets we have.
Also, as you know, I mean, it's under a long-term contract with Shell, which is an attractive credit and sort of risk profile for us, long -- very long-term contract with Shell. And so it fits very well, and we did a partial sell-down earlier, as I mentioned.

And then I don't know how long it will take the EPA necessarily to act.
But once it acts and the railroad commission has control of it, I think they're going to process them very quickly. Jesse made the point earlier, the permitting process itself is -- today at the EPA is just very slow. Now I would think that they are going to want to, as a public policy matter, speed it up anyway, right? But it's 5 or 6 years right now. That doesn't work. And so whether it's the EPA speeding itself up in order to enable more of this for its own policy objectives or whether it's the railroad commission getting control of it, it will get sped up.
In terms of onshore versus offshore, we're obviously onshore-focused in the opportunity that we have and given what our footprint of the existing pipeline network is, which is a very important consideration for the reasons I said earlier.
But Jesse, do you have any other comments on onshore versus offshore?"

Before we begin, as usual, I'd like to remind you that KMI's earnings release today and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. Before making any investment decision, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking statements.
With that out of the way, let me just say that like a broken record, each quarter, I open our call with comments on the strong cash flow we're generating and how we're using and intend to use that cash flow. Whether you look at our cash flow for the second quarter, for year-to-date, or our projections for the full year, it's apparent that we continue to be a strong generator of cash flow. It's also apparent that we continue to live comfortably within that cash flow.
The question investors should ask on a continuous basis is whether we are wise stewards of that cash. We have said repeatedly that we would use our funds to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay a good and growing dividend, invest in new projects or acquisitions when they met our relatively high return hurdle rates and opportunistically repurchase our shares.
This quarter, we announced 2 fairly significant acquisitions. The first was our purchase of the Stagecoach natural gas storage and pipeline assets in the Northeast for approximately $1.2 billion. These assets expand our services to our customers by helping connect natural gas supply with Northeast demand areas. The acquisition is immediately accretive to our shareholders, and I believe it will be an important and profitable asset for KMI for many years to come.
Our second acquisition is to make an attractive platform investment in the rapidly growing renewable natural gas market by purchasing Kinetrex for approximately $300 million. Steve will talk about this acquisition in detail. We believe there is a bright future for this business and other related energy transition businesses that we are exploring.
Now let me conclude with 2 important points. Both of these acquisitions meet our hurdle rates that I referred to earlier, and both are being paid for with our internally generated cash. I believe both fit within the long-term financial strategy that I speak to each quarter, and I can assure you that our Board looks at all alternatives in a manner completely consistent with that financial strategy.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

I'm going to make a couple of additional comments about the 2 acquisitions and then turn it over to Kim and David.On the Stagecoach, storage and transportation assets drew $1.2 billion. We closed that transaction earlier this month.",920,"Okay. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to make a couple of additional comments about the 2 acquisitions and then turn it over to Kim and David.
On the Stagecoach, storage and transportation assets drew $1.2 billion. We closed that transaction earlier this month. It adds 41 Bcf of certificated and pretty flexible working gas storage capacity and 185 miles of pipeline. We're excited about this transaction for several reasons. As we discussed on the first quarter call, we think storage value is going to increase over time. Its value was certainly revealed during Winter Storm Uri, and we've seen that start to show up in our commercial transactions.
Storage will also become more valuable as more intermittent renewable resources are added to the grid. The Stagecoach assets are well interconnected with our Tennessee Gas Pipeline system as well as other third-party systems in a part of the country that is constrained from an infrastructure standpoint, and frankly, where it is difficult to get new infrastructure permitted and built. We're excited about this transaction and believe it will pay off nicely for our shareholders.
The second transaction, which we announced at the end of last week, was accomplished by our newly formed Energy Transition Ventures Group. We put that together in the first quarter of this year. We're acquiring Kinetrex, a renewable natural gas business, subject to regulatory approval and a couple of other closing conditions. At signing, Kinetrex had secured 3 new signed development projects that we will build out over the next 18 months, resulting in a purchase price plus capital at a less than 6x EBITDA multiple by the time we get to 2023.
With Kinetrex, we're picking up a rare platform investment in a highly fragmented market. It gives us a nice head start on working on hundreds, if not thousands, of potential renewable natural gas project candidates in the U.S.
A few more points on this deal. As several of you pointed out in your comments post announcement, the value is dependent on RINs value. You don't make money on the gas sale, with an important exception that I'll get to in a minute. Importantly, the particular RINs that this business generates are D3 RINs, which can be used to satisfy other RINs obligations as well. D3s are for advanced biofuels, and promoting more of those in the transportation fuel market has had bipartisan support and even more support from the environmental community than conventional ethanol.
While there is some regulatory flexibility in EPA's hands, there is an underlying statutory framework, again with bipartisan support, combined with widely acknowledged greenhouse gas benefits that further protects the value of this category of RINs in particular.
Having said that, we believe we'll have the opportunity to mitigate our exposure to RINs pricing volatility. Based on conversations with potential customers, not signed deals yet but conversations so far, there is significant interest in renewable natural gas in the so-called ""voluntary market."" These are customers who are outside of the transport fuel market who are interested in reducing their carbon footprint and we believe would transact on a long-term fixed price basis.
There are also potential customers interested in sharing the risk and reward of the RINs value. So we will look for appropriate ways to lock in the value of the environmental attributes on attractive terms.
When we talked about our Energy Transition Ventures Group in the past, we've talked about transacting on attractive returns for our shareholders, not loss leaders and not doing things for show. This deal is a great example of that. In the team's short existence so far, they've acted on an attractive opportunity, and they continue to work on a number of other specific project opportunities. So very good progress in a short period of time.
These 2 deals illustrate a couple of key points, broader points, about our business. The larger deal, Stagecoach, is a further investment in our existing natural gas business, where we own the largest transportation and storage network in the country. That reflects our view that our existing business will be needed for decades to come. Hydrocarbons, and especially natural gas, have very stubborn advantages and will play an essential role in meeting the growing need for energy around the world. That's something we are well positioned for with our assets and especially considering our considerable connectivity with export markets, especially in natural gas but also in refined products.
At the same time, we do see opportunities in the energy evolution, I'm putting emphasis on evolution, and we're positioning ourselves there as well. We're doing this in our base business, where our gas delivery capability provides the needed backup for renewables at far lower cost and longer duration than batteries. We're doing it in responsibly sourced, that is low methane emissions, natural gas. We had our second such transaction this quarter. We're doing it in our refined products businesses where we handle renewable transportation fuels, and we are actively developing additional business in that part of our business as well.
The Kinetrex transaction, while relatively small, positions us to develop a new business line in the renewable energy space at attractive returns and with a bit of a head start. The takeaway from all of this is that we continue to see strong long-term value in the assets and service offerings we have today while also pivoting in an appropriate and value-creating way to the faster-growing parts of the energy business.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

First, I'm going to start with our business fundamentals, and then I'll talk very high level about our forecast for the full year.Starting with the natural gas business fundamentals for the quarter. Transport volumes were up 4% or a",791,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. First, I'm going to start with our business fundamentals, and then I'll talk very high level about our forecast for the full year.
Starting with the natural gas business fundamentals for the quarter. Transport volumes were up 4% or approximately 1.5 dekatherms per day versus the second quarter of 2020. And that was driven primarily by LNG, Mexico exports, and power demand on TGP, the PHP in-service, higher industrial and LNG demand on our Texas intrastate system, and then higher deliveries to our Elba Express LNG facility. These increases were partially offset by lower volumes on CIG. And that's due to declines in Rockies production and Fayetteville Express contract expirations.
Physical deliveries to LNG off of our pipeline averaged approximately 5 million dekatherms per day. That's a huge increase versus the second quarter of 2020. LNG volumes also increased versus the first quarter of this year by approximately 8%. Our market share of LNG export volumes is about 48%. Exports to Mexico were up about 20% versus the second quarter of 2020. Our share of Mexico volumes is about 54%. Overall, deliveries to power plants were relatively flat. Deliveries to LDCs were down slightly, while deliveries to industrial facilities were up 4%.
Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 12% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of '20. For gathering volumes, though, I think the more informative comparison is the sequential quarter. So compared to the first quarter of this year, volumes were up about 6%. And here, we saw nice increases in Hiland volumes, which were up about 10%; and the Haynesville volumes, reports were up about 13%.
In our products pipeline segment, refined products were up 37% for the quarter versus the second quarter of '20. Volumes are also up about 17% versus the first quarter of this year. So we saw substantial improvement both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Compared to the pre-pandemic levels, and we're using the second quarter of 2019 as the reference point, road fuels, and that's gasoline and diesel combined, are essentially flat, and jet fuel is still down about 26%.
Crude and condensate volumes were up 6% in the quarter versus the second quarter of '20, and sequentially, they were up very slightly. In our Terminals business segment, our liquids utilization remains high. If you exclude the tanks out of service or required inspections, approximately 98% of our tanks are leased. Most of the revenue that we receive comes from fixed monthly charges we receive for tanks under lease, but we do receive a marginal amount of revenue from throughput, and we saw throughput increase significantly, about 22% in total on our liquids terminals, 26% if you're just looking at refined products. But that still remains a little bit below 2019, up 6% on total liquids volumes, 5% when you're just looking at gasoline and diesel.
We continue to experience some weakness in our marine tanker business. But as we said last quarter, we expect that this market will improve, but it may take until late this year as the charter activity tends to lag the underlying supply and demand fundamentals.
On the bulk side, volumes increased by 23%, and that was driven by coal and steel. Mill utilization of our largest steel customer exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Coal export economics improved for both met and thermal coal.
In the CO2 segment, crude volumes were down about 9%. CO2 volumes were down about 10% year-over-year. Increased oil and NGL prices did offset some of the volume degradation. But if you compare to our budget, we're currently anticipating the oil volumes will exceed our budget by approximately 5%, and that's driven primarily by some nice performance on SACROC. CO2 volumes, we also expect to exceed our budget.
So overall, we're seeing increased natural gas volumes and demand from LNG and Mexico exports as well as industrial demand on the Gulf Coast. We're seeing increased gathering volumes in the Bakken and the Haynesville and nice recovery of refined products volumes. Crude oil volumes are above our expectations in our CO2 segment, and we're getting some price help. We still experienced some weakness in our Jones Act tankers, and the Eagle Ford remains highly competitive.
Now let me give you a very high-level update of our full year forecast. As we said in the release, we're currently projecting full year DCF of $5.4 billion. That's above the high end of the range that we gave you last quarter. The range we gave you last quarter was $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion. The outperformance versus the high end of the range is driven by our Stagecoach acquisition, higher commodity prices and better refined products volumes.
And with that, I'll turn it over to David."

For the second quarter of 2021, we're declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share, which is $1.08 annualized, and that's up 3% from the second quarter of 2020. This quarter, we generated revenue of $3.15 billion, which is up $590 million from the second quarter of 2020. We also had higher cost of sales with an increase there of $495 million. So netting those 2 together, gross margin was up $95 million.
This quarter, we also took an impairment of our South Texas gathering and processing assets of $1.6 billion. So with that impact, we generated a loss -- net loss of $757 million for the quarter.
Looking at adjusted earnings, which is before certain items, primarily the South Texas asset impairment this quarter and the midstream goodwill impairment a year ago, we generated income of $516 million this quarter, up $135 million from the second quarter of 2020.
Moving on to the segment EBDA and distributable cash flow performance. Natural gas -- our natural gas segment was up $48 million for the quarter, and that was up primarily due to favorable margins in our Texas Intrastate business; greater contributions from our PHP asset, which is now in service; and increased volumes on our Bakken gas gathering systems. Partially offsetting those items were lower volumes on our South Texas and KinderHawk gathering and processing assets and lower contributions from FEP due to contract roll-offs.
Our product segment was up $66 million driven by a nice recovery in refined product volume. Terminals was up $17 million, also driven by the nice refined product volume recovery, partially offset by lower utilization of our Jones Act tankers. Our CO2 segment was down $5 million due to lower crude oil and CO2 volumes and some increased well work costs. Those are partially offset by higher realized crude oil and NGL pricing.
Our G&A and corporate charges were lower by $7 million. This is where we benefited from our organizational efficiency savings as well as some lower noncash pension expenses, partially offset by some lower capitalized G&A costs. Our JV DD&A category was lower by $27 million primarily due to Ruby. And that brings us to our adjusted EBITDA of $1.670 billion, which is 7% higher than the second quarter of 2020.
Moving below EBITDA. Interest expense was $16 million favorable driven by our lower LIBOR rates benefiting our interest rate swaps as well as a lower debt balance and lower rates on our long-term debt. And those are partially offset by lower capitalized interest expenses versus last year. Our cash taxes for the quarter were unfavorable $40 million, mostly due to Citrus, our products Southeast pipeline and Texas margin tax deferrals, which were taken in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, just timing. And for the full year, our cash taxes are in line with our budget.
Our sustaining capital was unfavorable $51 million for the quarter driven by higher spend in our natural gas, CO2 and Terminals segments, but that higher spend is in line with what we had budgeted for the quarter. Our total DCF of $1.025 billion is up 2%, and our DCF per share of $0.45 per share is up $0.01 from last year.
On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 3.8x debt-to-EBITDA, which is down nicely from 4.6x at year-end. Kim already mentioned that we updated our full year guidance, which now has DCF and EBITDA above the top end of the range that we provided in the first quarter. For debt-to-EBITDA, we expect to end the year at 4.0x. That includes the acquisitions of Stagecoach, which we closed on July 9; and Kinetrex, which we expect to close in the third quarter.
As a reminder, that level -- that -- our year-end debt-to-EBITDA level has the benefits of the largely nonrecurring EBITDA generated during Winter Storm Uri earlier in the year, and our longer-term leverage target of around 4.5x has not changed.
On to reconciliation of our net debt. The net debt for the quarter ended at $30 billion, almost $30.2 billion, down $1.847 billion from year-end and about $500 million down from Q1. Our net debt has now declined by over $12 billion or about 30% since our peak levels.
To reconcile the change in the quarter in net debt, we generated $1.025 billion of DCF. We paid out approximately $600 million of dividends. We spent approximately $100 million of growth capital and contributions to our joint ventures. And we had $175 million of working capital source of cash flows, primarily interest expense accrual. That explains the majority of the change for the quarter. For the change year-to-date, we generated $3.354 billion of distributable cash flow. We spent $1.2 billion on dividends. We've spent $300 million on growth CapEx and JV contributions. We received $413 million on our partial interest sale of NGPL. And we have experienced a working capital use of approximately $425 million, and that explains the majority of the change for the year.
That completes the financial review, and I will turn it back to Steve."

And we think what we bring to the table in terms of competitive advantages, our existing network and our existing footprint. And I would describe that just in terms of the obvious physical assets, the pipelines and storage that we have, but also the customer access and customer contacts that we have that will enable us, I think, in some decent-sized chunks to develop and originate some additional business really in both categories: the voluntary market as well as the transport market.
We've got good project management expertise. We're actually looking at whether or not we can make some of the equipment that's being deployed in these areas. And so we think we bring a lot to the table. We're getting a good team as part of this acquisition. So we think we can expand this business, expand it organically and do it in a way that the returns are attractive."

It's been about $100 million to $200 million, about a year drag on EBITDA. 
Is that now substantially over? And so all the growth-related projects that you're talking about on the Energy Venture side and so forth or any of the capital that you spend will, in fact, be additive to EBITDA from this point going forward?

And we update that, as you know, every January, when we do our investor conference. And we'll do that again. But it is -- we see it as being lower in terms of the rollout post 2021.
And so the background there, as I think you know well, is that 10 years ago or a little bit more, we built a number of pipelines that were kind of point-to-point pipelines. And they were built on the strength of long-term contractual commitments in a very high-basis environment. And so as you get to the end of those 10- or 10-plus-year contracts and they start to roll off, they're rolling off into a more challenged-basis environment for those particular pipes. And so that has had the effect of kind of masking or dampening, however you want to see it, some of the, I think, strong underlying performance in our natural gas pipeline segment. So that's what's been going on. And as I said, I think we see that as being lower from here.
In terms of your broader question, it is -- we invest all of our capital on a return. Everyone -- each one stands on its own from a return standpoint. We've been getting good returns. As we show in our  performance update there, very attractive returns on the capital that we've deployed.
In terms of the overall puts and takes, though, there are puts and takes across a diversified asset portfolio like ours. And those puts and takes and the uncertainty around them in further out-periods are hard enough to quantify or uncertain enough to quantify -- for me to give you a specific answer to your question about base business then plus, right?
And so generally, what we do is give you the best view we can of the fundamental drivers underpinning our business economically and commercially so that our investors can make their own -- come to their own expectations about that future. But we don't guide beyond the current budget year or updates to the guidance like we're giving you today.

And for our business, we've tried to distinguish ourselves with our customers as a storage provider and a transport provider and a good operating partner to be able to capture as much of that business as we can. We have a very good share of that business moving through our pipes today, and we look to expand it. And the map of where those facilities are coming in is lined up very nicely with our natural gas pipeline footprint.
And just to put a little more context on it. As we look at -- and this is a different time frame now, 2020 to 2030, the growth that we see in natural gas happening over that 10-year period, 80% of that is Texas and Louisiana, and a lot of that is the export market.

Coming out of the winter storm, for example, not just in Texas, but really along our system, we've successfully transacted for incremental and also attractive, that is increasing renewal rates, particularly on our storage assets, especially in Texas, but also elsewhere on our system. It was a bit of a, I think, a wake-up call to the market generally that there is real value in having that delivery flexibility and real value in holding firm transport capacity. So I think just overall, we are seeing uplift, if you will, in that area."

I'll start, and then I'll ask Jesse to comment more specifically on the deal front. You made the right point in your opening on the question, which is that the near-term opportunity really is along existing infrastructure and primarily processing and also ethanol plants because the CO2 stream is pure -- or fairly pure there. And so it still needs to be compressed and get it into the pipe, et cetera.
The other thing about it is the pipe itself, right? The CO2 moves most efficiently in a liquid state, which means high pressure. So that's 1,800 to 2,200 psi. And what that means is you're not going to repurpose a lot of gas pipe or oil pipe for that, for example, when you tend to operate in, call it, 600 psi to maybe 1,450 on the newer gas pipes. And so that has been a barrier, right? If you've got to build new heavy-wall pipe in order to get it to a place where you can sequester it, that's a barrier. EOR is a valuable application of that CO2. And so that does make that the near-term opportunity.
So having said that, I'll ask Jesse to comment on timing and current deal activity."

Question 2 is a follow-up one. Somebody earlier asked a little bit about the asset mix and asset disposals. And Steve, I think you made the comment about everything for a price. Well, it's -- where does Elba fit into that?

And in terms of its -- how it fits in the overall portfolio, it is kind of integrated with our broader system. We have the Elba Express pipeline, which we have opportunities on as well. We have the potential to do more at Elba in terms of storage and the like. And it's interconnected with our SNG system. And so it fits nicely within the portfolio of assets we have.
Also, as you know, I mean, it's under a long-term contract with Shell, which is an attractive credit and sort of risk profile for us, long -- very long-term contract with Shell. And so it fits very well, and we did a partial sell-down earlier, as I mentioned.

The -- so the Texas legislature in this last session did what it needed to do to set the railroad commission up to go seek primacy, but then they have to go put their plan together and put that on file, which could be this fall. And then I don't know how long it will take the EPA necessarily to act.
But once it acts and the railroad commission has control of it, I think they're going to process them very quickly. Jesse made the point earlier, the permitting process itself is today, at the EPA is just very slow. Now I would think that they are going to want to, as a public policy matter, speed it up anyway, right? But it's 5 or 6 years right now. That doesn't work. And so whether it's the EPA speeding itself up in order to enable more of this for its own policy objectives or whether it's the railroad commission getting control of it, it will get sped up.
In terms of onshore versus offshore, we're obviously onshore-focused in the opportunity that we have and given what our footprint of the existing pipeline network is, which is a very important consideration for the reasons I said earlier.
But Jesse, do you have any other comments on onshore versus offshore?"

Before we begin, as usual, I'd like to remind you that KMI's earnings release today and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. Before making any investment decision, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking statements.
With that out of the way, let me just say that like a broken record, each quarter, I open our call with comments on the strong cash flow we're generating and how we're using and intend to use that cash flow. Whether you look at our cash flow for the second quarter, for year-to-date or our projections for the full year, it's apparent that we continue to be a strong generator of cash flow. It's also apparent that we continue to live comfortably within that cash flow.
The question investors should ask on a continuous basis is whether we are wise stewards of that cash. We have said repeatedly that we would use our funds to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay a good and growing dividend, invest in new projects or acquisitions when they met our relatively high return hurdle rates and opportunistically repurchase our shares.
This quarter, we announced 2 fairly significant acquisitions. The first was our purchase of the Stagecoach natural gas storage and pipeline assets in the Northeast for approximately $1.2 billion. These assets expand our services to our customers by helping connect natural gas supply with Northeast demand areas. The acquisition is immediately accretive to our shareholders, and I believe it will be an important and profitable asset for KMI for many years to come.
Our second acquisition is to make an attractive platform investment in the rapidly growing renewable natural gas market by purchasing Kinetrex for approximately $300 million. Steve will talk about this acquisition in detail. We believe there is a bright future for this business and other related energy transition businesses that we are exploring.
Now let me conclude with 2 important points. Both of these acquisitions meet our hurdle rates that I referred to earlier, and both are being paid for with our internally generated cash. I believe both fit within the long-term financial strategy that I speak to each quarter, and I can assure you that our Board looks at all alternatives in a manner completely consistent with that financial strategy.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

On the Stagecoach storage and transportation assets for $1.2 billion. We closed that transaction earlier this month. It adds 41 Bcf of certificated and pretty flexible working gas storage capacity and 185 miles of pipeline. We're excited about this transaction for several reasons. As we discussed on the first quarter call, we think storage value is going to increase over time. Its value was certainly revealed during Winter Storm Uri, and we've seen that start to show up in our commercial transactions. Storage will also become more valuable as more intermittent renewable resources are added to the grid. The Stagecoach assets are well interconnected with our Tennessee Gas Pipeline system as well as other third-party systems in a part of the country that is constrained from an infrastructure standpoint, and frankly, where it is difficult to get new infrastructure permitted and built. We're excited about this transaction and believe it will pay off nicely for our shareholders.
The second transaction, which we announced at the end of last week, was accomplished by our newly formed Energy Transition Ventures Group. We put that together in the first quarter of this year. We're acquiring Kinetrex, a renewable natural gas business, subject to regulatory approval and a couple of other closing conditions. At signing, Kinetrex had secured 3 new signed development projects that we will build out over the next 18 months, resulting in a purchase price plus capital at a less than 6x EBITDA multiple by the time we get to 2023. With Kinetrex, we're picking up a rare platform investment in a highly fragmented market. It gives us a nice head start on working on hundreds, if not thousands, of potential renewable natural gas project candidates in the U.S.
A few more points on this deal. As several of you pointed out in your comments post announcement, the value is dependent on RINs value. You don't make money on the gas sale, with an important exception that I'll get to in a minute. Importantly, the particular RINs that this business generates are D3 RINs, which can be used to satisfy other RINs obligations as well. D3s are for advanced biofuels, and promoting more of those in the transportation fuel market has had bipartisan support and even more support from the environmental community than conventional ethanol.
While there is some regulatory flexibility in EPA's hands, there is an underlying statutory framework, again with bipartisan support, combined with widely acknowledged greenhouse gas benefits that further protects the value of this category of RINs in particular.
Having said that, we believe we'll have the opportunity to mitigate our exposure to RINs pricing volatility. Based on conversations with potential customers, not signed deals yet but conversations so far, there is significant interest in renewable natural gas in the so-called ""voluntary market."" These are customers who are outside of the transport fuel market who are interested in reducing their carbon footprint and we believe would transact on a long-term fixed price basis.
There are also potential customers interested in sharing the risk and reward of the RINs value. So we will look for appropriate ways to lock in the value of the environmental attributes on attractive terms.
When we talked about our Energy Transition Ventures Group in the past, we've talked about transacting on attractive returns for our shareholders, not loss leaders and not doing things for show. This deal is a great example of that. In the team's short existence so far, they've acted on an attractive opportunity, and they continue to work on a number of other specific project opportunities. So very good progress in a short period of time.
These 2 deals illustrate a couple of key points, broader points, about our business. The larger deal, Stagecoach, is a further investment in our existing natural gas business, where we own the largest transportation and storage network in the country. That reflects our view that our existing business will be needed for decades to come. Hydrocarbons, and especially natural gas, have very stubborn advantages and will play an essential role in meeting the growing need for energy around the world. That's something we are well positioned for with our assets and especially considering our considerable connectivity with export markets, especially in natural gas but also in refined products.
At the same time, we do see opportunities in the energy evolution, I'm putting emphasis on evolution, and we're positioning ourselves there as well. We're doing this in our base business, where our gas delivery capability provides the needed backup for renewables at far lower cost and longer duration than batteries. We're doing it in responsibly sourced, that is low methane emissions, natural gas. We had our second such transaction this quarter. We're doing it in our refined products businesses where we handle renewable transportation fuels, and we are actively developing additional business in that part of our business as well.
The Kinetrex transaction, while relatively small, positions us to develop a new business line in the renewable energy space at attractive returns and with a bit of a head start. The takeaway from all of this is that we continue to see strong long-term value in the assets and service offerings we have today while also pivoting in an appropriate and value-creating way to the faster-growing parts of the energy business.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."
34952431,1673919408,2350588,"Kinder Morgan, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2021",2021-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Kinder Morgan, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Steve. First, I'm going to start with our business fundamentals, and then I'll talk very high level about our forecast for the full year.Starting with the Natural Gas business fundamentals for the quarter. Transport volumes were up 4% or a",791,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. First, I'm going to start with our business fundamentals, and then I'll talk very high level about our forecast for the full year.
Starting with the Natural Gas business fundamentals for the quarter. Transport volumes were up 4% or approximately 1.5 dekatherms per day versus the second quarter of 2020. And that was driven primarily by LNG, Mexico exports, and power demand on TGP, the PHP in-service, higher industrial and LNG demand on our Texas intrastate system, and then higher deliveries to our Elba Express LNG facility. These increases were partially offset by lower volumes on CIG. And that's due to declines in Rockies production and Fayetteville Express contract expirations.
Physical deliveries to LNG off of our pipeline averaged approximately 5 million dekatherms per day. That's a huge increase versus the second quarter of 2020. LNG volumes also increased versus the first quarter of this year by approximately 8%. Our market share of LNG export volumes is about 48%. Exports to Mexico were up about 20% versus the second quarter of 2020. Our share of Mexico volumes is about 54%. Overall, deliveries to power plants were relatively flat. Deliveries to LDCs were down slightly, while deliveries to industrial facilities were up 4%.
Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 12% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of '20. For gathering volumes, though, I think the more informative comparison is the sequential quarter. So compared to the first quarter of this year, volumes were up about 6%. And here, we saw nice increases in Hiland volumes, which were up about 10%; and the Haynesville volumes, which were up about 13%.
In our products pipeline segment, refined products were up 37% for the quarter versus the second quarter of '20. Volumes are also up about 17% versus the first quarter of this year. So we saw substantial improvement both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Compared to the prepandemic levels, and we're using the second quarter of 2019 as the reference point, road fuels, and that's gasoline and diesel combined, are essentially flat, and jet fuel is still down about 26%. Crude and condensate volumes were up 6% in the quarter versus the second quarter of '20, and sequentially, they were up very slightly. 
In our Terminals business segment, our liquids utilization remains high. If you exclude the tanks out of service or required inspections, approximately 98% of our tanks are leased. Most of the revenue that we receive comes from fixed monthly charges we receive for tanks under lease, but we do receive a marginal amount of revenue from throughput, and we saw throughput increase significantly, about 22% in total on our liquids terminals, 26% if you're just looking at refined products. But that still remains a little bit below 2019, up 6% on total liquids volumes, 5% when you're just looking at gasoline and diesel.
We continue to experience some weakness in our marine tanker business. But as we said last quarter, we expect that this market will improve, but it may take until late this year as the charter activity tends to lag the underlying supply and demand fundamentals.
On the bulk side, volumes increased by 23%, and that was driven by coal and steel. Mill utilization of our largest steel customer exceeded prepandemic levels. Coal export economics improved for both met and thermal coal.
In the CO2 segment, crude volumes were down about 9%. CO2 volumes were down about 10% year-over-year. Increased oil and NGL prices did offset some of the volume degradation. But if you compare to our budget, we're currently anticipating the oil volumes will exceed our budget by approximately 5%, and that's driven primarily by some nice performance on SACROC. CO2 volumes, we also expect to exceed our budget.
So overall, we're seeing increased natural gas volumes and demand from LNG and Mexico exports as well as industrial demand on the Gulf Coast. We're seeing increased gathering volumes in the Bakken and the Haynesville and nice recovery of refined products volumes. Crude oil volumes are above our expectations in our CO2 segment, and we're getting some price help. We're still experiencing some weakness in our Jones Act tankers, and the Eagle Ford remains highly competitive.
Now let me give you a very high-level update of our full year forecast. As we said in the release, we're currently projecting full year DCF of $5.4 billion. That's above the high end of the range that we gave you last quarter. The range we gave you last quarter was $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion. The outperformance versus the high end of the range is driven by our Stagecoach acquisition, higher commodity prices and better refined products volumes.
And with that, I'll turn it over to David."

For the second quarter of 2021, we're declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share, which is $1.08 annualized, and that's up 3% from the second quarter of 2020. This quarter, we generated revenue of $3.15 billion, which is up $590 million from the second quarter of 2020. We also had higher cost of sales with an increase there of $495 million. So netting those 2 together, gross margin was up $95 million. This quarter, we also took an impairment of our South Texas gathering and processing assets of $1.6 billion. So with that impact, we generated a loss -- net loss of $757 million for the quarter.
Looking at adjusted earnings, which is before certain items, primarily the South Texas asset impairment this quarter and the midstream goodwill impairment a year ago, we generated income of $516 million this quarter, up $135 million from the second quarter of 2020.
Moving on to the segment EBDA and distributable cash flow performance. Natural gas -- our Natural Gas segment was up $48 million for the quarter, and that was up primarily due to favorable margins in our Texas Intrastate business; greater contributions from our PHP asset, which is now in service; and increased volumes on our Bakken gathering systems. Partially offsetting those items were lower volumes on our South Texas and KinderHawk gathering and processing assets and lower contributions from FEP due to contract roll-offs.
Our Products segment was up $66 million driven by a nice recovery in refined product volume. Terminals was up $17 million, also driven by the nice refined product volume recovery partially offset by lower utilization of our Jones Act tankers. Our CO2 segment was down $5 million due to lower crude oil and CO2 volumes and some increased well work costs. Those are partially offset by higher realized crude oil and NGL pricing.
 
Our G&A and corporate charges were lower by $7 million. This is where we benefited from our organizational efficiency savings as well as some lower noncash pension expenses, partially offset by some lower capitalized G&A costs. Our JV DD&A category was lower by $27 million primarily due to Ruby. And that brings us to our adjusted EBITDA of $1.670 billion, which is 7% higher than the second quarter of 2020.
Moving below EBITDA. Interest expense was $16 million favorable driven by our lower LIBOR rates benefiting our interest rate swaps as well as a lower debt balance and lower rates on our long-term debt. And those are partially offset by lower capitalized interest expenses versus last year. Our cash taxes for the quarter were unfavorable $40 million, mostly due to Citrus, our products Southeast pipeline and Texas margin tax deferrals, which were taken in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, just timing. And for the full year, our cash taxes are in line with our budget.
Our sustaining capital was unfavorable $51 million for the quarter driven by higher spend in our Natural Gas, CO2 and Terminals segments, but that higher spend is in line with what we had budgeted for the quarter. Our total DCF of $1.025 billion is up 2%, and our DCF per share of $0.45 per share is up $0.01 from last year.
On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 3.8x debt-to-EBITDA, which is down nicely from 4.6x at year-end. Kim already mentioned that we updated our full year guidance, which now has DCF and EBITDA above the top end of the range that we provided in the first quarter. For debt-to-EBITDA, we expect to end the year at 4.0x. That includes the acquisitions of Stagecoach, which we closed on July 9; and Kinetrex, which we expect to close in the third quarter.
As a reminder, that level -- that -- our year-end debt-to-EBITDA level has the benefits of the largely nonrecurring EBITDA generated during Winter Storm Uri earlier in the year, and our longer-term leverage target of around 4.5x has not changed.
On to reconciliation of our net debt. The net debt for the quarter ended at $30 billion, almost $30.2 billion, down $1.847 billion from year-end and about $500 million down from Q1. Our net debt has now declined by over $12 billion or about 30% since our peak levels.
To reconcile the change in the quarter in net debt, we generated $1.025 billion of DCF. We paid out approximately $600 million of dividends. We spent approximately $100 million of growth capital and contributions to our joint ventures. And we had $175 million of working capital source of cash flows, primarily interest expense accrual. That explains the majority of the change for the quarter. For the change year-to-date, we generated $3.354 billion of distributable cash flow. We spent $1.2 billion on dividends. We've spent $300 million on growth CapEx and JV contributions. We received $413 million on our partial interest sale of NGPL. And we have experienced a working capital use of approximately $425 million. And that explains the majority of the change for the year.
That completes the financial review, and I will turn it back to Steve."

It seems the capacity is loose now with PHP online, Whistler soon to be online. But if the Permian grows as some expect, there could be tightness in the next couple of years, 2 to 3 years.

So it's still -- we had pretty active conversations in that arena before. We know who to talk to about it. I wouldn't characterize those as super active right now, but we think they could as we get closer to tightening up the Permian."

It's been about $100 million to $200 million, about a year drag on EBITDA. 
Is that now substantially over? And so all the growth-related projects that you're talking about on the Energy Venture side and so forth or any of the capital that you spend will, in fact, be additive to EBITDA from this point going forward? 
Just kind of curious if we're kind of done with the recontracting resets, if -- maybe there's a little bit left, but is it substantially out of the way at this point?"

And we update that, as you know, every January, when we do our investor conference. And we'll do that again. But it is -- we see it as being lower in terms of the rollout post 2021.
And so the background there, as I think you know well, is that 10 years ago or a little bit more, we built a number of pipelines that were kind of point-to-point pipelines. And they were built on the strength of long-term contractual commitments in a very high-basis environment. And so as you get to the end of those 10- or 10-plus-year contracts and they start to roll off, they're rolling off into a more challenged-basis environment for those particular pipes. And so that has had the effect of kind of masking or dampening, however you want to see it, some of the, I think, strong underlying performance in our natural gas pipeline segment. So that's what's been going on. And as I said, I think we see that as being lower from here.
In terms of your broader question, it is -- we invest all of our capital on a return. Everyone -- each one stands on its own from a return standpoint. We've been getting good returns. As we show in our  performance update there, very attractive returns on the capital that we've deployed.
In terms of the overall puts and takes, though, there are puts and takes across a diversified asset portfolio like ours. And those puts and takes and the uncertainty around them in further out-periods are hard enough to quantify or uncertain enough to quantify -- for me to give you a specific answer to your question about base business then plus, right?
And so generally, what we do is give you the best view we can of the fundamental drivers underpinning our business economically and commercially so that our investors can make their own -- come to their own expectations about that future. But we don't guide beyond the current budget year or updates to the guidance like we're giving you today.

And for our business, we've tried to distinguish ourselves with our customers as a storage provider and a transport provider and a good operating partner to be able to capture as much of that business as we can. We have a very good share of that business moving through our pipes today, and we look to expand it. And the map of where those facilities are coming in is lined up very nicely with our natural gas pipeline footprint.
And just to put a little more context on it. As we look at -- and this is a different time frame now, 2020 to 2030, the growth that we see in natural gas happening over that 10-year period, 80% of that is Texas and Louisiana, and a lot of that is the export market.

I'll start, and then I'll ask Jesse to comment more specifically on the deal front. You made the right point in your opening on the question, which is that the near-term opportunity really is along existing infrastructure and primarily processing and also ethanol plants because the CO2 stream is pure -- or fairly pure there. And so it still needs to be compressed and get it into the pipe, et cetera.
The other thing about it is the pipe itself, right? The CO2 moves most efficiently in a liquid state, which means high pressure. So that's 1,800 to 2,200 psi. And what that means is you're not going to repurpose a lot of gas pipe or oil pipe for that, for example, when you tend to operate in, call it, 600 psi to maybe 1,450 on the newer gas pipes. And so that has been a barrier, right? If you've got to build new heavy-wall pipe in order to get it to a place where you can sequester it, that's a barrier. EOR is a valuable application of that CO2. And so that does make that the near-term opportunity.
So having said that, I'll ask Jesse to comment on timing and current deal activity."

If it's sequestration, you're looking at much longer horizons because you'll need a Class 6 well permit, which, currently, the EPA has authority over.

That's question one. 
Question 2 is a follow-up one. Somebody earlier asked a little bit about the asset mix and asset disposals. And Steve, I think you made the comment about everything for a price. Well, it's -- where does Elba fit into that?

And in terms of its -- how it fits in the overall portfolio, it is kind of integrated with our broader system. We have the Elba Express pipeline, which we have opportunities on as well. We have the potential to do more at Elba in terms of storage and the like. And it's interconnected with our SNG system. And so it fits nicely within the portfolio of assets we have.
Also, as you know, I mean, it's under a long-term contract with Shell, which is an attractive credit and sort of risk profile for us, long -- very long-term contract with Shell. And so it fits very well, and we did a partial sell-down earlier, as I mentioned.

So it will shorten up the time frame if the Texas Railroad Commission is in charge of it. And now there's a process, as you kind of alluded to there. The -- so the Texas legislature in this last session did what it needed to do to set the railroad commission up to go seek primacy, but then they have to go put their plan together and put that on file, which could be this fall. And then I don't know how long it will take the EPA necessarily to act.
But once it acts and the Railroad Commission has control of it, I think they're going to process them very quickly. Jesse made the point earlier, the permitting process itself is -- today at the EPA is just very slow. Now I would think that they are going to want to, as a public policy matter, speed it up anyway, right? But it's 5 or 6 years right now. That doesn't work. And so whether it's the EPA speeding itself up in order to enable more of this for its own policy objectives or whether it's the Railroad Commission getting control of it, it will get sped up.
In terms of onshore versus offshore, we're obviously onshore focused in the opportunity that we have. And given what our footprint of the existing pipeline network is, which is a very important consideration for the reasons I said earlier.
But Jesse, do you have any other comments on onshore versus offshore?"

Before we begin, as usual, I'd like to remind you that KMI's earnings release today and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. Before making any investment decision, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking statements.
With that out of the way, let me just say that like a broken record, each quarter, I open our call with comments on the strong cash flow we're generating and how we're using and intend to use that cash flow. Whether you look at our cash flow for the second quarter, for year-to-date or our projections for the full year, it's apparent that we continue to be a strong generator of cash flow. It's also apparent that we continue to live comfortably within that cash flow.
The question investors should ask on a continuous basis is whether we are wise stewards of that cash. We have said repeatedly that we would use our funds to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay a good and growing dividend, invest in new projects or acquisitions when they met our relatively high return hurdle rates and opportunistically repurchase our shares.
This quarter, we announced 2 fairly significant acquisitions. The first was our purchase of the Stagecoach natural gas storage and pipeline assets in the Northeast for approximately $1.2 billion. These assets expand our services to our customers by helping connect natural gas supply with Northeast demand areas. The acquisition is immediately accretive to our shareholders, and I believe it will be an important and profitable asset for KMI for many years to come.
Our second acquisition is to make an attractive platform investment in the rapidly growing renewable natural gas market by purchasing Kinetrex for approximately $300 million. Steve will talk about this acquisition in detail. We believe there is a bright future for this business and other related energy transition businesses that we are exploring.
Now let me conclude with 2 important points. Both of these acquisitions meet our hurdle rates that I referred to earlier, and both are being paid for with our internally generated cash. I believe both fit within the long-term financial strategy that I speak to each quarter, and I can assure you that our Board looks at all alternatives in a manner completely consistent with that financial strategy.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

On the Stagecoach storage and transportation assets for $1.2 billion. We closed that transaction earlier this month. It adds 41 Bcf of certificated and pretty flexible working gas storage capacity and 185 miles of pipeline. We're excited about this transaction for several reasons. As we discussed on the first quarter call, we think storage value is going to increase over time. Its value was certainly revealed during Winter Storm Uri, and we've seen that start to show up in our commercial transactions. Storage will also become more valuable as more intermittent renewable resources are added to the grid. The Stagecoach assets are well interconnected with our Tennessee Gas Pipeline system as well as other third-party systems in a part of the country that is constrained from an infrastructure standpoint, and frankly, where it is difficult to get new infrastructure permitted and built. We're excited about this transaction and believe it will pay off nicely for our shareholders.
The second transaction, which we announced at the end of last week, was accomplished by our newly formed Energy Transition Ventures Group. We put that together in the first quarter of this year. We're acquiring Kinetrex, a renewable natural gas business, subject to regulatory approval and a couple of other closing conditions. At signing, Kinetrex had secured 3 new signed development projects that we will build out over the next 18 months, resulting in a purchase price plus capital at a less than 6x EBITDA multiple by the time we get to 2023. With Kinetrex, we're picking up a rare platform investment in a highly fragmented market. It gives us a nice head start on working on hundreds, if not thousands, of potential renewable natural gas project candidates in the U.S.
A few more points on this deal. As several of you pointed out in your comments post announcement, the value is dependent on RINs value. You don't make money on the gas sale, with an important exception that I'll get to in a minute. Importantly, the particular RINs that this business generates are D3 RINs, which can be used to satisfy other RINs obligations as well. D3s are for advanced biofuels, and promoting more of those in the transportation fuel market has had bipartisan support and even more support from the environmental community than conventional ethanol.
While there is some regulatory flexibility in EPA's hands, there is an underlying statutory framework, again with bipartisan support, combined with widely acknowledged greenhouse gas benefits that further protects the value of this category of RINs in particular.
Having said that, we believe we'll have the opportunity to mitigate our exposure to RINs pricing volatility. Based on conversations with potential customers, not signed deals yet but conversations so far, there is significant interest in renewable natural gas in the so-called ""voluntary market."" These are customers who are outside of the transport fuel market who are interested in reducing their carbon footprint and we believe would transact on a long-term fixed price basis.
There are also potential customers interested in sharing the risk and reward of the RINs value. So we will look for appropriate ways to lock in the value of the environmental attributes on attractive terms.
When we talked about our Energy Transition Ventures Group in the past, we've talked about transacting on attractive returns for our shareholders, not loss leaders and not doing things for show. This deal is a great example of that. In the team's short existence so far, they've acted on an attractive opportunity, and they continue to work on a number of other specific project opportunities. So very good progress in a short period of time.
These 2 deals illustrate a couple of key points, broader points, about our business. The larger deal, Stagecoach, is a further investment in our existing natural gas business, where we own the largest transportation and storage network in the country. That reflects our view that our existing business will be needed for decades to come. Hydrocarbons, and especially natural gas, have very stubborn advantages and will play an essential role in meeting the growing need for energy around the world. That's something we are well positioned for with our assets and especially considering our considerable connectivity with export markets, especially in natural gas but also in refined products.
At the same time, we do see opportunities in the energy evolution, I'm putting emphasis on evolution, and we're positioning ourselves there as well. We're doing this in our base business, where our gas delivery capability provides the needed backup for renewables at far lower cost and longer duration than batteries. We're doing it in responsibly sourced, that is low methane emissions, natural gas. We had our second such transaction this quarter. We're doing it in our refined products businesses where we handle renewable transportation fuels, and we are actively developing additional business in that part of our business as well.
The Kinetrex transaction, while relatively small, positions us to develop a new business line in the renewable energy space at attractive returns and with a bit of a head start. The takeaway from all of this is that we continue to see strong long-term value in the assets and service offerings we have today while also pivoting in an appropriate and value-creating way to the faster-growing parts of the energy business.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

First, I'm going to start with our business fundamentals, and then I'll talk very high level about our forecast for the full year.Starting with the Natural Gas business fundamentals for the quarter. Transport volumes were up 4% or a",791,"Okay. Thanks, Steve. First, I'm going to start with our business fundamentals, and then I'll talk very high level about our forecast for the full year.
Starting with the Natural Gas business fundamentals for the quarter. Transport volumes were up 4% or approximately 1.5 dekatherms per day versus the second quarter of 2020. And that was driven primarily by LNG, Mexico exports, and power demand on TGP, the PHP in-service, higher industrial and LNG demand on our Texas intrastate system, and then higher deliveries to our Elba Express LNG facility. These increases were partially offset by lower volumes on CIG. And that's due to declines in Rockies production and Fayetteville Express contract expirations.
Physical deliveries to LNG off of our pipeline averaged approximately 5 million dekatherms per day. That's a huge increase versus the second quarter of 2020. LNG volumes also increased versus the first quarter of this year by approximately 8%. Our market share of LNG export volumes is about 48%. Exports to Mexico were up about 20% versus the second quarter of 2020. Our share of Mexico volumes is about 54%. Overall, deliveries to power plants were relatively flat. Deliveries to LDCs were down slightly, while deliveries to industrial facilities were up 4%.
Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 12% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of '20. For gathering volumes, though, I think the more informative comparison is the sequential quarter. So compared to the first quarter of this year, volumes were up about 6%. And here, we saw nice increases in Hiland volumes, which were up about 10%; and the Haynesville volumes, which were up about 13%.
In our products pipeline segment, refined products were up 37% for the quarter versus the second quarter of '20. Volumes are also up about 17% versus the first quarter of this year. So we saw substantial improvement both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Compared to the prepandemic levels, and we're using the second quarter of 2019 as the reference point, road fuels, and that's gasoline and diesel combined, are essentially flat, and jet fuel is still down about 26%. Crude and condensate volumes were up 6% in the quarter versus the second quarter of '20, and sequentially, they were up very slightly. 
In our Terminals business segment, our liquids utilization remains high. If you exclude the tanks out of service or required inspections, approximately 98% of our tanks are leased. Most of the revenue that we receive comes from fixed monthly charges we receive for tanks under lease, but we do receive a marginal amount of revenue from throughput, and we saw throughput increase significantly, about 22% in total on our liquids terminals, 26% if you're just looking at refined products. But that still remains a little bit below 2019, up 6% on total liquids volumes, 5% when you're just looking at gasoline and diesel.
We continue to experience some weakness in our marine tanker business. But as we said last quarter, we expect that this market will improve, but it may take until late this year as the charter activity tends to lag the underlying supply and demand fundamentals.
On the bulk side, volumes increased by 23%, and that was driven by coal and steel. Mill utilization of our largest steel customer exceeded prepandemic levels. Coal export economics improved for both met and thermal coal.
In the CO2 segment, crude volumes were down about 9%. CO2 volumes were down about 10% year-over-year. Increased oil and NGL prices did offset some of the volume degradation. But if you compare to our budget, we're currently anticipating the oil volumes will exceed our budget by approximately 5%, and that's driven primarily by some nice performance on SACROC. CO2 volumes, we also expect to exceed our budget.
So overall, we're seeing increased natural gas volumes and demand from LNG and Mexico exports as well as industrial demand on the Gulf Coast. We're seeing increased gathering volumes in the Bakken and the Haynesville and nice recovery of refined products volumes. Crude oil volumes are above our expectations in our CO2 segment, and we're getting some price help. We're still experiencing some weakness in our Jones Act tankers, and the Eagle Ford remains highly competitive.
Now let me give you a very high-level update of our full year forecast. As we said in the release, we're currently projecting full year DCF of $5.4 billion. That's above the high end of the range that we gave you last quarter. The range we gave you last quarter was $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion. The outperformance versus the high end of the range is driven by our Stagecoach acquisition, higher commodity prices and better refined products volumes.
And with that, I'll turn it over to David."

For the second quarter of 2021, we're declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share, which is $1.08 annualized, and that's up 3% from the second quarter of 2020. This quarter, we generated revenue of $3.15 billion, which is up $590 million from the second quarter of 2020. We also had higher cost of sales with an increase there of $495 million. So netting those 2 together, gross margin was up $95 million. This quarter, we also took an impairment of our South Texas gathering and processing assets of $1.6 billion. So with that impact, we generated a loss -- net loss of $757 million for the quarter.
Looking at adjusted earnings, which is before certain items, primarily the South Texas asset impairment this quarter and the midstream goodwill impairment a year ago, we generated income of $516 million this quarter, up $135 million from the second quarter of 2020.
Moving on to the segment EBDA and distributable cash flow performance. Natural gas -- our Natural Gas segment was up $48 million for the quarter, and that was up primarily due to favorable margins in our Texas Intrastate business; greater contributions from our PHP asset, which is now in service; and increased volumes on our Bakken gathering systems. Partially offsetting those items were lower volumes on our South Texas and KinderHawk gathering and processing assets and lower contributions from FEP due to contract roll-offs.
Our Products segment was up $66 million driven by a nice recovery in refined product volume. Terminals was up $17 million, also driven by the nice refined product volume recovery partially offset by lower utilization of our Jones Act tankers. Our CO2 segment was down $5 million due to lower crude oil and CO2 volumes and some increased well work costs. Those are partially offset by higher realized crude oil and NGL pricing.
 
Our G&A and corporate charges were lower by $7 million. This is where we benefited from our organizational efficiency savings as well as some lower noncash pension expenses, partially offset by some lower capitalized G&A costs. Our JV DD&A category was lower by $27 million primarily due to Ruby. And that brings us to our adjusted EBITDA of $1.670 billion, which is 7% higher than the second quarter of 2020.
Moving below EBITDA. Interest expense was $16 million favorable driven by our lower LIBOR rates benefiting our interest rate swaps as well as a lower debt balance and lower rates on our long-term debt. And those are partially offset by lower capitalized interest expenses versus last year. Our cash taxes for the quarter were unfavorable $40 million, mostly due to Citrus, our products Southeast pipeline and Texas margin tax deferrals, which were taken in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, just timing. And for the full year, our cash taxes are in line with our budget.
Our sustaining capital was unfavorable $51 million for the quarter driven by higher spend in our Natural Gas, CO2 and Terminals segments, but that higher spend is in line with what we had budgeted for the quarter. Our total DCF of $1.025 billion is up 2%, and our DCF per share of $0.45 per share is up $0.01 from last year.
On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 3.8x debt-to-EBITDA, which is down nicely from 4.6x at year-end. Kim already mentioned that we updated our full year guidance, which now has DCF and EBITDA above the top end of the range that we provided in the first quarter. For debt-to-EBITDA, we expect to end the year at 4.0x. That includes the acquisitions of Stagecoach, which we closed on July 9; and Kinetrex, which we expect to close in the third quarter.
As a reminder, that level -- that -- our year-end debt-to-EBITDA level has the benefits of the largely nonrecurring EBITDA generated during Winter Storm Uri earlier in the year, and our longer-term leverage target of around 4.5x has not changed.
On to reconciliation of our net debt. The net debt for the quarter ended at $30 billion, almost $30.2 billion, down $1.847 billion from year-end and about $500 million down from Q1. Our net debt has now declined by over $12 billion or about 30% since our peak levels.
To reconcile the change in the quarter in net debt, we generated $1.025 billion of DCF. We paid out approximately $600 million of dividends. We spent approximately $100 million of growth capital and contributions to our joint ventures. And we had $175 million of working capital source of cash flows, primarily interest expense accrual. That explains the majority of the change for the quarter. For the change year-to-date, we generated $3.354 billion of distributable cash flow. We spent $1.2 billion on dividends. We've spent $300 million on growth CapEx and JV contributions. We received $413 million on our partial interest sale of NGPL. And we have experienced a working capital use of approximately $425 million. And that explains the majority of the change for the year.
That completes the financial review, and I will turn it back to Steve."

So it's still -- we had pretty active conversations in that arena before. We know who to talk to about it. I wouldn't characterize those as super active right now, but we think they could as we get closer to tightening up the Permian."

Great.

It's been about $100 million to $200 million, about a year drag on EBITDA. 
Is that now substantially over? And so all the growth-related projects that you're talking about on the Energy Venture side and so forth or any of the capital that you spend will, in fact, be additive to EBITDA from this point going forward? 
Just kind of curious if we're kind of done with the recontracting resets, if -- maybe there's a little bit left, but is it substantially out of the way at this point?"

And we update that, as you know, every January, when we do our investor conference. And we'll do that again. But it is -- we see it as being lower in terms of the rollout post 2021.
And so the background there, as I think you know well, is that 10 years ago or a little bit more, we built a number of pipelines that were kind of point-to-point pipelines. And they were built on the strength of long-term contractual commitments in a very high-basis environment. And so as you get to the end of those 10- or 10-plus-year contracts and they start to roll off, they're rolling off into a more challenged-basis environment for those particular pipes. And so that has had the effect of kind of masking or dampening, however you want to see it, some of the, I think, strong underlying performance in our natural gas pipeline segment. So that's what's been going on. And as I said, I think we see that as being lower from here.
In terms of your broader question, it is -- we invest all of our capital on a return. Everyone -- each one stands on its own from a return standpoint. We've been getting good returns. As we show in our  performance update there, very attractive returns on the capital that we've deployed.
In terms of the overall puts and takes, though, there are puts and takes across a diversified asset portfolio like ours. And those puts and takes and the uncertainty around them in further out-periods are hard enough to quantify or uncertain enough to quantify -- for me to give you a specific answer to your question about base business then plus, right?
And so generally, what we do is give you the best view we can of the fundamental drivers underpinning our business economically and commercially so that our investors can make their own -- come to their own expectations about that future. But we don't guide beyond the current budget year or updates to the guidance like we're giving you today. So we try to provide the transparency and -- particularly around the roll-off issue in particular, but we don't guide beyond the current year."

And for our business, we've tried to distinguish ourselves with our customers as a storage provider and a transport provider and a good operating partner to be able to capture as much of that business as we can. We have a very good share of that business moving through our pipes today, and we look to expand it. And the map of where those facilities are coming in is lined up very nicely with our natural gas pipeline footprint.
And just to put a little more context on it. As we look at -- and this is a different time frame now, 2020 to 2030, the growth that we see in natural gas happening over that 10-year period, 80% of that is Texas and Louisiana, and a lot of that is the export market.

I'll start, and then I'll ask Jesse to comment more specifically on the deal front. You made the right point in your opening on the question, which is that the near-term opportunity really is along existing infrastructure and primarily processing and also ethanol plants because the CO2 stream is pure -- or fairly pure there. And so it still needs to be compressed and get it into the pipe, et cetera.
The other thing about it is the pipe itself, right? The CO2 moves most efficiently in a liquid state, which means high pressure. So that's 1,800 to 2,200 psi. And what that means is you're not going to repurpose a lot of gas pipe or oil pipe for that, for example, when you tend to operate in, call it, 600 psi to maybe 1,450 on the newer gas pipes. And so that has been a barrier, right? If you've got to build new heavy-wall pipe in order to get it to a place where you can sequester it, that's a barrier.

If it's sequestration, you're looking at much longer horizons because you'll need a Class 6 well permit, which, currently, the EPA has authority over. And there's only a couple of these in place throughout the United States. So that's probably more of a 3- to 5-year time frame in obtaining one, that's current today.

That's question one. 
Question 2 is a follow-up one. Somebody earlier asked a little bit about the asset mix and asset disposals. And Steve, I think you made the comment about everything for a price. Well, it's -- where does Elba fit into that? Because it seems like the infrastructure funds market where others are paying pretty healthy multiples minority stakes in LNG -- contracted LNG facilities.

And in terms of its -- how it fits in the overall portfolio, it is kind of integrated with our broader system. We have the Elba Express pipeline, which we have opportunities on as well. We have the potential to do more at Elba in terms of storage and the like. And it's interconnected with our SNG system. And so it fits nicely within the portfolio of assets we have.
Also, as you know, I mean, it's under a long-term contract with Shell, which is an attractive credit and sort of risk profile for us, long -- very long-term contract with Shell. And so it fits very well, and we did a partial sell-down earlier, as I mentioned.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you, as we always do, that KMI's earnings release today in this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exch",598,"Thank you, Michelle. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you, as we always do, that KMI's earnings release today in this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of [indiscernible] non-GAAP financial measures. Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking statements.
Now every quarter, I open this call by talking about our financial philosophy at Kinder Morgan. I always mentioned strong and consistent cash flow and explain how we use that cash flow to pay a healthy and growing dividend, internally fund our expansion CapEx needs, keep our balance sheet strong and opportunistically buy back our shares I believe our shareholders understand and appreciate the strength of our cash flow even if there are varied positions on what we should do with it.
But in a broader sense, if we examine what owning a share of KMI really amounts to, I've come to believe, as the largest shareholder, that we are receiving a very good and growing yield on our investment while at the same time, getting an amazing optionality on future developments. Let me explain that optionality.
We have entered the energy transition field with what I consider to be solid investments that Steve and the team will discuss further, and our cash flow gives us the ability to pursue those opportunities in size if and only if the investments achieved a satisfactory return. And I believe that if we so desire, we will be able to attract new partners at the time of our choosing, whether public or private, to participate in those opportunities with us on terms favorable to KMI.
I also firmly believe that there is still a long runway for fossil fuels around the world, particularly for natural gas. If you read carefully the latest studies from the IEA, OPEC and from various other energy experts, you will see projections that fossil fuels will continue to supply the majority of our energy needs for at least the next quarter century, and that natural gas will be at the forefront of fulfilling those needs.
If these projections are anywhere close to accurate, a company like Kinder Morgan with significant free cash flow will find significant opportunities to invest in this core business where we have substantial expertise and a huge network that can be expanded and extended. So this is another option that you receive as a KMI shareholder.
I would add that the events of this fall throughout Europe, Asia and North America demonstrate that the transition to renewables is going to be a lot longer and more difficult than many of its proponents originally thought. In short, while the world makes the transition, the lights need to stay on, homes need to be heated, and our industrial production needs to be sustained.
Finally, we always have the option of returning dollars to our shareholders through selective stock repurchases, in addition to the healthy return we are providing through our dividend. This is why I say that an investment in KMI provides you with a nice locked-in return with this dividend and then provides really good optionality for the future.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

I'll give you an overview of our business and the current environment for our sector as we see it. Then our President, giving will cover the outlook and segment updates. Our CFO, David Michels, will take you through the financials",818,"All right. Thanks, Rich. I'll give you an overview of our business and the current environment for our sector as we see it. Then our President, giving will cover the outlook and segment updates. Our CFO, David Michels, will take you through the financials, and then we'll take your questions.
Our financial principles remain the same. First, maintaining a strong balance sheet. A strong balance sheet helps us withstand setbacks and enables us to take advantage of opportunities. Over the last 2 years, we've seen both sides of that coin. Coming into 2020, we were better than our leverage target, and that helped us when we were hit with the pandemic-related downturn.
Then this year, we saw the other side where our extra capacity created as a result of our outperformance in the first quarter gave us the ability to take advantage of 2 acquisition opportunities. We see both of those acquisitions as adding value to the firm. Second, we are maintaining our capital discipline through our elevated return criteria, a good track record of execution, and by self-funding our investments.
We are also maintaining our cost discipline. We have always been lean, but last year at this time, we were completing an evaluation of how we were organized and how we could work even more efficiently. We implemented changes resulting in an estimated full year run rate efficiencies of about $100 million a year. In that effort, we were aiming for something beyond efficiency, greater effectiveness. And we can see that coming through in the functions we centralized under the leadership of our Chief Operating Officer, James Holland.
We are already seeing the benefits in project management and other functions. Finally, we are returning value to shareholders with the year-over-year dividend increase to $1.08 annualized, providing an increased but well-covered dividend, strong balance sheet, capital and cost discipline, returning value to shareholders. Those are the principles we operate by, and we have done so regardless of what is in fashion at the moment.
We have accomplished some important work so far in 2021, which I believe will lead to long-term distinction. First, we're having a record year financially, attributable to our outperformance in the first quarter. We've continued to execute well on our projects with our 2 interstate gas group projects coming in ahead of schedule, as noted in the press release. and we have continued to find new opportunities with a small net increase in our backlog this quarter.
Second, we completed the 2 important acquisitions, the larger 1 stage coach showing our confidence in the long-term value of our natural gas business and taking our total operated storage capacity to 700 Bcf. We believe in the long-term value of flexibility and deliverability in the gas business. that was demonstrated last winter. We are seeing it with the recent tightening in the natural gas markets here and abroad and in our rates on storage renewals.
Third, we've continued to advance the ball on the ongoing evolution in energy markets and in our ESG performance. As things stand today, 69% of our backlog is in support of low-carbon infrastructure. That includes natural gas, of course, but it also includes $250 million of organic projects supporting renewable diesel in our products and terminals business units and our renewable natural gas projects.
Repurposing and building assets at our current terminal locations to support the energy sources of the future. Importantly, too, that 69% is projected to come in at a weighted average 3.6x EBITDA multiple of the expansion capital spend. So we're getting attractive returns on these investments.
Further, our DAS team has now concluded 3 responsibly sourced gas transactions. Those are low emissions along the chain from the producer through our transmission and storage business. We'll soon be publishing our ESG report, including both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, we have incorporated ESG reporting and risk management into our existing management processes, and the report will explain how.
In the meantime, Sustainalytics has us ranked #1 in our sector for how we manage ESG risk and 2 other rating services have us in the top 10. This is increasingly a point of distinction with our investors, our regulators and our customers.
With all of this, our projects, these commercial transactions and our ESG reporting and risk management, we continue to advance the ball on ESG and the evolution in energy markets without sacrificing returns. We continue to focus on the G governance in ESG as well. These things are all important to our long-term success, and we have advanced it all significantly on all 3 in 2021.
We believe the winners in our sector will have strong balance sheets, low-cost operations that are safe and environmentally sound and the ability to get things done in difficult circumstances. As always, we will evolve to meet the challenges and opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

And so I'm going to start with the natural gas business unit for the quarter. Transport volumes were up about 3% or approximately 1.1 million dekatherms per day versus the third quarter of '20.

Transport volumes were up about 3% or approximately 1.1 million dekatherms per day versus the third quarter of '20. And that was driven primarily by increased LNG deliveries and the PHP in service. And then some -- those increases were somewhat offset by declines on our West pipes due to the declining Rockies production, pipeline outages and contract expirations.
Physical deliveries to LNG facilities off of our pipeline averaged 5.1 million dekatherms per day. That's a 3.3 million dekatherm per day increase versus the third quarter of '20 when there are a lot of canceled cargoes. Our market share of deliveries to LNG facilities is approximately 50%.
Exports to Mexico were down in the quarter when compared to the second quarter of '20 as a result of a new third-party pipeline capacity added during the quarter. Overall, deliveries to power plants were down, as you might expect with the higher natural gas prices.
Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 4% in the quarter compared to the third quarter of '20. But for gathering volumes, I think the more informative comparison is the sequential quarter. So compared to the second quarter of this year, volumes were up 5%, with nice increases in the Eagle Ford and the Haynesville volumes, which were up 12% and 8%, respectively.
In our products pipeline segment, refined product volumes were up 12% for the quarter versus the third quarter of 2020. And compared to the prepandemic levels, which we used the third quarter of 2019 as a reference point, road fuels were down about 3% and jet fuel was down about 21%. You might remember that in the second quarter, road fuels were basically flat versus the pre-pandemic number. So we did see some impact of the Delta variant during the quarter.
Crude and condensate volumes were down about 7% in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2020. And sequentially, they were down about 4%. In our Terminals business segment, our liquids utilization percentage remains high at 94%. If you exclude tanks out of service for required inspection, utilization is approximately 97%. Our Rack business, which serves consumer domestic demand are up nicely versus the third quarter of '20, but they're down about 5% versus pre-pandemic levels.
Now if you exclude some lost business and a rack closure, so trying to get volumes on an apples-to-apples basis, volumes on our rack terminals slightly exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Our hub facilities in Houston and New York, which are more driven by refinery runs, international trade and blending dynamics have shown less recovery than our rack terminals versus the pre-pandemic levels.
In our marine tanker business, we continue to experience weakness. However, we've recently seen increased customer interest. On the bulk side, volumes were up 19%, so very nicely, driven by coal, steel and petcoke. Bulk volumes overall are still down about 3% versus 2019 on an apples-to-apples comparison. But if you just look at coal, steel and petcoke on a combined basis, they're essentially flat to pre-pandemic levels. In our CO2 segment, crude volumes were down about 6%. CO2 volumes were down about 5%, but NGL volumes were up 7%. 
On price, we didn't see a benefit from the increase in crude price due to the hedges we've put in place in prior periods when crude prices were lower. We do, however, expect to benefit from higher crude prices in future periods on our unhedged barrels and as we layer on additional hedges in the current price environment.
We did see NGL price benefit in the quarter as we tend to hedge less of these volumes. Compared to our budget, we're currently anticipating that both oil volumes and CO2 volumes will exceed budget as well as oil, NGL and CO2 prices. Better oil production is primarily driven by reduced decline in the base production and better project performance at SACROC.
So overall, we're seeing increased natural gas transport volumes primarily from LNG exports. Seeing increased gas gathering volumes in the Eagle Ford and the Haynesville on a sequential basis. Product volumes are recovering versus 2020. However, road fuels were down about 3% versus pre-pandemic levels versus flat with pre-pandemic levels last quarter as we likely saw an impact from the Delta variant. Versus our budget CO2, crude oil production is outperforming and we're getting some nice help on price.
We're still experiencing weakness in our Jones Act tankers and the Bakken has been a little slower than we anticipated in bringing on new wells. But our producer customers have indicated that they'll continue bringing on new production with some wells being pushed into 2020.
With that, I'll turn it over to David."

So for the third quarter of 2021, we're declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share, which is $1.08 annualized and 3% up from the third quarter of last year. This quarter, we generated revenues of $3.8 billion, up $905 million from the third quarter of 2020. We had an associated increase in cost of sales with an increase there of $904 million, both of those increases driven by higher commodity prices versus last year. Our net income for the quarter was $495 million, up 9% from the third quarter of '20. And our adjusted earnings per share was $0.22, up $0.01 from last year.
Moving on to our segment and distributable cash flow performance. Our natural gas segment was up $8 million for the quarter. Incremental contributions from Stagecoach and PHP were partially offset by lower contributions from FEP where we've had contract expirations and lower usage and parking loan activity on our EPNG system.
The product segment was up $11 million, driven by continued refined product volume recovery, partially offset by some lower crude volumes in the Bakken. Terminal segment was down $13 million, driven by weakness in our Jones Act tanker business, partially offset by the continued refined product recovery volume -- excuse me, volume recovery we've seen there.
Our G&A and corporate charges were higher by $28 million due to lower capital spend, resulting in less capitalized G&A this quarter versus a year ago. as well as cost savings we experienced in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Those are partially offset by cost savings we experienced this year due to our organizational efficiency efforts, as well as lower noncash pension expenses this year versus last.
Our JV DD&A was lower by $30 million, primarily due to lower contributions from Ruby Pipeline. Interest expense was favorable $15 million, driven mostly by lower debt balance this year versus last. Our cash taxes were favorable $37 million, and that was due mostly due to 2020 payments of taxes that were deferred into -- in the second quarter into the third quarter. The full year, cash taxes are expected to be just slightly unfavorable to 2020 and slightly favorable to our budget.
Sustaining capital was unfavorable this quarter, $64 million, driven by spending in our natural gas segment. And that's only slightly more than we budgeted for the quarter, though for the full year, we expect to be about $65 million higher than in budget with most of that variance coming in the fourth quarter.
Total DCF of $1.013 billion or $0.44 per share is down $0.04 from last year. Our full year guidance is consistent with what we provided last quarter with DCF at $5.4 billion and EBITDA at $7.9 billion.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter at 4.0x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, and we expect to end the year at 4.0x as well. This level of benefits from largely nonrecurring EBITDA generated during the first quarter during the winter storm year event. And our long-term leverage target of around 4.5x has not changed.
Our net debt ended the quarter at $31.6 billion, down $424 million from year-end and up $1.423 billion from the end of the second quarter. To reconcile that change in net debt for the quarter, we generated $1.013 billion of Bcf. We paid out dividends of $600 million. We closed the Stagecoach and Conectric acquisitions which collectively were $1.5 billion. We spent $150 million on growth CapEx and JV contributions and we had a working capital use of $175 million, mostly interest expense payments in the quarter. And that explains the majority of the change for the quarter.
For the change from year-end, we've generated $4.367 billion of DCF, paid out $1.8 billion of dividends. We spent $413 million [indiscernible] comes in, and we've had a working capital mostly interest expense payments. And that kind of date. And that completes the financial review. So back to Steve."

We view this as an attractive opportunity, but it will take some time to develop. And I think that's important to understand. The 45Q tax credits as they were finalized at the beginning of this year, do make economic certain investments primarily related to capturing the flu stream off of ethanol facilities and gas processing facilities and primarily those in West Texas, which are adjacent to our existing CO2 infrastructure.
So there are some things to work through here, and let me give you a few examples. One is you have to get the underground injection permits. That's a long drawn-out process today that should get shortened up in Texas, in particular. In the legislature last time, they gave the Railroad Commission primacy on that. They have to go apply for that at EPA, but that will shorten up the process from a 5- or 6-year process to something much more brisk, I would think. And then the other thing to think about is just the pipe itself. So the pipe, it's more -- much more efficient, far more efficient to move CO2 and liquid form that requires high-pressure special purpose pipe, which we have. 2,000 PSI through the pipe. That's not something that you can achieve with a repurposed oil or gas pipe.
Now we've looked at this, and we think it are potentially some repurpose opportunities. I think the breakeven cutoff there is like 350 a day or less. But otherwise, you need some specialized facilities to move it efficiently and to inject it into the ground. And so we think we've got an advantage in that. We got to get the permitting shortened up and we got to get [indiscernible] are in active conversations."

We have signed up some incremental business in Texas, and we have also been able to, particularly on our flexible storage, we have seen rate increases, pretty good rate increases. Because I think everybody got a bit of a wake-up call on the underlying value of storage. And we are working on additional incremental business. We have talked publicly with regulators and others about a project that would add additional delivery capability in the state of Texas that would help support more power and human needs loads even outside of what is really our current more active market area. But we think, too, that we're seeing that really across the country that as things tighten up in these markets, people are putting value as they should, put value on firm deliverability.
And let's face it, supply hasn't quite kept pace with demand, particularly as export demand has grown, power demand has come off a little bit, as Kim mentioned, but it's fairly strong, and industrial demand is strong, residential commercial is seasonal. But the demand has outstripped supply. And the producers are working on it, but it hasn't come back as fast as it came back, for example, when we merged out of the 2015, 2016 downturn. So the value of deliverable to the generation stack as people look at winter coming, as people look at the experience we just had, we think that that's going to be attractive, and we're seeing that in real transactions."

We've had some timing shifts in the Bakken, as Kim mentioned. But generally speaking, I think it's the case that producers are responding. But again, not responding as quickly as they did in seeding disciplined about coming back in. They're enjoying the higher prices, but not responding as much out of the concern about capital discipline. However, for the rigs in the Permian now are owned by private players. And so the supply will come back, whichever capital source drives it. This has been coming back a little bit slower. Tom?"

I think it is 2 points here. One, really thinking about the project. It's no secret to anybody. Those are harder to permit and build. But a lot on the other hand, a lot of the growth is on the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast, the growth in gas demand that we expect. Their time frame on when it might be needed out of the Permian has moved up a bit. And so those discussions are kind of a function of Current prices in both crude and to some extent, natural gas.
But really huge projects, I think, are probably not as likely to get done or permitted. And we think the 1% to 2% is still probably about right, building off our existing network and attractive returns."

But I want to make a further point about the bucketing here, really flexible storage like we have about 30 or 40 Bcf of that in our Texas Intrastate business. Stage coaches at a pretty flexible storage asset as well. That's where the value is really appreciating the most. If you think about some of our shorter-term storage-related services like park and loan in a backward-dated market, there's not as much opportunity to park gas for customers.

But in the aggregate and in the overall outlook, storage is becoming more valuable in our judgment. And that's what made -- and we're seeing that, which was somewhat fortuitous."

But there's work to be done commercially and all of that from here to there. But it's very economic. And we've got some scale, we believe, to help commercialize this maybe more quickly than others.
So optimistic, but hard to quantify the when -- and the when and how much right now. the voluntary market, we have been buying in the voluntary market, that means about the RINs volatility. And but at very nice returns that are -- that would be locked in. And so I think that market is real because of the ESG commitment and the commitment for gas is strong. It's the interest in the transport market. I mean, when you think about the technological and economic barriers of electrifying heavy duty natural gas and even LNG as an attractive alternative that helps some of the big fleet operators meet their climate objectives and do so at attractive prices.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you, as we always do, that KMI's earnings release today and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exc",602,"Thank you, Michelle. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you, as we always do, that KMI's earnings release today and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking statements.
Now every quarter, I open this call by talking about our financial philosophy at Kinder Morgan. I always mention strong and consistent cash flow and explain how we use that cash flow to pay a healthy and growing dividend, internally fund our expansion CapEx needs, keep our balance sheet strong and opportunistically buy back our shares I believe our shareholders understand and appreciate the strength of our cash flow even if there are varied positions on what we should do with it.
But in a broader sense, if we examine what owning a share of KMI really amounts to, I've come to believe, as the largest shareholder, that we are receiving a very good and growing yield on our investment, while at the same time, getting an amazing optionality on future developments. Let me explain that optionality.
We have entered the energy transition field with what I consider to be solid investments that Steve and the team will discuss further, and our cash flow gives us the ability to pursue those opportunities in size if and only if the investments achieve a satisfactory return. And I believe that if we so desire, we will be able to attract new partners at a time of our choosing, whether public or private, to participate in those opportunities with us on terms favorable to KMI.
I also firmly believe that there is still a long runway for fossil fuels around the world, particularly for natural gas. If you read carefully the latest studies from the IEA, OPEC and from various other energy experts, you will see projections that fossil fuels will continue to supply the majority of our energy needs for at least the next quarter century, and that natural gas will be at the forefront of fulfilling those needs.
If these projections are anywhere close to accurate, a company like Kinder Morgan with significant free cash flow will find significant opportunities to invest in this core business where we have substantial expertise and a huge network that can be expanded and extended. So this is another option that you receive as a KMI shareholder.
I would add that the events of this fall throughout Europe, Asia and North America demonstrate that the transition to renewables is going to be a lot longer and more difficult than many of its proponents originally thought. In short, while the world makes the transition, the lights need to stay on, homes need to be heated, and our industrial production needs to be sustained.
Finally, we always have the option of returning dollars to our shareholders through selective stock repurchases, in addition to the healthy return we are providing through our dividend. This is why I say that an investment in KMI provides you with a nice locked-in return with this dividend and then provides really good optionality for the future.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve."

I'll give you an overview of our business and the current environment for our sector as we see it. Then our President, giving will cover the outlook and segment updates. Our CFO, David Michels, will take you through the financials",818,"All right. Thanks, Rich. I'll give you an overview of our business and the current environment for our sector as we see it. Then our President, giving will cover the outlook and segment updates. Our CFO, David Michels, will take you through the financials, and then we'll take your questions.
Our financial principles remain the same. First, maintaining a strong balance sheet. A strong balance sheet helps us withstand setbacks and enables us to take advantage of opportunities. Over the last 2 years, we've seen both sides of that coin. Coming into 2020, we were better than our leverage target, and that helped us when we were hit with the pandemic-related downturn.
Then this year, we saw the other side where our extra capacity, created as a result of our outperformance in the first quarter, gave us the ability to take advantage of 2 acquisition opportunities. We see both of those acquisitions as adding value to the firm. 
Second, we are maintaining our capital discipline through our elevated return criteria, a good track record of execution, and by self-funding our investments.
We are also maintaining our cost discipline. We have always been lean, but last year at this time, we were completing an evaluation of how we were organized and how we could work even more efficiently. We implemented changes resulting in an estimated full year run rate efficiencies of about $100 million a year. In that effort, we were aiming for something beyond efficiency, greater effectiveness. And we can see that coming through in the functions we centralized under the leadership of our Chief Operating Officer, James Holland. We are already seeing the benefits in project management and other functions. 
Finally, we are returning value to shareholders with the year-over-year dividend increase to $1.08 annualized, providing an increased but well-covered dividend, strong balance sheet, capital and cost discipline, returning value to shareholders. Those are the principles we operate by, and we have done so regardless of what is in fashion at the moment.
We have accomplished some important work so far in 2021, which I believe will lead to long-term distinction. First, we're having a record year financially, attributable to our outperformance in the first quarter. We've continued to execute well on our projects with our 2 interstate gas group projects coming in ahead of schedule, as noted in the press release. And we have continued to find new opportunities with a small net increase in our backlog this quarter.
Second, we completed the 2 important acquisitions, the larger one, Stagecoach, showing our confidence in the long-term value of our natural gas business and taking our total operated storage capacity to 700 Bcf. We believe in the long-term value of flexibility and deliverability in the gas business. That was demonstrated last winter, and we are seeing it with the recent tightening in the natural gas markets here and abroad and in our rates on storage renewals.
Third, we've continued to advance the ball on the ongoing evolution in energy markets and in our ESG performance. As things stand today, 69% of our backlog is in support of low-carbon infrastructure. That includes natural gas, of course, but it also includes $250 million of organic projects supporting renewable diesel in our products and terminals business units and our renewable natural gas projects.
Repurposing and building assets at our current terminal locations to support the energy sources of the future. Importantly, too, that 69% is projected to come in at a weighted average 3.6x EBITDA multiple of the expansion capital spend. So we're getting attractive returns on these investments.
Further, our DAS team has now concluded 3 responsibly sourced gas transactions. Those are low emissions along the chain from the producer through our transmission and storage business. We'll soon be publishing our ESG report, including both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, we have incorporated ESG reporting and risk management into our existing management processes, and the report will explain how.
In the meantime, Sustainalytics has us ranked #1 in our sector for how we manage ESG risk, and 2 other rating services have us in the top 10. This is increasingly a point of distinction with our investors, our regulators and our customers.
With all of this, our projects, these commercial transactions and our ESG reporting and risk management, we continue to advance the ball on ESG and the evolution in energy markets without sacrificing returns. We continue to focus on the G governance in ESG as well. These things are all important to our long-term success, and we have advanced it all significantly on all 3 in 2021.
We believe the winners in our sector will have strong balance sheets, low-cost operations that are safe and environmentally sound and the ability to get things done in difficult circumstances. As always, we will evolve to meet the challenges and opportunities.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim."

And so I'm going to start with the natural gas business unit for the quarter. Transport volumes were up about 3% or approximately 1.1 million dekatherms per day versus the third quarter of '20.

Transport volumes were up about 3% or approximately 1.1 million dekatherms per day versus the third quarter of '20. And that was driven primarily by increased LNG deliveries and the PHP in service. And then some -- those increases were somewhat offset by declines on our West pipes due to the declining Rockies production, pipeline outages and contract expirations.
Physical deliveries to LNG facilities off of our pipeline averaged 5.1 million dekatherms per day. That's a 3.3 million dekatherm per day increase versus the third quarter of '20 when there were a lot of canceled cargoes. Our market share of deliveries to LNG facilities is approximately 50%. 
Exports to Mexico were down in the quarter when compared to the second quarter of '20 as a result of a new third-party pipeline capacity added during the quarter. Overall, deliveries to power plants were down, as you might expect with the higher natural gas prices.
Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 4% in the quarter compared to the third quarter of '20. But for gathering volumes, I think the more informative comparison is the sequential quarter. So compared to the second quarter of this year, volumes were up 5%, with nice increases in the Eagle Ford and the Haynesville volumes, which were up 12% and 8%, respectively.
In our products pipeline segment, refined product volumes were up 12% for the quarter versus the third quarter of 2020. And compared to the pre-pandemic levels, which we used the third quarter of 2019 as a reference point, road fuels were down about 3% and jet fuel was down about 21%. You might remember that in the second quarter, road fuels were basically flat versus the pre-pandemic number. So we did see some impact of the Delta variant during the quarter.
Crude and condensate volumes were down about 7% in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2020. And sequentially, they were down about 4%. 
In our terminals business segment, our liquids utilization percentage remains high at 94%. If you exclude tanks out of service for required inspection, utilization is approximately 97%. 
Our rack business, which serves consumer domestic demand, are up nicely versus the third quarter of '20, but they're down about 5% versus pre-pandemic levels. Now if you exclude some lost business and a rack closure, so trying to get volumes on an apples-to-apples basis, volumes on our rack terminals slightly exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Our hub facilities in Houston and New York, which are more driven by refinery runs, international trade and blending dynamics, have shown less recovery than our rack terminals versus the pre-pandemic levels.
In our marine tanker business, we continue to experience weakness. However, we've recently seen increased customer interest. On the bulk side, volumes were up 19%, so very nicely, driven by coal, steel and petcoke. Bulk volumes overall are still down about 3% versus 2019 on an apples-to-apples comparison. But if you just look at coal, steel and petcoke on a combined basis, they're essentially flat to pre-pandemic levels. 
In our CO2 segment, crude volumes were down about 6%. CO2 volumes were down about 5%. But NGL volumes were up 7%. 
On price, we didn't see a benefit from the increase in crude price due to the hedges we've put in place in prior periods when crude prices were lower. We do, however, expect to benefit from higher crude prices in future periods on our unhedged barrels and as we layer on additional hedges in the current price environment.
We did see NGL price benefit in the quarter as we tend to hedge less of these volumes. Compared to our budget, we're currently anticipating that both oil volumes and CO2 volumes will exceed budget as well as oil, NGL and CO2 prices. Better oil production is primarily driven by reduced decline in the base production and better project performance at SACROC.
So overall, we're seeing increased natural gas transport volumes primarily from LNG exports. Seeing increased gas gathering volumes in the Eagle Ford and the Haynesville on a sequential basis. Product volumes are recovering versus 2020. However, road fuels were down about 3% versus pre-pandemic levels versus flat with pre-pandemic levels last quarter as we likely saw an impact from the Delta variant. Versus our budget CO2, crude oil production is outperforming and we're getting some nice help on price.
We're still experiencing weakness in our Jones Act tankers and the Bakken has been a little slower than we anticipated in bringing on new wells. But our producer customers have indicated that they'll continue bringing on new production with some wells being pushed into 2020.
With that, I'll turn it over to David."

So for the third quarter of 2021, we're declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share, which is $1.08 annualized and 3% up from the third quarter of last year. This quarter, we generated revenues of $3.8 billion, up $905 million from the third quarter of 2020. We had an associated increase in cost of sales with an increase there of $904 million, both of those increases driven by higher commodity prices versus last year. Our net income for the quarter was $495 million, up 9% from the third quarter of '20. And our adjusted earnings per share was $0.22, up $0.01 from last year.
Moving on to our segment and distributable cash flow performance. Our natural gas segment was up $8 million for the quarter. Incremental contributions from Stagecoach and PHP were partially offset by lower contributions from FEP where we've had contract expirations and lower usage and parking loan activity on our EPNG system.
The product segment was up $11 million, driven by continued refined product volume recovery, partially offset by some lower crude volumes in the Bakken. Terminal segment was down $13 million, driven by weakness in our Jones Act tanker business, partially offset by the continued refined product recovery volume -- or excuse me, volume recovery we've seen there.
Our G&A and corporate charges were higher by $28 million due to lower capital spend, resulting in less capitalized G&A this quarter versus a year ago, as well as cost savings we experienced in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Those are partially offset by cost savings we experienced this year due to our organizational efficiency efforts, as well as lower noncash pension expenses this year versus last.
Our JV DD&A was lower by $30 million, primarily due to lower contributions from Ruby Pipeline. Interest expense was favorable $15 million, driven mostly by lower debt balance this year versus last. Our cash taxes were favorable $37 million, and that was due -- mostly due to 2020 payments of taxes that were deferred into -- in the second quarter into the third quarter. For the full year, cash taxes are expected to be just slightly unfavorable to 2020 and slightly favorable to our budget.
Sustaining capital was unfavorable this quarter, $64 million, driven by spending in our natural gas segment. And that's only slightly more than we budgeted for the quarter, though for the full year, we expect to be about $65 million higher than in budget with most of that variance coming in the fourth quarter.
Total DCF of $1.013 billion or $0.44 per share is down $0.04 from last year. Our full year guidance is consistent with what we provided last quarter, with DCF at $5.4 billion and EBITDA at $7.9 billion.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter at 4.0x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, and we expect to end the year at 4.0x as well. This level benefits from the largely nonrecurring EBITDA generated during the first quarter during the winter storm Yuri event. And our long-term leverage target of around 4.5x has not changed.
Our net debt ended the quarter at $31.6 billion, down $424 million from year-end and up $1.423 billion from the end of the second quarter. To reconcile that change in net debt for the quarter, we generated $1.013 billion of Bcf. We paid out dividends of $600 million. We closed the Stagecoach and Kinetrex acquisitions which collectively were $1.5 billion. We spent $150 million on growth CapEx and JV contributions. And we had a working capital use of $175 million, mostly interest expense payments in the quarter. And that explains the majority of the change for the quarter.
For the change from year-end, we've generated $4.367 billion of DCF. We paid out $1.8 billion of dividends. We spent $450 million in growth CapEx and JV contributions. We had the $1.5 billion Stagecoach and Kinetrex acquisitions. We have $413 million come in on the NGPL sale. And we've had a working capital use of $600 million, mostly interest expense payments.

I won't express those in terms of comparisons to others and the announcements they've made. I want to be really clear about this. We view this as an attractive opportunity, but it will take some time to develop. And I think that's important to understand. 
The 45Q tax credits, as they were finalized at the beginning of this year, do make economic certain investments primarily related to capturing the flu stream off of ethanol facilities and gas processing facilities and primarily those in West Texas, which are adjacent to our existing CO2 infrastructure.
So there are some things to work through here, and let me give you a few examples. One is you have to get the underground injection permits. That's a long drawn-out process today that should get shortened up in Texas, in particular. In the legislature last time, they gave the Railroad Commission primacy on that. They have to go apply for that at EPA. But that will shorten up the process from a 5- or 6-year process to something much more brisk, I would think. 
And then the other thing to think about is just the pipe itself. So the pipe, it's more -- much more efficient, far more efficient to move CO2 in liquid form. That requires high-pressure, special purpose pipe, which we have. 2,000 PSI through the pipe. That's not something that you can achieve with a repurposed oil or gas pipe.
Now we've looked at this, and we think it is -- and for certain applications, particularly smaller volumes, shorter distances, there are potentially some repurpose opportunities. I think the breakeven cutoff there is like 350 a day or less in order to make that more attractive. But otherwise, you need some specialized facilities to move it efficiently and to inject it into the ground. And so we think we've got an advantage in that. We got to get the permitting shortened up and we got to get customers who are nearby our infrastructure in the boat if you will. But it's not a tomorrow thing. It's probably not a next year thing. It's something that's going to take a little bit of time to develop, but we are in active conversations."

We have signed up some incremental business in Texas, and we have also been able to, particularly on our flexible storage, we have seen rate increases, pretty good rate increases. Because I think everybody got a bit of a wake-up call on the underlying value of storage. 
And we are working on additional incremental business. We have talked publicly with regulators and others about a project that would add additional delivery capability in the state of Texas that would help support more power and human needs, loads even outside of what is really our current more active market area. 
But we think, too, that we're seeing that really across the country that as things tighten up in these markets, people are putting value, as they should, put value on firm deliverability. And let's face it, supply hasn't quite kept pace with demand, particularly as export demand has grown, power demand has come off a little bit, as Kim mentioned, but it's fairly strong. And industrial demand is strong, residential commercial is seasonal. But the demand has outstripped supply. And the producers are working on it, but it hasn't come back as fast as it came back, for example, when we merged out of the 2015, 2016 downturn. 
So the value of deliverability, firm deliverability, as you get more intermittent resources in the generation stack, as people look at winter coming, as people look at the experience we just had, we think that, that's going to be attractive, and we're seeing that in real transactions."

As Kim mentioned, we are starting to see some sequential improvement -- sequential quarter, Q2 to Q3, and there's been a lot more lively conversation, I think, with producers who are bringing some rigs in and starting to share some development plans.
We've had some timing shifts in the Bakken, as Kim mentioned. But generally speaking, I think it's the case that producers are responding. But again, not responding as quickly as they did in the last downturn. And as many have reported, you're seeing the publicly traded producers continue to be exceedingly disciplined about coming back in. They're enjoying the higher prices, but not responding as much out of their concern about capital discipline. 
However, I think something on the order of half of the rigs in the Permian now are owned by private players. And so the supply will come back, whichever capital source drives it. This has been coming back a little bit slower. Tom?"

Second one, just maybe getting your latest thoughts around capital spending going forward kind of on a multiyear basis. Historically, you guys have talked about $2 billion to $3 billion spending in any given year. And then, of course, with the pandemic and the slowdown, I think that fell to sort of $1 billion or less was kind of the new number. 
But since then, we've seen the outlook kind of dramatically improve, especially when you consider a lot of the energy transition opportunities in front of you that Rich mentioned earlier. And so just wondering, how do you think about an appropriate level of growth CapEx or M&A spending, however you want to think about it going forward, that sort of keeps you within your target leverage and also allows you to grow the dividend?"

So when we sort of adjusted the outlook from $2 billion to $3 billion to something lower, we adjusted it to $1 billion to $2 billion. and we still think that, that's a pretty good estimate. And this year, we ended up on the expansion capital front under $1 billion, as you mentioned. So we were at about $800 million for this year. 
And look, this is a function of kind of what -- what kind of activity there is out there. A lot of the -- some of the new origination did come in the renewable diesel area and the renewable natural gas area, as we talked about earlier, but we continue to have 53%, I think of our backlog, is for natural gas. And so we still think the $1 billion to $2 billion is about right.
I think it is 2 points here. One, really big mega projects. It's no secret to anybody. Those are harder to permit and build. But a lot -- on the other hand, a lot of the growth is on the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast, the growth in gas demand that we expect. And we're just starting to hear a little bit more from Permian players about the need for another pipeline. They don't need it right now, but their time frame on when it might be needed out of the Permian has moved up a bit. And so those discussions are very advanced. It's just kind of a function of current prices in both crude, and to some extent, natural gas.
But really huge projects, I think, are probably not as likely to get done or permitted. And so we think the $1 billion to $2 billion is still probably about right, building off our existing network at attractive returns."

But I want to make a further point about the bucketing here. Really flexible storage like we have about 30 or 40 Bcf of that in our Texas Intrastate business. Stage coaches are a pretty flexible storage asset as well. That's where the value is really appreciating the most. If you think about some of our shorter-term storage-related services like park and loan, in a backward-dated market, there's not as much opportunity to park gas for customers. And so that shorter-term business gets a little more limited.
But in the aggregate and in the overall outlook, storage is becoming more valuable in our judgment. And that's what made -- and we're seeing that, and it's also what made the acquisition opportunity, which was somewhat fortuitous, but made it attractive to us."

Those were all under contract, under EPC contract, et cetera. At the time that we close, that's been kicked off, those are on track. 
In terms of the opportunity set, there are hundreds of landfill opportunities, but there are other competitive players out there. We think we bring some scale to that business. The returns are attractive. The capital commitment is $25 million to $40 million essentially per installation. 
I guess what I'd say, Keith, is it's a little early to tell right now when and how much, okay? We're keeping a very close eye on it. There's a lot of interest. There's shadow backlog, if you will, customer discussions underway on a significant number of additional landfills. But there's work to be done commercially and all of that from here to there. 
But it's very economic. And we've got some scale, we believe, to help commercialize this maybe more quickly than others. So optimistic, but hard to quantify the when and the -- or the -- yes, the when and how much right now. 
The voluntary market, we have good, real conversations with real counterparties who are interested in buying in the voluntary market, that means about the RINs value and without the RINS volatility, and -- but at very nice returns that are -- that would be locked in. And so I think that market is real because of the ESG commitment and the net zero commitments that people are making. Their interest in doing -- using renewable natural gas is strong. 
And so is the interest in the transport market. I mean, when you think about the technological and economic barriers of electrifying heavy duty trucking, compressed natural gas and even LNG is an attractive alternative that helps some of the big fleet operators meet their climate objectives and do so at attractive prices. 
And the other thing I would mention is we sell our RINS not quite exactly at the time we generate them, but we've pretty much sold our RINs inventory for the year and at prices that are better than what we have in the acquisition model."

So there is an economic return associated with the lower cost of running the equipment and with the volumes that we are recovering, and that gets us to a nice economic return.
