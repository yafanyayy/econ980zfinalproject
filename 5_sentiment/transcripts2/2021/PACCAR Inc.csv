Harry Schippers, Michael Barkley, and I will update you on our good fourth quarter and full year 2020 results as well as provide you an update on other business highlights. First, I really appreciate our outstanding PACCAR employee",694,"Good morning, everyone. Harry Schippers, Michael Barkley, and I will update you on our good fourth quarter and full year 2020 results as well as provide you an update on other business highlights. First, I really appreciate our outstanding PACCAR employees around the world. Their focus on safety and health throughout the pandemic continues to be outstanding as they deliver the highest quality trucks and transportation solutions to our customers.
In 2020, PACCAR achieved annual revenues of $18.7 billion and good net income of $1.3 billion. PACCAR's performance benefited from a recovery in truck demand to normal levels in the second half of the year and strong performance from our Trucks, Parts and Financial Services divisions.
PACCAR has achieved 82 consecutive years of net income. The company has paid a dividend every year since 1941, and and has delivered annual dividends of approximately half of net income for many years. In 2020, PACCAR declared dividends of $1.98 per share. PACCAR's fourth quarter revenues were $5.6 billion, and fourth quarter net income increased to $406 million. PACCAR parts achieved fourth quarter revenues of $1.07 billion and record pretax profits of $223 million, which was an 8% increase compared to the same period last year.
PACCAR delivered 40,700 trucks during the fourth quarter compared to $36,000 in the third quarter. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect deliveries to be 10% higher than the fourth quarter due to stronger markets and higher customer demand for Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF's great trucks.
In 2020, U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck retail sales were 216,500 units. Kenworth and Peterbilt's combined Class 8 market share increased to 30.1%, and medium-duty share increased to a record 22.6%. For 2021, the U.S. economy and industrial production are projected to expand by about 4%. The strengthening economy, low fuel prices and high volumes of freight are good for the truck industry. We estimate the 2021 U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck market to increase to a range of 250,000 to 280,000 vehicles. European above 16-tonne truck registrations were 230,500 last year, and DAF achieved strong market share of 16.3%.
In 2021, the European economies are projected to continue growing, and we expect the above 16-tonne truck registrations to increase to a range of 250,000 to 280,000. The South American above 16-tonne truck industry registrations were 93,000 last year. In Brazil, DAF increased its share of the greater than 16-tonne market from 4.3% to a record 5.7%.
In 2021, the South American market is expected to increase to a range of 100,000 to 110,000 units. Truck and parts gross margins were 12.6% in the fourth quarter. We estimate first quarter truck and parts gross margins to increase to around 13.5%. PACCAR takes a rigorous approach to controlling costs throughout all phases of the business cycle and continues to deliver industry-leading margins. Last week, we announced a strategic partnership with Aurora, a leader in autonomous driving technology. This partnership will integrate PACCAR's autonomously enabled truck platform with the Aurora self-driving sensor and software system. The goal of this collaboration is to create a commercially viable autonomous truck that enhances safety and operational efficiency for PACCAR's customers. PACCAR 0-emissions vehicles continue to lead the industry. Our 0-emissions vehicles have accumulated nearly 500,000 miles. Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF battery electric trucks are beginning production in the second quarter of this year, and we're continuing in the development of hydrogen fuel cell powered 0-emissions vehicles.
Last year, PACCAR was again recognized as a global leader in environmental practices by the reporting firm, CDP, which places PACCAR in the top 15% of over 9,500 reporting companies. And the women in trucking organization ordered our PACCAR corporate office, Peterbilt, Kenworth, PACCAR Parts and Dynacraft as a top place for women to work. Kenworth and Peterbilt received a total of 5 manufacturing leadership awards from the National Association of Manufacturers and the DAF XF are in the fleet truck of the Year 2020 award in the United Kingdom. There are a multitude of exciting things happening around PACCAR.
And Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and PACCAR's Investments in future growth. Harrie?"

In 2020, PACCAR Parts generated excellent annual revenues of more than $3.9 billion and annual pretax profit of $799 million fourth quarter parts revenues were a record $1.07 billion, and quarterly pretax profit was a record $223 million. One of the great things about PACCAR Parts is that it provides steady profitability through all phases of the business cycle. PACCAR has increased market shares over the years, resulting in a greater number of truck and powertrain parts opportunities. PACCAR Parts' excellent long-term growth reflects investments in distribution and technology. PACCAR Parts has expanded its global network to 18 distribution centers and is currently constructing another facility in Louisville, Kentucky. PACCAR Parts' investment and leadership and e-commerce technologies proved valuable last year as e-commerce retail sales increased by 25%.
In 2021, we estimate Part sales to grow by 7% to 9%. PACCAR Financial Services achieved 2020 annual revenues of $1.57 billion; annual pretax income of $223 million and portfolio assets of $15.8 billion. The percentage of PACCAR truck sales financed by PACCAR Financial Services increased from 25% to 28% last year. The portfolio continues to perform well with low parts views and low credit losses.
Pretax finance income increased from $55 million in the third quarter to $64 million in the fourth quarter. PACCAR financial added used truck centers in Denton, Texas; Leon, France and Prague Czech Republic last year. And we'll open a new used truck center in Madrid, Spain this year.
Across PACCAR, last year, we invested $570 million in capital and $274 million in R&D. In 2021, we're planning to increase capital investments to the range of $575 million to $625 million, and R&D expenses will grow to be in the range of $350 million to $375 million. These capital and R&D projects will develop the next-generation of fuel-efficient diesel powertrains, 0-emissions vehicles as well as advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous vehicles, connected services, and cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities. PACCAR has started 2021 with strong momentum. The truck and parts businesses are growing, Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF market share is increasing, and we're investing in new trucks and technologies that will deliver enhanced operational efficiency, safety and environmental benefits to our customers. Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions."

If we look at the world around us right now, the most important thing that we're doing at PACCAR is having the right technologies in place. So we've spent considerable amount of time and energy, bringing to market battery electric vehicles that fit the 0-emissions class, both in Europe and North America, both for our medium-duty and our heavy-duty products, and the key there is making sure we have the right technology and the right leverage for those products as we move forward. So we've done a good job with that. As we shared last time, we announced the sale of the product, and now we're going to production with those trucks beginning in the second quarter. As far as volumes go of those, as we shared last time, we expect that the industry will have volumes in the hundreds in the coming year or 2 and then as we get to the 2025 time frame, like you referenced, that might grow into the thousands. And we would expect that we'll have a good market share representation as the industry comes along. The most important thing, again, right now is make sure we have great technology. And I got to say I'm really excited about the products we're bringing to market. So on the second point of advanced manufacturing. What we're really talking about there is how we have a connected factory. So if we look at how the factory works together, what kind of data analytics we're sharing within the -- in the factories, how the robotics work together and making sure that we just enhance to an even higher degree already excellent equality."

What I would say is that the technologies that are being evaluated right now, batteries and fuel sub, both have capacity to expand range, just takes more batteries or take more fuel cells. So range is really about how much space you take up on the truck. And the energy density at this point in time is higher for fuel cells, for hydrogen fuel cells. So that's an advantage they have. Of course, both types of solutions meet infrastructure development and infrastructural development, and how close charging stations are for either system will decide how much range you need on the vehicle. So I think it's a little early to tell what's going to happen and which technology will play out in which markets."

Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley, and I will update you on our good fourth quarter and full year 2020 results as well as provide you an update on other business highlights. First, I really appreciate our outstanding PACCAR",696,"Hey, good morning, everyone. Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley, and I will update you on our good fourth quarter and full year 2020 results as well as provide you an update on other business highlights. 
First, I really appreciate our outstanding PACCAR employees around the world. Their focus on safety and health throughout the pandemic continues to be outstanding as they deliver the highest quality trucks and transportation solutions to our customers. 
In 2020, we PACCAR achieved annual revenues of $18.7 billion and good net income of $1.3 billion. PACCAR's performance benefited from a recovery in truck demand to normal levels in the second half of the year and strong performance from our trucks, parts and financial services divisions. 
PACCAR has achieved 82 consecutive years of net income. The company has paid a dividend every year since 1941, and has delivered annual dividends of approximately half of net income for many years. In 2020, PACCAR declared dividends of $1.98 per share. PACCAR's fourth quarter revenues were $5.6 billion, and fourth quarter net income increased to $406 million. PACCAR parts achieved fourth quarter revenues of $1.70 billion and record pretax profits of $223 million, which was an 8% increase compared to the same period last year. 
PACCAR delivered 40,700 trucks during the fourth quarter compared to $36,000 in the third quarter. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect deliveries to be 10% higher than the fourth quarter due to stronger markets and higher customer demand for Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF's great trucks. 
In 2020, U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck retail sales were 216,500 units. Kenworth and Peterbilt's combined Class 8 market share increased to 30.1%, and medium-duty share increased to a record 22.6%. For 2021, the U.S. economy and industrial production are projected to expand by about 4%. The strengthening economy, low fuel prices and high volumes of freight are good for the truck industry. We estimate the 2021 U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck market to increase to a range of 250,000 to 280,000 vehicles. European above 16 tonne truck registrations were 230,500 last year, and DAF achieved strong market share of 16.3%. 
In 2021, the European economies are projected to continue growing, and we expect the above 16-tonne truck registrations to increase to a range of 250,000 to 280,000. The South American above 16-tonne truck industry registrations were 93,000 last year. In Brazil, DAF increased its share of the greater than 16-tonne market from 4.3% to a record 5.7%. 
In 2021, the South American market is expected to increase to a range of 100,000 to 110,000 units. Truck and parts gross margins were 12.6% in the fourth quarter. We estimate first quarter truck and parts gross margins to increase to around 13.5%. PACCAR takes a rigorous approach to controlling costs throughout all phases of the business cycle and continues to deliver industry-leading margins. 
Last week, we announced a strategic partnership with Aurora, a leader in autonomous driving technology. This partnership will integrate PACCAR's autonomously enabled truck platform with the Aurora self-driving sensor and software system. The goal of this collaboration is to create a commercially viable autonomous truck that enhances safety and operational efficiency for PACCAR's customers. 
PACCAR's 0-emission vehicles continue to lead the industry. Our 0-emissions vehicles have accumulated nearly 500,000 miles. Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF battery electric trucks are beginning production in the second quarter of this year, and we're continuing in the development of hydrogen fuel cell powered 0-emissions vehicles. 
Last year, PACCAR was again recognized as a global leader in environmental practices by the reporting firm, CDP, which places PACCAR in the top 15% of over 9,500 reporting companies. And the Women in Trucking Organization awarded our PACCAR corporate office, Peterbilt, Kenworth, PACCAR Parts and Dynacraft as a top place for women to work. 
Kenworth and Peterbilt received a total of 5 manufacturing leadership awards from the National Association of Manufacturers and the DAF XF are in the Fleet Truck of the Year 2020 award in the United Kingdom. 
There are a multitude of exciting things happening around PACCAR. And Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and PACCAR's Investments in future growth. Harrie?"

Fourth quarter parts revenues were a record $1.07 billion, and quarterly pretax profit was a record $223 million. 
One of the great things about PACCAR Parts is that it provides steady profitability through all phases of the business cycle. PACCAR has increased market shares over the years, resulting in a greater number of truck and powertrain parts opportunities. PACCAR Parts' excellent long-term growth reflects investments in distribution and technology. PACCAR Parts has expanded its global network to 18 distribution centers and is currently constructing another facility in Louisville, Kentucky. PACCAR Parts' investment and leadership and e-commerce technologies proved valuable last year as e-commerce, retail sales increased by 25%. 
In 2021, we estimate Part sales to grow by 7% to 9%. PACCAR Financial Services achieved 2020 annual revenues of $1.57 billion; annual pretax income of $223 million and portfolio assets of $15.8 billion. The percentage of PACCAR truck sales financed by PACCAR Financial Services increased from 25% to 28% last year. The portfolio continues to perform well with low past dues and low credit losses. 
Pretax finance income increased from $55 million in the third quarter to $64 million in the fourth quarter. PACCAR financial added used truck centers in Denton, Texas; Leon, France and Prague Czech Republic last year. And we'll open a new used truck center in Madrid, Spain this year. 
Across PACCAR, last year, we invested $570 million in capital and $274 million in R&D. In 2021, we're planning to increase capital investments to the range of $575 million to $625 million, and R&D expenses will grow to be in the range of $350 million to $375 million. These capital and R&D projects will develop the next-generation of fuel-efficient diesel powertrains, 0-emissions vehicles as well as advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous vehicles, connected services, and cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities. PACCAR has started 2021 with strong momentum. The truck and parts businesses are growing. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF market share is increasing, and we're investing in new trucks and technologies that will deliver enhanced operational efficiency, safety and environmental benefits to our customers.

If we look at the world around us right now, the most important thing that we're doing at PACCAR is having the right technologies in place. So we've spent considerable amount of time and energy bringing to market battery electric vehicles that fit the 0-emissions class, both in Europe and North America, both for our medium-duty and our heavy-duty products. And the key there is making sure we have the right technology and the right leverage for those products as we move forward. So we've done a good job with that. As we shared last time, we announced the sale of the product. And now we're going to production with those trucks beginning in the second quarter. As far as volumes go of those, as we shared last time, we expect that the industry will have volumes in the hundreds in the coming year or 2. And then as we get to the 2025 time frame, like you referenced, that might grow into the thousands. And we would expect that we'll have a good market share representation as the industry comes along. The most important thing, again, right now is make sure we have great technology. And I got to say, I'm really excited about the products we're bringing to market.

And what I would share with you is the way we think about that question, which we obviously do, is we want to make sure we have the right capabilities for what the customers' needs are. So in autonomy, if there was the right operating environment for Level 4, Level 5 autonomy, we want to have the right products there for our customers as soon as that makes sense, too. And that's why we took the step we did. And similarly, on 0-emissions vehicles, there is going to, at some point, be an economic payback for them. And so that's why we keep being invested in all the different battery electric and hydro fuel cell and hybrid capabilities so that when the market chooses, PACCAR is there for the product that they want. And we kind of think of ourselves as a powertrain agnostic and want to make sure that we can provide the customers the product they need.

Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley and I will update you on a very good first quarter results and business highlights. First, my sincere appreciation to PACCAR's employees around the world for their dedication, hard work and upbeat spirit.",502,"Good morning. Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley and I will update you on a very good first quarter results and business highlights. 
First, my sincere appreciation to PACCAR's employees around the world for their dedication, hard work and upbeat spirit. Throughout the past year's challenges, they have delivered outstanding trucks and services that provide essential goods to our communities. Now as the world moves forward, we have many reasons to be optimistic. 
In the first quarter, PACCAR achieved very good revenues and net income. PACCAR's first quarter sales and financial services revenues increased 13% to $5.85 billion, and first quarter net income increased 31% to $470 million. PACCAR parts increased its first quarter revenues to a record $1.16 billion and parts pretax profits were a record $251 million, 17% higher than the same period last year. Truck and parts gross margins increased from 12.6% to 13.4% in the first quarter. And PACCAR Financial had a great quarter, delivering excellent portfolio performance and achieving pretax income of $76 million. 
PACCAR is having a tremendous year of new product introductions. In February, Peterbilt and Kenworth launched beautiful new heavy-duty truck models. The new Peterbilt Model 579 and next-generation Kenworth T680 feature enhanced aerodynamics and powertrains that deliver up to 7% higher fuel efficiency. They feature new LED headlights, new Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and a state-of-the-art interior with a 15-inch configurable digital display. Truck owners and drivers will appreciate these and many other features in these great new trucks. 
In April, Kenworth and Peterbilt introduced a new medium-duty truck lineup. These vehicles have an 8-inch wider cab, lower cab heights, which makes it easier to get into and out of the truck, best-in-class visibility for enhanced safety and a new premium interior with configurable dash displays. The new medium-duty trucks feature PACCAR's PX-7 and PX-9 engines and the new PACCAR 8-speed automatic transmission. 
In April, DAF began producing CF Electric trucks, and Peterbilt and Kenworth expect to deliver their first production battery electric vehicles in the coming months. PACCAR has strategic partnerships with 2 electric vehicle battery providers, CATL and Romeo Power. These 2 excellent partners provide our customers with the right technology choice for their applications. 
As the U.S. economy recovers, GDP and industrial production are each projected to expand 6.3% this year. Consumer spending, the housing market and the automotive sectors have strengthened. Good freight tonnage, high truck utilization and a shortage of drivers has created strong demand for PACCAR's premium trucks. The 2021 market size will be tempered by the industry-wide undersupply of semiconductors, and we estimate the U.S. and Canada Class 8 market to be in the range of 260,000 to 290,000 trucks. 
The U.K. and European economies are also expected to grow strongly. Economists project U.K. GDP to increased 4.8% and European GDP increased 4.2%. The 2021 European truck market is expected to increase to a range of 260,000 to 290,000 trucks. 
Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other business highlights. Harrie?"

This was a 3% increase over fourth quarter production despite an end of supply of semiconductors. This was enabled by all the efforts of PACCAR's outstanding purchasing and production teams. Truck parts and other gross margins improved to 13.4% in the first quarter. Second quarter production has a higher than normal level of uncertainty. Depending on semiconductor supply, we anticipate second quarter global truck production to be similar to the first quarter, with truck, parts and other gross margin also at first quarter levels. 
PACCAR parts had an outstanding quarter, achieving revenues of $1.16 billion, which is 16% higher than the same period last year. Parts pretax profits were a record $251 million. Parts gross margins were a robust 28.2%. PACCAR parts benefited from strong freight demand and truck utilization, investments in distribution initiatives such as tier feel makes parts and stores and a growing population of connected vehicles with PACCAR engines. E-commerce parts sales increased more than 30% in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Parts is a business in which speed of delivery is a major factor in customers' purchasing decisions. Each new distribution center that we open increases sales capacity, parts availability, and delivery speed to customers and dealers. PACCAR will continue its investments in world-class distribution by opening a new distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky next year. We expect second quarter part sales to be similar to the strong first quarter, with full year part sales up 15% to 18% compared to last year. 
PACCAR Financial Services benefited in the first quarter from strong new loan and lease business volumes, improved used strip prices and an excellent portfolio quality. Revenues were $432 million, 13% higher than last year. Pretax income was $76 million, 58% higher than last year. The excellent portfolio performance resulted in low past dues of less than 0.5% at the end of March. 
In the first quarter, North American Kenworth and Peterbilt used truck pricing increased by 30% compared to a year ago. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values continue to command a premium over the competition. PACCAR Financial has been increasing its retail used truck center capacity and now has 12 facilities worldwide. Selling used trucks at retail has resulted in higher prices and margins. PACCAR Financial plans to open another used truck retail center in Madrid, Spain later this year. 
PACCAR has invested $7.3 billion in new and expanded facilities, innovative products and new technologies during the past decade. Capital expenditures are projected to be $575 million to $625 million and research and development expenses are estimated to be $350 million to $375 million this year. PACCAR is investing in many exciting projects. These include next-generation truck models, zero-emissions and ultra clean diesel powertrains, Advanced Driver Assistance and autonomous driving systems, connected vehicle services and enhanced production and distribution facilities. We thank our excellent independent Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers for their support to our customers. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers are well capitalized and have invested $1.7 billion in their businesses in the last 5 years. These investments make a significant contribution to PACCAR's strip market share, and support the growth of PACCAR parts and PACCAR Financial Services. 
Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions."

The medium-duty product is a brand-new cab, entire new platform. It's a fantastic truck. Both for Class 5, 6 and 7 markets for Peterbilt and Kenworth. And there is a higher degree of automation in the product. So it has more robotic assembly, which is good for us, good for quality and good for our customers.

It's really about which chipset is used in whichever vehicle, and that's ubiquitous across markets. 
From a cost standpoint, that second part of your question, certainly, there's raw materials impacts in costs recently, whether that's steel or aluminum.

I'd say on the -- where we're at in the performance of the truck market is, I think we're just at the beginning of a really nice steady growth in the truck market. Things are going well. Our business is doing well. Customers are doing well. And then just to complement that and a very important complement that is these great new trucks we're introducing, the new medium-duty and the new heavy-duty trucks are going to be fantastic for our customers. So I think that's going to help PACCAR in the coming months and years actually. So I would say that's an important story. 
And the second part of your question was around electrification. And I would say that there, we have great products. We outlined a little bit that in our earnings release and share with you that our thoughts are is we have partnerships with CATL and we have partnerships with Romeo Power and battery pack, production, sell production for us, which gives us an array of different technologies we can put into battery electric vehicles. That's important because that enables us to meet different applications for customers. Some people will use the truck for 1 -- 8 hours a day and then park it overnight and can charge it overnight. Others will want multiple charge cycles in a day. That requires different battery types. So we have that capability built into our systems, which will give us a strong product offering. That product offering will enable us to meet the demands of California the 15 states or anything else, whether it's port, drayage, medium-duty or heavy-duty trucks."

Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley and I will update you on a very good first quarter results and business highlights. First, my sincere appreciation to PACCAR's employees around the world for their dedication, hard work and upbeat spirit.",504,"Good morning. Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley and I will update you on a very good first quarter results and business highlights. 
First, my sincere appreciation to PACCAR's employees around the world for their dedication, hard work and upbeat spirit. Throughout the past year's challenges, they have delivered outstanding trucks and services that provide essential goods to our communities. Now as the world moves forward, we have many reasons to be optimistic. 
In the first quarter, PACCAR achieved very good revenues and net income. PACCAR's first quarter sales and financial services revenues increased 13% to $5.85 billion, and first quarter net income increased 31% to $470 million. PACCAR Parts increased its first quarter revenues to a record $1.16 billion and Parts pretax profits were a record $251 million, 17% higher than the same period last year. Truck and Parts gross margins increased from 12.6% to 13.4% in the first quarter. And PACCAR Financial had a great quarter, delivering excellent portfolio performance and achieving pretax income of $76 million. 
PACCAR is having a tremendous year of new product introductions. In February, Peterbilt and Kenworth launched beautiful new heavy-duty truck models. The new Peterbilt Model 579 and next-generation Kenworth T680 feature enhanced aerodynamics and powertrains that deliver up to 7% higher fuel efficiency. They feature new LED headlights, new Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and a state-of-the-art interior with a 15-inch configurable digital display. Truck owners and drivers will appreciate these and many other features in these great new trucks. 
In April, Kenworth and Peterbilt introduced a new medium-duty truck lineup. These vehicles have an 8-inch wider cab, lower cab heights, which makes it easier to get into and out of the truck, best-in-class visibility for enhanced safety and a new premium interior with configurable dash displays. The new medium-duty trucks feature PACCAR's PX-7 and PX-9 engines and the new PACCAR 8-speed automatic transmission. 
In April, DAF began producing CF Electric trucks, and Peterbilt and Kenworth expect to deliver their first production battery electric vehicles in the coming months. PACCAR has strategic partnerships with 2 electric vehicle battery providers, CATL and Romeo Power. These 2 excellent partners provide our customers with the right technology choice for their applications. 
As the U.S. economy recovers, GDP and industrial production are each projected to expand 6.3% this year. The consumer spending, the housing market and the automotive sectors have strengthened. Good freight tonnage, high truck utilization and a shortage of drivers has created strong demand for PACCAR's premium trucks. The 2021 market size will be tempered by the industry-wide undersupply of semiconductors, and we estimate the U.S. and Canada Class 8 market to be in the range of 260,000 to 290,000 trucks. 
The U.K. and European economies are also expected to grow strongly. Economists project U.K. GDP to increased 4.8% and European GDP to increase 4.2%. The 2021 European truck market is expected to increase to a range of 260,000 to 290,000 trucks. 
Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other business highlights. Harrie?"

PACCAR has delivered 42,200 trucks during the first quarter. This was a 3% increase over fourth quarter production despite an end of supply of semiconductors.

This was a 3% increase over fourth quarter production despite an end of supply of semiconductors. This was enabled by all the efforts of PACCAR's outstanding purchasing and production teams. Truck, Parts and Other gross margins improved to 13.4% in the first quarter. 
Second quarter production has a higher than normal level of uncertainty. Depending on semiconductor supply, we anticipate second quarter global truck production to be similar to the first quarter, with Truck, Parts and Other gross margins also at first quarter levels. 
PACCAR Parts had an outstanding quarter, achieving revenues of $1.16 billion, which is 16% higher than the same period last year. Parts pretax profits were a record $251 million. Parts gross margins were a robust 28.2%. PACCAR Parts benefited from strong freight demand and truck utilization, investments in distribution initiatives such as tier feel makes parts and stores and a growing population of connected vehicles with PACCAR engines. 
E-commerce Parts sales increased more than 30% in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Parts is a business in which speed of delivery is a major factor in customers' purchasing decisions. Each new distribution center that we open increases sales capacity, parts availability and delivery speeds to customers and dealers. PACCAR will continue its investments in world-class distribution by opening a new distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky next year. We expect second quarter part sales to be similar to the strong first quarter, with full year part sales up 15% to 18% compared to last year. 
PACCAR Financial Services benefited in the first quarter from strong new loan and lease business volumes, improved used truck prices and an excellent portfolio quality. Revenues were $432 million, 13% higher than last year. Pretax income was $76 million, 58% higher than last year. The excellent portfolio performance resulted in low past dues of less than 0.5% at the end of March. 
In the first quarter, North American Kenworth and Peterbilt used truck pricing increased by 30% compared to a year ago. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values continued to come out of premium over the competition. PACCAR Financial has been increasing its retail used truck center capacity and now has 12 facilities worldwide. Selling used trucks at retail has resulted in higher prices and margins. PACCAR Financial plans to open another used truck retail center in Madrid, Spain later this year. 
PACCAR has invested $7.3 billion in new and expanded facilities, innovative products and new technologies during the past decade. Capital expenditures are projected to be $575 million to $625 million and research and development expenses are estimated to be $350 million to $375 million this year. PACCAR is investing in many exciting projects. These include next-generation truck models, zero-emissions and ultra clean diesel powertrains, Advanced Driver Assistance and Autonomous Driving Systems, connected vehicle services and enhanced production and distribution facilities. 
We thank our excellent independent Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers for their support to our customers. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers are well capitalized and have invested $1.7 billion in their businesses in the last 5 years. These investments make a significant contribution to PACCAR's truck market share and support the growth of PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services. 
Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions."

The medium-duty product is a brand-new cab, entire new platform. It's a fantastic truck. Both for Class 5, 6 and 7 markets for Peterbilt and Kenworth. And there is a higher degree of automation in the product. So it has more robotic assembly, which is good for us, good for quality and good for our customers.

As I mentioned earlier, there's a strong economy, there's strong truck markets, ,and working with our customers, they have the desire for our great trucks that we just have introduced. So we see that carrying through. 
I think because there is limitations and build in the first half of the year. It's rational to think that there is a lift in parts just because people are running their trucks for longer periods of time, and that's advantageous to us. And I also think that it has to do with the great systems the team has built. I mean, probably can't overstate how strong a job our team has done putting in distribution centers that are close to our dealers, making it easy for people to get parts the same day, building this e-commerce system, introducing TRP parts and stores, which serves the all-make market very well.

So I think that's going to help PACCAR in the coming months and years, actually. So I would say, that's an important story. 
And the second part of your question was around electrification. And I would say that there, we have great products. We outlined a little bit that in our earnings release and share with you that our thoughts are is we have partnerships with CATL and we have partnerships with Romeo Power in battery pack production, sell production for us, which gives us an array of different technologies we can put into battery electric vehicles. That's important because that enables us to meet different applications for customers. Some people will use the truck for 1 -- 8 hours a day and then park it overnight and can charge it overnight. Others will want multiple charge cycles in a day. That requires different battery types. 
So we have that capability built into our systems, which will give us a strong product offering. That product offering will enable us to meet the demands of California, the 15 states or anything else, whether it's port, drayage, medium-duty or heavy-duty trucks."

Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley and I will update you on our second quarter results and business highlights. First and foremost, I appreciate our outstanding employees around the world who are providing excellent trucks and transportation solutions to our customers. I'd also like to thank PACCAR's fantastic dealers and suppliers for their support. 
PACCAR achieved very good quarterly revenues and net income in the second quarter of 2021. PACCAR's results reflect quarterly sales and profit records at PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services. The economies and freight markets continue to be robust in all of PACCAR's geographic markets. Demand for PACCAR's premium trucks is strong. PACCAR's second quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $5.8 billion, and second quarter net income was $493 million. PACCAR Parts achieved record quarterly revenues of $1.2 billion and record pretax profits of $266 million. PACCAR Financial achieved record pretax income of $107 million. And I'd just like to take a moment to recognize these wonderful achievements by our great team. 
So looking at product. 2021 is the biggest year of new truck introductions in PACCAR's history. The most recent truck introduction was in June when DAF launched the XF, XG and XG+. These DAF trucks are game-changing. DAF is the first manufacturer to utilize the new European regulations allowing for a longer cab, and the regulations enabled DAF's engineers to design an aerodynamically-optimized truck that provides up to 10% greater fuel efficiency and an equal reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. 
Technology enhancements include a new powertrain, new digital mirrors, digital dash displays and a full suite of advanced driver assistance systems. The new models provide drivers a new level of luxury and comfort. And there is great customer excitement for the new trucks and this is being reflected in strong orders. Production start is in October. 
The next-generation Peterbilt 579 and Kenworth T680 began production in May. These new trucks feature enhanced aerodynamics and powertrains that deliver up to 7% higher fuel efficiency, industry-leading LED headlights, advanced driver assistance systems and a state-of-the-art interior with a configurable digital display. So in addition to launching the new Class 8 trucks, this month, Kenworth and Peterbilt began production of their new medium-duty truck lineup. These vehicles have an 8-inch wider cab, best-in-class visibility for enhanced safety and a premium interior with configurable dash displays. The new medium-duty trucks feature the PACCAR 8-speed automatic transmission. And we're seeing excellent customer demand for these new Peterbilt and Kenworth vehicles. 
PACCAR's industry-leading zero-emissions battery electric trucks are now in production with 60 vehicles in customer operations in Europe and North America. And we've received orders for over 450 battery electric trucks and are working closely with our customers and our dealers as we move forward with these exciting zero emissions product offerings. 
During the second quarter, PACCAR enhanced its autonomous truck development partnership with Aurora by becoming a minority investor in their planned public offering. The PACCAR-Aurora partnership continues to make progress in developing a Level 4 autonomous solution. 
Now looking at the truck markets. U.S. and Canada Class 8 industry retail sales are estimated to be in a range of 260,000 to 280,000 vehicles. Kenworth and Peterbilt market share was 29.4% in the first half. In Europe, truck industry registrations in the above 16-tonne market are estimated to be in a range of 270,000 to 290,000 vehicles, and DAF's year-to-date market share is 15.7%. The South American above 16-tonne market is projected to be in the range of 100,000 to 110,000 trucks. And DAF Brazil's above 16-tonne market share through June was 5.7%. 
As has been discussed in recent months, industry truck production has been tempered by the undersupply of semiconductor chips. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF had a good quarter and delivered 40,100 trucks with an additional 6,500 awaiting key components. While it's very dynamic, we currently anticipate supplier constraints improving towards the end of this year. 
PACCAR continues to advance its industry-leading environmental focus with our products and in our factories. PACCAR is committed to achieving science-based carbon reduction targets, and PACCAR continues to receive high rankings for its environmental leadership. These are really exciting times for PACCAR as we create our future. And Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other business highlights. Thank you. Harrie?"

PACCAR Parts had another outstanding quarter, achieving record revenues of $1.2 billion compared to $823 million for the second quarter of last year. Parts pretax profits were a record $266 million compared to $152 million in the same period last year. Parts gross margins were a robust 28.2%. PACCAR Parts benefited from strong freight demand and truck utilization, investments in e-commerce technology and distribution capacity, strategically located PDCs, reduced delivery times and increased customer uptime. 
E-commerce parts sales increased 56% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year. PACCAR is continuing its investments in world-class distribution by opening a new distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky next year. We expect third quarter parts sales to be similar to the strong second quarter. 
PACCAR Financial Services earned record pretax income of $107 million, reflecting strong portfolio performance and robust used truck demand. We expect third quarter PACCAR Financial results to be in line with the excellent second quarter. PACCAR Financial is increasing its retail used truck center capacity worldwide, which enhances margins. A new PACCAR Financial used truck facility is under construction in Madrid, Spain. 
Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values come out at 10% to 20% premium over competitors' trucks. PACCAR has invested $7.3 billion in new vehicle programs, enhanced facilities and new technologies during the past decade. This includes the investment of $1 billion for the new DAF truck range and expanded factories. Capital expenditures for the year are projected to be $550 million to $600 million, and research and development expenses are estimated to be $340 million to $360 million. 
PACCAR is investing in zero emissions and ultra-clean diesel powertrains, advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving systems, connected vehicle services and enhanced production and distribution facilities. 
Second quarter Truck, Parts and Other gross margins were 13.5%. Customer demand is strong and DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt are sold out for the year. Depending on the supply of materials, third quarter global truck production and gross margins could be similar to the second quarter. The recently introduced DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt truck models provide PACCAR the newest and most exciting product lineup in company history. These new trucks will support our customers, dealers and our success in the coming years. Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions."

So with this great demand, great market need for trucks around the world really, customers are looking for trucks as quick as they can get them. And we're building them as quick as we can get them. 
And so we had a good second quarter in our deliveries at 40,000. Obviously, you can do the math. There's several thousands sitting there that are waiting a component. And as we get the components, which is unclear in the semiconductor front, we complete the trucks and get them to our customers. So wish we could give you more clarity on how that semiconductor supply is going to proceed through the third and fourth quarter but we just don't have any more than that right now."

And so basically what everybody is trying to do in the all OEMs, car and truck are trying to create an infrastructure that's usable by each other and that's what theirs would be, so usable by all our products. At the same time, we're also rolling out our capabilities into the dealers and with the customers. Obviously, with each electric vehicle in the early phases, [indiscernible] range is unlimited. 
They're going to be largely used in a return to base kind of an operating style, which means when you buy a truck, you're probably looking at a charging station also, and the integration of the truck and the charging station, how those -- how that system works together is a core competency that we bring to our customers and we'll share with our customers. So we see that as kind of an avenue forward. So there's some symbiotic relationship with all the OEMs, but there's also this unique capability that PACCAR has in bringing the right battery energy management and the right kind of system to a customer."

The first thing is double-digit changes in Europe where speeds are more like 100 kilometers an hour -- excuse me, 80 kilometers an hour for trucks is, wow. I mean, getting that kind of improvement is just amazing. And the DAF team did such a fantastic job. And one of the reasons they're able to do such a good job is they work closely with the government there all in defining what the shape of a vehicle can be. And so the government allowed a different shape of a vehicle, and DAF is the first OEM and the only one that's announced to do so, so far of being able to bring out a cab that meets this new shape, which is more aerodynamic. So just fantastic effort by the team at DAF in bringing that truck out. 
And it doesn't just create aerodynamic benefit but the interior and the visibility of this truck are just amazing. And I would also say that from being a user of the truck, if you get in the truck and you're driving it just the way it feels, it's really, really quiet, like I would say, quieter than a [ 5 Series ] BMW when you're running down the highway. It's just fantastic. And then if you use the sleeper compartment of it, it's got all kinds of creature comforts and luxury for the drivers. And so it's just a beautiful product that delivers this double-digit fuel economy. 
And in characterizing it against other programs, you might think 5% is a lot. That's how we would look at it. It's a 5% change in fuel, big change in fuel economy. So for them to get 10%, just amazing. And same thing for the Kenworth and the Peterbilt teams getting 7% on these next-generation 579s and 680s. They just did a great job of bringing everything they could to the table, and that's obviously got a big impact on lowering operating costs for our customers.

Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley and I will update you on our second quarter results and business highlights. First and foremost, I appreciate our outstanding employees around the world who are providing excellent trucks and transportation solutions to our customers. I'd also like to thank PACCAR's fantastic dealers and suppliers for their support.  
PACCAR achieved very good quarterly revenues and net income in the second quarter of 2021. PACCAR's results reflect quarterly sales and profit records at PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services. The economies and freight markets continue to be robust in all of PACCAR's geographic markets. Demand for PACCAR's premium trucks is strong. PACCAR's second quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $5.8 billion, and second quarter net income was $493 million. PACCAR Parts achieved record quarterly revenues of $1.2 billion and record pretax profits of $266 million. PACCAR Financial achieved record pretax income of $107 million. And I'd just like to take a moment to recognize these wonderful achievements by our great team.  
So looking at product. 2021 is the biggest year of new truck introductions in PACCAR's history. The most recent truck introduction was in June when DAF launched the XF, XG and XG+. These DAF trucks are game-changing. DAF is the first manufacturer to utilize the new European regulations allowing for a longer cab, and the regulations enabled DAF's engineers to design an aerodynamically-optimized truck that provides up to 10% greater fuel efficiency and an equal reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  
Technology enhancements include a new powertrain, new digital mirrors, digital dash displays and a full suite of advanced driver assistance systems. The new models provide drivers a new level of luxury and comfort. And there is great customer excitement for the new trucks and this is being reflected in strong orders. Production start is in October.  
The next-generation Peterbilt 579 and Kenworth T680 began production in May. These new trucks feature enhanced aerodynamics and powertrains that deliver up to 7% higher fuel efficiency, industry-leading LED headlights, advanced driver assistance systems and a state-of-the-art interior with a configurable digital display. So in addition to launching the new Class 8 trucks, this month, Kenworth and Peterbilt began production of their new medium-duty truck lineup. These vehicles have an 8-inch wider cab, best-in-class visibility for enhanced safety and a premium interior with configurable dash displays. The new medium-duty trucks feature the PACCAR 8-speed automatic transmission. And we're seeing excellent customer demand for these new Peterbilt and Kenworth vehicles.  
PACCAR's industry-leading zero-emissions battery electric trucks are now in production with 60 vehicles in customer operations in Europe and North America. And we've received orders for over 450 battery electric trucks and are working closely with our customers and our dealers as we move forward with these exciting zero emissions product offerings.  
During the second quarter, PACCAR enhanced its autonomous truck development partnership with Aurora by becoming a minority investor in their planned public offering. The PACCAR-Aurora partnership continues to make progress in developing a Level 4 autonomous solution.  
Now looking at the truck markets. U.S. and Canada Class 8 industry retail sales are estimated to be in a range of 260,000 to 280,000 vehicles. Kenworth and Peterbilt market share was 29.4% in the first half. In Europe, truck industry registrations in the above 16-tonne market are estimated to be in a range of 270,000 to 290,000 vehicles, and DAF's year-to-date market share is 15.7%. The South American above 16-tonne market is projected to be in the range of 100,000 to 110,000 trucks. And DAF Brazil's above 16-tonne market share through June was 5.7%.
As has been discussed in recent months, industry truck production has been tempered by the undersupply of semiconductor chips. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF had a good quarter and delivered 40,100 trucks with an additional 6,500 awaiting key components. While it's very dynamic, we currently anticipate supplier constraints improving towards the end of this year.  
PACCAR continues to advance its industry-leading environmental focus with our products and in our factories. PACCAR is committed to achieving science-based carbon reduction targets, and PACCAR continues to receive high rankings for its environmental leadership. 
These are really exciting times for PACCAR as we create our future. And Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other business highlights. Thank you. Harrie?"

PACCAR Parts had another outstanding quarter, achieving record revenues of $1.2 billion compared to $823 million for the second quarter of last year. Parts pretax profits were a record $266 million compared to $152 million in the same period last year. Parts gross margins were a robust 28.2%. PACCAR Parts benefited from strong freight demand and truck utilization, investments in e-commerce technology and distribution capacity, strategically located PDCs, reduced delivery times and increased customer uptime.  
E-commerce parts sales increased 56% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year. PACCAR is continuing its investments in world-class distribution by opening a new distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky next year. We expect third quarter parts sales to be similar to the strong second quarter.
PACCAR Financial Services earned record pretax income of $107 million, reflecting strong portfolio performance and robust used truck demand. We expect third quarter PACCAR Financial results to be in line with the excellent second quarter. PACCAR Financial is increasing its retail used truck center capacity worldwide, which enhances margins. A new PACCAR Financial used truck facility is under construction in Madrid, Spain.
Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values commanded 10% to 20% premium over competitors' trucks. PACCAR has invested $7.3 billion in new vehicle programs, enhanced facilities and new technologies during the past decade. This includes the investment of $1 billion for the new DAF truck range and expanded factories. Capital expenditures for the year are projected to be $550 million to $600 million, and research and development expenses are estimated to be $340 million to $360 million.
PACCAR is investing in zero emissions and ultra-clean diesel powertrains, advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving systems, connected vehicle services and enhanced production and distribution facilities.  
Second quarter Truck, Parts and Other gross margins were 13.5%. Customer demand is strong and DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt are sold out for the year. Depending on the supply of materials, third quarter global truck production and gross margins could be similar to the second quarter. 
The recently introduced DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt truck models provide PACCAR the newest and most exciting product lineup in company history. These new trucks will support our customers, dealers and our success in the coming years. Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions."

So between DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt, we take the best approaches and apply them, and that shows up in the way some of the vehicle functionality is, which is just, I got to tell you, is really fun.  
I was able to drive the new DAF a few weeks ago, I was over in Europe and the truck is amazing. And I think, obviously, I'm subjectively biased, but we had a bunch of our dealers in it and they got to see it and everybody is just thrilled with it. So we're seeing just a beautiful new truck there in Europe and the same can be said for the trucks in North America. 
We are -- there's more commonality between the Kenworth and the Peterbilt in terms of the chassis design there, so we use best practices to make sure we provide the best ride and capabilities. And those trucks are equally just fantastic to be in. So yes, we're using our best practices and getting global leverage as we do our designs."

Some of the orders are multiyear. They could take a few years because there's high quantities. 
But we anticipate the market just continuing to evolve, grow over the years. So it starts in the hundreds, as we've shared before, and we see it moving to the thousands as that happens. And our team at PACCAR Parts is doing a great job of rolling out charging stations and being supportive to our customers and our dealers with the infrastructure needs that they have. 
So we've taken a holistic approach there and see these as good opportunities for PACCAR to grow its business beyond just the provision of product there."

The Finance company is a great foundational growth opportunity for us as well. The new trucks would be really remiss to not talk about how the new trucks are going to help to grow the business over time. You mentioned other things like alternative powertrains, zero-emissions vehicles. That's a great opportunity for PACCAR where we're already putting ourselves in a leadership position in terms of order intake. 
And so that -- not just the sale of the truck but the support of the trucks in the field, battery electric charging stations, battery energy management, fleet management help, those are skills that we can provide.
We see embedded software and connected trucks being an opportunity for growth in the future. Obviously, we have this relationship with autonomous vehicle producers and namely, Aurora. That's an opportunity as we go forward and increasing utilization of safety systems like that.

Obviously, with each electric vehicle in the early phases, before range is unlimited. They're going to be largely used in a return to base kind of an operating style, which means when you buy a truck, you're probably looking at a charging station also, and the integration of the truck and the charging station, how those -- how that system works together is a core competency that we bring to our customers and we'll share with our customers.

The first thing is double-digit changes in Europe where speeds are more like 100 kilometers an hour -- excuse me, 80 kilometers an hour for trucks is, wow. I mean, getting that kind of improvement is just amazing. A",350,"Sure. That's a good way to think of it. The first thing is double-digit changes in Europe where speeds are more like 100 kilometers an hour -- excuse me, 80 kilometers an hour for trucks is, wow. I mean, getting that kind of improvement is just amazing. And the DAF team did such a fantastic job. And one of the reasons they're able to do such a good job is they work closely with the government there all in defining what the shape of a vehicle can be. 
And so the government allowed a different shape of a vehicle, and DAF is the first OEM and the only one that's announced to do so, so far, of being able to bring out a cab that meets this new shape, which is more aerodynamic. So just fantastic effort by the team at DAF in bringing that truck out. 
And it doesn't just create aerodynamic benefit but the interior and the visibility of this truck are just amazing. And I would also say that from being a user of the truck, if you get in the truck and you're driving it just the way it feels, it's really, really quiet, like I would say, quieter than a 5 Series BMW when you're running down the highway. It's just fantastic. And then if you use the sleeper compartment of it, it's got all kinds of creature comforts and luxury for the drivers. And so it's just a beautiful product that delivers this double-digit fuel economy. 
And in characterizing it against other programs, you might think 5% is a lot. That's how we would look at it. It's a 5% change in fuel, big change in fuel economy. So for them to get 10%, just amazing. And same thing for the Kenworth and the Peterbilt teams getting 7% on these next-generation 579s and 680s. 
They just did a great job of bringing everything they could to the table, and that's obviously got a big impact on lowering operating costs for our customers. So these trucks are going to set the mark for the industry."

From an OpEx perspective, a 10% improvement year-over-year feels like a very big deal. If you could indulge me, maybe characterize how you think this would impact multiyear truck demand, if indeed, upgrade features are maybe higher. 
And then in that same vein, I guess where I'm coming from, I understand the near-term focus on margins, given all of the temporary noise in the numbers. But if demand does stay elevated for longer, is there anything structural in the model why margins should not move sort of in tandem with that prolonged demand? Any color kind of would be appreciated."

And I'd also like to thank PACCAR's dealers and suppliers for their contributions and support during these dynamic times. 
PACCAR's good quarterly revenues and net income in the third quarter reflects sales and profit records at PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services. The economies and freight markets continue to be robust in all of PACCAR's geographic markets. PACCAR is having a tremendous year of new product introductions and demand for the new Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF trucks is excellent. 
PACCAR's third quarter sales and financial services revenues were $5.2 billion, and third quarter net income was $378 million. PACCAR Parts achieved record quarterly revenues of $1.26 billion and record pretax profits of $281 million. PACCAR Financial achieved record pretax income of $120 million. The record-setting Parts and Financial Services results illustrate the strength of PACCAR's businesses. 
With the strong order backlog growth in the truck divisions will accelerate as the supply of semiconductors improves. We estimate Class 8 industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada to be in a range of 230,000 to 250,000 trucks this year. Peterbilt and Kenworth have achieved 29.6% market share through September. Although build is still expected to be limited by semiconductor supply in the fourth quarter, the good news is that we're starting to see improvements in the supply chain. We forecast the 2022 U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market to be in the range of 250,000 to 290,000 vehicles. 
In Europe, this year's truck industry registrations in the above 16-tonne market are estimated to be in a range of 260,000 to 280,000 vehicles. DAF's year-to-date market share is 15.8%. The 2022 market is expected to be in the range of 260,000 to 300,000 trucks. The South American above 16-tonne market is projected to be in the range of 120,000 to 130,000 trucks this year. DAF Brazil's above 16-tonne market share through September was 5.6%. 
The South American above 16-tonne truck market is estimated to be in a range of 130,000 to 140,000 trucks next year. The new Kenworth T680 and Peterbilt 579 trucks that began production in the third quarter are being well received by our customers.

Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF delivered 32,800 trucks in the third quarter, with truck, parts and other gross margins of 11.8%. Third quarter volumes and margins reflect manufacturing and efficiencies associated with limited Microchip supplies. 
Depending on the supply of materials, fourth quarter take global truck deliveries should increase into the low 40,000s with gross margins improving to approximately 12.5% and Customer demand is strong and Doug, Genworth and Peterbilt are well positioned for sales growth and margin expansion as the new truck models are now in production, -- And when semiconductor vendor supply issues are resolved. Becker parts had another outstanding quarter, achieving record revenues of $1.26 billion up 24% compared to the third quarter of last year. [indiscernible] pretax profits were a record $281 million, up 34% from last year. Backup parts benefited from strong freight demand and truck utilization, world-class supply chain management and logistics and increased distribution capacity. 
In the first 9 months of this year, overall part sales increased 28% with e-commerce parts sales increasing 37%. PACCAR continues to invest in its parts business, and is building a new distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky that will open next year. We currently expect fourth quarter part sales to be similar to the strong third quarter. 
PACCAR Financial Services earned record pretax income of $120 million, reflecting strong portfolio performance, a robust used truck demand. We expect fourth quarter PACCAR Financial results to be in line with the excellent third quarter. PACCAR Financial is increasing its retail used truck center capacity worldwide, which enhances used truck margins. The latest PACCAR Financial used truck facility is under construction, Imadrid, Spain. Kenworth and Peterbilt drug resale values deliver a 10% to 20% premium over competitive strikes. 
PACCAR has invested $7.3 billion in new vehicle programs, enhanced facilities and new technologies during the past decade. This includes the investment of $1 billion for the new DAF truck range and its expanded factories. Capital expenditures for 2021 are projected to be $525 million to $550 million. Next year, we plan to invest $425 million to $475 million in capital projects as we've just completed the launch of our exciting new drug platforms. 
Research and development expenses are estimated to be $320 million to $330 million this year, an increase to $350 million to $400 million next year. Next year's increased R&D spending will support our clean diesel, 0 emissions, autonomous and connected truck programs. These programs, along with the strong performance of parts and financial services will ensure PACCAR's ongoing success. 
Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions."

So we're working through those. The other part of it is we're developing a proprietary PACCAR autonomous vehicle poor, which has all the redundancies involved in it, which is -- should be ready in the next couple of years here, and that will be a huge advantage for PACCAR in working with companies like Aurora, like our partner, Aurora because it will let us have this really robust platform to build upon. 
And then we think probably the things that cause it to be constrained for 25 or again technology. There'll be a societal element to it as well and then company adoption. So I think it will start with certain lanes and evolve from there."

So that's kind of the transitional phase that we're in right now, realize it's still limited by the infrastructure requirements that are around out there, some numbers of chargers and putting that together. So it's really still a return to base kind of model adoption, and it probably will be for a few years. So that's a positive thing. 
We're selling our chargers. PACCAR Parts is doing a good job of that. Our teams are doing a good job working together with customers to make sure they have the balance of truck and infrastructure. So it will just continue to progress over the coming years.

As far as platform, this autonomous vehicle platform, we're building indeed, it does have application across markets, across brands. So we are investing in the knowledge centers and software capabilities that develop a vehicle as well as the hardware systems onboard the trucks. So that those integrate well with the autonomous driver with companies like Aurora that are creating the driver itself integrates well to our platform and then our platform could be used with another autonomous driver as well. 
So that's why we're making those big investments. I would also kind of continue to say that the lessons learned are that the drivers are going to be around for a long time that this is not something that will step in, in 3 years and displace drivers. This is a gradual introduction be certain routes. It will take weather conditions, and those will slowly get sorted out. 
So I would say that the other key learning is that the support required for an autonomous vehicle is pretty high and having a strong global presence like PACCAR does help success occur for autonomous vehicle operations because you need a good dealer network. You need to be able to understand what's happening on board the vehicle through connected services and you be able to reach out and get to that truck and work with our customers to make sure that they're operating well and then repair the truck when something happens.

Our Parts team is doing a fantastic job of doing that, and that's what kind of grows the business in the longer term. So really positive things to look forward to."

Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley and I will update you on our good third quarter results and business highlights. I appreciate our outstanding employees around the world, who are managing through the supply-based constraints to deliver the highest quality trucks, parts and financial services solutions to our customers. And I'd also like to thank PACCAR's dealers and suppliers for their contributions and support during these dynamic times.
PACCAR's good quarterly revenues and net income in the third quarter reflects sales and profit records at PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services. The economies and freight markets continue to be robust in all of PACCAR's geographic markets. PACCAR is having a tremendous year of new product introductions and demand for the new Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF trucks is excellent.
PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $5.2 billion, and third quarter net income was $378 million. PACCAR Parts achieved record quarterly revenues of $1.26 billion and record pretax profits of $281 million. PACCAR Financial achieved record pretax income of $120 million. The record-setting Parts and Financial Services results illustrate the strength of PACCAR's businesses.
With the strong order backlogs growth in the truck divisions will accelerate as the supply of semiconductors improves. We estimate Class 8 industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada to be in a range of 230,000 to 250,000 trucks this year. 
Peterbilt and Kenworth have achieved 29.6% market share through September. Although build is still expected to be limited by semiconductor supply in the fourth quarter, the good news is that we're starting to see improvements in the supply chain. We forecast the 2022 U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market to be in the range of 250,000 to 290,000 vehicles.
In Europe, this year's truck industry registrations in the above 16-tonne market are estimated to be in a range of 260,000 to 280,000 vehicles. DAF's year-to-date market share is 15.8%. The 2022 market is expected to be in the range of 260,000 to 300,000 trucks. The South American above 16-tonne market is projected to be in a range of 120,000 to 130,000 trucks this year. DAF Brazil's above 16-tonne market share through September was 5.6%. The South American above 16-tonne truck market is estimated to be in a range of 130,000 to 140,000 trucks next year. 
The new Kenworth T680 and Peterbilt 579 trucks that began production in the third quarter are being well received by our customers. These trucks feature new styling, configurable digital instrumentation, advanced aerodynamics, distinctive LED forward lighting and they provide up to 7% greater fuel efficiency.
The new Kenworth and Peterbilt medium-duty trucks that also began production in the third quarter, provide features that customers appreciate, such as a wider cab with 3-person seating, lower cab heights for easier entry and exit, and new digital instrumentation. The exciting new DAF XF, XG and XG+ lineup feature luxurious interiors and beautiful exteriors that provide 10% greater fuel efficiency. The new DAF offers unsurpassed performance and value.
DAF is the first truck manufacturer in the industry to have taken full advantage of Europe's new regulations governing truck design. And the new DAF trucks began production earlier this month. All of these new trucks position PACCAR very well for the future. 
PACCAR leads the industry with 7 battery electric vehicle models now available. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF have orders for several hundred zero-emissions vehicles and have 90 trucks operating with customers. These include Kenworth T680 fuel cell trucks, Peterbilt battery electric model 579s and DAF medium-duty battery electric trucks.
PACCAR has advanced its autonomous truck program by working with his partners, Aurora and FedEx to launch a commercial pilot of autonomous vehicles into line haul operations. If the PACCAR trucks are operating autonomously with a backup driver for safety as they haul freight on 500-mile route between Dallas and Houston.
PACCAR has launched an advanced global connected truck platform. Customers will benefit from the systems enhanced truck data security, advanced over-the-air software updates, elimination of the need for third-party hardware modules, and an open platform that supports existing fleet management systems. PACCAR's new proprietary connect system increases customer value, increases PACCAR's recurring revenue and as part of PACCAR's digital transformation. 
We're pleased to share that PACCAR was recently recognized as a 2021 Top Company for Women To Work For In Transportation by the Women in Trucking Association. We were honored for our excellent working environment and company culture that supports gender diversity. PACCAR is committed to hiring and promoting the most talented people in the world, and we know that the best people represent the diversity present in the global community.
PACCAR continues to be an environmental leader. PACCAR is working with the science-based targets initiative and is committed to 2030 carbon reduction goals. PACCAR earned a CDP climate change score of A-, placing PACCAR in the top 15% over 9,500 companies that publish reports to the CDP. 100% of PACCAR's manufacturing locations globally have environmental management programs certified under ISO 14001.
Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other business highlights. Thank you. Harrie, over to you."

Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF delivered 32,800 trucks in the third quarter, with truck, parts and [ our ] gross margins of 11.8%. Third quarter volumes and margins reflect manufacturing and efficiencies associated with limited microchip supplies. Depending on the supply of materials, fourth quarter PACCAR global truck deliveries should increase into the low 40,000s with gross margins improving to approximately 12.5%. 
Customer demand is strong, and DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt are well positioned for sales growth and margin expansion as the new truck models are now in production, and when semiconductor and the supply issues are resolved. 
PACCAR Parts had another outstanding quarter, achieving record revenues of $1.26 billion up 24% compared to the third quarter of last year. Parts pretax profits were a record $281 million, up 34% from last year. PACCAR Parts benefited from strong freight demand and truck utilization, world-class supply chain management and logistics, and increased distribution capacity. 
In the first 9 months of this year, overall Parts sales increased 28% with e-commerce parts sales increasing 37%. PACCAR continues to invest in its Parts business, and is building a new distribution center in Louisville, Kentucky that will open next year. We currently expect fourth quarter Part sales to be similar to the strong third quarter.
PACCAR Financial Services earned record pretax income of $120 million, reflecting strong portfolio performance, a robust used truck demand. We expect fourth quarter PACCAR Financial results to be in line with the excellent third quarter. PACCAR Financial is increasing its retail used truck center capacity worldwide, which enhances used truck margins. The latest PACCAR Financial used truck facility is under construction in Madrid, Spain. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values deliver a 10% to 20% premium over competitors trucks.
PACCAR has invested $7.3 billion in new vehicle programs, enhanced facilities and new technologies during the past decade. This includes the investment of $1 billion for the new DAF truck range and its expanded factories. Capital expenditures for 2021 are projected to be $525 million to $550 million. Next year, we plan to invest $425 million to $475 million in capital projects as we've just completed the launch of our exciting new truck platforms.
Research and development expenses are estimated to be $320 million to $330 million this year, an increase to $350 million to $400 million next year. Next year's increased R&D spending will support our clean diesel, zero emissions, autonomous and connected truck programs. These programs, along with the strong performance of Parts and Financial Services will ensure PACCAR's ongoing success. 
Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions."

And then just to add on to what Harrie was talking about in price realization. One of the things that we do see with the new DAF trucks, we have over 10,000 orders for the new DAFs in Europe. And as we mentioned briefly, it's the only truck in Europe that meets the new regulations for truck design, the only truck and customers are amazingly excited about it, and it's going to make a big difference for us. So that's a positive."

I almost feel bad coming back to autonomous, but I think it's just such an interesting opportunity. So I'd love to ask you 2 questions on this. Number one, is there going to be any ability for you to utilize the platform across markets, so let's say, Europe, where is the thermometer on autonomy out there and what's going on? 
And then the second question, you kind of answered a little bit, but you're building a platform for it. So it's not something you're dabbling in. I mean this is something you believe in and you're going to commit to. What have you learned so far, whether it's the way the trucks were, or whether what things maybe are you learning that you didn't expect in terms of fuel economy? I know it's early stage in this early innings, but I'm just kind of curious because you're one of the few companies that's really being proactive in terms of building a platform and testing vehicles."

As far as platform, this autonomous vehicle platform, we're building indeed, it does have application across markets, across brands. So we are investing in the knowledge centers and software capabilities that develop a vehicle as well as the hardware systems on board of the trucks. So that those integrate well with the autonomous driver with companies like Aurora that are creating the driver itself integrates well to our platform and then our platform could be used with another autonomous driver as well.
So that's why we're making those big investments. I would also kind of continue to say that the lessons learned are that the drivers are going to be around for a long time, but this is not something that will step in, in 3 years and displace drivers. This is a gradual introduction, it will be certain routes. It will take weather conditions, and those will slowly get sorted out.
So I would say that the other key learning is that the support required for an autonomous vehicle is pretty high and having a strong global presence like PACCAR does help success occur for autonomous vehicle operations because you need a good dealer network. You need to be able to understand what's happening onboard the vehicle through connected services and you be able to reach out and get to that truck and work with our customers to make sure that they're operating well and then repair the truck when something happens. So it really is, autonomy is a great opportunity for PACCAR to grow in the world."
