For the call, we propose to start first by looking back to fiscal year 2020 and then looking to fiscal year 2021. For fiscal year 2020, I will share a few slides to summarize the key elements of the year, before David shares with you the 2020 financials and also how we think about 2021 financial framework. For fiscal year 2021, I will share our business objectives and why we are so excited for 2021 and the inflection point this year will represent in our history. Stephen will start with an update on our approach to variance of concern and then Tal will provide an update on our clinical pipeline. 
2020 was a historic year for Moderna. We started in January as an early-stage development company. By the end of July, we have become a late-stage development company. And by December, we had positive results from our Phase III COVE study of our COVID-19 vaccine showing efficacy around 94%. 
Our COVID-19 vaccine was authorized by the FDA and Canada Health in mid-December and we shipped almost [ billion ] doses to the U.S. government and the Canadian government by year-end. 
We laid the groundwork for a global organization, adding commercial subsidiaries in 8 countries, 8 countries. 
By year-end, we have signed $11.7 billion of advanced purchase agreement for a vaccine. 
A team of a little over 1,000 members did all that. And we also continue to invest in science to improve further our mRNA platform. And we also advance on 20 programs in development across 5 therapeutic areas. And we did it without a large global pharmaceutical partner. 
The Moderna team executed swiftly and superbly in carrying out the complicated Phase III study while achieving remarkable diversity. The Moderna team secured the authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine by regulators. The Moderna team built out our manufacturing capacity, scaling up across many manufacturing processes, partnered with Lonza, ROVI and Catalent, and shipped close to 80 million doses by year-end. For context, we had made less than 100,000 doses of medicine in 2019. This was roughly a 200x increase in 12 months. And we're on our way to produce as many as 1 billion doses in 2021 and more in 2022. 
In 2019, we had no authorized products. We had negative cash flows from operations every quarter. And we anticipated needing multiple capital raises over at least 5 years until CMV will produce sufficient revenues for Moderna to break even in terms of cash flows and become a self-sustaining company. 
In 2020, we had our first product authorized and our first product revenues in the last 2 weeks of Q4. We had 2 quarters of positive cash flows from operations. We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and with cash generation in 2 quarters. 
Moderna has been changed, however. Moderna has been changed in a profound way. Moderna is now a commercial company with subsidiaries in 8 countries and a direct presence in many more through commercial distributors and partners. 
mRNA is [ an commercial ] molecule. We have a powerful platform, and this is just the beginning. We have a scalable platform due to our investment in IT, robotics and AI over the last 7 years. We have an amazing team, as you witnessed by what the team accomplished in the 12 short months of 2020. And we have a capital to invest and scale. 
On Slide 6, you have a summary of countries in which we received emergency use authorization or conditional approvals and all started rolling submission that we did. 
On Slide 7, you get a sense for the commercial infrastructure that we built. For context, in May of 2020, Moderna did not have a single employee dedicated to commercial activities. We closed the year with 8 commercial subsidiaries, an incredible commercial team and commercial partners. We now have commercial operations in the U.S.; in Canada; in Europe, in the 5 largest markets, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the U.K. We established one in Switzerland, where we have both commercial capabilities to serve the Swiss market as well as manufacturing for geographies outside the U.S. with our partner Lonza and the support teams that we need in finance, HR, digital and legal. We have partnered with Medison in Israel and Takeda in Japan. 
If you step back and think about it, this commercial network which we started building and will expand in 2021 is an incredible asset for the entire Moderna pipeline. We now have the infrastructure to commercialize all our products. 
This market on the slide are some of the largest markets in the world. So by basing the commercial network for the launch of our COVID-19 vaccine and deciding not to partner, we have actually financed and built the commercial network for all of our programs. We have become a fully integrated company, and in 12 months proved that we're capable of running complex Phase III studies, scaling up manufacturing to commercial level, making hundreds of million of doses per year and building our own commercial network. As I said, the Moderna team did an amazing job in 2020. 
On Slide 8, you get a glimpse of what Moderna looks like in February 2021. While most people in the world think of Moderna as a COVID-19 vaccine company, this is just the first product that we are launching. We have a platform, and our molecule mRNA is an [ information ] molecule. This is just the beginning. 
We are going to soon start a Phase III study for vaccine against CMV, cytomegalovirus, the #1 cause of birth defect. There is no approved CMV vaccine on the market. The pharma industry has strived for around 20 years to make a vaccine against CMV. This is a complex virus of vaccine 6 mRNAs per dose, over which are 2 from a complex protein called Pentamer. We believe that CMV vaccine will present financial annual peak sales between $2 billion and $5 billion. 
We have 3 programs in Phase II of personal cancer vaccine in melanoma or OX40 ligand in ovarian cancer and injected in patients at cost artefact to revascularize the half with new blood vessels. We have had 12 positive Phase I results. 
In addition to our COVID-19 vaccine, we have 8 infectious vaccine candidates, all for first-in-class vaccine like against CMV or what we believe could be a best-in-class vaccine that with influenza. 
But we also have a remarkable therapeutic pipeline. We have candidate therapeutics in immuno-oncology with 5 medicines in the clinic, 4 in rare disease program, 2 cardio program and 2 autoimmune disease programs. 
If you think about it, Moderna is going after leading cause of death by disease area: infectious disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease. The total addressable market is very large. We are not a COVID-19 vaccine company. 
We're investing in science and leveraging our scalable platform to take more candidates from our research lab to clinical development soon. So stay tuned for that. 
We announced yesterday that we are increasing our base manufacturing plant for the number of COVID-19 dose we will produce in fiscal year 2021 from 600 million to 700 million doses, given the strong start of our U.S. operation and initial ramp of our outside the U.S. operation. Our team is still working hard to get us up to 1 billion doses for fiscal year '21. 
Now let me turn to David for Q4 and fiscal year 2021 financial framework. David?"
128680956,703291844,2223198,"Moderna, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Moderna, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stéphane.

Before reviewing the financial section of the slide deck, I want to comment on the approach we've taken sharing this information. 
This starts with the 3 Cs, these being clear, complete and comprehensible. Today, we are presenting our results primarily on a U.S. GAAP basis. And in individual item level, in some cases, we also provide additional detail to provide greater clarity on underlying trends and to facilitate period-over-period comparisons in line with our 3C goal. 
Reflecting the continued uncertainties related to the course of the evolving pandemic, along with the many challenges and opportunities we face as a newly globalizing commercial company, we also seek to avoid implying an unrealistic level of precision concerning future financial projections in the face of a range of outcomes. 
With this background, we are providing today the analysis of actual 2020 results, along with a view of key drivers of the financial framework going forward. We will continue to update and refine this information as business evolves. 
Turning to Slide 10. I want to briefly remind you about some key accounting changes which we presented on this slide in our Q3 call in October. 
As a result of the successful transition to a commercial company, following the emergency use authorization by the FDA and Health Canada in December 2020, we began to record product sales. We also began to capitalize inventory based on the expectation these costs would be recoverable through commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine as opposed to expensing costs directly to R&D in the period incurred. And we also began to capitalize purchases of property and equipment and long-term lease assets as opposed to expensing costs in the period incurred through the lack of alternative use. 
With this context, let me turn now to Slide #11. Total revenue was $571 million for Q4 2020 compared to $14 million for the same period in 2019. Total revenue was $803 million for the full year 2020 compared to $60 million in the prior year. 
Following the authorization for emergency use by the FDA and Health Canada in December of our COVID-19 vaccine, we generated our first ever product sales. For 2020, we recognized $200 million of product sales for our COVID-19 vaccine, all in late December. 
Additionally, grant and collaboration revenue increased to $371 million in Q4 and $603 million for the full year, primarily due to increases in grant revenue from BARDA to accelerate development of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
Now turning to cost of sales. We began capitalizing our COVID-19 vaccine inventory costs in December, starting after the vaccine was first authorized based upon our expectation that these costs would be recoverable through commercialization of the vaccine. Prior to the authorization of our COVID-19 vaccine, inventory costs were recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred. We expensed $242 million of prelaunch inventory costs in 2020. Hence, our cost of sales were only $8 million in 2020, comprised primarily of third-party royalties. If inventory sold during 2020 was valued at cost, our cost of sales for 2020 would have been $62 million or 31% of our product sales. 
Research and development expenses were $759 million for Q4 2020 compared to $118 million for the same period in 2019. Research and development expenses were $1.37 billion for the full year 2020 compared to $496 million in the prior year. The increases for both 3- and 12-month periods in 2020 were mainly due to increased COVID-19 vaccine clinical development activities, headcount increases, pre-launch inventory buildup and expenses associated with the equipment and lease facilities that were deemed to have no alternative use at the acquisition of such equipment. 
Selling, general and administration expenses were $79 million for Q4 2020 compared to $26 million for the same period in 2019. Expenses were $188 million for the full year 2020 compared to $110 million in the prior year. The increases for both periods were mainly driven by increases in personnel, outside services and start-up costs associated with preparation for commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally. 
We recorded a net loss of $272 million for Q4 2020 compared to $123 million in the same period in 2019 and $747 million for the full year 2020 compared to $514 million in the prior year. 
Turning to selected cash flow information on Page 12. We ended Q4 2020 with cash and investments of $5.25 billion compared to $3.97 billion at the end of Q3. The increase is primarily driven by $1.7 billion of customer deposits received in the fourth quarter for supply of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
On the top half of the page, we present information from our 10-K and 10-Q filings. And on the bottom part, we provide the quarterly trend and the cash deposits received related to supply agreements for our COVID-19 vaccine. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.03 billion for the 12 months ended December 2020, compared to net cash used of $459 million for the same period in 2019. The reversal from cash used to cash provided by operating activities is driven by total customer deposits. Cash used for purchases of capitalized property and equipment was $67 million for the full year 2020 compared to $32 million in 2019. 
Before looking forward to 2021, let me summarize a few areas from our 2020 results that are important to keep in mind when modeling 2021 financial performance, starting with research and development and SG&A expenses shown on the top left quadrant of Slide 13. Prior to the authorization for emergency use by the FDA and Health Canada as a pre-commercial research stage company, Moderna expensed all costs related to the production of inventory as well as costs for property and equipment and lease expenses for current and some future contract manufacturing activities due to lack of alternative use. Adjusting for these items, which in the future would be capitalized and expensed as cost of sales, the underlying R&D and SG&A expense run rate for Q4 2020 was $0.5 billion for the quarter. 
Turning to the upper right quadrant of Slide 13. Cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, logistics and warehousing costs as well as third-party royalty costs. The reported expense in Q4 of $8 million reflects the fact that we expensed all inventory-related costs until authorization of our COVID-19 vaccine. If valued at cost or actual cost of sales, including initial ramp-up costs, would have been $62 million or 31% of product sales. 
The cash and investment balance reported as of December 31 was $5.25 billion, $2.8 billion of which related to cash deposits from customers for future supply of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
Lastly, let me comment on certain tax-related items. The significant investments in our research and development and start-up activities to develop the mRNA platform over the last decade has resulted in a net operating loss carry forward with the balance as of December 31, 2020, of $2.3 billion, up from $1 billion at year-end 2019. As of December 31, we maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets related to these loss carryforwards. We will continue to monitor the valuation allowance as we progress through 2021 and expect to utilize our loss carryforwards. 
With this context, let me now move to considerations for 2021, starting with an overview of advanced purchase agreements for our COVID-19 vaccine on Slide 14. We have disclosed advanced purchase agreements to supply our COVID-19 vaccine to 40 countries through the end of 2021, including the U.S. government for 300 million doses with options for an additional 200 million doses; the European for 310 million, with an option for an additional 150 million doses in 2022; plus 10 other countries, including Japan, Canada and South Korea, with announced doses totaling 186 million. 
We are thankful for the trust of governments around the world that placed in us to deliver a vaccine for their countries. All these agreements contain provisions for deposits and have contributed to our balance of deposits of $2.8 billion at year-end 2020. 
Negotiations with other countries are also ongoing, including with COVAX. 
Turning now to the 2021 financial framework on Slide 15. Already signed APA agreements for expected delivery in 2021 reflect a total of $18.4 billion in anticipated product sales. Based on continuous progress to ramp up available supply capacity in our network, we have raised the lower end of our global manufacturing plan for 2021 from 600 million to 700 million doses at the 100-microgram dose level. Manufacturing is still working to supply up to 1 billion doses for 2021. 
Further, we expect a range of related -- of released doses in Q1 2021 of 100 million to 125 million doses and 200 million to 250 million doses in the second quarter. 
Our total cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing, logistics and warehousing and third-party royalties, as discussed previously. For 2021, we currently model total cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be approximately 20% for the full year, with some variation quarter-by-quarter, largely driven by the average selling price. We also expect Q1 reported cost of sales in percent of product sales to be in line with the full year average, including the benefit from the remaining 0 cost prelaunch inventory in Q1. 
Now let me comment on planned R&D and SG&A expenses. The underlying Q4 2020 expense run rate, adjusted for transitional items as discussed on Slide 13, was approximately $0.5 billion. We currently expect our quarterly reported expenses to increase on a continuous basis through 2021 compared to the Q4 2020 adjusted run rate. In Q1, we expect an increase in the low double-digit percentage range relative to the adjusted Q4 2020 expense run rate of $0.5 billion million. We will provide additional updates going forward as our global business rapidly expands. 
I would also like to comment on how we think about modeling our tax rate. In 2021, Moderna will transition to taxpaying status as we deliver on our COVID-19 vaccine contracts to customers. As a U.S.-based company, we start with the statutory 21% tax rate. This is impacted by global sales mix to the extent that non-U.S. rates are generally lower than in the U.S. and by recovery against our prior accumulated losses of over $2 billion. As we start the year, we expect the all-in 2021 tax rate to be in the mid-teen percentage level on an ongoing basis, including in the first quarter. We will update this view as our book of business evolves further. 
Lastly, regarding capital investments. We currently plan capital investment in the amount of $350 million to $400 million for 2021. Roughly half of the investment is to further expand our COVID-19 vaccine supply capability, including supply capacity up to 1.4 billion doses at the 100-microgram level, with the balance of planned capital investments to expand our technical development, clinical manufacturing as well as our other facility footprint. 
This concludes my remarks concerning the financial performance, and I turn the call back to Stéphane."

We are still in February, and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is now authorized in 37 countries, and our team is continuing to engage regulators in new geographies, like Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines",1705,"Thank you, David. Let me now discuss 2021 on Slide 17. 
We are still in February, and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is now authorized in 37 countries, and our team is continuing to engage regulators in new geographies, like Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and more. 
We're also well on our way in the rolling submission process to the WHO, which will be key for low-income countries access via COVAX and UNICEF if we get the partnership done. 
We are committed to our principles of global access to our new class of medicines, where we recognize that the need for scale up our manufacturing operations have led to supply going to the U.S., Europe and other countries. 
We are working with COVAX to provide low-cost vaccines to the poorest countries and look forward to supplying our vaccines for COVAX [indiscernible] and becoming a company that will be part of the global health infrastructure for many years to come. UNICEF is a procurement arm of COVAX. 
On Slide 18. As I shared in my 2020 shareholder letter which we posted publicly on January 4 in which you can access on our block if you have not read it, I believe that 2021 is going to be the most important inflection year in Moderna's history. 
You can see the evolution of the company over 2019, 2020 and 2021 on this slide over a few dimensions. But to me, the reason I say that 2021 is the most important inflection year in the company's history, is that we are not the same company. As I've told our employees in a recent town hall, I almost wished I could change the company name [indiscernible] understand the magnitude of the change. 
We used to believe that mRNA vaccine could be authorized and become commercial. We used to have negative cash flows from operations each quarter since our founding in 2010. We used to work to raise additional capital regularly and thought we needed to do that for another 5 plus years until CMV will get the company's cash flow breakeven. 
But we have been through an incredible pivot. This is not the same company. Now we know that mRNA vaccine can be authorized and become commercial. Now we have positive cash flows from operations for 2 quarters in a row already. 
So now we are going to double down on our investment in science, in process development, in manufacturing, in IT, in robotics, in AI to scale our company. 
I believe that in business, there's a drastic difference between believing in an outcome and having negative cash flow versus knowing an outcome and having positive cash flow. Our appetite and our ability to invest has been transformed. We are not the same company now that we were in the last 10 years. Our thinking is going to be much more [ expensive ]. 
On Slide 19. As David shared a moment ago, we have, as of yesterday, already $18.4 billion of signed Advanced Purchase Agreements for fiscal year 2021 deliveries. We still have multiple discussions ongoing about additional APAs for 2021. So these have not been signed yet, so they are not counted in the $18.4 billion. We'll update you each quarter about the signed APAs for fiscal year '21 as we report sale recognized with the shipment of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
We increased our manufacturing base plan for the year to 700 million doses and are working hard to get to 1 billion. We are working with COVAX and its procurement arm, UNICEF, to maximize the availability of our vaccine around the world. 
Let me now turn to Slide 20 to talk about 2022 manufacturing capacity. We announced last night after the market closed that several factors have led us to decide to add more manufacturing capacity. 
First, many governments have been telling us that they now see 2 classes of COVID-19 vaccine based on efficacy, and they will act more of our vaccine given its high efficacy. 
Second, variant. Government and political leaders around the world are concerned about the emergence of several variants. We have been very clear about it, and some of them have started to request options for 2022. 
With the start of the fall season soon in the southern hemisphere, with a large population of the world and with a large population of immune-compromised patients, like HIV-positive patients, we're ring daily that governments around the world and the COVID teams worry that boosting people with variant will be an important strategy over the next couple of years to get this virus under control. 
So we decided to add manufacturing capacity. We have communicated previously that our capacity for 2022, given the ramp in 2021, will be approximately up to 1.2 billion doses, assuming 100-microgram dose. We have decided and have started to buy additional capital equipment, hire more people and order more raw materials towards 200 million doses per year of capacity for 2022. 
So if you assume a 100-microgram dose, we will have 1.4 billion dose of capacity for fiscal year '22. In other words, we will build the manufacturing capacity to make up to 140 kilograms of formulated mRNA in 2022. 
Now let's talk about output in number of doses. 2 factors determine output, the dose of a boost and the product mix. Given our COVID-19 vaccine, previously referred as mRNA-1273, is currently authorized for 100-microgram dose, [indiscernible] boost like mRNA-1273.351, the South African variant candidate, needs 50 microgram per dose. On the bottom left of the slide, you see a scenario in which 100% of our output is our COVID-19 vaccine authorized, and we get 1.4 billion doses at 100 microgram. 
On the bottom in the middle, you see a scenario where we say 1 billion doses for COVID-19 authorized vaccine and 0.8 billion doses for boost at 50 microgram for a total of 1.8 billion doses. 
And on the bottom right, you see the marks and other scenario on the right. 
The way to think about output will depend on the dose of the boost and the product mix. We will learn in the next few months in the clinic about the necessary dose to get a high neutralizing antibody titer for our boost. 
Only, one needs to think about our manufacturing capacity in terms of mass. Given the flexibility of mRNA, we can, in the same room and with the same equipment, make COVID-19 vaccine and our one boost and are 2 boosts and [indiscernible], you get the point. 
We can run manufacturing campaign based on the market demand with the same manufacturing capacity, just like small molecule drug substance. 
So we are [indiscernible]. We not only have the advantage of speed, but we also have the advantage of manufacturing flexibility and we are best-in-class efficacy. I believe this will prove crucial from a competitive standpoint for the years ahead, where nobody knows what the demand mix will have to be. It's a new and still unstable virus. Nobody knows if 1 variant is going to be necessary and/or enough to boost or more in the years to come until this virus is fully under control. 
So split to market and flexibility of product mix and scale will be critical. We have all three. A few companies do. And we also, without the partners, we don't have to get aligned with somebody else with different goals, different financial incentives, different corporate decision making process, different culture. We have moved fast, and we will continue to move fast. 
On Slide 21. In 2021, we are continuing to scale our commercial network. We plan to open commercial subsidiaries this year in Japan, South Korea and Australia. I look forward to planting the Moderna flag in Tokyo, Seoul and Sydney. 
We also want to continue to help regional distributors. We are in advanced discussions with partners to cover ASEAN and also Eastern Europe. With this addition in 2021, we will have a strong commercial network across the world in most critical markets by the end of this year. 
On the next slide, we were delighted to announce earlier this year that Corinne Le Goff has joined as Moderna's first Chief Commercial Officer. Corinne's experience in global commercial leadership, most recently at Amgen, but also her critical experience as Country Manager at Roche and her experience with digital marketing will prove invaluable. I have had the chance to spend a lot of time with Corinne since she joined, and I'm confident she will build a Moderna commercial organization highly leveraged with digital solutions, both externally and internally. We both share the view that there are many ways to run commercial operation in a much more modern way than traditional sales force of large pharmaceutical companies. In commercial, too, Moderna will disrupt and innovate and implement best practices from many industries and build a digital commercial organization. Corinne will have a chance to share some our thoughts and present to you at our Vaccine Day on April 14. 
This morning, we also announced that Tal, our Chief Medical Officer, will be leaving the company in late September after 6 years of service. Tal joined us when we were a preclinical company and now we have our first authorized product. I am very thankful for Tal for taking a chance on us 6 years ago. It was not obvious at the time, trust me, that we're going to make it. But given his deep scientific understanding and curiosity, Black, Stephen Hoge and I and many others on the team, he saw that this technology could change medicine if we could make it work safely in human. Tal, thank you so much for everything you have done. It has been a pleasure of building Moderna with you and the team. I look forward to continuing working with you in the coming quarters. 
The company has retained Russel Reynolds to recruit a new Chief Medical Officer with global and commercial experience as the company scale up to launch the COVID-19 vaccine, of course, around the world, also prepares for potential COVID Boost and prepare to file several biological license over the next few years. 
With this, now let me turn to Stephen to talk about SARS-CoV-2 variants. Stephen?"

Last week, we published a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine with data that confirmed the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, provide neutralizing activity against all variants of concern tested to date. Nonetheless, as recent reports have increased transmission and potential reinfections of the new variants have emerged, out of an abundance of caution, we have announced multiple strategies to try to increase protection against those variants. 
As has been widely reported, the immune response generated by original strains appears to be relatively weaker against the B.1.351 variant. If or when and immunity wane in the future, this might lead to a gap in protection. We plan to close this potential gap with an update to our vaccine based on the new strains. We anticipate different approaches for 2 distinct populations. For those who have been immunized or infected by the original strains, we anticipate boosting with a variant-specific booster vaccine, either alone or in combination with our vaccine against the ancestral strains. For those who are still naive to SARS-CoV-2 because they have not been previously infected or vaccinated, we anticipate updating our vaccine to provide immunity to both the ancestral strains and the new variants of concern. 
Now on Slide 25, you can see the clinical trials that are ongoing or planned for our COVID-19 vaccines. For mRNA-1273, the team COVE Phase II/III study in adolescents ages 12 to 17 years is ongoing and recently completed enrollment. The KidCOVE study, Phase II, in pediatric populations ages 6 months to 11 years, will begin in the near term. And our Phase I/II study in Japan is ongoing, led by our partner, Takeda. 
For the Variant studies, we plan to test a variant-specific booster candidate, mRNA-1273.351 based on the B.1.351 variant, first identified in the Republic of South Africa at the 50-microgram dose level and lower. 
In addition, we plan to test a multivalent booster candidate, mRNA-1273.211 that combines mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 in a single vaccine, again at the 50-microgram dose level and lower. 
And we're also evaluating a third dose of our authorized Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, at a 50-microgram dose level, which is already underway. 
Finally, we are planning to test the next-generation vaccine, mRNA-1283 that encodes for the receptor binding domain and end terminal domain of the spike protein and is being developed as a potential refrigerator stable mRNA vaccine that could facilitate easier distribution and administration in a wider range of settings, including potentially developing countries. 
We believe messenger RNA is best positioned to address the potential threat of SARS-CoV-2 variance, given several key characteristics, including high vaccine efficacy, speed and agility to make updates, ease with which we can do combinations and our manufacturing flexibility and scalability. I'm happy to say that we have already manufactured the first GMP batch of our variant booster candidate, mRNA-1273.351, and have shipped clinical trial material to the NIH for clinical testing. 
Now I'll hand it over to Tal, who will walk you through the rest of our portfolio across vaccines and therapeutics. Tal?"

We have 4 other vaccine programs that are in clinical trials. The CMV vaccine is on track to start the pivotal Phase III this year. The Zika vaccine is preparing for a Phase II trial that is also expected to begin in this year. And our hMPV/PIV3 vaccine is currently enrolling in toddlers. 
Our RSV vaccine is being studied in 2 separate trials, 1 in children and 1 in adults. The pediatric trial is enrolling quickly, and the first 3 cohorts in the HD escalation study have now been fully enrolled. 
We announced last month that we were taking our RSV vaccine into the adult population, and I'm happy to share that the first participant has since then been dosed in that trial. 
Just last month, we announced 3 new development programs in infectious disease vaccines. Our influenza vaccine program will evaluate 3 candidates comprising multiple antigen combinations against the 4 seasonal viruses recommended by the WHO, eventually moving 1 candidate into a Phase III trial. 
Our HIV vaccine program has 2 approaches. MRNA-1644 is a collaboration with IAVI and the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation. It's a novel approach to an HIV vaccine strategy that's designed to elicit broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies. 
mRNA-1574 is a collaboration with the NIH, and this includes multiple native-like trimer antigens. 
And finally, for those  unfamiliar with the Nipah virus, this is a zoonotic virus transmitted to humans from animals, that is either transmitted in food or through direct human-to-human transmission. It is included in the WHO R&D blueprint list of epidemic threats needed for urgent R&D action. mRNA-1215 is a collaboration with the NIH to develop a Nipah vaccine. 
We also have 7 clinical proof-of-concept trials ongoing in our exploratory modalities. The Phase II program in VEGF, partnered with AstraZeneca, is ongoing. 
The personalized cancer vaccine Phase II, which is in combination with KEYTRUDA compared to KEYTRUDA alone, that is partnered with Merck continues. And the Phase 1 of that program in multiple cohorts is ongoing, including the upsized head and neck cohort that is currently recruiting additional patients. 
The KRAS Phase I that is partnered with Merck continues. 
And in the intratumoral oncology, we have a Phase II ongoing with OX40 ligand program in ovarian cancer patients. 
The Phase I dose escalation for the triplet program is ongoing both as monotherapy and in combination with durvalumab. 
And IL-12 partnered with AstraZeneca continues in a Phase I trial. 
Finally, within the systemic intra solar therapeutics, the Phase I/II sites for our PA program are being initiated, and we plan to enter the clinic this year. 
This final slide has our full pipeline. And with that, let me hand it back to Stéphane."

Priority #1, to maximize the impact of our COVID-19 vaccine. The output in 2021 in terms of number of dose that we can ship to countries, the manufacturing scale-up, preparing for 2022 supply. Clinical development of variants and boost. And our full commitment to bring variants of concern to the clinic. 
Priority #2, accelerate vaccine development and continue to bring more innovation from a research lab to clinical development. 
Priority #3, generate proof-of-concept in therapeutics. [indiscernible] success of our ability to repeat dose in human of therapeutics technology with chikungunya antibodies, but also intratumoral, we expect key data in cardiology, oncology, rate genetic disease and the entry in the clinic of our first autoimmune programs. 
Priority #4, we want to continue the expansion of mRNA technology. Our appetite to invest in science and process development has not weakened, just the opposite. We believe we are still at the beginning of the S-curve of this exciting new disruptive technology. 
On Slide 33, as I shared earlier, this is an important inflection year for the company. Now that we know that mRNA vaccine can be approved, that we have positive cash flow, we have the ability to invest and scale like we've never had in our history. 
If you look at Slide 34, you see some of the key attributes that energized me. mRNA is an information molecule. Moderna has a unique platform. We have a very strong cash position. We have signed very large amount of APAs. We believe Modena will be cash flow positive this year. We believe Moderna will be profitable in 2021. The team has done a remarkable job, and I'm so proud of this team. We have a fully integrated manufacturing plant in Massachusetts and the network of partners with Lonza, Catalent, ROVI, [indiscernible]. 
We have already made 100 million doses of drug substance of the COVID-19 vaccine. We have shipped approximately 60 million doses globally. And as the team reviewed, we have 24 exciting first-in-class or best-in-class development programs that we are pushing towards the clinic -- sorry, [indiscernible]. 
As our historic investors know, since I've joined Moderna as employee #2 in 2011, we have always focused on how do we grow 10x from where we are. We ask this question to ourselves regularly. I have to admit that in 2020, I did not focus on it as intensely as in the previous years. We were focused on moving mRNA 1273 to Phase I, Phase II, Phase III regulatory authorization and on building manufacturing to deliver up to 1 billion doses for 2021. We did not spend much time asking how do we grow 10x? We were focused on how do we get this important vaccine to the finish line and get up to 1 billion dose to help people around the world. 
In early December, while our team was focused on preparing for FDA [indiscernible] meeting on December 17, I was starting to step back and engaged with the Board and some of our executive team members and asked all of them: Now that we know mRNA vaccine can get approved and that we are generating cash, how do we grow 10x from here? 
The last 2 months have been really fun to invent that 10x Moderna. The team is highly [indiscernible] by it and so am I. We have the opportunity to become one of the most impactful biopharmaceutical company over the next 10 to 20 years in the world. The potential to maximize that impact on patients is what motivates us. 
The team and I look forward to welcoming you to our regular investor event. We will host our vaccine day on April 14. We will host our annual Science Day on May 27. And we will host our annual R&D Day on September 9. 
More than ever, we have a unique opportunity to have a very large impact on so many lives. This is humbling to all of us and also highly motivating to always challenge ourselves to build the best version of Moderna that we can. 
I would like to thank our Moderna team, our partners, our many suppliers around the world, our clinical investigators, our participants in our clinical studies. I would also like to thank our investors for your trust as we embark in this new version of Moderna. The team and I will now be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

And so it's important for people to understand, we invested and built the manufacturing capacity, the ability to make 1 billion dose. But this, having worked myself in manufacturing at commercial scale, and of course [indiscernible] manufacturing use manufacturing for Novartis worldwide, there are so many unknown at this stage that.

But if you look forward and say at some point in the future we're going to be perhaps in a regular boosting environment what would be the ideal vaccine, it seems logical that a vaccine that provides the broadest immunity, so not just against ancestral strains or a boost against the new strains would perhaps be the best mode.

It's likely to be in the hundreds of people and immunogenicity and safety as important endpoints there. But ultimately, that will be subject to discussions with the FDA.

And so I believe that our vaccine platform is optimally suited to boost, irrespective of what primary series somebody got, whether it was a protein mRNA or, frankly, an adeno vector. 
I think the challenge with the adeno vector is for both the initial boost and certainly any work with variants down the road is going to be that the adeno vectors generate significant immunity against the other components of the antivirus and thus have the risk of limiting the ability to translate the transgene. And therefore, if you look at the boosting delta, that is how much additional antibody levels do you get from a boost, with adeno vectors, you can get a boost, but the magnitude of that boost is invariably less than the magnitude of the boost you get with an mRNA platform. And that is true just in the first boost. I suspect that if you needed to come with a third dose or a fourth dose or variant specific vaccines, it would be challenging to get the requisite amount of specific immune recognition towards the new transgene."

So in terms of the mRNA-1283 it is correct. It is -- the fact that it is a shorter mRNA does help with the long term stability and does facilitate, we think, moving that into a refrigerated vaccine. It's not the only feature. As you'll know, we've had advantages on our mRNA platform based on our long history of working in it, for instance, that we're functioning right now already, as has been noted, in a normal freezer for up to 6 months and actually already doing 30 days with mRNA-1273 in a refrigerator [ post stalling ]. And so it's a benefit that we're already well on that path, even with just 1273. 
I think the second part of your question was, is it just the RBM, and 1283 covers both the RBD and the N terminal domain. And as has been widely reported, those are particularly important for neutralizing activity in the immune system against SARS-CoV-2 virus."

Look, I realize there's not much you can say on pricing beyond 2021. But as we think about your booster strategies that could be less frequent at lower doses as well as the greater supply of vaccines we should have on the market, balanced against the potential waning of the pandemic, are there scenarios where the price per dose could be either materially higher or lower than what we're looking at in 2021? 
And then my second question is from a modeling standpoint. Should we be assuming anything in the model above and beyond what was talked about today that could be owed to the U.S. government for the initial co-development of your COVID vaccine? Or is that what David was referring to with the royalties that are included as part of your cost of sales? And if so, should we just be assuming a generally stable rate going forward? Are those changed at all?"

So it's quite interesting because, as you know, this is public information, there are some vaccines that have been made available to governments at $3 per dose. And as you know, we walked you pricing strategy back, I think, in August on the Q2 call. The Moderna vaccine is priced much higher. And I think it goes down to a few things. And the most important one is efficacy. Governments care about saving lives. Governments care about getting the economies back on their feet. And so what we're hearing from governments, literally almost on a daily basis as we engage with our existing government contracts versus new ones that are calling us, is there start to be very clear differentiation between the different products that are either available already or that are very close to authorization. And I wished, if I had a crystal ball last year, that we would have built more manufacturing capacity for '21. But I did not anticipate and I don't think anybody did that there will be such difference of efficacy between vaccine, that the mRNA vaccine will be such high performance. As you know, some countries decided to invest first to procure vaccine in adeno or protein technology because they were better understood. And as we know what happened in 2020 in terms of the clinical data, that has a big role. 
So it's quite interesting that also seeing how people are reacting in the countries. If you follow the media, for example, in Europe, where several vaccines have been authorized, as you know, in U.S., we have as of today, I'm hopeful this will change soon with [indiscernible] meeting tomorrow, but only 2 mRNA vaccine authorized in the U.S. 
But if you look at what's happening in some countries in Europe, also what's happening in different countries around the world, I think governments, because of essence, you've advisors and clinical advisers and because of really the aim, reduce the pressure on the health care system, in the hospitals. 
So what is quite fascinating, and I'm sure you're all observing it, is that it's at least the first time I've seen in my career, being 20 years in this business, that in the media every day. You hear about vaccines on TV, in the newspaper, online. And you have the product efficacy that are all revenues every day. This has never happened to my knowledge for any of our products. And so you have this very interesting phenomenon that's happening, too, that you have the clinician, the nurses, the pharmacists, but the consumers too, that are believing that those products are not all the same. And this, I think will be a very important differentiation as we move into '22, as we move more to a traditional commercial market, where it's not governments buying directly, but the traditional kind of retail channel. And the impact, I think, of the consumers' desire to ask for a product when he or she walks into a pharmacy or GP office will be quite significantly different from what we are used with our products."

So in terms of the flexibility, as I described in my remarks, the only raw material that is different from let's say mRNA-1273 to mRNA-1273.351 is only the [indiscernible]. The enzymes are the same. The [indiscernible] is the same. In the same equipment in the same rooms with the same people. So the flexibility of this technology is really incredible for people that have worked with recombinant, like I used to do at Lilly. And as you know, I trained as biochemical engineer doing cell and e-coli production in bioreactors. It is visually you come week after we use disposable reactors, you get new consumable plastic bags and so on as your reactor. And here you go again, you just need to change take a different plasmid. Because we use disposable reactors and not stainless steel reactors you don't have to spend a lot of time doing cleaning validation because we basically dispose of things. And so the flexibility is quite incredible. You just need a new plasmid. And so because so it's not a very expensive part of the cost of the total cost of the finished product that is filled in a vial, because you have to make mRNA, you have to formulate it and you have to fill it in a vial. Are doing a lot of plasmid at risk for variant is a great optionality for the company with very, very down payment. So that's a piece that I think makes this technology very unique on ready to scale and be able to be flexible to respond to different demand. Is there a way where we potentially might end up with a different combination of mutant boost on the road in different continents, maybe. I don't know, again, it will be market-driven. But if it is what the market requires, we can accommodate that in a way that is totally atypical to what the industry could do and at the speed, which was I think will surprise many. Because again, we make these other products in the same reactors. 
In terms of taking down the manufacturing capacity if we don't need, let's say, '23 or '24, the same amount of volume because of a mass of boosting, as we say. It's actually interesting because, as you know, we have now good plant where we have quite a lot of capacity. But also, we have some capacity at Lonza in New Shire and also capacity in Switzerland, where they are there several lines of manufacturing. So we have actually quite a lot of flexibility to take capacity down at Lonza, either in the U.S. and/or in Europe at different time points. So that's one point. 
The other piece we should not forget is the pipeline. And I will just make 2 comments, which I think are very important to understand why actually us building manufacturing to that scale is going to be so enabling to Moderna to keep growing and growing and growing. First is the other vaccines. CMV is ready to move into Phase III, as we say, this year. We will give you updates on the flu program, but I will remind everybody that there is an approvable endpoint with the regulator for seasonal flu vaccines. And so we anticipate that the development of the flu program will be pretty quick. 
And as we discussed on previous calls, one of our kind of optimal target product profile for down the road will be a product that is both seasonal through with the current strain of flu, but also a boost for COVID-19 with a relevant strength at that time in the same dose. So we anticipate we should have high efficacy for flu has not so mRNA virus. It's a pretty straightforward virus like the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
And so that is where we are going with more vaccines coming to the market. And then there's also always therapeutic pipeline. And the piece, I think, that is actually quite good for us that we started with vaccine, the scale-up, if I go back to mass, which is if you think about some of our products, as you know 1273 requires 100-microgram per human per dose. But if you look at the chikungunya antibody program, that use the IV formulated mRNA that we use also in the rare disease program, for example, what we showed is very good data at 0.1 milligram per kilo. So in a 70-kilo adult, it is 7 milligram compared to 100 micrograms. So as we move the therapeutic pipeline further into development, but especially to commercial, we're going to need much more mass of mRNA. And so I actually -- I'm spending a lot of time thinking, one, how do we keep adding capacity to manage the entire pipeline that is progressing. We have the flexibility with Lonza, that's why we did it this way we want so we are ready to take chunks down if we need to. But if I was a betting man, how we bet with you that we're going to be more adding than taking capacity down because of the probability of technical success. As I've said all along, I believe we will launch the CMV vaccine, given the data we have, the medical need and the biology we're able to do with both the pentamer and GB. And so now spending time, we want to think about how do we do more."

So as we've said all along, which is why we gave a range and not 1 number for expected supply in the year, I think one number is a very dangerous strategy. As we said, those type of consumables are, of course, important. We are in a regulated business, and we cannot start to make a product until we have all the components, all the raw material, the entire train team and so on and so forth. We have a lot of like in an airplane, you have to check a lot of things before you can start the engine. Well, in GMP manufacturing, you have to do the same to ensure the quality and the safety of the product. 
And so what I think the team has done a very good job last year. As you recall, we started [ rating ] against this virus in very early January. And it's in the late January time frame that we started to say, geez, this could turn into a pandemic. And we started to think bigger. And so, one, the team and I spent quite a lot of time as we are trying to think about, okay, how do we go? If we had to make 1 billion dose in '21, how would we do that? I used to run the supply chain at Lilly globally. And we went right away to start to talk to our suppliers. 
And one other thing we had to do, and if you recall, we did an important capital raise in May of last year, which was very important for getting us to where we are today. In some suppliers, because the increase of mass of product we're ordering from them were so gigantic, a thousand times more, in the 2,000 times more than the year before, as You can imagine, many of them looked at us a bit funny and we are very worried. They were worried that if the drug would fail, they might be in trouble, because they will have to get this type of increase of capacity to sometimes buy new equipment, hire more people, buy their own raw materials to make our raw materials for our product, if that makes sense. And so sometimes what we have to do with the team is actually to pay upfront the entire purchase of products so that they will go and take that cash and start to invest to prepare for scale up. So we took a lot of business risk last year that we thought were necessary to ensure we could deliver this year on the output from the manufacturing supply chain. 
So I think we're in a good place. Do we have from time to time one component that give us a sleepless night because it's very tight? It's happening because the ramp-up the industry is doing is unprecedented. But so far, so good, and we are extremely on top of it, including as we do things like increasing capacity that we announced last night to right away not only buy new machine, but right away place new orders for raw materials and make sure we keep increasing our safety stock so that we run this more and more as a regular business where you have safety stock on site. So if a supplier has a bump in a road, a pump breaking or something else, that we are able to manage that variability, which is normally manufacturing without impacting our ability to maximize our own output."

So we tend to be cautious, because as a new company we want to make sure that we build credibility and the credibility in to be earned.

And as we learn more we moved it yesterday to 700 million. So I believe it is possible as we're going to sell more than 5 billion of CMV? Yes, I believe it's possible because it's an incredible unmet medical need. As the world develops, I think the piece one has to be careful about peak sales. This peak sales when [indiscernible] sales 25 years after launch because now those vaccines are [indiscernible] annuity lack products. There's, of course, inflation.

And then secondarily, and maybe scientifically more interestingly, how do you interpret the data suggesting that at least for the adenoviral approach from J&J, but also from your own data and the other mRNA vaccine, that titers appear to improve over time and [indiscernible] improves over time and the gap and efficacy against the so-called South African variance and the [indiscernible] seems to close.

Point two is from an accounting perspective, what happens is you basically project the full year tax rate, including the consumption of that deferred tax asset.

I think the question, though, is at some point, you would expect coronavirus immunity to wane. And that's because in all of the human circulating coronaviruses, that's what happens. The durability here has always been a question. Is it 1 year? Is it 3 years? Is it 5 years? I think as you see new strains emerge, like the potentially concerning strains that we've been talking about, particularly in the Republic of South Africa and Brazil, you have to ask the question, is that -- what does that look like not just now, but what does that look like 6 months from now, 1 year from now, as we start to move into a mode where we're going to see seasonal epidemics of coronaviruses, which we already see for the other coronaviruses, and you would have to assume will happen with SARS-CoV-2. 
And it's for that -- those gaps in immunity that I think we're particularly focused on right now, which is, to what extent do you -- to what extent in the future do at-risk populations emerge with increased risk against these new strains? 
It's not something you can see in the data in the first 30, 60, 90 days post vaccination in the current clinical trials. But it's something that you -- we did talk a lot about last year, and I think it's going to continue to be something we have to track closely as we look ahead."

I mean, look, I think we will obviously update data on durability of responses across our Phase I, Phase II, Phase III trials as that comes out. And looking forward, it's prudent. And if we can, we will be providing updates as well against the new strains. 
I think what we're saying about the variance and strategies against it is, I think none of us want to be in a situation where we wait until there are reinfections and increased morbidity and God forbid more mortality in a seasonal epidemic, for instance, this winter in the Northern Hemisphere is coming winter. And then say, okay, now it's time to be boosting people. And so as we're continuing to face an evolving virus that is changing its stripes and perhaps decreasing the durability of our immunity, we're trying to be very proactive with the 3 strategies we described. And I think we'll continue to follow things like the data that you pointed to, which is how are we doing in terms of immunity and blood of people who were previously vaccinated or previously infected, we'll obviously closely be following reinfections. And then I think we all have to be following very closely what's happening in the southern hemisphere, because as they move into their winter and a potential -- a potential seasonal spike in the winter, as you normally see in temperate climates, it will help us understand to what extent are we still in we have to stay ahead in the concerning phase of this epidemic or pandemic? Or is it a place where we start to get more and more confident that the vaccines have the virus under control?"

For the call, we propose to start first by looking back to fiscal year 2020 and then looking to fiscal year 2021. For fiscal year 2020, I will share a few slides to summarize the key elements of the year, before David shares with you the 2020 financials and also how we think about 2021 financial framework. For fiscal year 2021, I will share our business objectives and why we are so excited for 2021 and the inflection point this year will represent in our history. Stephen will start with an update on our approach to variance of concern and then Tal will provide an update on our clinical pipeline. 
2020 was a historic year for Moderna. We started in January as an early-stage development company. By the end of July, we had become a late-stage development company. And by December, we had positive results from our Phase III COVE study of our COVID-19 vaccine showing efficacy around 94%. Our COVID-19 vaccine was authorized by the FDA and Canada Health in mid-December and we shipped [ 80 million ] doses to the U.S. government and the Canadian governments by year-end. We laid the groundwork for a global organization, adding commercial subsidiaries in 8 countries, 8 countries. By year-end, we have signed $11.7 billion of advanced purchase agreement for our vaccine. 
A team of a little over 1,000 members did all that. And we also continue to invest in science to improve further our mRNA platform. And we also advance on 20 programs in development across 5 therapeutic areas. And we did it without a large global pharmaceutical partner. 
The Moderna team executed swiftly and superbly in carrying out the complicated Phase III study while achieving remarkable diversity. The Moderna team secured the authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine by regulators. The Moderna team built out our manufacturing capacity, scaling up across many manufacturing processes, partnered with Lonza, ROVI and Catalent, and shipped close to 80 million doses by year-end. For context, we had made less than 100,000 doses of medicine in 2019. This was roughly a 200x increase in 12 months. And we're on our way to produce as many as 1 billion doses in 2021 and more in 2022. 
In 2019, we had no authorized products. We had negative cash flows from operations every quarter. And we anticipated needing multiple capital raises over at least 5 years until CMV would produce sufficient revenues for Moderna to break even in terms of cash flows and become a self-sustaining company.  
In 2020, we had our first product authorized and our first product revenues in the last 2 weeks of Q4. We had 2 quarters of positive cash flows from operations. We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and with cash generation in 2 quarters. 
Moderna has been changed forever. Moderna has been changed in a profound way. Moderna is now a commercial company with subsidiaries in 8 countries and a direct presence in many more through commercial distributors and partners. 
mRNA is an information molecule. We have a powerful platform, and this is just the beginning. We have a scalable platform due to our investment in IT, robotics and AI over the last 7 years. We have an amazing team, as you witnessed by what the team accomplished in the 12 short months of 2020. And we have a capital to invest and scale. 
On Slide 6, you have a summary of the countries in which we received emergency use authorization or conditional approvals and all were -- started rolling submission that we did. 
On Slide 7, you get a sense for the commercial infrastructure that we built. For context, in May of 2020, Moderna did not have a single employee dedicated to commercial activities. We closed the year with 8 commercial subsidiaries, an incredible commercial team and commercial partners. We now have commercial operations in the U.S.; in Canada; in Europe, in the 5 largest markets, Germany; France; Italy; Spain; and the U.K. We established one in Switzerland, where we have both commercial capabilities to serve the Swiss market as well as manufacturing for geographies outside the U.S. with our partner Lonza and the support teams that we need in finance, HR, digital and legal. We have partnered with Medison in Israel and with Takeda in Japan. 
If you step back and think about it, this commercial network which we started building and will expand in 2021 is an incredible asset for the entire Moderna pipeline. We now have the infrastructure to commercialize all our products. These markets on the slide are some of the largest markets in the world. So by building the commercial network for the launch of our COVID-19 vaccine and deciding not to partner, we have actually financed and built the commercial network for all of our programs. 
We have become a fully integrated company, and in 12 months, proved that we're capable of running complex Phase III studies, scaling up manufacturing to commercial level, making hundreds of millions of doses per year and building our own commercial network. As I said, the Moderna team did an amazing job in 2020. 
On Slide 8, you get a glimpse of what Moderna looks like in February 2021. While most people in the world think of Moderna as a COVID-19 vaccine company, this is just the first product that we are launching. We have a platform, and our molecule mRNA is an information molecule. This is just the beginning. 
We are going to soon start a Phase III study for vaccine against CMV, cytomegalovirus, the #1 cause of birth defect. There is no approved CMV vaccine on the market. The pharma industry has strived for around 20 years to make a vaccine against CMV. This is a complex virus, a vaccine of 6 mRNAs per dose, over which are 2 from a complex protein called pentamer. We believe that CMV vaccine will present potential annual peak sales between $2 billion and $5 billion. 
We have 3 programs in Phase II of personal cancer vaccine in melanoma or OX40 ligand in ovarian cancer and injected in patients' hearts, post heart attack, to revascularize their heart with new blood vessels. We have had 12 positive Phase I results. 
In addition to our COVID-19 vaccine, we have 8 infectious vaccine candidates, all for first-in-class vaccine like against CMV or what we believe could be a best-in-class vaccine like with influenza. But we also have a remarkable therapeutic pipeline. We have candidate therapeutics in immuno-oncology with 5 medicines in the clinic, 4 in rare disease program, 2 cardio program and 2 autoimmune disease programs.  
If you think about it, Moderna is going after the 4 leading cause of death by disease area: infectious disease; cancer; cardiovascular disease; autoimmune disease. The total addressable market is very large. We are not a COVID-19 vaccine company. 
We're investing in science and leveraging our scalable platform to take more candidates from our research lab to clinical development soon. So stay tuned for that. We announced yesterday that we are increasing our base manufacturing plant for the number of COVID-19 doses we will produce in fiscal year 2021 from 600 million to 700 million doses, given the strong start of our U.S. operation and initial ramp of our outside-the-U.S. operation. Our team is still working hard to get us up to 1 billion doses for fiscal year '21. 
Now let me turn to David for Q4 and fiscal year 2021 financial framework. David?"

Before reviewing the financial section of the slide deck, I want to comment on the approach we've taken sharing this information. This starts with the 3 Cs, these being clear, complete and comprehensible. Today, we are presenting our results primarily on a U.S. GAAP basis. And in individual item level, in some cases, we also provide additional detail to provide greater clarity on underlying trends and to facilitate period-over-period comparisons in line with our 3C goal. 
Reflecting the continued uncertainties related to the course of the evolving pandemic, along with the many challenges and opportunities we face as a newly globalizing commercial company, we also seek to avoid implying an unrealistic level of precision concerning future financial projections in the face of a range of outcomes. With this background, we are providing today the analysis of actual 2020 results, along with a view of key drivers of the financial framework going forward. We will continue to update and refine this information as business evolves. 
Turning to Slide 10. I want to briefly remind you about some key accounting changes which we presented on this slide in our Q3 call in October. As a result of the successful transition to a commercial company, following the emergency use authorization by the FDA and Health Canada in December 2020, we began to record product sales. We also began to capitalize inventory based on the expectation these costs would be recoverable through commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine as opposed to expensing costs directly to R&D in the period incurred. And we also began to capitalize purchases of property and equipment and long-term lease assets as opposed to expensing costs in the period incurred through the lack of alternative use. 
With this context, let me turn now to Slide #11. Total revenue was $571 million for Q4 2020 compared to $14 million for the same period in 2019. Total revenue was $803 million for the full year 2020 compared to $60 million in the prior year. Following the authorization for emergency use by the FDA and Health Canada in December of our COVID-19 vaccine, we generated our first ever product sales. 
For 2020, we recognized $200 million of product sales for our COVID-19 vaccine, all in late December. Additionally, grant and collaboration revenue increased to $371 million in Q4 and $603 million for the full year, primarily due to increases in grant revenue from BARDA to accelerate development of our COVID-19 vaccine.
Now turning to cost of sales. We began capitalizing our COVID-19 vaccine inventory costs in December, starting after the vaccine was first authorized based upon our expectation that these costs would be recoverable through commercialization of the vaccine. Prior to the authorization of our COVID-19 vaccine, inventory costs were recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred. 
We expensed $242 million of prelaunch inventory costs in 2020. Hence, our cost of sales were only $8 million in 2020, comprised primarily of third-party royalties. If inventory sold during 2020 was valued at cost, our cost of sales for 2020 would have been $62 million or 31% of our product sales. 
Research and development expenses were $759 million for Q4 2020 compared to $118 million for the same period in 2019. Research and development expenses were $1.37 billion for the full year 2020 compared to $496 million in the prior year. The increases for both 3- and 12-month periods in 2020 were mainly due to increased COVID-19 vaccine clinical development activities, headcount increases, pre-launch inventory buildup and expenses associated with the equipment and lease facilities that were deemed to have no alternative use at the acquisition of such equipment. 
Selling, general and administration expenses were $79 million for Q4 2020 compared to $26 million for the same period in 2019. Expenses were $188 million for the full year 2020 compared to $110 million in the prior year. The increases for both periods were mainly driven by increases in personnel, outside services and start-up costs associated with preparation for commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally. We recorded a net loss of $272 million for Q4 2020 compared to $123 million in the same period in 2019 and $747 million for the full year 2020 compared to $514 million in the prior year. 
Turning to selected cash flow information on Page 12. We ended Q4 2020 with cash and investments of $5.25 billion compared to $3.97 billion at the end of Q3. The increase is primarily driven by $1.7 billion of customer deposits received in the fourth quarter for supply of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
On the top half of the page, we present information from our 10-K and 10-Q filings. And on the bottom part, we provide the quarterly trend and the cash deposits received related to supply agreements for our COVID-19 vaccine. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.03 billion for the 12 months ended December 2020, compared to net cash used of $459 million for the same period in 2019. The reversal from cash used to cash provided by operating activities is driven by total customer deposits. Cash used for purchases of capitalized property and equipment was $67 million for the full year 2020 compared to $32 million in 2019. 
Before looking forward to 2021, let me summarize a few areas from our 2020 results that are important to keep in mind when modeling 2021 financial performance. Starting with research and development and SG&A expenses shown on the top left quadrant of Slide 13. Prior to the authorization for emergency use by the FDA and Health Canada as a pre-commercial research stage company, Moderna expensed all costs related to the production of inventory as well as costs for property and equipment and lease expenses for current and some future contract manufacturing activities due to lack of alternative use. Adjusting for these items, which in the future would be capitalized and expensed as cost of sales, the underlying R&D and SG&A expense run rate for Q4 2020 was $0.5 billion for the quarter. 
Turning to the upper right quadrant of Slide 13. Cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, logistics and warehousing costs as well as third-party royalty costs. The reported expense in Q4 of $8 million reflects the fact that we expensed all inventory-related costs until authorization of our COVID-19 vaccine. If valued at cost or actual cost of sales, including initial ramp-up costs, would have been $62 million or 31% of product sales. The cash and investment balance reported as of December 31 was $5.25 billion, $2.8 billion of which related to cash deposits from customers for future supply of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
Lastly, let me comment on certain tax-related items. The significant investments in our research and development and start-up activities to develop the mRNA platform over the last decade has resulted in a net operating loss carryforward with the balance as of December 31, 2020, of $2.3 billion, up from $1 billion at year-end 2019. As of December 31, we maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets related to these loss carryforwards. We will continue to monitor the valuation allowance as we progress through 2021 and expect to utilize our loss carryforwards. 
With this context, let me now move to considerations for 2021, starting with an overview of advanced purchase agreements for our COVID-19 vaccine on Slide 14. We have disclosed advanced purchase agreements to supply our COVID-19 vaccine to 40 countries through the end of 2021, including the U.S. government for 300 million doses with options for an additional 200 million doses; the European for 310 million, with an option for an additional 150 million doses in 2022; plus 10 other countries, including Japan, Canada and South Korea, with announced doses totaling 186 million. 
We are thankful for the trust of governments around the world have placed in us to deliver a vaccine for their countries. All these agreements contain provisions for deposits and have contributed to our balance of deposits of $2.8 billion at year-end 2020. Negotiations with other countries are also ongoing, including with COVAX. 
Turning now to the 2021 financial framework on Slide 15. Already-signed APA agreements for expected delivery in 2021 reflect a total of $18.4 billion in anticipated product sales. Based on continuous progress to ramp up available supply capacity in our network, we have raised the lower end of our global manufacturing plan for 2021 from 600 million to 700 million doses at the 100-microgram dose level. Manufacturing is still working to supply up to 1 billion doses for 2021. Further, we expect a range of related -- of released doses in Q1 2021 of 100 million to 125 million doses and 200 million to 250 million doses in the second quarter. 
Our total cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing, logistics and warehousing and third-party royalties, as discussed previously. For 2021, we currently model total cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be approximately 20% for the full year, with some variation quarter-by-quarter, largely driven by the average selling price. We also expect Q1 reported cost of sales in percent of product sales to be in line with the full year average, including the benefit from the remaining 0 cost prelaunch inventory in Q1. 
Now let me comment on planned R&D and SG&A expenses. The underlying Q4 2020 expense run rate, adjusted for transitional items as discussed on Slide 13, was approximately $0.5 billion. We currently expect our quarterly reported expenses to increase on a continuous basis through 2021 compared to the Q4 2020 adjusted run rate. In Q1, we expect an increase in the low double-digit percentage range relative to the adjusted Q4 2020 expense run rate of $0.5 billion. We will provide additional updates going forward as our global business rapidly expands. 
I would also like to comment on how we think about modeling our tax rate. In 2021, Moderna will transition to taxpaying status as we deliver on our COVID-19 vaccine contracts to customers. As a U.S.-based company, we start with the statutory 21% tax rate. This is impacted by global sales mix to the extent that non-U.S. rates are generally lower than in the U.S  and by recovery against our prior accumulated losses of over $2 billion. As we start the year, we expect the all-in 2021 tax rate to be in the mid-teen percentage level on an ongoing basis, including in the first quarter. We will update this view as our book of business evolves further. 
Lastly, regarding capital investments. We currently plan capital investment in the amount of $350 million to $400 million for 2021. Roughly half of the investment is to further expand our COVID-19 vaccine supply capability, including supply capacity up to 1.4 billion doses at the 100-microgram level, with the balance of planned capital investments to expand our technical development, clinical manufacturing as well as our other facility footprint. 
This concludes my remarks concerning the financial performance, and I turn the call back to Stéphane."

Let me now discuss 2021 on Slide 17. We are still in February, and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is now authorized in 37 countries, and our team is continuing to engage regulators in new geographies, like Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and more. We're also well on our way in the rolling submission process to the WHO, which will be key for low-income countries access via COVAX and UNICEF if we get the partnership done. 
We are committed to our principles of global access to our new class of medicines, where we recognize that the need for scale up of manufacturing operations have led to supply going to the U.S., Europe and other countries. We are working with COVAX to provide low-cost vaccines to the poorest countries and look forward to supplying our vaccines for COVAX Gavi and becoming a company that will be part of the global health infrastructure for many years to come. UNICEF is the procurement arm of COVAX. 
On Slide 18. As I shared in my 2020 shareholder letter, which we posted publicly on January 4 and which you can access on our block if you have not read it, I believe that 2021 is going to be the most important inflection year in Moderna's history. You can see the evolution of the company over 2019, 2020 and 2021 on this slide over a few dimensions. But to me, the reason I say that 2021 is the most important inflection year in the company's history, is that we are not the same company. As I've told our employees in a recent town hall, I almost wished I could change the company name to help our team understand the magnitude of the change. 
We used to believe that mRNA vaccine could be authorized and become commercial. We used to have negative cash flows from operations each quarter since our founding in 2010. We used to work to raise additional capital regularly and thought we needed to do that for another 5 plus years until CMV will get the company's cash flow breakeven. But we have been through an incredible pivot. This is not the same company. 
Now we know that mRNA vaccine can be authorized and become commercial. Now we have positive cash flows from operations for 2 quarters in a row already. So now we are going to double down on our investment in science, in process development, in manufacturing, in IT, in robotics, in AI to scale our company. 
I believe that in business, there's a drastic difference between believing in an outcome and having negative cash flow versus knowing an outcome and having positive cash flow. Our appetite and our ability to invest has been transformed. We are not the same company now that we were in the last 10 years. Our thinking is going to be much more expansive. 
On Slide 19. As David shared a moment ago, we have, as of yesterday, already $18.4 billion of signed advanced purchase agreements for fiscal year 2021 deliveries. We still have multiple discussions ongoing about additional APAs for 2021. So these have not been signed yet, so they are not counted in the $18.4 billion. We'll update you each quarter about the signed APAs for fiscal year 2021 as we report sales recognized with the shipment of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
We increased our manufacturing base plan for the year to 700 million doses and are working hard to get to 1 billion. We are working with COVAX and its procurement arm, UNICEF, to maximize the availability of our vaccine around the world. 
Let me now turn to Slide 20 to talk about 2022 manufacturing capacity. We announced last night after the market closed that several factors have led us to decide to add more manufacturing capacity. First, many governments have been telling us that they now see 2 classes of COVID-19 vaccine based on efficacy, and they would like more of our vaccine given its high efficacy. Second, variants. Government and political leaders around the world are concerned about the emergence of several variants. They have been very clear about it, and some of them have started to request options for 2022.  
With the start of the fall season soon in the southern hemisphere, with a large population of the world and with a large population of immune-compromised patients, like HIV-positive patients, we're hearing daily that governments around the world and the COVID teams worry that boosting people with variants will be an important strategy over the next couple of years to get this virus under control. 
So we decided to add manufacturing capacity. We have communicated previously that our capacity for 2022, given the ramp in 2021, will be approximately up to 1.2 billion doses, assuming 100-microgram dose. We have decided and have started to buy additional capital equipment, hire more people and order more raw materials towards 200 million doses per year of capacity for 2022. So if you assume a 100-microgram dose, we will have 1.4 billion dose of capacity for fiscal year '22. In other words, we will build the manufacturing capacity to make up to 140 kilograms, yes, kilograms, of formulated mRNA in 2022. 
Now let's talk about output in number of doses. Two factors determine output: the dose of a boost; and the product mix. Given our COVID-19 vaccine, previously referred as mRNA-1273, is currently authorized for 100-microgram dose. So with using the boost like mRNA-1273.351, the South African variant candidate, needs 50 microgram per dose. On the bottom left of the slide, you see a scenario in which 100% of our output is our COVID-19 vaccine authorized, and we get 1.4 billion doses at 100 microgram. On the bottom in the middle, you see a scenario where we sell 1 billion doses for COVID-19 authorized vaccine and 0.8 billion doses for boost at 50 microgram for a total of 1.8 billion doses. And on the bottom right, you see the marks and -- another scenario on the right. 
The way to think about output will depend on the dose of the boost and the product mix. We will learn in the next few months in the clinic about the necessary dose to get a high neutralizing antibody titer for our boost. Only, one needs to think about our manufacturing capacity in terms of mass. Given the flexibility of mRNA, we can, in the same room and with the same equipment, make COVID-19 vaccine and/or 1 boost, and/or are 2 boosts, and/or 3 boosts, you get the point. We can run manufacturing campaign based on the market demand with the same manufacturing capacity, just like small molecule drug substance. 
So with mRNA, we not only have the advantage of speed, but we also have the advantage of manufacturing flexibility and we have best-in-class efficacy. I believe this will prove crucial from a competitive standpoint for the years ahead, where nobody knows where the demand mix will have to be. It's a new and still unstable virus. Nobody knows if 1 variant is going to be necessary and/or enough to boost or more in the years to come until this virus is fully under control. 
So speed to market and flexibility of product mix and scale will be critical. We have all three. Few companies do. And we also, without the partners, we don't have to get aligned with somebody else with different goals, different financial incentives, different corporate decision-making process, different culture. We have moved fast, and we will continue to move fast. 
On Slide 21. In 2021, we are continuing to scale our commercial network. We plan to open commercial subsidiaries this year in Japan, South Korea and Australia. I look forward to planting the Moderna flag in Tokyo, Seoul and Sydney. We also want to continue to help regional distributors. We are in advanced discussions with partners to cover ASEAN and also Eastern Europe. With this addition in 2021, we will have a strong commercial network across the world in most critical markets by the end of this year. 
On the next slide, we were delighted to announce earlier this year that Corinne Le Goff has joined as Moderna's first Chief Commercial Officer. Corinne's experience in global commercial leadership, until recently at Amgen, but also her critical experience as Country Manager at Roche and her experience with digital marketing will prove invaluable. 
I have had the chance to spend a lot of time with Corinne since she joined, and I'm confident she will build a Moderna commercial organization highly leveraged with digital solutions, both externally and internally. We both share the view that there are many ways to run commercial operation in a much more modern way than traditional sales force of large pharmaceutical companies. In commercial, too, Moderna will disrupt and innovate and implement best practices from many industries and build a digital commercial organization. Corinne will have a chance to share some her thoughts and present to you at our Vaccine Day on April 14.  
This morning, we also announced that Tal, our Chief Medical Officer, will be leaving the company in late September after 6 years of service. Tal joined us when we were a preclinical company and now we have our first authorized product. I am very thankful for Tal for taking a chance on us 6 years ago. It was not obvious at the time, trust me, that we were going to make it. But given his deep scientific understanding and curiosity like Stephen Hoge and I and many others on the team, he saw that this technology could change medicine if we could make it work safely in humans. 
Tal, thank you so much for everything you have done. It has been a pleasure of building Moderna with you and the team. I look forward to continuing working with you in the coming quarters. 
The company has retained Russell Reynolds to recruit a new Chief Medical Officer with global and commercial experience as the company scale up to launch the COVID-19 vaccine, of course, around the world, also prepares for potential COVID boost and prepares to file several biological license over the next few years. 
With this, now let me turn to Stephen to talk about SARS-CoV-2 variants. Stephen?"

Today, I want to take you through our current thinking on variance and our strategy to address them. I'll then turn it over to Tal to provide an update on our pipeline. Let me start with a quick overview",558,"Thank you, Stéphane, and good morning, everyone. Today, I want to take you through our current thinking on variance and our strategy to address them. I'll then turn it over to Tal to provide an update on our pipeline. 
Let me start with a quick overview of our strategy for SARS-CoV-2 variance of concern. Last week, we published a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine with data that confirmed the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, provides neutralizing activity against all variants of concern tested to date. Nonetheless, as recent reports have increased transmission and potential reinfections of the new variants have emerged, out of an abundance of caution, we have announced multiple strategies to try to increase protection against those variants. 
As has been widely reported, the immune response generated by original strains appears to be relatively weaker against the B.1.351 variant. If or when immunity wanes in the future, this might lead to a gap in protection. We plan to close this potential gap with an update to our vaccine based on the new strains. We anticipate different approaches for 2 distinct populations. 
For those who have been immunized or infected by the original strains, we anticipate boosting with a variant-specific booster vaccine, either alone or in combination with our vaccine against the ancestral strains. For those who are still naive to SARS-CoV-2 because they have not been previously infected or vaccinated, we anticipate updating our vaccine to provide immunity to both the ancestral strains and the new variants of concern. 
Now on Slide 25, you can see the clinical trials that are ongoing or planned for our COVID-19 vaccines. For mRNA-1273, the TeenCOVE Phase II/III study in adolescents ages 12 to 17 years is ongoing and recently completed enrollment. The KidCOVE study, Phase II, in pediatric populations ages 6 months to 11 years, will begin in the near term. And our Phase I/II study in Japan is ongoing, led by our partner, Takeda. 
For the variant studies, we plan to test a variant-specific booster candidate, mRNA-1273.351 based on the B.1.351 variant, first identified in the Republic of South Africa at the 50-microgram dose level and lower. In addition, we plan to test a multivalent booster candidate, mRNA-1273.211 that combines mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 in a single vaccine, again at the 50-microgram dose level and lower. And we're also evaluating a third dose of our authorized Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, at a 50-microgram dose level, which is already underway.  
Finally, we are planning to test the next-generation vaccine, mRNA-1283 that encodes for the receptor binding domain and end terminal domain of the spike protein and is being developed as a potential refrigerator stable mRNA vaccine that could facilitate easier distribution and administration in a wider range of settings, including potentially developing countries. 
We believe messenger RNA is best positioned to address the potential threat of SARS-CoV-2 variance, given several key characteristics, including high vaccine efficacy, speed and agility to make updates, ease with which we can do combinations and our manufacturing flexibility and scalability. I'm happy to say that we have already manufactured the first GMP batch of our variant booster candidate, mRNA-1273.351, and have shipped clinical trial material to the NIH for clinical testing. 
Now I'll hand it over to Tal, who will walk you through the rest of our portfolio across vaccines and therapeutics. Tal?"

We have 4 other vaccine programs that are in clinical trials. The CMV vaccine is on track to start the pivotal Phase III this year. The Zika vaccine is preparing for a Phase II trial that is also expected to begin in this year. And our hMPV/PIV3 vaccine is currently enrolling in toddlers. Our RSV vaccine is being studied in 2 separate trials, 1 in children and 1 in adults. The pediatric trial is enrolling quickly, and the first 3 cohorts in the age de-escalation study have now been fully enrolled. We announced last month that we were taking our RSV vaccine into the adult population, and I'm happy to share that the first participant has since then been dosed in that trial. 
Just last month, we announced 3 new development programs in infectious disease vaccines. Our influenza vaccine program will evaluate 3 candidates comprising multiple antigen combinations against the 4 seasonal viruses recommended by the WHO, eventually moving 1 candidate into a Phase III trial.  
Our HIV vaccine program has 2 approaches. mRNA-1644 is a collaboration with IAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. It's a novel approach to an HIV vaccine strategy that's designed to elicit broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies. mRNA-1574 is a collaboration with the NIH, and this includes multiple native-like trimer antigens. 
And finally, for those unfamiliar with the Nipah virus, this is a zoonotic virus transmitted to humans from animals, that is either transmitted in food or through direct human-to-human transmission. It is included in the WHO R&D blueprint list of epidemic threats needed for urgent R&D action. mRNA-1215 is a collaboration with the NIH to develop a Nipah vaccine. 
We also have 7 clinical proof-of-concept trials ongoing in our exploratory modalities. The Phase II program in VEGF, partnered with AstraZeneca, is ongoing. The personalized cancer vaccine Phase II, which is in combination with KEYTRUDA compared to KEYTRUDA alone, that is partnered with Merck continues. And the Phase 1 of that program in multiple cohorts is ongoing, including the upsized head and neck cohort that is currently recruiting additional patients.  
The KRAS Phase I that is partnered with Merck continues. And in the intratumoral oncology, we have a Phase II ongoing with OX40 ligand program in ovarian cancer patients. The Phase I dose escalation for the triplet program is ongoing both as monotherapy and in combination with durvalumab. And IL-12 partnered with AstraZeneca continues in a Phase I trial. Finally, within the systemic intracellular therapeutics, the Phase I/II sites for our PA program are being initiated, and we plan to enter the clinic this year. 
This final slide has our full pipeline. And with that, let me hand it back to Stéphane."

Priority #1, to maximize the impact of our COVID-19 vaccine. The output in 2021 in terms of number of dose that we can ship to countries, the manufacturing scale-up, preparing for 2022 supply, clinical development of variants and boost, and our full commitment to bring variants of concern to the clinic. Priority #2, accelerate vaccine development and continue to bring more innovation from a research lab to clinical development. 
Priority #3, generate proof-of-concept in therapeutics, based on the success of our ability to repeat dose in human of therapeutics technology with chikungunya antibodies. But also with intratumoral, we expect key data in cardiology, oncology, rate genetic disease and the entry in the clinic of our first autoimmune programs. Priority #4, we want to continue the expansion of mRNA technology. Our appetite to invest in science and process development has not weakened, just the opposite. We believe we are still at the beginning of the S-curve of this exciting new disruptive technology. 
On Slide 33, as I shared earlier, this is an important inflection year for the company, now that we know that mRNA vaccine can be approved, that we have positive cash flow, we have the ability to invest and to scale like we've never had in our history. 
If you look at Slide 34, you see some of the key attributes that energized me. mRNA is an information molecule, Moderna has a unique platform. We have a very strong cash position. We have signed very large amount of APAs. We believe Moderna will be cash flow positive this year. We believe Moderna will be profitable in 2021. The team has done a remarkable job, and I'm so proud of this team. We have a fully integrated manufacturing plant in Massachusetts and the network of partners with Lonza, Catalent, ROVI, [indiscernible]. We have already made 100 million doses of drug substance of the COVID-19 vaccine. We have shipped approximately 60 million doses globally. And as the team reviewed, we have 24 exciting first-in-class or best-in-class development programs that we are pushing towards the clinic -- sorry, for approval. 
As our historic investors know, since I've joined Moderna as employee #2 in 2011, we have always focused on how do we grow 10x from where we are. We ask this question to ourselves regularly. I have to admit that in 2020, I did not focus on it as intensely as in the previous years. We were focused on moving mRNA-1273 to Phase I, Phase II, Phase III regulatory authorization and on building manufacturing to deliver up to 1 billion doses for 2021. 
We did not spend much time asking how do we grow 10x? We were focused on how do we get this important vaccine to the finish line and get up to 1 billion dose to help people around the world. In early December, while our team was focused on preparing for FDA VRBPAC meeting on December 17, I was starting to step back and engaged with the Board and some of our executive team members and asked all of them, ""Now that we know mRNA vaccine can get approved and that we are generating cash, how do we grow 10x from here?"" 
The last 2 months have been really fun to invent that 10x Moderna. The team is highly energized by it and so am I. We have the opportunity to become one of the most impactful biopharmaceutical company over the next 10 to 20 years in the world. The potential to maximize that impact on patients is what motivates us. 
The team and I look forward to welcoming you to our regular investor events. We will host our Vaccine Day on April 14. We will host our annual Science Day on May 27. And we will host our annual R&D Day on September 9. 
More than ever, we have a unique opportunity to have a very large impact on so many lives. This is humbling to all of us and also highly motivating to always challenge ourselves to build the best version of Moderna that we can. I would like to thank our Moderna team, our partners, our many suppliers around the world, our clinical investigators, our participants in our clinical studies. I would also like to thank our investors for your trust as we embark in this new version of Moderna.

And so I think we're quite optimistic that a substantially lower dose is necessary because the immune system has already been primed and boosted once. And this is just maturing and updating that immune response to new variant. 
And I'll note that we've shared our Phase II data, which does show that we see at 50 micrograms, even in a primary series, really good neutralizing antibodies. And so I think we're quite optimistic that 50 micrograms or lower will suffice as the third dose booster."

I, believe we had already a vaccine that was published a while ago that showed that if you come in months later, you can come in with a much lower dose and that is sufficient to provide a boost. So in the context of wanting to maximize the ability to provide a benefit from whatever given capacity, I think that strategy makes sense. On top of which, as Stephen alluded to, it could be that even 50 micrograms as a priming series could suffice. Recall that our dose at 100 supersedes what you see with natural infection in terms of neutralizing antibodies to begin with."

On the second question, Matthew, as you know, we have been cautious about talking about supply for the year, and we have raised the number as we have understood better the learning curve of the process, as we've had the lots made and being able to see the demonstrated output. I think it's important to always appreciate this is a new [ technology ] we have never made and nobody in the world has made at that scale so fast. 
And so it's important for people to understand, we invested and built the manufacturing capacity, the ability to make 1 billion dose. The piece, having worked myself in manufacturing at commercial scale, and of course, you know Juan Andres, who runs manufacturing -- used to run manufacturing for Novartis worldwide, there are so many unknown at this stage that as we learn more, we are upgrading our numbers. As you know, last year, early in the process, we said we feel comfortable we'll get at least 500 million dose of the 1 billion of infrastructure capacity. 
Then we raised it to 600. With what we have seen out of the U.S. supply chain, the -- as you know, Europe is around 3 months behind the U.S. because of when we started building it. We did not have a Norwood-like site in Europe, as you know. We feel good about what's happening in the U.S. The team are doing really a remarkable job. And so we feel comfortable today to up what we call our base case. We feel very comfortable that we will deliver 700 million doses. 
The team is working extremely hard to get to 1 billion dose. They know that every extra dose we can get out of Moderna supply chain will be used and will help protect people. So you have our full commitment to do everything we can to get as close as we can to 1 billion. But at this stage, what we're saying is we feel very comfortable we can deliver 700 million, base plan. And we are still working through the upside, and I will not bet against the Moderna team to be able to do better. But at this stage, 700 million is the base."

But if you look forward and say at some point in the future we're going to be perhaps in a regular boosting environment, what would be the ideal vaccine, it seems logical that a vaccine that provides the broadest immunity, so not just against ancestral strains or a boost against the new strains would perhaps be the best mode. And that's where I think the blended approach, so 1273.211 as we announced today might ultimately be the right long term product. But in the near term, we got to run the clinical experiments to get the answer."

And I wanted to answer your question about the correlate. I think that work continues. It's being primary led by NIH who have access to all our samples as well as the other BARDA funded trials.
The current assumption is that we should be able to move even without a correlate, and that is consistent with the recent FDA guidance on the development of a variant vaccine. I think if there does emerge a correlative protection, it will make everybody's life easier, especially those coming up in our footsteps in terms of licensing new vaccines. But I think also, for us, the ability to peg the dose level will be substantially made easier with that. So we continue to work towards that goal. We'll see in the coming months whether when one emerges."

We've already, I think, demonstrated that we can pretty quickly produce a new batch. And if you look back to when we announced that we started manufacturing, it might be even faster than last year. 
We do think the clinical program for testing this is pretty straightforward based on the recent FDA guidance and other public comments. It's likely to be in the hundreds of people and immunogenicity and safety as important endpoints there. But ultimately, that will be subject to discussions with the FDA. And so we think we could get to clinical data here relatively quickly. That will be able to demonstrate the potential for a booster vaccine to close a potential gap in immunity. 
As far as production, that will depend a lot on the demand picture and possibly that data. But as Stéphane noted, our manufacturing systems, really, we believe we could almost copy and paste the new information into those manufacturing systems and proceed very quickly to be updating our vaccine or produce a booster. 
Tal, do you want to take the second part of that?"

It only recognizes the protein that we teach the body to make. And so I believe that our vaccine platform is optimally suited to boost, irrespective of what primary series somebody got, whether it was a protein mRNA or, frankly, an adeno vector. 
I think the challenge with the adeno vector is for both the initial boost and certainly any work with variants down the road is going to be that the adeno vectors generate significant immunity against the other components of the adenovirus and thus, have the risk of limiting the ability to translate the transgene. And therefore, if you look at the boosting delta, that is how much additional antibody levels do you get from a boost, with adeno vectors, you can get a boost, but the magnitude of that boost is invariably less than the magnitude of the boost you get with an mRNA platform. And that is true just in the first boost. I suspect that if you needed to come with a third dose or a fourth dose or variant-specific vaccines, it would be challenging to get the requisite amount of specific immune recognition towards the new transgene."

So in terms of the mRNA-1283, it is correct. It is -- the fact that it is a shorter mRNA does help with the long term stability and does facilitate, we think, moving that into a refrigerated vaccine. It's not the only feature. As you'll know, we've had advantages on our mRNA platform based on our long history of working in it, for instance, that we're functioning right now already, as has been noted, in a normal freezer for up to 6 months and actually already doing 30 days with mRNA-1273 in a refrigerator post stalling. And so it's a benefit that we're already well on that path, even with just 1273.

And then my second question is from a modeling standpoint. Should we be assuming anything in the model above and beyond what was talked about today that could be owed to the U.S. government for the initial co-development of your COVID vaccine? Or is that what David was referring to with the royalties that are included as part of your cost of sales? And if so, should we just be assuming a generally stable rate going forward? Are those changed at all?"

Let me start maybe on pricing. So it's quite interesting because, as you know, this is public information, there are some vaccines that have been made available to governments at $3 per dose.

So it's quite interesting because, as you know, this is public information, there are some vaccines that have been made available to governments at $3 per dose. And as you know, we walked you through our pricing strategy back, I think, in August, on the Q2 call. The Moderna vaccine is priced much higher. 
And I think it comes down to a few things. And the most important one is efficacy. Governments care about saving lives. Governments care about getting the economies back on their feet. And so what we're hearing from governments, literally almost on a daily basis as we engage with our existing government contracts versus new ones that are calling us, is there starts to be very clear differentiations between the different products that are either available already or that are getting very close to authorization. 
And I wish, if I had a crystal ball last year, that we would have built more manufacturing capacity for '21. But I did not anticipate and I don't think anybody did that there will be such difference of efficacy between vaccine, that the mRNA vaccine will be such high performance. As you know, some countries decided to invest first to procure vaccine in adeno or protein technology because they were better understood. And as we know what happened in 2020 in terms of the clinical data, that has played a big role. 
So it's quite interesting that -- also seeing how people are reacting in the countries. If you follow the media, for example, in Europe, where several vaccines have been authorized. As you know, in U.S., we have as of today, I'm hopeful this will change soon with VRBPAC meeting tomorrow, but only to mRNA vaccine authorized in the U.S. 
But if you look at what's happening in some countries in Europe, also what's happening in different countries around the world, I think governments, because of essence, advisers and clinical advisers and because of really the aim to reduce the pressure on the health care system, in the hospitals. 
Also what is quite fascinating, and I'm sure you're all observing it, is that, at least the first time I've seen in my career, being 20 years in this business, that in the media every day, you hear about vaccines on TV, in the newspaper, online. And you have the product efficacy that are all over the news every day. This has never happened to my knowledge for any of our products. 
And so you have this very interesting phenomenon that's happening too, that you have the clinicians, the nurses, the pharmacists, but the consumers too, that are believing that those products are not all the same. And this, I think will be a very important differentiation as we move into '22, as we move more to a traditional commercial market, where it's not governments buying directly, but the traditional kind of retail channel. And the impact, I think, of the consumers' desire to ask for a product when he or she walks into a pharmacy or their GP's office will be quite significantly different from what we are used to with other products."

So in terms of the flexibility, as I described in my remarks, the only raw material that is different from let's say mRNA-1273 to mRNA-1273.351 is only the plasmid. The enzymes are the same, the lipid is the same, with the same equipment in the same rooms with the same people. So the flexibility of this technology is really incredible for people that have worked with recombinant, like I used to do at Lilly. And as you know, I trained as a biochemical engineer, doing neutrophil and E. coli production in bioreactors. It is literally, you come a week after we use disposable reactors, you get new consumable plastic bags and so on as your reactor. And here you go again, you just need to change -- take a different plasmid. Because we use disposable reactors and not stainless steel reactors you don't have to spend a lot of time doing cleaning, validation because we basically dispose of things. 
And so the flexibility is quite incredible. You just need a new plasmid. And so because -- so it's not a very expensive part of the cost of the total cost of the finished product that is filled in a vial, because you have to make the mRNA, you have to formulate it and you have to fill it in a vial, our doing a lot of plasmid at risk for variant is a great optionality for the company with very, very [ good ] payment. 
So that's a piece that I think makes this technology very unique and ready to scale and be able to be flexible to respond to different demand. Is there a world where we potentially might end up with a different combination of mutant boost on the road in different continents? Maybe. I don't know, again, it will be market-driven. But if it is what the market requires, we can accommodate that in a way that is totally atypical to what the industry could do and at the speed, which is, I think will surprise many. Because again, we make these other products in the same reactors. 
In terms of taking down the manufacturing capacity if we don't need, let's say, in '23 or '24, the same amount of volume because of a mass of boosting, as we say, it's actually interesting because, as you know, we have now good plants where we have quite a lot of capacity. But also, we have some capacity at Lonza, in New Hampshire and also capacity in Switzerland, where they have there several lines of manufacturing. So we have actually quite a lot of flexibility to take capacity down at Lonza, either in the U.S. and/or in Europe at different time points. So that's one point. 
The other piece we should not forget is the pipeline. And I will just make 2 comments, which I think are very important to understand why actually us building manufacturing to that scale is going to be so enabling to Moderna to keep growing and growing and growing. 
First is the other vaccines. CMV is ready to move into Phase III, as we said this year. We will give you updates on the flu program, but I will remind everybody that there is an approvable endpoint with the regulator for seasonal flu vaccines. And so we anticipate that the development of the flu program will be pretty quick. 
And as we discussed on previous calls, one of our kind of optimal target product profile for down the road will be a product that is both seasonal flu, with the current strain of flu, but also a boost for COVID-19 with the relevant strain at that time in the same dose. So we anticipate we should have high efficacy for flu as much as mRNA virus. It's a pretty straightforward virus like the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
And so that is where we are going. We have more vaccines coming to the market. And then there's also our therapeutic pipeline. And the piece, I think, that is actually quite good for us that we started with vaccine, the scale-up, is I go back to mass, which is if you think about some of our products, as you know 1273 requires 100-microgram per human per dose. But if you look at the chikungunya antibody program, that use the IV-formulated mRNA that we use also in the rare disease program, for example, what we showed is very good data at 0.1 milligram per kilo. So in a 70-kilo adult, it is 7 milligram compared to 100 micrograms. 
So as we move the therapeutic pipeline further into development, but especially to commercial, we're going to need much more mass of mRNA. And so I actually -- I'm spending a lot of time thinking, one, how do we keep adding capacity to manage the entire pipeline as it's progressing. We have the flexibility with Lonza, that's why we did it this way with Juan, so we are ready to take it -- take chunks down if we need to. But if I was a betting man, I would bet with you that we're going to be more adding than taking capacity down because of the probability of technical success. As I've said all along, I believe we will launch the CMV vaccine, given the data we have, the medical need and the biology we're able to do with both the pentamer and GB. And so I'm more spending time wanting to think about how do we do more."

So as we've said all along, which is why we gave a range and not one number for expected supply in the year, I think one number is a very dangerous strategy. As we said, those type of consumables are, of course, important. We are in a regulated business, and we cannot start to make a product until we have all the components, all the raw material, the entire train team and so on and so forth. So we have a lot of -- like in an airplane, you have to check a lot of things before you can start the engine. Well, in GMP manufacturing, you have to do the same to ensure the quality and the safety of the product.
And so, well, I think the team has done a very good job last year. And as you recall, we started racing against this virus in very early January. And it's in the late January time frame that we started to say, geez, this could turn into a pandemic. And we started to think bigger. And so, one, the team and I spent quite a lot of time as we were starting to think about, okay, how do we go -- if we had to make 1 billion dose in '21, how would we do that? I used to run the supply chain at Lilly globally. And we went right away to start to talk to our suppliers. 
And one other thing we had to do, and if you recall, we did an important capital raise in May of last year, which was very important for getting us to where we are today, in some suppliers. Because the increase of mass of product we're ordering from them was so gigantic, a thousand times more, even 2,000 times more than the year before. 
As you can imagine, many of them looked at us a bit funny and were very worried. They were worried that if the drug would fail, they might be in trouble, because they will have to get this type of increase of capacity to sometime, buy new equipment, hire more people, buy their own raw materials to make our raw materials for our product, if that makes sense. 
And so sometimes what we have to do with the team is actually to pay upfront the entire purchase of product so that they will go and take that cash and start to invest to prepare for scale up. So we took a lot of business risk last year that we thought were necessary to ensure we could deliver this year on the output from the manufacturing supply chain. 
So I think we're in a good place. Do we have from time to time, one component that give us a sleepless night because it's very tight? It's happening because the ramp-up the industry is doing is unprecedented. But so far, so good, and we are extremely on top of it, including as we do things like increasing capacity that we announced last night to right away, not only buy new machine, but right away, place new orders for raw materials and make sure we keep increasing our safety stock so that we run this more and more as a regular business where you have safety stock on site. So if your supplier has a bump in a road, a pump breaking or something else, that we are able to manage that variability, which is normally manufacturing without impacting our ability to maximize our own output."

So we tend to be cautious, because as a new company we want to make sure that we build credibility and credibility in life has to be earned. And so I will just make the analogy to manufacturing in the sense, we built 1 billion of capacity, and we are very upfront to the financial community about it last year when we did so. But we said, look, given the unknown on raw material supply, given the unknown on yield, we feel comfortable we should get at least 500 million dose out. And then as we learned more, we moved to 600. And as we learned more, we moved it yesterday to 700 million. 
So do I believe it is possible as we're going to sell more than 5 billion of CMV? Yes, I believe it's possible because it's an incredible unmet medical need. As the world develops, I think the piece one has to be careful about peak sales is peak sales when peak sales slightly up [indiscernible] peak sales 25 years after launch because those vaccines are like annuity-like products. There's, of course, inflation. There's, of course, developing countries that are becoming richer and richer. So is there upside to the number? I believe there's upside to the number. But that's our number right now as a company."

A quick and sort of boring financial question. As we -- as you guys are pretty clearly going to transition to profitability, cash flow positivity on a -- at least in the near term, very durable basis, when would you consider changing your current treatment of your NOL allowances? How would that -- how would you communicate that? How would that flow through how you communicate your financials from a modeling perspective? 
And then secondarily, and maybe scientifically, more interestingly, how do you interpret the data suggesting that at least for the adenoviral approach from J&J, but also from your own data and the other mRNA vaccine, that titers appear to improve over time and cellular immunity improves over time and the gap in efficacy against the so-called South African variance and the ancestral Wuhan variant seems to close. That would suggest to me, the 1273 should have similar efficacy versus the South African and the Wuhan variance. Am I interpreting it the same way you are? Or am I missing something?"

On the tax rate, as I said, what happens is we're carrying this net operating loss with a full valuation reserve right now against the deferred tax asset that comes with it. So that will, of course, get released as we start generating pretax income. And it's likely based on the current book of business that we would consume during the year the entire loss carryforward. So that's point one. 
Point two is from an accounting perspective, what happens is you basically project the full year tax rate, including the consumption of that deferred tax asset. And then you start accounting quarter-by-quarter based on that average of the full year rate. So it actually, from an accounting perspective, doesn't matter, the timing of the release of the NOL, the deferred tax asset and the valuation reserve. So that's why I tried to be clear with the mid-teen percentage, including in Q1, because from an accounting perspective, it will -- it would be stable unless we have some other changes that caused the full year rate to change as we move forward. Hopefully, that's clear."

I think we're -- as you noted, I mean, we had nearly or essentially 100% of efficacy against severe disease, 94% against moderate or any disease. And I think that gives us great optimism about the current 1273 vaccine that's been authorized is protecting and even if the new strains are slightly more virulent, that we'll be in good shape. 
I think the question, though, is at some point, you would expect coronavirus immunity to wane. And that's because in all of the human circulating coronaviruses, that's what happens. The durability here has always been a question. Is it 1 year? Is it 3 years? Is it 5 years? I think as you see new strains emerge, like the potentially concerning strains that we've been talking about, particularly in the Republic of South Africa and Brazil, you have to ask the question, is that -- what does that look like not just now, but what does that look like 6 months from now, 1 year from now, as we start to move into a mode where we're going to see seasonal epidemics of coronaviruses, which we already see for the other coronaviruses, and you would have to assume will happen with SARS-CoV-2. 
And it's for that -- it's those gaps in immunity that I think we're particularly focused on right now, which is, to what extent do you -- to what extent in the future do at-risk populations emerge with increased risk against these new strains? It's not something you can see in the data in the first 30, 60, 90 days post vaccination in the current clinical trials. But it's something that you -- we did talk a lot about last year, and I think it's going to continue to be something we have to track closely as we look ahead."

I mean, look, I think we will obviously update data on durability of responses across our Phase I, Phase II, Phase III trials as that comes out. And looking forward, it's prudent. And if we can, we will be providing updates as well against the new strains. 
I think what we're saying about the variants and strategies against it is -- I think none of us want to be in a situation where we wait until there are reinfections and increased morbidity and, God forbid, more mortality in a seasonal epidemic, for instance, this winter in the Northern Hemisphere, this coming winter. And then say, okay, now it's time to be boosting people. 
And so as we're continuing to face an evolving virus that is changing its stripes and perhaps decreasing the durability of our immunity, we're trying to be very proactive with the 3 strategies we described. And I think we'll continue to follow things like the data that you pointed to, which is how are we doing in terms of immunity and blood of people who've previously been vaccinated or previously infected. We'll obviously closely be following reinfections. And then I think we all have to be following very closely what's happening in the southern hemisphere, because as they move into their winter and a potential seasonal spike in the winter as you normally see in temperate climates, it will help us understand to what extent are we still in a -- we have to stay ahead in the concerning phase of this epidemic or pandemic or is it a place where we start to get more and more confident that the vaccines have the virus under control."

We'll start by a quick business review of the quarter before Corinne walk you through commercial update. David will then walk you through the key financials. Stephen will provide a clinical update, especially new human data about 2 of our COVID-19 booster candidates, mRNA-1273, the currently authorized vaccine; and mRNA-1273.351, the variant specific booster to B.1.351 first identified in South Africa. I will then come back to close. 
The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is now available and protecting people in 37 countries around the world. And with the WHO authorization last Friday night, the number of countries where our vaccine will be available, will go up significantly. 
In the first quarter alone, 102 million doses have been shipped and many tens of millions of people have been fully vaccinated or received their first dose. 
12 months ago, in Q1 2020, Moderna had never ran a Phase III clinical study, never gotten a product authorized by a regulator and never made $100 million in a single quarter. Not even 10 million, not even 1 million doses. I am very proud of what the Moderna team has achieved, but most importantly, I am very thankful for their impact on the world and the incredible personal sacrifices that our team has made towards protect fellow human beings around the world. This is very humbling, and I'm fortunate to lead Moderna in this moment. 
I'm also thankful for Moderna scientists, engineers, doctors and team members who have worked relentlessly over the last 10 years now to be ready for when the virus emerged in late 2019. We invented technology to produce sales, well-tolerated mRNA vaccines, which made it possible for us to chase ours. 
At the end of 2021, we had cash and cash investments of $8.2 billion. David will give you more details in a few minutes. 
We increased our 2021 supply forecast once again. We now believe that we should be able to supply 800 million doses in 2021, and [ roughly ] for 1 billion doses over the year. The total advanced purchase agreement signed for delivery in 2021 have been increased to $19.2 billion. 
We are happy to report this morning an interim update to our TeenCOVE study. The initial interim analysis of our Phase II/III TeenCOVE study of mRNA-1273 showed vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 over 96% and mRNA-1273 was generally well tolerated with no serious safety concern identified to date. 
We're also on track to start this month the filing of our rolling BLA to FDA for COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273. 
As of [indiscernible], we added another first as a company. And that is the dosing our first patient with an mRNA therapeutic candidates against a rare genetic disease, propionic acidemia. a genetic deficiency in the liver with our candidate mRNA-3927. 
One of the things that I'm most excited about is where we are going. The Q1 results highlighted above are the consequence of last year work and decisions we made. So as I look to where Moderna going, I get very excited by the level of our increased investments across the board. Using our strong balance sheet to invest to scale Moderna. Just 2 numbers of some color. In Q1 2021, our investments were approximately 4x higher than the R&D investments in Q1 of last year. Not 4%, not 40%, 4x higher. 
For all of you who have known us for many years. Modena has been built as a digital enterprise since the early days. But we now have the opportunity to do much more and to build new functions like clinical trial operations, pharmacovigilance, commercial, digitally from the get go. So looking at the next 5 to 10 years, we're investing intensively in digital, automation and AI. Our plan for 2021 is to invest 3x more in digital than in fiscal year 2020. 
We announced last week that we have decided to invest to increase our 2020 supply to up to 3 billion doses. Let me share with you why we decided to recommend to our Board to invest at that scale. 
First, let's talk about the science of SARS-CoV-2 virus. New variants of concern continue to emerge around. And we believe that over the next 6 months as the Southern Hemisphere enter its foreign winter, we could see more variants of concern emerge. We have said for right now that we believe booster shots will be needed as we believe that the virus is not going away. We also believe from a scientific standpoint, that the highest efficacy booster over time will be provided by multivalent specific booster. 
Second, the market has changed quite a lot versus what we knew 6 months ago. First, mRNA vaccines have emerged as the best-in-class vaccines, high efficacy, good tolerability profile, habit to scale manufacturing and speed to chase variants in the clinic. 
Many companies are still in the clinic with their first-generation vaccine, where we're in a clinic with variant specific boosters. 
More importantly, as we are looking to go net around the world in the West and in the East, in the North and in the South, we are hearing loud and clear from the market, supply us with more mRNA vaccine for primary series and supply more vaccine in the future for boosters for 2022 and 2023. 
There is a big shift versus what the market perceived 6 or 9 or 12 months ago, when protein vaccine or adeno vaccines were thought to be the answer to the pandemic. We believe it has become an mRNA market for COVID-19 vaccine. 
Third is our pipeline. We believe we will bring to market several more products in the next few years that will add to the market demand for COVID-19 boosters for years through vaccine as we discussed at the Vaccine Day. And our goal is to have a seasonal flu vaccine combined with COVID variant booster in a single-dose product. 
We'll start strong clinical data for RSV vaccine and CMV vaccine. Plus we have 7 programs in clinical studies in 3 therapeutics area and more programs to move from preclinical development to clinical studies in a month to come. 
So we decided to build capacity to deliver up to $3 billion of supply in 2022 to open North and the South. We are doubling our drug substance supply in Europe and increasing by 50% of drug substance supply in the U.S. We are, of course, adding filling capacity in the U.S. and Europe at our existing partners, but also adding new ones as we speak, more to come. 
Another feedback we're hearing from the market is that Moderna has a best-in-class mRNA vaccine. Shipment of minus 20 Celsius in storage, not minus 70 celsius. Small cartons of 100 doses, storage up to 6 months in standard freezer and 4 weeks in regular temperatures. 
The only authorized mRNA vaccine that does not require on-site dilution. We believe this is an even more important feature today, but it will be more in the future in '21 and '22 and '23 as we move to a booster market decentralized in pharmacies and in a doctor's office. 
We believe we have the best mRNA vaccine, and we continue to improve our product continue to or the best-in-class product of the mRNA market. 
We were delighted to announce this morning the start of dosing of our first patient in our Phase I/II study with propionic acidemia disease. The study is called Paramount. It is yet another milestone for Moderna. Not only do we have, I believe, the most innovative infectious vaccine clinical pipeline, but we also have therapeutic candidates in clinical studies in oncology, in cardiology and now, in rare disease. 
Let me close my remarks on this familiar slide. We now have 1,500 employees. We have recently incorporated Modern Japan. And we'll continue to build our commercial network. We will push to Asia Pacific in 2021. 
And given our strong balance sheet of $8.2 billion, we're going to continue to accelerate and invest to scale and maximize the impact of our broad mRNA platform to help as many people as we can. 
Let me share our perspective on yesterday afternoon announcement by the United States Trade Ambassador that the U.S. government will support waving intellectual property protection for COVID-19 vaccines. We believe this will not help supply more mRNA vaccines to the world any faster in 2021 or in 2022, which is the most critical time of the pandemic. There is no [ ideal ] mRNA manufacturing capacity in the world. There is no industry of talent individuals who are skilled in the art of making high-quality and high-purity GMP-grade mRNA vaccines. There are no companies who have developed manufacturing processes, clarification processes and medical processes that would allow them to quickly run a clinical. And if approved by regulators around the world then provide hundreds of millions or billions of supply of mRNA vaccine. 
We have announced in the company's statement issued October 8, 2020 that during the pandemic, Modena will not enforce COVID-19-related patents. You can find that statement on our website. We believe that the best way to end the pandemic is what we are currently doing. First, to maximize supply in 2021 to protect as many people as we can. Second, to build additional capacity, which we have announced last week to get up to $3 billion of authorized mRNA vaccines for 2022, 2023 and beyond. And third, to continue to adapt the vaccine to have a highest efficacy vaccine with variant specific poster for which we announced very encouraging clinical results yesterday. 
Let me now turn to Corinne to give you a commercial update. Corinne?"

And on the back of it, we have turned into a commercial company very quickly. So today, I'm delighted to give you an update on the commercial progress in the first quarter. 
I will start with our most recently signed supply agreements, those that occurred in the first quarter and at the beginning of the second quarter this year. I am particularly happy to announce our agreement with COVAX, which will provide access to our vaccine to millions of people in low- and middle-income countries and is in keeping with our global access principles. 
In total, our COVAX agreement is for 500 million doses for delivery in the 2021 and 2022 period. Specifically, in 2021, Modena will begin delivery of 34 million doses in the fourth quarter of 2021. COVAX will have an option for an additional 466 million doses in 2022. We are grateful to all the collaborative efforts of [ SEPI ], [ Gavi ], UNICEF the World Health Organization and the Moderna commercial teams in making this important supply agreement a reality. 
Moving now to the additional supply agreements signed for both 2021 and '22. We have signed additional supply agreements with Israel for 5.3 million doses in 2022 with an additional option of 17.3 million doses for '22 and '23. And with Switzerland for 7 million doses in 2022 and options for an additional 7 million in late 2022 and '23. 
We have also signed new deals for '21 delivery with Botswana, Brunei. And in addition, we have also signed an agreement with Zurich Pharma, our distribution partner,in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. 
In total, we announced advanced purchase agreements totaling 845 million to be delivered in 2021 to the countries that are listed here on the slide. And we continue to have discussions with countries, those we have already contracted with and new countries for supply in 2022 and beyond. 
In our discussions, as Stéphane said, we are hearing consistently from governments that in their view, there is no other technology that provides the high efficacy of mRNA vaccines and the speed necessary to adapt to variance. while at the same time, allowing reliable scalability of manufacturing. We are grateful for the trust placed in us from the various governments we have signed agreements with, and we look forward to supplying the vaccine to other countries and helping end pandemic and getting ahead of variance. 
Let me now turn to product sales. Our first -- our product sales for the first quarter of this year were $1.73 billion and were recorded for the delivery of 102 million doses. Product sales in the U.S. were approximately $1.4 billion and sales outside of the U.S. to the EU, Canada, Switzerland, Israel and Singapore were approximately $400 million for the 14 million doses delivered in the first quarter. 
In the U.S., we have successfully completed the delivery of the first 100 million doses to the U.S. government within 100 days of emergency use authorization. And we expect to complete the delivery of the second 100 million doses to the United States government before the end of the second quarter. 
As you know, the U.S. production started earlier and is roughly 1 quarter ahead in production ramp. As such, in the second quarter of '21, we expect the ex-U.S. ramp to be similar to that of the U.S. ramp in the first quarter. 
To close, I want to reiterate that as we continue to produce and roll out vaccines into the global market, we are humbled and proud to be part of the solution. 
I will now turn the call over to David Meline."

In some cases, we also provide additional detail to provide greater clarity on underlying trends. With this background, we are providing an analysis of actual 2021 first quarter results, along with an updated view of key drivers of financial performance going forward. 
Turning to Slide 18. Total revenue was $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $8 million in Q1 of last year. Following our first-ever product sales of $200 million in December 2020, we recorded product sales of $1.7 billion for our COVID-19 vaccine in the first quarter of 2021. 
Grant and collaboration revenue increased to $204 million in Q1, primarily due to increases in grant revenue from BARDA to accelerate development of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
Cost of sales were $193 million in the first quarter, benefiting substantially from previously expensed pre-commercial inventory costs, which I will discuss in more detail on a later slide. 
Research and development expenses were $401 million for Q1 2021 compared to $115 million for the same period in 2020. The higher spend was driven by increased COVID-19 vaccine clinical development activities, including our announced efforts around booster, variant specific and multivalent vaccine candidates. Headcount increases as well as pharmacovigilance activities related to our COVID-19 vaccine also contributed to the year-on-year expense increase. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $77 million for Q1 2021 compared to $24 million for the same period in the prior year. The growth in spending was driven by increases in personnel, outside services and costs associated with commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally. 
Our provision for income taxes was $39 million in Q1 2021, reflecting a benefit from the utilization of our net operating loss carryforward as well as discrete items. I will provide further context on the following slides. 
We recorded net income of $1.2 billion for Q1 of this year compared to a net loss of $124 million in the same period of last year. Earnings per share on a diluted basis was $2.84. Please note that our share count on a diluted basis now also includes the effect of outstanding options and RSUs as we began to be profitable. Previously, when we were in a net loss position, basic and reported diluted number of shares were the same. 
Turning to cash and selected cash flow information on Slide 19. We ended Q1 2021 with cash and investments of $8.2 billion compared to $5.2 billion at the end of Q4 2020. The increase is driven by our commercial sales and additional customer deposits received in the first quarter for future purchases of our COVID-19 vaccine. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.97 billion in Q1 of this year compared to net cash used in operating activities of $106 million in Q1 of last year. The reversal from net operating cash outflow to cash inflow was driven by our commercial market entry for the entire quarter. 
Similar to last quarter, before providing an updated financial framework for the remainder of 2021, let me summarize a few areas from our Q1 results that are important to keep in mind when modeling expected 2021 financial performance. 
Starting with product sales on Slide 20. We started last year to build 2 distinct supply chains, 1 in the U.S. and 1 outside the East for rest of world markets. Our supply chain scale up in the U.S. was roughly 1 quarter in advance of our ex U.S. supply chain, which is reflected in the geographic sales mix in Q1. As we move forward in Q2, the ex U.S. supply chain is also ramping up toward full capability. 
Turning to Slide 21. Cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, logistics and warehousing costs as well as third-party royalty costs. We began capitalizing our COVID-19 vaccine inventory costs in December of 2020, following the COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorization based upon our expectation that these inventory costs would be recoverable through commercialization of the vaccine. Prior to the authorization of our COVID-19 vaccine, inventory costs were recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred. We expensed $242 million of prelaunch inventory costs in 2020 and started 2021 with the remaining balance of $187 million of 0 cost inventory. Almost the entire balance, or $184 million was sold and benefited our cost of sales in Q1 of this year, and hence, will not further impact future quarters in a material way. If inventory sold during the first quarter was valued at actual cost, our cost of sales would have been $377 million or 22% of our product sales somewhat favorable to what we expected, driven by favorable yields in our U.S. production facilities. 
Now turning to our cash and investment position on Slide 22. The cash and investment balance reported as of March 31 was $8.2 billion, up from $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. And The increase is primarily driven by the net increase in customer deposits for future product supply of COVID-19 vaccine. The net balance of cash customer deposits increased from $2.8 million at the end of December 2020 to $5.6 billion at the end of Q1 '21. 
Lastly, let me comment on tax-related items on Slide 23. We The significant investments in our research, development and start-up activities to develop the mRNA platform over the last decade have resulted in net operating loss carryforwards, with a balance of $2.3 billion at the end of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets related to these loss carryforwards. We performed a valuation allowance assessment during each reporting period based on the latest available financial information and outlook. After considering the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, we concluded that as of March 31, it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize the substantial majority of its net deferred tax assets. This analysis included not only our strong first quarter results, but also our April activity. The majority of the valuation allowance will flow through the P&L over the course of 2021 and in our effective tax rate prorated based on the cadence of our expected pretax quarterly earnings. 
We also recorded 2 discrete benefits in our tax provision in Q1, which lowered our first quarter tax rate. The first benefit related to the valuation allowance release for the portion of deferred tax assets, which we expect to utilize in future years. 
The second related to the excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. 
Turning now to the 2021 updated financial framework on Slide 24. Signed advanced purchase agreements for expected delivery in 2021 reflect a current full year total of $19.2 billion in anticipated product sales including doses that have been delivered and recognized revenue in Q1. 
Based on continuous progress to ramp up available supply capacity in our network, we have raised the lower end of our global manufacturing plan for 2021 from 700 million to 800 million doses at the 100-microgram dose level. Our manufacturing team and our partners are still working to supply up to 1 billion doses for 2021.
Further, we continue to expect a range of deliveries in Q2 2021 of 200 million to 250 million doses. 
Our total cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing, logistics and warehousing and third-party royalties. For 2021, we continue to model average total cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be approximately 20% for the full year with some variation quarter-by-quarter largely driven by average selling price going forward. 
Now let me comment on planned R&D and SG&A expenses. Q1 expenses of approximately $0.5 billion were stable compared to the underlying Q4 2020 expense run rate on a like-for-like basis. 
In Q1, our actual expenses were lower than the internal forecast primarily driven by the timing of clinical development and commercial activities and related costs. We now expect a notable expense trend increase starting in Q2 on a quarter-over-quarter basis for the remainder of this year. 
Based on better visibility of the utilization of our accumulated net operating loss carryforward, expected global sales mix and the mentioned discrete benefits in Q1, we now expect our all-in 2020 tax rate to be in low teens. This compares to our previous forecast in the mid-teen range. This forecast is based on current U.S. tax policy in effect and does not include any future potential discrete benefits related to stock-based compensation. We will update this view as our business evolves further. 
Finally, regarding capital investments, we are raising our forecast for capital investment from our previous range of $350 million to $400 million for 2021 to $450 million to $550 million, including the planned capacity expansion investments as announced on April 29. 
This concludes my remarks concerning financial performance, and I now turn the call over to Stephen."

I'll begin with an overview of our COVID-19 strategy against variance of concern and the initial data from our Phase II booster vaccine study before ending with a summary of the rest of our pipeline. And before I go into the data, a remi",1106,"Thank you, David. I'll begin with an overview of our COVID-19 strategy against variance of concern and the initial data from our Phase II booster vaccine study before ending with a summary of the rest of our pipeline. And before I go into the data, a reminder that our booster strategy is evaluating single-dose booster vaccinations with 3 different mRNA vaccines: 50 micrograms of mRNA-1273; 50 micrograms of mRNA-1273.351, both of which have data available today and what I will discuss in just a moment; and a multivalent booster vaccine candidate, which combines a 50-50 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 in a single vaccine. 
In addition, we're also evaluating a lower 20-microgram dose of mRNA-1273.351. Data from the multivalent booster and the 20-microgram booster of 351 will be shared when available. 
And with that backdrop, let's move to the data. Starting with safety, local and systemic adverse events within 7 days after a booster dose of either -1273 or -1273.351 were generally comparable to those observed after the second dose of 1273 in our previously reported Phase II study and our Phase III COVE study. The majority of the events were mild or moderate in severity and grade 3 events occurred with the frequency of approximately 15% in participants who received -1273 and approximately 10% in participants who received -1273.51. The most commonly reported solicited local events were injection site pain and the most commonly reported systemic events were fatigue, headache, myalgia and [indiscernible]. There were no grade forward events reporting. 
On the next slide, are figures from 2 papers. The figure on the left-hand side were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and Show The difference in neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudo viruses in serum samples 1 week after vaccination with a primary series of mRNA-1273. Recall that there was a sixfold decrease in neutralization titers against the B.1.351 variant, the variant first identified in the Republic of South Africa; and a three-fold drop in titers against P1, the variant first described in Brazil. And again, as a reminder, these neutralizing titer levels were from serum samples 1 week after the second dose of the primary vaccine series of mRNA-1273. 
So essentially, these titers are close to peak levels. 
On the right-hand side of the slide is a figure from the preprint manuscript of our initial results from our Phase II study posted yesterday to Bio Archive. The figures show the neutralization titer levels of the participants in our Phase II Booster study immediately before their booster vaccinations. 
A reminder that these individuals were previously vaccinated with a primary series of mRNA-1273 in either our Phase II or Phase III studies, roughly 6 to 8 months prior to enrolling in this booster study. 
At this time point, titers against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 remained high with almost all participants having detectable titers. But titers against B.1.351 and P1, the variance of concern were much lower. In fact, approximately half of participants had titers below the assays limit of quantitation at this time point. 
So it is clear that waning of titers is apparent, both with time and that lower titers against variance of concern lead to more rapid loss of neutralizing activity. 
Turning to the next slide. The data shows that 2 weeks after booster vaccines of either mRNA-1273 or -1273.351 neutralizing tighter levels increased against both the wild-type virus as well as the B.1.351 and P1 variance of concern. In fact, following boost, geometric mean titers against the 3 variants tested increased to levels similar to or higher than previously reported peak titers against the ancestral strain following primary vaccination. 
When looking specifically at the GMTs of the different strains, we achieved levels of 1,400 after booster vaccination with mRNA-1273.351 against the 351 variant. This compares against the GMT of 864 when boosting with mRNA-1273. 
Vaccination with mRNA-1273.351 was more effective at narrowing the gap in neutralizing titers between wild-type and B.1.351 viruses relative to boosting with mRNA-1273. 
Now we're encouraged by this initial data, and we're excited to see additional data over time from these arms as well as the data from the multivalent arm and the lower dose arm of mRNA-1273.351.
On the next slide, I would like to highlight 1 last comparison from the manuscript. On the left hand is a sample of participants from the Phase I study and they're neutralizing titers against ancestral strain following a primary vaccination series with mRNA-1273. GMT is achieved in this at approximately 1,500. On the right-hand side is a reproduction of the data we just spoke through, looking at neutralizing titers, and I'm specifically highlighting the neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant of concern. A booster dose of 50 micrograms of mRNA-1273, the top bar, was able to increase titers to a level of 864 in this type. That compares with a booster dose of 50 micrograms of 1273 351, which was able to get to titers against the variant of concern as high as 1,400 in the study. We'll continue to closely watch this data, and as I mentioned a moment ago, look forward to subsequent updates and time points. 
On Slide 31 is a snapshot of our vaccine development candidates that are in or entering the clinic. I'll highlight a few. Our CMV vaccine is on track to start a pivotal Phase III study in 2021. Our Zika vaccine is expected to begin a Phase II study also in 2021. Our hMPV/PIV3 respiratory combo vaccine is currently enrolling in toddlers. And at our Vaccines Day last month, we announced positive interim Phase I data from our RSV vaccine, mRNA-1345. This continues in pediatric and older adult cohorts of that Phase I study are still enrolling. 
Finally, within our flu vaccine program, we expect a Phase I study of mRNA-1010 to begin in 2021. 
Outside of vaccines, we have 7 clinical proof-of-concept trials ongoing across 4 modalities. Our VEGF program partnered with AstraZeneca is enrolling in a Phase II. Our personalized cancer vaccine program partnered with Merck is also enrolling in a Phase II trial. And KRAS, our second program partnered with Merck is ongoing in a Phase I study. 
Within intratumoral immuno-oncology, our Phase II dose expand in OX40 ligand, Phase I triplet and Phase I IL-2 study, which is partnered with AstraZeneca, are all still ongoing. 
Finally, as Stéphane mentioned, we are pleased to have started dosing in the Paramount study in propionic acidemia. 
On Slide 33, you can see our full development pipeline. In addition to our large portfolio of infectious disease vaccines, we now have 7 therapeutic programs in the clinic. 
I'll now turn the call over to Stéphane."

Our 2021 advanced purchase agreement signed have now been increased to $19.2 billion. As we look into 2022, we're investing to build $3 billion dose supply capacity because we believe the market need could be greater",1238,"Thank you, Stephen, Corinne and David. Our 2021 advanced purchase agreement signed have now been increased to $19.2 billion. As we look into 2022, we're investing to build $3 billion dose supply capacity because we believe the market need could be greater in 2022 than in 2021. 
First, we already have countries signing APAs for 2022 for additional series for children but also for are specific boosters. Israel last week and Switzerland this morning. 
If you recall, there were some of the first countries who signed APAs in 2020. And again, these countries are ahead of the game for 2022 and 2023. 
Second, with the COVAX partnership announced Monday, we anticipate to supply up to 466 million doses in 2022. 
Third, we're having active discussions with all the governments that have signed 2021 APAs with Moderna. For new APAs for 222 deliveries, again, prime series but also boosters. 
Fourth, we're having numerous discussions with government that do not have 2021 APAs with Moderna because we cannot supply them in 2021 fortunately. But many of these governments are already asking us to enter into 2022 APAs because they want high efficacy mRNA vaccines that are easy to store. This is why we decided to invest for more supply in 2022. We believe from our current deals and current discussions that the market wants more supply from us in 2022 than we can supply in 2021. 
As we look at the next 5 to 10 years, We have the most innovative vaccine pipeline in the industry. And we're investing more in research to increase our impact by bringing to the clinic more innovative axis against viruses that hurt humans. We are now in the clinic in 3 therapeutic areas: oncology, cardiology and rare disease and soon, we should be in the clinic in autoimmune disease as well. We are continuing to innovate and invest in science. like, for example, for delivering mRNA in the lung with our partner, Vertex. 
As we continue to procure model to scale and that 10x more impact, we're investing aggressively. We are accelerating our investments in digital, automation and AI. 
From a spend of $27 million in 2019, we invested around $60 million in 2020 in digital. We're planning to almost triple that $170 million in 2021. We're investing across the board in R&D to ensure high quality to accelerate the pace of learning and to ensure we can transform clinical operations. We're investing in digital to ensure high-quality, high scalability for manufacturing. We are building commercial so that we can commercialize our pipeline in a highly efficient and effective manner. We want to change the big pharma paradigm of large, inefficient and expensive sales force and advertising spend to promote [indiscernible] drugs. Our pipeline is first-in-class medicine that patients and doctors are waiting for. 
We want to enable our corporate functions, HR, legal, finance and so on to scale without creating large corporate organization. 
I'm also excited that we are launching an AI Academy. Today, we have some exciting pockets of excellence in AI across the company. But AI is not yet part of our DNA. The reason is simple, Most companies don't do AI. So as we grow and hire new talent, they have great skills in their part, but few have been exposed to AI in their previous company. We want AI to be how we run the business in science, in clinical development, in manufacturing quality in commercial, in finance everywhere. It is the same change management revolution as 20 to 30 years ago when personal computer build the workforce. We want everything at Moderna to understand and use AI in everything we do. AI will become part of our DNA. 
As many of you know, we have built integrated digital system connected to [indiscernible]. And as we have more systems, we get more data. As we get more data, we lean faster. And we keep building and creating in a cycle. Between our strong balance sheet for our RNA platform, our team, our culture and our digital infrastructure, I believe our scale Moderna is unique in the biopharmaceutical industry. 
As part of scaling Moderna, there is software, but also there is a hard way. Many of you were the opening of a Norwood manufacturing site in July 2018 or you came to visit after the opening. Our building is around 200,000 square feet. We call it Moderna Technology Center South or MTC South. In 2020, we added the building next to it and added around 245,000 square feet and called it MTC North. We are pleased to announce this week that we now have access to a new building, MTC East, which will start welcoming modern employees later this year after some maybe investment and renovation to the building. That is another 240,000 square feet. 
So we now have in MTC access to around 650,000 square feet. We now hold the building on this campus, and we can also add more buildings and build them now that we have the entire campus. 
We are deeply committed about building a company that has a strong sense of responsibility. We want Moderna to be a positive force in the world, not only for our medicines, but also by who we are as a company. 
We are very committed to belong, inclusion and diversity. We recently published or expanded the workforce diversity figures for the first time. Last year, we signed the CEO action for diversity and equation pledge. And we have also reiterated our ongoing commitment to increasing diversity in our clinical trials. 
We are deeply committed to the environment. We have decided to source the Cambridge site with renewable energy and will offset any energy that is not from renewable sources, and we will be working on our target as to when we should be a net 0 carbon company. 
We also encouraging our employees to have a positive impact on the communities in which we live and volunteer, from cleaning the South River in Cambridge, to feeding the homeless and stem education and much more. You can find a lot of resources online on our website. 
As I close, I want to convey how thankful we are at Modern to have a chance to do what we do. Every day, we come to work to make innovative medicine using the first information platform of a biopharmaceutical industry. My colleagues and I work and collaborate to make more medicines to protect or treat people. 
I am proud of what the team has done over the last 10 years to get us to this stage. Over the last 14 months since we started chasing SARS-CoV-2 virus. And in Q1, as we continue to execute relentlessly. 
But as I look at the future of Moderna, I believe we have a chance over the next 5, 10, 20 years to transform medicines potentially like no other company has ever changed medicine. This is just the beginning. 
Before taking your questions, I would like to remind you that we will be hosting our Annual Science Day in a few weeks on May 27. You are going to work to connect this event as Stephen and his team have some very cool new things to share with you. 
And later at the end of the summer, on September 9, our annual R&D Day for holistic clinical update.

Let me start with your first questions and then turn the peer question to Stephen. So on the IP, what does it mean? I believe it doesn't change anything for Moderna.

So on the IP, what does it mean? I believe it doesn't change anything for Moderna. As I said, we had said last October that we will not enforce our COVID-19 patents during the pandemic. And as I said in my remarks, there is no mRNA in manufacturing capacity in the world. This is a new technology. You cannot go hire people who know how to make the mRNA. Those people don't exist. And then even if all those things were available, whoever who wants to do mRNA vaccine will have to buy the machine, invent the manufacturing process, invest verification processes and ethical processes. And then they will have to go run a clinical trial, get the data, get the product approved and scale manufacturing. This does not happen ] in 6 or 12 or 18 months. We have been working at these for years. And as you know, there are some small mRNA companies that are still in the clinic trying to get the products to a finish line. And so we saw the news last night and [indiscernible] the news during the night. 
Our 2022 contract, the dynamic is, as I just described it, which is the market has tremendously changed Since the pandemic started last year before clinical data, many countries didn't want to move, especially because of mRNA being a new technology. They moved first on protein contracts, on adeno contracts. And then the kind of mRNA contracts came later, more just in case. And then the clinical data came along and the speed to get to approval. 
And so -- and then you have the fact that the proteins are still not authorized anywhere in the West. And then you had the low efficacy of the adenos and the safety questions around the adenos, manufacturing scale-up issues that adenos companies have had. And the big question that scientist advising governments have, which is boost adenos -- more adenos products because, by definition, you give again the same virus vector to somebody that we believe over time will get less and less response from it. 
So as we look at the marketplace, which what governments are doing, and given many governments, I think last year, believe the pandemic will be gone quickly. Trust me, every governments we're talking to believe this is going to stay for a long time. They have got massively educated by the scientists and the clinician, and they believe this virus is not going away. They believe boosting is going to be critical. They believe variant specific boosting is going to be the right way to do the science. And as you saw from Stephen's presentation, this is what the clinical data are showing as well. 
And so the dynamic is that current governments that have already contracted with us are calling for more, and we're in active discussion with all of them to supply more for '22 and '23, both prime series and specific variant booster. The beauty other technology is we can agree right now in contracts to give them next year to be able to choose what they want based on the clinical data. And that's an incredible competitive advantage. And this we can do because, as you know, the manufacturing process is the same for -1273 or -1273.351 or [indiscernible], the new variant. And we can change that on a very short notice because it's the same equipment in the same room with the same people with some raw materials. 
And then you have all those governments, which is almost more exciting to me that never called before -- that called before, but we couldn't supply them because we are in the unfortunate position, say, we're very sorry. We have no more supply for you in 2021, which, of course, very difficult discussions given the suffering happening around the world. But the great news with the investments we've announced to get up to 3 billion next year. We now can have those discussions with those governments. And Corinne and the team having a lot of discussions with them. So that kind of give you a sense for the dynamics. 
Stephen, on PA?"

So as you know, the program the Paramount study for propionic acidemia is going to be looking at biomarkers as a part of its dose optimization. And so it's possible that we'll be seeing very early indicators of impact there. But we are going to -- there's no guarantee that the first dose level and the first cohort that we're looking at will be the correct one. And we're going to make sure that we develop a cogent and consistent data set before we bring that forward. It is a dose optimization study, and we will perhaps be looking at multiple dose levels. So while I think it's possible that we would see data this year, it's dependent upon many things that are well beyond our control. 
Now you asked a more general question also about our broader portfolio. And if you look at the programs generally, VEGF, as we mentioned, is a Phase II program that's been enrolling for a while. It's possible we could see data from that. Our PCV and KRAS programs, again, as open-label programs will continue to track those closely as they enroll. And then similar to the intratumoral programs that we highlighted, many of them are ongoing and producing data. And of course, when we have a complete in cogent data set, we will bring it forward."

It is a shorter construct that we think could have a longer refer to instability profile. 
As we announced previously, we started enrolling in the Phase I in that study. And it's probably a little bit premature to comment on what we think the regulatory path will look like for that until we get some of that initial data and have conversations, obviously, with regulators. But I would highlight that it's possible that -1283 may not go into a full primary series vaccination study. It could impact in the future function as a booster. But again, that's probably too early to say. We will have to wait until we see that data and ultimately, it would be dependent upon conversations with regulators in the future. 
As it relates to PA enrollment, yes, as you mentioned, we've been working very hard on that over the coming -- over the past years, and we're quite pleased to have enrolled the first participant, the first patient in that study. And the team is working hard to enroll additional patients as quickly as possible. I think time will tell whether we've actually broken through here and addressed any of the issues that we previously had in terms of enrollment.

Look, I think we have to start by saying we don't know. We do not have data on when to expect waning immunity leading to breakthrough infections. But we do know that there is a raging pandemic that reinfections will happen",479,"Thank you for the question, Ted. Look, I think we have to start by saying we don't know. We do not have data on when to expect waning immunity leading to breakthrough infections. But we do know that there is a raging pandemic that reinfections will happen at some point. And the best way to ensure that we do not have renewed outbreaks in well vaccinated countries is to boost and maintain the highest possible levels of neutralizing immunity. We, as Moderna, also believe that, that means we want to maintain the broadest neutralizing immunity against the largest number of than circulating variance of concern. 
If you look at the data that we have posted today as well as some of our published data and others reports, it does feel like immunity to a primary vaccination series or a previous infection seems to weigh in over the 6- to 12-month time horizon, at least as measured by neutralizing titers. Again, we don't know whether that's a clinical correlate or not, but it certainly is an indication of that waning immunity. And if you look at the data that we -- that I presented earlier, approximately half of the participants in our booster studies no longer have detectable neutralizing immunity against the various concerned. They have neutralizing immunity against the ancestral strain that they were vaccinated against. So the logical thing we think to do is to boost their immunity against those variants of concern, if you will, vaccinate them against those to both increase those titers right now, but also give them a longer duration of protection, perhaps long enough, that we can see our way through the pandemic. That probably looks like boosting on a 9 to 12 months after primary series as an annual booster for now. At least while we're continuing to see the evolution of the virus. 
Now the last point was about our strategy more generally here. And we do believe that the virus is not going to follow 1 path of evolution, that we are going to see many variants of concern, that there may be divergent paths. And therefore, the best way to ensure that we can protect against the broadest number of variants of concern will be a multivalent vaccine. 
Now right now, we're still waiting to see our multivalent vaccine data, which is a combination, as you know, of industrial and 351 on the strain first identified in South Africa. But we think this is just the beginning, and we think we're going to be unfortunately continuing to fight this pandemic through 2022, at least globally. And therefore, we're committed as a company to make as many updates to the vaccine, to add as many variants as we think are necessary, to ensure that when people receive a booster, it provides the broadest immune protection against the widest range severance."

Going back to what I said is if somebody was to start from scratch because again there is no mRNA player that's with idle capacity out there.

And you cannot find that patent, which as you all know on the U.S., not in the website. And so one on to figure out what machine you need, how do you make mRNA, what purification method you need, what methods you need. And once you take out all those things, which trust me is going to take you time, it is not easy us and other companies that are in the market we are on a vaccine have been worn for decades. And even companies that have been working on it for 10 or 20 years are still in a clinic trying to figure out how to get to the finish line. And so I really believe that this is not the issue. I already believe the IP topic is mostly critically driven. This is not the issue. It might impact over technology that had a role and protein and this I could not comment on.

The preclinical data that we have published does -- or presented to dose suggest that, that is going to be the winning approach. And as I highlighted, as is highlighted by the monovalent clinical data we already have, there is a benefit to adding additional antigens and potentially, therefore, benefit with a multivalent approach. 
I think it's important to recognize that we view this as an ongoing battle. And so your question about when do we pull the trigger and move forward bivalent manufacturing. We're already on the path of doing that manufacturing, not because we think that we're done with mRNA-1273, the 211, the current bio vaccine, but because we think we're going to go down the path of multivalent vaccines and continue needing to add things. 
And so that platform capability, we are already in the process of building and establishing to support multiple updates to a multivalent vaccine. And we do think that's going to be required because we think the virus is not going to stand still and stop evolving, and we suspect there's going to be trivalent, maybe quadrivalent. It will keep happening In the time ahead. We have completed GMP manufacturing of all of those batches, and we're at sufficient scale, we think, to be able to quickly move into commercial scale distribution if needed. But at this point, we are still waiting for data to come shortly to confirm that performance in trial."

As you all know, we have a CMV vaccine on its way to Phase III, where we developed and that we find over the years, a very complex product, 6 mRNA in the same guidance. So if you think about what the multivalent vaccine for COVID is going to look like, it's not going to be easy. And so for people that have not done multivalent in GMP setting before, trust me, the regulators because we had this discussion with regulators around CME over years, They don't want to see a lot of analytical method characterization so that you can prove to them that you know what is in the pipe.

I'll -- maybe I'll take that question first and then hand it back to Stéphane on your IP question. So a couple of things I would note. The first is the level of titers, as you suggested, there's a little bit less than twofold difference between them, but you are seeing substantially higher titers in the order of 1,400 when you give the very specific booster, that's mRNA-1273.51. 
Now I would note that this is happening already at Day 15, right? This is an early time point that we're looking at, at this point. We will also be looking at Day 29. And in this case, we are -- effectively, it is a prime with the 1273.351, right? It is the first dose of the strain first identified in South Africa. And so it's actually -- there's 2 ways you could look at it. One is obviously that it is -- both look good. I think the other and the way that I'm still looking at this is it looks like we can very rapidly direct the immune response to an increased level of neutralizing titers against the variant of concern that was first identified in South Africa .351 in this case. 
And if you compare the titers that we've achieved even by day 15, between these 2 variants -- or between the industrial strain and the .351 stream, it's really only the .351 strain that's getting to the same level that we saw against the industrial strains in that last comparison. So to levels that are approximately similar amount. 
Now that's not to say that mRNA-1273 as a booster couldn't -- wouldn't provide a benefit, and I think you're highlighting that, Gena. There is evidence in this data as well that we can substantially increase neutralizing titers generally across the response with a booster dose of mRNA-1273, our authorized vaccine at 50 micrograms. And that is encouraging. That is good news because I think it suggests that is also a useful strategy. But if you had to choose between the 2, and you were primarily concerned about increasing immunity to a higher level so that it can last longer, particularly in patient populations at high risk of either waning immunity or incomplete immunity, we think this starts to provide very early on even at Day 15, even after a priming dose, that there's going to be an advantage to some strain matching of the antigen. And that's what has us continue to be excited about a multivalent strategy. Stéphane?"

So maybe I'll take the first 1 first, which is Our real-world evidence, the largest amount of it that we've seen has been published by groups like the CDC and continues to reinforce that the efficacy we saw in the clinical trial seems to be translating well into real-world use with very high efficacy against disease. against COVID-19. I think it's important to note, though, that this is all happening very acutely, right? We're still only months away into or months into these vaccination campaigns. And the primary concern that we and others have from a public health perspective is really not what's going to happen right after vaccination. But what does this look like in 9 months? What does this look like in 18 months? And I think the really difficult situation everybody is in is you could say, well, let's wait until it's a year from now, and we see a reemergence of spikes of cases We see -- maybe it's not as bad, but we see a very big and bad flu season in the winters, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of death, that kind of scale. That's not a situation that most are willing to take a risk on because it obviously could be substantially worse than that. And so we're probably not going to have a chance to wait for data for cases to really break through a year from after vaccination in the real-world setting and let that start to guide revaccination decisions. At that point, it's almost too late. And so I think at this level, we think for the very near term, the correct and sort of conservative decision is to continue to try and maintain the highest level of broadest immunity in the populations that are well vaccinated already. 
Now if you look beyond this sort of epidemic phase, on pandemic phase that we're in with this variant evolution, into the years beyond that. So 3, 4, 5 years from now, hopefully, we're well past the current pandemic. We still believe there's going to be SARS CoV-2 reinfections. And as we shared at the Vaccines Day just a couple of weeks ago, we take that lesson from the previous endemic coronavirus epidemics that have happened. where hundreds of years later, you still see reinfections, mortality, substantial health care costs associated with those viruses. And we don't know whether SARS-CoV-2 is worse than them or the same, but we believe that, that burden of disease that's created by the fact that respiratory viruses continually reinfect and when they do, they can really have a devastating effect in high-risk populations, particularly older immunocompromised, We think that's a real probability in the future. In fact, it would almost be unprecedented for that not to be the case in the coronavirus context. 
And so for that reason, we believe there is going to be a need for continual boosters whether it's annual or not and whether the multivalency continues to add more and valencies, I don't think anybody can say yet. But it's certainly a situation we're preparing for."

So I think what is pretty clear from all the vaccines, if you look across them, but certainly if you focus on the messenger RNA vaccines is that the high degree of efficacy we're seeing in vaccines right now is based on spike protein immunogenicity. That is the antigen that's being expressed. Is it theoretically possible that non-spike antigens could have provided the same protection. I think it's definitely possible, so forward-looking possible. But I think you would be remiss to look past the multiple large Phase III trials that provide pretty conclusive evidence of the value of going up for spike protein and trying to prevent COVID-19. 
So I think you would probably -- if you went down that route to have to redecorate that efficacy that may be increasingly difficult in a world where we have so many good choices in terms of vaccines. And so I'm not exactly sure how we go down that path, even theoretically."

But we've previously shared and published our Phase II data on a slightly larger number of subjects looking at a 50-microgram primary series. That looked quite good and at least as measured by immunogenicity seemed to achieve levels that were consistent with 100-microgram dose. So it's certainly something we're going to look at as to whether or not we could pursue a 50-microgram primary series. But how we get there will depend upon data that we don't yet have, right? So we will have to look at whether there are clear correlates of protection that we can use to bridge between those doses and/or we'll have to look at different populations in which we started those doses. As an example, as been shared. We're evaluating 50 micrograms as a potential primary series even in pediatric populations. As you can imagine, you don't need perhaps as higher dose in younger people than you do in older ones. 
So there's a lot of things ahead of us in terms of looking at whether or not a primary series or 50 micrograms is possible. Certainly for a booster series, that is the top dose at which we're looking. And as we look forward, we'll continue to carefully evaluate whether or not we can adopt that as a target dose across all of our applications. But it will depend on data."

I guess what I'd say is it's a little early to start giving that kind of guidance for 2022. What I would say is that if you look at our cost of goods and the cost of goods manufacturing thus far, we've been quite pleased with what we're seeing as we've ramped up production initially here in the U.S. We've seen, as I said, yields have been better than we'd foreseen as we did the initial planning. So that's obviously very helpful. And we reiterated today We think right now, the right planning assumption continues to be 20% cost of goods. As you move beyond '21, you get into a question of vaccines versus therapeutics. We think cost of goods manufactured will be very competitive for this product And therefore, margins and gross margins will depend very much on price levels, which I think it's early to comment on. And then in terms of operating expenses, we are building out the company. We continue to do that. And as I mentioned, we while our overall operating expenses were quite stable at $0.5 billion in the first quarter. We do see that trending up as we now move through the year. And we'll continue to invest appropriately to drive the portfolio investment and to build out globally. So I would say we'll continue to do that. And we'll give you better and more precise guidance here as we move closer to '22 and beyond."

So if you look at this year, the only reason we only supply 100 million to those in Q1, which is an extraordinary number is because we are building the capacity. And so",354,"Yes, it's Stéphane. So the -1273 ramp has been constrained by manufacturing capacity. So if you look at this year, the only reason we only supply 100 million to those in Q1, which is an extraordinary number is because we are building the capacity. And so the way to think about it is, as Corinne and his team are working how to add new lines and to increase the capacity, the rents of the follow up products will be much faster because today, manufacturing is slowing down the ramp. So I anticipate that as you think about the multivalent booster launches, as you think about RV to CMV launch, we will not be on the back foot. As you know, as part of our 2020 budget that we did at the end of 2019, we did not plan for pandemic. We were supposed to be commercial several years down the road. And so the team has done a remarkable job to get to this point, but we are -- and we're going to stay for, I would anticipate all over year supply constrained. Corinne and the team would love to be able to sell more product because trust me, their phone is turning real hot by calls from around the planet and would have to be able to help protect more people, we just can't because we were not planning a pandemic in 2020. So I anticipate that for variant and for new product launch, we will make sure that we are not capacity constrained, which is why the 3 billion supply volume that are for people might think it's maybe too aggressive. As I said in my remarks, the pipeline of the company is also going to play with this. And so is just behind the multivalent vaccine look. So if you look at a couple of years out, And we're not building manufacturing for 6 months. We're going to be really happy to give that capacity so that as we launch products, we can supply the market every single dose that Corinne and her team can make sure that the market wants."

We -- if you look now, we've increased our guidance for this year based on the developments that have occurred over the last couple of months. Is that a steady state going forward into the future?

And therefore, you can expect we'll have ongoing CapEx. Is it precisely in this range or somewhat above or below. I really wouldn't want to give you that precision as of yet because we're -- it's not that clear yet. But I think an ongoing CapEx trend will be appropriate for the company. 
In terms of the COGS, I think that's the right way to think about the cost of manufacturing this product. It will be impacted at some level by the amount of materials in the product. But when you're talking about micrograms of materials, it's really not that significant. So I think you can as the simplest assumption assume, it's a pretty steady cost of manufacture as we're seeing right now."

Stephen will provide a clinical update, especially new human data about 2 of our COVID-19 booster candidates, mRNA-1273, the currently authorized vaccine; and mRNA-1273.351, the variant specific booster to B.1.351 first identified in South Africa. I will then come back to close.  
The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is now available and protecting people in 37 countries around the world. And with the WHO authorization last Friday night, the number of countries where our vaccine will be available, will go up significantly.  
In the first quarter alone, 102 million doses have been shipped and many tens of millions of people have been fully vaccinated or received their first dose. 12 months ago, in Q1 2020, Moderna had never ran a Phase III clinical study, never gotten a product authorized by a regulator and never made 100 million doses in a single quarter, not even 10 million, not even 1 million doses. 
I am very proud of what the Moderna team has achieved, but most importantly, I am very thankful for their impact on the world and the incredible personal sacrifices that our team has made towards protect fellow human beings around the world. This is very humbling, and I'm fortunate to lead Moderna in this moment.  
I'm also thankful for Moderna scientists, engineers, doctors and team members who have worked relentlessly over the last 10 years now to be ready for when the virus emerged in late 2019. We invented technology to produce safe, well-tolerated mRNA vaccines, which made it possible for us to chase the SARS.  
The company achieved revenues of $1.9 billion in Q1 2021 of which $1.7 billion were COVID-19 vaccine product sales. The net income for the period was $1.2 billion. This marks the company's first GAAP profitable quarter in its history after 9 years of operating losses.  
At the end of 2021, we had cash and cash investments of $8.2 billion. David will give you more details in a few minutes.  
We increased our 2021 supply forecast once again. We now believe that we should be able to supply 800 million doses in 2021, and we're still aiming for 1 billion doses over the year. The total advanced purchase agreements signed for delivery in 2021 have been increased to $19.2 billion.  
We are happy to report this morning an interim update to our TeenCOVE study. The initial interim analysis of our Phase II/III TeenCOVE study of mRNA-1273 showed the vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 over 96% and mRNA-1273 was generally well tolerated with no serious safety concern identified to date.  
We're also on track to start this month the filing of our rolling BLA to the FDA for COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273, a type of COVID, we added another first as a company. And that gives the dosing of our first patient with an mRNA for our therapeutics candidate against a rare genetic disease, propionic acidemia a genetic deficiency in the liver with a candidate mRNA-3927.  
One of the things that I'm the most excited about is where we are going. The Q1 results highlighted above of the consequence of the last year work and decisions we made. So as I look to where Moderna is going, I get very excited by the level of our increased investments across the board. Using our strong balance sheet to invest to scale Moderna. These 2 numbers, awesome color. In Q1 2021, our R&D investments were approximately 4x higher than the R&D investments in Q1 of last year. Not 4%, not 40%, 4x higher.  
For all of you who have known us for many years, Moderna has been built as a digital enterprise since the early days. But we now have the opportunity to do much more and to build new functions like clinical trial operations, pharmacovigilance, commercial, digitally from the get-go. So looking at the next 5 to 10 years, we're investing intensively in digital, automation and AI. Our plan for 2021 is to invest 3x more in digital than in fiscal year 2020.  
We announced last week that we have decided to invest to increase our 2020 supply to up to 3 billion doses. Let me share with you why we decided to recommend to our Board to invest at that scale. First, let's talk about the science of SARS-CoV-2 virus. New variants of concern continue to emerge around the world. And we believe that over the next 6 months as the southern hemisphere enter its foreign winter, we could see more variants of concern emerge. We have said for right now that we believe booster shots will be needed as we believe that the virus is not going away. We also believe from the scientific standpoint, that the highest efficacy booster over time will be provided by multivalent variant-specific booster.  
Second, the market has changed quite a lot versus what we knew 6 months ago. First, mRNA vaccines have emerged as the best-in-class vaccines, high efficacy, good tolerability profile, having to scale manufacturing and speed to chase the variants in the clinic. Many companies are still in the clinic with their first-generation vaccine, where we're in a clinic with variant-specific boosters.  
More importantly, as we are looking to throw our nets around the world, in the West and in the East, in the North and in the South, we are hearing loud and clear from the market, supply us with more mRNA vaccine for primary series and supply us with more mRNA vaccine in the future for boosters for 2022 and 2023. There is a big shift versus what the market perceived 6 or 9 or 12 months ago, when protein vaccine or adeno vaccines were thought to be the answer to the pandemic. We believe it has become an mRNA market for COVID-19 vaccine.  
Third is rollout pipeline. We believe we will bring to market several more products in the next few years as we add to this market demand for COVID-19 boosters vials, flu vaccine as we discussed at the Vaccine Day. And our goal is to have a seasonal flu vaccine combined with COVID variant booster in a single-dose product.  
We saw strong clinical data for RSV vaccine and CMV vaccine. Plus we have 7 programs in clinical studies in 3 therapeutics area and more programs to move from preclinical development to clinical studies in the months to come.  
So we decided to build capacity to deliver up to 3 billion dose of supply in 2022 to share both the North and the South. We are doubling our drug substance supply in Europe and increasing by 50% of drug substance supply in the U.S. We are, of course, adding filling capacity in the U.S. and Europe at our existing partners, but also adding new ones as we speak, more to come.  
Another clinical feedback we're hearing from the market is that Moderna has a best-in-class mRNA vaccine. Shipment of minus 20 Celsius in storage, not minus 70 celsius. Small cartons of 100 doses. Storage up to 6 months in standard freezer and 4 weeks in regular repurchase temperatures. The only authorized mRNA vaccine that does not require on-site dilution. We believe this is an even more important feature today, but will be more in the future in '21 and '22 and '23 as we move to a booster market decentralized in pharmacies and in a doctor's office.  
We believe we have the best mRNA vaccine authorized, and we continue to improve our product to continue to have a best-in-class product of the mRNA market.  
We were delighted to announce this morning the start of a dosing of our first patient in our Phase I/II study with propionic acidemia disease. The study is called Paramount. It is yet another milestone for Moderna. Not only do we have, I believe, the most innovative infectious vaccine clinical pipeline, but we also have therapeutic candidates in clinical studies in oncology, in cardiology and now in a rare genetic disease.  
Let me close my remarks on this familiar slide. We now have 1,500 employees. We have recently incorporated Moderna Japan K.K. And we'll continue to build our commercial network. We will push to Asia Pacific in 2021.  
And given our strong balance sheet of $8.2 billion, we're going to continue to accelerate and invest to allow Moderna to scale and maximize the impact of our broad mRNA platform to help as many people as we can.  
Let me share our perspective on yesterday afternoon announcement by the United States Trade Ambassador that the U.S. government will ship off waving intellectual property protection for COVID-19 vaccines. We believe this will not help supply more mRNA vaccines to the world any faster in 2021 or in 2022, which is the most critical time of the pandemic. There is no idle mRNA manufacturing capacity in the world. There is no industry of talented individuals who are skilled in the art of making high-quality and high-purity GMP-grade mRNA vaccines. There are no companies who have developed manufacturing processes, purification processes and medical processes that would allow them to quickly run a clinical trial. And if approved by regulators around the world, then provide hundreds of millions or billions of supply of mRNA vaccine.  
We have announced in the company's statement issued October 8, 2020 that during the pandemic, Moderna will not enforce COVID-19-related patents. You can find that statement on our website. We believe that the best way to end the pandemic is what we are currently doing. First, to maximize supply in 2021 to protect as many people as we can. 
Second, to build additional capacity, which we have announced last week to get up to $3 billion of authorized mRNA vaccines for 2022, 2023 and beyond. And third, to continue to adapt the vaccine to have a highest efficacy vaccine with variant-specific booster for which we announced a very encouraging clinical results yesterday.  
Let me now turn to Corinne to give you a commercial update. Corinne?"

And on the back of it, we have turned into a commercial company very quickly. So today, I'm delighted to give you an update on the commercial progress in the first quarter.  
I will start with our most recently signed supply agreements, those that occurred in the first quarter and at the beginning of the second quarter this year. I am particularly happy to announce our agreement with COVAX, which will provide access to our vaccine to millions of people in low- and middle-income countries and is in keeping with our global access principles.  
In total, our COVAX agreement is for 500 million doses for delivery in the 2021 and 2022 period. Specifically, in 2021, Moderna will begin delivery of 34 million doses in the fourth quarter of 2021. COVAX will have an option for an additional 466 million doses in 2022. We are grateful to all the collaborative efforts of CEPI, Gavi, UNICEF, the World Health Organization and the Moderna commercial teams in making this important supply agreement a reality.  
Moving now to the additional supply agreements signed for both 2021 and '22. We have signed additional supply agreements with Israel for 5.3 million doses in 2022 with an additional option of 17.3 million doses for '22 and '23. And with Switzerland for 7 million doses in 2022 and options for an additional 7 million in late 2022 and '23.  
We have also signed new deals for '21 delivery with Botswana, Brunei. And in addition, we have also signed an agreement with Zuellig Pharma, our distribution partner,in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. 
In total, we announced advanced purchase agreements totaling 845 million doses to be delivered in 2021 to the countries that are listed here on the slide. And we continue to have discussions with countries, who those we have already contracted with and new countries for supply in 2022 and beyond.  
In our discussions, as Stephane said, we are hearing consistently from governments that in their view, there is no other technology that provides the high efficacy of mRNA vaccines and the speed necessary to adapt to variants, while at the same time, allowing reliable scalability of manufacturing. We are grateful for the trust placed in us from the various governments we have signed agreements with, and we look forward to supplying the vaccine to other countries and helping end the pandemic and getting ahead of variance.  
Let me now turn to product sales. Our first -- our product sales for the first quarter of this year were $1.73 billion and were recorded for the delivery of 102 million doses. Product sales in the U.S. were approximately $1.4 billion and sales outside of the U.S. to the EU, Canada, Switzerland, Israel and Singapore were approximately $400 million for the 14 million doses delivered in the first quarter.  
In the U.S., we have successfully completed the delivery of the first 100 million doses to the U.S. government within 100 days of emergency use authorization. And we expect to complete the delivery of the second 100 million doses to the United States government before the end of the second quarter.  
As you know, the U.S. production started earlier and is roughly 1 quarter ahead in production ramp. As such, in the second quarter of '21, we expect the ex-U.S. ramp to be similar to that of the U.S. ramp in the first quarter.  
To close, I want to reiterate that as we continue to produce and roll out vaccines into the global market, we are humbled and proud to be part of the solution.  
I will now turn the call over to David Meline."

Today, as with our last earnings call, we are presenting our results primarily on a U.S. GAAP basis. In some cases, we also provide additional detail to provide greater clarity on underlying trends.

In some cases, we also provide additional detail to provide greater clarity on underlying trends. With this background, we are providing an analysis of actual 2021 first quarter results, along with an updated view of key drivers of financial performance going forward.  
Turning to Slide 18. Total revenue was $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $8 million in Q1 of last year. Following our first-ever product sales of $200 million in December 2020, we recorded product sales of $1.7 billion for our COVID-19 vaccine in the first quarter of 2021.  
Grant and collaboration revenue increased to $204 million in Q1, primarily due to increases in grant revenue from BARDA to accelerate development of our COVID-19 vaccine.  
Cost of sales were $193 million in the first quarter, benefiting substantially from previously expensed pre-commercial inventory costs, which I will discuss in more detail on a later slide.  
Research and development expenses were $401 million for Q1 2021 compared to $115 million for the same period in 2020. The higher spend was driven by increased COVID-19 vaccine clinical development activities, including our announced efforts around booster, variant-specific and multivalent vaccine candidates. Headcount increases as well as pharmacovigilance activities related to our COVID-19 vaccine also contributed to the year-on-year expense increase.  
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $77 million for Q1 2021 compared to $24 million for the same period in the prior year. The growth in spending was driven by increases in personnel, outside services and costs associated with commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally.  
Our provision for income taxes was $39 million in Q1 2021, reflecting a benefit from the utilization of our net operating loss carryforward as well as discrete items. I will provide further context on the following slides.  
We recorded net income of $1.2 billion for Q1 of this year compared to a net loss of $124 million in the same period of last year. Earnings per share on a diluted basis was $2.84. Please note that our share count on a diluted basis now also includes the effect of outstanding options and RSUs as we began to be profitable. Previously, when we were in a net loss position, basic and reported diluted number of shares were the same.  
Turning to cash and selected cash flow information on Slide 19. We ended Q1 2021 with cash and investments of $8.2 billion compared to $5.2 billion at the end of Q4 2020. The increase is driven by our commercial sales and additional customer deposits received in the first quarter for future purchases of our COVID-19 vaccine. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.97 billion in Q1 of this year compared to net cash used in operating activities of $106 million in Q1 of last year. The reversal from net operating cash outflow to cash inflow was driven by our commercial market entry for the entire quarter.  
Similar to last quarter, before providing an updated financial framework for the remainder of 2021, let me summarize a few areas from our Q1 results that are important to keep in mind when modeling expected 2021 financial performance.  
Starting with product sales on Slide 20. We started last year to build 2 distinct supply chains, one in the U.S. and one outside the U.S. for rest of world markets. Our supply chain scale up in the U.S. was roughly 1 quarter in advance of our ex U.S. supply chain, which is reflected in the geographic sales mix in Q1. As we move forward in Q2, the ex U.S. supply chain is also ramping up toward full capability.  
Turning to Slide 21. Cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, logistics and warehousing costs as well as third-party royalty costs. We began capitalizing our COVID-19 vaccine inventory costs in December of 2020, following the COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorization based upon our expectation that these inventory costs would be recoverable through commercialization of the vaccine. Prior to the authorization of our COVID-19 vaccine, inventory costs were recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred. We expensed $242 million of prelaunch inventory costs in 2020 and started 2021 with the remaining balance of $187 million of 0 cost inventory. Almost the entire balance, or $184 million was sold and benefited our cost of sales in Q1 of this year, and hence, will not further impact future quarters in a material way. If inventory sold during the first quarter was valued at actual cost, our cost of sales would have been $377 million or 22% of our product sales somewhat favorable to what we expected, driven by favorable yields in our U.S. production facilities.  
Now turning to our cash and investment position on Slide 22. The cash and investment balance reported as of March 31 was $8.2 billion, up from $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily driven by the net increase in customer deposits for future product supply of COVID-19 vaccine. The net balance of cash customer deposits increased from $2.8 million at the end of December 2020 to $5.6 billion at the end of Q1 '21.  
Lastly, let me comment on tax-related items on Slide 23. The significant investments in our research, development and start-up activities to develop the mRNA platform over the last decade have resulted in net operating loss carryforwards, with a balance of $2.3 billion at the end of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets related to these loss carryforwards. We performed a valuation allowance assessment during each reporting period based on the latest available financial information and outlook. 
After considering the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, we concluded that as of March 31, it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize the substantial majority of its net deferred tax assets. This analysis included not only our strong first quarter results, but also our April activity. The majority of the valuation allowance will flow through the P&L over the course of 2021 in our effective tax rate prorated based on the cadence of our expected pretax quarterly earnings.  
We also recorded 2 discrete benefits in our tax provision in Q1, which lowered our first quarter tax rate. The first benefit related to the valuation allowance release for the portion of deferred tax assets, which we expect to utilize in future years. The second related to the excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation.  
Turning now to the 2021 updated financial framework on Slide 24. Signed advanced purchase agreements for expected delivery in 2021 reflect a current full year total of $19.2 billion in anticipated product sales including doses that have been delivered and recognized as revenue in Q1.  
Based on continuous progress to ramp up available supply capacity in our network, we have raised the lower end of our global manufacturing plan for 2021 from 700 million to 800 million doses at the 100-microgram dose level. Our manufacturing team and our partners are still working to supply up to 1 billion doses for 2021. Further, we continue to expect a range of deliveries in Q2 2021 of 200 million to 250 million doses. 
Our total cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing, logistics and warehousing and third-party royalties. For 2021, we continue to model average total cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be approximately 20% for the full year with some variation quarter-by-quarter largely driven by average selling price going forward.  
Now let me comment on planned R&D and SG&A expenses. Q1 expenses of approximately $0.5 billion were stable compared to the underlying Q4 2020 expense run rate on a like-for-like basis.  
In Q1, our actual expenses were lower than the internal forecast primarily driven by the timing of clinical development and commercial activities and related costs. We now expect a notable expense trend increase starting in Q2 on a quarter-over-quarter basis for the remainder of this year.  
Based on better visibility of the utilization of our accumulated net operating loss carryforward, expected global sales mix and the mentioned discrete benefits in Q1, we now expect our all-in 2021 tax rate to be in the low teens. This compares to our previous forecast in the mid-teen range. This forecast is based on current U.S. tax policy in effect and does not include any future potential discrete benefits related to stock-based compensation. We will update this view as our business evolves further.  
Finally, regarding capital investments, we are raising our forecast for capital investment from our previous range of $350 million to $400 million for 2021 to $450 million to $550 million, including the planned capacity expansion investments as announced on April 29.  
This concludes my remarks concerning financial performance, and I now turn the call over to Stephen."

I'll begin with an overview of our COVID-19 strategy against variants of concern and the initial data from our Phase II booster vaccination study before ending with a summary of the rest of our pipeline. And before I go into the data, a",1108,"Thank you, David. I'll begin with an overview of our COVID-19 strategy against variants of concern and the initial data from our Phase II booster vaccination study before ending with a summary of the rest of our pipeline. And before I go into the data, a reminder that our booster strategy is evaluating single-dose booster vaccinations with 3 different mRNA vaccines: 50 micrograms of mRNA-1273; 50 micrograms of mRNA-1273.351, both of which have data available today and what I will discuss in just a moment; and a multivalent booster vaccine candidate, which combines a 50-50 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 in a single vaccine.
In addition, we're also evaluating a lower 20-microgram dose of mRNA-1273.351. Data from the multivalent booster and the 20-microgram booster of 351 will be shared when available. 
And with that backdrop, let's move to the data. Starting with safety, local and systemic adverse events within 7 days after a booster dose of either -1273 or -1273.351 were generally comparable to those observed after the second dose of -1273 in our previously reported Phase II study and our Phase III COVE study. The majority of the events were mild or moderate in severity and grade 3 events occurred with a frequency of approximately 15% in participants who received -1273 and approximately 10% in participants who received -1273.351. The most commonly reported solicited local events were injection site pain and the most commonly reported systemic events were fatigue, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. There were no grade 4 events reported. 
On the next slide, are figures from 2 papers. The figure on the left-hand side were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and show the difference in neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses in serum samples 1 week after vaccination with a primary series of mRNA-1273. Recall that there was a sixfold decrease in neutralization titers against the B.1.351 variant, the variant first identified in the Republic of South Africa; and a three-fold drop in titers against P.1, the variant first described in Brazil. And again, as a reminder, these neutralizing titer levels were from serum samples 1 week after the second dose of the primary vaccine series of mRNA-1273. So essentially, these titers are close to peak levels. 
On the right-hand side of the slide is a figure from the preprint manuscript of our initial results from our Phase II study posted yesterday at Bio Archive. The figures show the neutralization titer levels of the participants in our Phase II booster study immediately before their booster vaccinations. 
A reminder that these individuals were previously vaccinated with a primary series of mRNA-1273 in either our Phase II or Phase III studies, roughly 6 to 8 months prior to enrolling in this booster study. 
At this time point, titers against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 remained high with almost all participants having detectable titers. But titers against B.1.351 and P1, the variants of concern were much lower. In fact, approximately half of participants had titers below the assays limit of quantitation at this time point. 
So it is clear that waning of titers is apparent, both with time and that lower titers against variants of concern lead to more rapid loss of neutralizing activity. 
Turning to the next slide. The data shows that 2 weeks after booster vaccines of either mRNA-1273 or -1273.351 neutralizing tighter levels increased against both the wild-type virus as well as the B.1.351 and P1 variants of concern. In fact, following boost, geometric mean titers against the 3 variants tested increased to levels similar to or higher than previously reported peak titers against the ancestral strain following primary vaccination. 
When looking specifically at the GMTs of the different strains, we achieved levels of 1,400 after booster vaccination with mRNA-1273.351 against the 351 variant. This compares against the GMT of 864 when boosting with mRNA-1273. 
Vaccination with mRNA-1273.351 was more effective at narrowing the gap in neutralizing titers between wild-type and B.1.351 viruses relative to boosting with mRNA-1273. 
Now we're encouraged by this initial data, and we're excited to see additional data over time from these arms as well as the data from the multivalent arm and a lower dose arm of mRNA-1273.351.
On the next slide, I would like to highlight one last comparison from the manuscript. On the left hand is a sample of participants from the Phase I study and they're neutralizing titers against ancestral strain following a primary vaccination series with mRNA-1273. GMT is achieved in this assay approximately 1,500. 
On the right-hand side is a reproduction of the data we just spoke through, looking at neutralizing titers, and I'm specifically highlighting the neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant of concern. A booster dose of 50 micrograms of mRNA-1273, the top bar, was able to increase titers to a level of 864 in this study. That compares with a booster dose of 50 micrograms of 1273.351, which was able to get to titers against the variant of concern as high as 1,400 in the study. We'll continue to closely watch this data, and as I mentioned a moment ago, look forward to subsequent updates and time points. 
On Slide 31 is a snapshot of our vaccine development candidates that are in or entering the clinic. I'll highlight a few. Our CMV vaccine is on track to start a pivotal Phase III study in 2021. Our Zika vaccine is expected to begin a Phase II study also in 2021. Our hMPV/PIV3 respiratory combo vaccine is currently enrolling in toddlers. And at our Vaccines Day last month, we announced positive interim Phase I data from our RSV vaccine, mRNA-1345. This continues in pediatric and older adult cohorts of that Phase I study are still enrolling. 
Finally, within our flu vaccine program, we expect a Phase I study of mRNA-1010 to begin in 2021. 
Outside of vaccines, we have 7 clinical proof-of-concept trials ongoing across 4 modalities. Our VEGF program partnered with AstraZeneca is enrolling in a Phase II. Our personalized cancer vaccine program partnered with Merck is also enrolling in a Phase II trial. And KRAS, our second program partnered with Merck is ongoing in a Phase I study. 
Within intratumoral immuno-oncology, our Phase II dose expansion in OX40 ligand, Phase I Triplet and Phase I IL-2 study, which is partnered with AstraZeneca, are all still ongoing. 
Finally, as Stephane mentioned, we are pleased to have started dosing in the Paramount study in propionic acidemia. 
On Slide 33, you can see our full development pipeline. In addition to our large portfolio of infectious disease vaccines, we now have 7 therapeutic programs in the clinic. 
I'll now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you so much."

Our 2021 advanced purchase agreement signed have now been increased to $19.2 billion. As we look into 2022, we're investing to distribute and dose supply capacity because we believe the market need -- could be greater in 2022 than in 2021. 
First, we already have countries signing APAs for 2022 for prime series for children but also for variant-specific boosters. Israel last week and Switzerland this morning. 
If you recall, there were some of the first countries who signed APAs in 2020. And again, these countries are ahead of the game for 2022 and 2023. 
Second, with the COVAX partnership announced Monday, we anticipate to supply up to 466 million doses in 2022. 
Third, we're having active discussions with all the governments that have signed 2021 APAs with Moderna. For new APAs for 2022 deliveries, again, prime series but also boosters. 
Fourth, we're having numerous discussions with government that do not have 2021 APAs with Moderna because we cannot supply them in 2021 unfortunately. But many of these governments are already asking us to enter into 2022 APAs because they want high efficacy mRNA vaccines that are easy to store. This is why we decided to invest for more supply in 2022. We believe from our current deals and current discussions that the market wants more supply from us in 2022 than we can supply in 2021. 
As we look at the next 5 to 10 years, we have the most innovative vaccine pipeline in the industry. And we're investing more in research to increase our impact by bringing to the clinic, more innovative vaccines against viruses that hurt humans. We are now in the clinic in 3 therapeutic areas: oncology, cardiology and rare disease and soon, we should be in the clinic in autoimmune disease as well. We are continuing to innovate and invest in science, like, for example, for delivering mRNA in the lung with our partner, Vertex. 
As we continue to prepare Moderna to scale and to have 10x more impact, we're investing aggressively. We are accelerating our investments in digital, automation and AI. 
From a spend of $27 million in 2019, we invested around $60 million in 2020 in digital. We're planning to almost triple that $170 million in 2021. We're investing across the world in R&D to ensure high quality to accelerate the pace of learning and to ensure we can transform clinical operations. We're investing in digital to ensure high-quality, high scalability for manufacturing. We are building commercial so that we can commercialize our pipeline in a highly efficient and effective manner. We want to change the big pharma paradigm of large, inefficient and expensive sales force and advertising spend to promote me-too drugs. Our pipeline is first-in-class medicine that patients and doctors are waiting for. 
We want to enable our corporate functions, HR, legal, finance and so on to scale without creating large corporate organization. 
I'm also excited that we are launching an AI Academy. Today, we have some exciting pockets of excellence in AI across the company. But AI is not yet part of our DNA. The reason is simple, most companies don't do AI. So as we grow and hire new talent, they have great skills in their heart, but few have been exposed to AI in their previous company. We want AI to be how we run the business in science, in clinical development, in manufacturing quality in commercial, in HR and finance, everywhere. 
It is the same change management revolution as 20 to 30 years ago when personal computers entered the workforce. We want everything at Moderna to understand and use AI in everything we do. AI will become part of our DNA. 
As many of you know, we have built integrated digital system connected to each other. And as we have more systems, we get more data. As we get more data, we learn faster. And we keep building and creating a network cycle. Between our strong balance sheet, our mRNA platform, our team, our culture and our digital infrastructure, I believe our belief to scale Moderna is unique in the biopharmaceutical industry. 
As part of scaling Moderna, there is software, better so very value added. Many of you were at the opening of a Norwood manufacturing site in July 2018 or you came to visit after the opening. Our building is around 200,000 square feet. We call it Moderna Technology Center South or MTC South. 
In 2020, we added the building next to it and added around 245,000 square feet and called it MTC North. We are pleased to announce this week that we now have access to a new building, MTC East, which will start welcoming Moderna employees later this year after some maybe investment and renovation to the building. That is another 240,000 square feet. 
So we're now having in MTC access to around 650,000 square feet. We now hold the building on this campus, and we can also add more buildings and build them now that we have the entire campus. 
We are deeply committed about building a company that has a strong sense of responsibility. We want Moderna to be a positive force in the world, not only for our medicines, but also by who we are as a company. 
We are very committed to belong, inclusion and diversity. We recently published or expanded workforce diversity figures for the first time. Last year, we signed the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge. And we have also reiterated our ongoing commitment to increasing diversity in our clinical trials. 
We are deeply committed to the environment. We have decided to source our Norwood and Cambridge site with renewable energy and will offset any energy that is not from renewable sources, and we will be working on our target as to when we should be a net-zero carbon company. 
We also encouraging our employees with a positive impact on the communities in which we live and volunteer, from cleaning the Charles River in Cambridge, to feeding the homeless and stem education and much more. You can find a lot of resources online on our website. 
As I close, I want to convey how thankful we are at Moderna to have a chance to do what we do. Every day, we come to work to make innovative medicine using the first information platform of a biopharmaceutical industry. My colleagues and I work and collaborate to make more medicines to protect or treat people. 
I am proud of what the team has done over the last 10 years to get us to this stage. Over the last 14 months, since we started chasing SARS-CoV-2 virus. And in Q1, as we continue to execute relentlessly. 
But as I look at the future of Moderna, I believe we have a chance over the next 5, 10, 20 years to transform medicines potentially like no other company has ever changed medicine. This is just the beginning. 
Before taking your questions, I would like to remind you that we will be hosting our Annual Science Day in a few weeks on May 27. You are going to work to connect this event as Stephen and his team have some very cool new things to share with you. 
And later at the end of the summer, on September 9, our annual R&D Day for holistic clinical update.

Secondly, if you could just discuss contract dynamics for the vaccine in 2022 as you look to address variants and kind of you see them move towards an endemic market. 
And third, it's nice to see the PA program move forward. It would be great to kind of understand whether we'll see data from that program this year and what else we might see from the ex COVID pipeline?"

Let me start with your first questions and then turn few questions to Stephen. So on the IP, what does it mean? I believe it doesn't change anything for Moderna. As I said, we had said last October that we will not enforce our CO",734,"Salveen, it's Stephane. Let me start with your first questions and then turn few questions to Stephen. 
So on the IP, what does it mean? I believe it doesn't change anything for Moderna. As I said, we had said last October that we will not enforce our COVID-19-related patents during the pandemic. And as I said in my remarks, there is no mRNA in manufacturing capacity in the world. This is a new technology. You cannot go hire people who know how to make the mRNA. Those people don't exist. 
And then even if all those things were available, whoever who wants to do mRNA vaccines will have to buy the machine, invent the manufacturing process, invest verification processes, analytical processes. And then they will have to go run a clinical trial, get the data, get the product approved and scale the manufacturing. This doesn't happen in 6 or 12 or 18 months. We have been working at these for years. 
And as you know, there are some smaller mRNA companies that are still in the clinic, trying to get the products to a finish line. And so we saw the news last night and I didn't lose a minute of sleep of the news during the night. 
On 2022 contract, the dynamic is, as I just described it, which is, the market has tremendously changed. Since the pandemic started last year, before clinical data, many countries as you know, didn't want to move, especially because of mRNA being a new technology. They moved first on protein contracts, on adenos contracts. And then the kind of mRNA contracts came later, more just in case. And then the clinical data came along and the speed to get to approval. 
And so -- and then you have the fact that the proteins are still not authorized anywhere in the West. And then you had the low efficacy of the adenos in over the safety questions around the adenos, manufacturing scale-up issues that adenos companies have had. And the big question that scientists advising governments are which is, can you actually really boost adenos with more adenos products because, by definition, you give again the same virus vector to somebody that we believe over time will get less and less response from it. 
So as we look at the marketplace, which what governments are doing, and given many governments, I think last year, believe the pandemic will be gone quickly. Trust me, every governments we're talking to believe this is going to stay for a long time. They have got massively educated by the scientists and the clinician, and they believe this virus is not going away. They believe boosting is going to be critical. They believe variant-specific boosting is going to be the right way to do the science. And as you saw from Stephen's presentation, this is what the clinical data are showing as well. 
And so the dynamic is that current governments that have already contracted us are calling for more, and we're in active discussion with all of them to supply more for '22 and '23, both prime series and specific-variant booster. The beauty about this technology is, we can agree right now in the contracts to give them next year to be able to choose what they want based on the clinical data. And that's an incredible competitive advantage. And this we can do because, as you know, the manufacturing process is the same for -1273 or -1273.351 or -1273.221 or new 1273 dot something is a new variant. And we can change that on a very short notice because it's a same equipment, in the same room, with the same people, with same raw materials. 
And then -- all those governments, which is almost more exciting to me that never called before -- that we called before, but we couldn't supply them because we are in the unfortunate position and we're very sorry. We have no more supply for you in 2021, which, of course, a very difficult discussion to have given the suffering happening around the world. 
But the great news with the investments we've announced to get up to 3 billion next year. We now can have those discussions with those governments. And Corinne and the team are having a lot of discussions with them. So that kind of give you a sense on the dynamics. 
Stephen, on PA?"

And we're going to make sure that we develop a cogent and consistent data set before we bring that forward. It is a dose optimization study, and we will perhaps be looking at multiple dose levels. So while I think it's possible that we would see data this year, it's dependent upon many things that are well beyond our control. 
Now you asked a more general question also about our broader portfolio. And if you look at the programs more generally, VEGF, as we mentioned, is a Phase II program that's been enrolling for a while. It's possible we could see data from that. Our PCV and KRAS programs, again, as open-label programs will continue to track those closely as they enroll. And then similar intratumoral programs that we highlighted, many of them are ongoing and producing data. And of course, when we have a complete and cogent data set, we will bring it forward."

So first on -- I believe you're referencing our second-generation vaccine candidate, which is mRNA-1283. It is a shorter construct that we think could have a much longer refer through its stability profile. 
As we announced previously, we started enrolling in the Phase I in that study. And it's probably a little bit premature to comment on what we think the regulatory path will look like for that until we get some of that initial data and have conversations, obviously, with regulators. But I would highlight that it's possible that -1283 may not go into a full primary series vaccination study. It could impact in the future function as a booster. But again, that's probably too early to say. We will have to wait until we see that data and ultimately, it would be dependent upon conversations with regulators in the future. 
As it relates to PA enrollment, yes, as you mentioned, we've been working very hard on that over the coming -- over the past years, and we're quite pleased to have enrolled the first participant, the first patient in that study. And the team is working hard to enroll additional patients as quickly as possible. I think time will tell whether we've actually broken through here and addressed any of the issues that we previously had in terms of enrollment. And so hopefully, we'll be able to provide subsequent updates on expanding enrollment in the near term that will demonstrate that we've made that progress."

Look, I think we have to start by saying we don't know. We do not have data on when to expect waning immunity leading to breakthrough infections. But we do know that there is a raging pandemic that reinfections will happen",480,"Thank you for the question, Ted. Look, I think we have to start by saying we don't know. We do not have data on when to expect waning immunity leading to breakthrough infections. But we do know that there is a raging pandemic that reinfections will happen at some point. And the best way to ensure that we do not have renewed outbreaks in well vaccinated countries is to boost and maintain the highest possible levels of neutralizing immunity. 
We, as Moderna, also believe that, that means we want to maintain the broadest neutralizing immunity against the largest number of than circulating variants of concern. 
If you look at the data that we have posted today as well as some of our published data and others reports, it does feel like immunity to a primary vaccination series or a previous infection seems to weigh in over the 6- to 12-month time horizon, at least as measured by neutralizing titers. Again, we don't know whether that's a clinical cohort or not, but it certainly is an indication of that waning immunity. 
And if you look at the data that we -- that I presented earlier, approximately half of the participants in our booster studies, no longer have detectable neutralizing immunity against the variants of concern. They have neutralizing immunity against the ancestral strain that they were vaccinated against. 
So the logical thing we think to do is to boost their immunity against those variants of concern. If you will vaccinate them against those to both increase those titers right now, but also give them a longer duration of protection, perhaps long enough, that we can see our way through the pandemic. That probably looks like boosting on a 9 to 12 months after primary series as an annual booster for now. At least while we're continuing to see the evolution of the virus. 
Now the last point was about our strategy more generally here. And we do believe that the virus is not going to follow one path of evolution. That we are going to see many variants of concern, that there may be divergent paths. And therefore, the best way to ensure that we can protect against the broadest number of variants of concern will be a multivalent vaccine. 
Now right now, we're still waiting to see our multivalent vaccine data, which is a combination, as you know, of ancestral and 351, the strain first identified in South Africa. But we think this is just the beginning, and we think we're going to be unfortunately continuing to fight this pandemic through 2022, at least, globally. And therefore, we're committed as a company to make as many updates to the vaccine, to add as many variants as we think are necessary, to ensure that when people receive a booster, it provides the broadest immune protection against the widest range of variants."

Because I don't think that you can just make it. And like it's easy. Can you maybe just offer some color there? 
And the second question is also a follow-up on the variant strategy. It sounds like the bivalent strategy might be the best, Stephen. So at what point would you just pull the trigger on beginning to manufacture that and ramp that all up for 2022?"

Going back to what I said is, if somebody was to start from scratch because again there is no mRNA player that's with idle capacity out there.

And you cannot find that patent, which as you all know are on the founded on the U.S., but they block this website. And so one is going to figure out what machine do you need, how do you make mRNA, what purification method you need, what analytical methods you need. And once you recognize all those things, which trust me is going to take you time, it is not easy. Us and other companies that are in the market we are on a vaccine that we've been building for decades. And even companies that have been working on it for 10 or 20 years are still in a clinic trying to figure out how to get to the finish line. 
And so I really believe that this is not the issue. I already believe the IP topic is mostly critically driven. It is not the issue. It might impact other technology that had a role in proteins and this I could not comment on. But for mRNA, I really think this is the wrong question. Stephen, do you want to take the variants?"

So on our multivalent strategy, we have -- at this point, we are still waiting for the clinical data to confirm that.

The preclinical data that we have published does -- or presented to dose suggest that, that is going to be the winning approach. And as I highlighted, or as is highlighted by the monovalent clinical data we already have, there is a benefit to adding additional antigens and potentially, therefore, benefit with a multivalent approach. 
I think it's important to recognize that we view this as an ongoing battle. And so your question about when do we pull the trigger and move forward bivalent manufacturing. We're already on the path of doing that manufacturing, not because we think that we're done with mRNA-1273.211 the bivalent -- current bivalent vaccine, but because we think we're going to go down the path of multivalent vaccines and continue needing to add things. 
And so that platform capability, we are already in the process of building and establishing to support multiple updates to a multivalent vaccine. 
And we do think that's going to be required because we think the virus is not going to stand still and stop evolving, and we suspect there's going to be trivalent, maybe quadrivalent. It will keep happening in the time ahead. We have completed GMP manufacturing of all of those batches, and we're at sufficient scale, we think, to be able to quickly move into commercial scale distribution if needed. But at this point, we are still waiting for data to come shortly to confirm that performance in clinic."

As you all know, we have a CMV vaccine on its way to Phase III, where we developed and that we find over the years, a very complex product, seeks mRNA in the same guidance. 
So if you think about what the multivalent vaccine for COVID is going to look like, it's not going to be easy. And so for people that have not done multivalent in GMP setting before, trust me, the regulators because we had this discussion with regulators around CMV over years. They didn't want to see a lot of analytical method characterization so that you can prove to them that you know what is in the pipe. And that is yet again another big differentiation with Moderna."

This is more for Steve, actually, to me, it was a little bit surprised the differences between -1273 versus -1273.351 was less or narrow than initially I would expect it. It seems like -1273 should be also sufficient to protect from variant strain. So what could be the explanation? And then you did just lay out the plan, you still will be going after the multi-variant approach. But regarding the explanation there, like do you think that, that just a single shot that was should be sufficient for the protection?"

I'll -- maybe I'll take that question first and then hand it back to Stephane on your IP question. So a couple of things I would note. The first is the level of titers, as you suggested, there's a little bit less than twofold difference between them, and you are -- when you are seeing substantially higher titers in the order of 1,400 when you give the very specific booster, that's mRNA-1273.351. 
Now I would note that this is happening already at Day 15, right? This is an early time point that we're looking at, at this point. We will also be looking at Day 29. And in this case, we are -- effectively, it is a prime with the 1273.351, right? It is the first dose of the strain first identified in South Africa. And so it's actually -- there's 2 ways you could look at it. One is obviously that it is -- both look good. I think the other and the way that I'm still looking at this is, it looks like we can very rapidly direct the immune response to an increased level of neutralizing titers against the variant of concern that was first identified in South Africa 351 in this case. 
And if you compare the titers that we've achieved even by day 15, between these 2 variants -- or between the ancestral strain and the 351 strain, it's really only the 351 strain that's getting to the same level that we saw against the ancestral strains in that last comparison. So to levels that are approximately similar amount. 
Now that's not to say that mRNA-1273 as a booster couldn't -- wouldn't provide a benefit, and I think you're highlighting that, Gena. There is evidence in this data as well that we can substantially increase neutralizing titers generally across the response with a booster dose of mRNA-1273, our authorized vaccine at 50 micrograms. And that is encouraging. That is good news because I think it suggests that is also a useful strategy. But if you had to choose between the 2, and you were primarily concerned about increasing immunity to a higher level so that it can last longer, particularly in patient populations at high risk of either waning immunity or incomplete immunity, we think this starts to provide very early event, even at Day 15, even after a priming dose, that there's going to be an advantage to some strain matching of the antigen. And that's what has us continue to be excited about a multivalent strategy. Stephane?"

I think it's important to note, though, that this is all happening very acutely, right? We're still only months away into -- we're months into these vaccination campaigns. And the primary concern that we and others have from a public health perspective is really not what's going to happen right after vaccination. But what does this look like in 9 months? What does this look like in 18 months? And I think that the really difficult situation everybody is in is you could say, well, let's wait until it's a year from now, and we see a reemergence of spikes of cases. We see -- maybe it's not as bad, but we see a very big and bad flu season in the winters, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of death, that kind of scale. That's not a situation that most are willing to take a risk on because it obviously could be substantially worse than that. 
And so we're probably not going to have a chance to wait for data for cases to really break through a year from after vaccination in the real-world setting and let that start to guide revaccination decisions. 
At that point, it's almost too late. And so I think at this level, we think for the very near term, the correct and sort of conservative decision is to continue to try and maintain the highest level of broadest immunity in the populations that are well vaccinated already. 
Now if you look beyond this sort of epidemic phase or pandemic phase that we're in with this variant evolution, into the years beyond that, so 3, 4, 5 years from now, hopefully, we're well past the current pandemic. We still believe there's going to be SARS-CoV-2 reinfections. And as we shared at the Vaccines Day just a couple of weeks ago, we take that lesson from the previous endemic coronavirus epidemics that have happened, where hundreds of years later, you still see reinfections, mortality, substantial health care costs associated with those viruses. And we don't know whether SARS-CoV-2 is worse than them or the same, but we believe that, that burden of disease that's created by the fact that respiratory viruses continually reinfect. And when they do, they can really have a devastating effect in high-risk populations, particularly older immunocompromised. We think that's a real probability in the future. In fact, it would almost be unprecedented for that not to be the case in the coronavirus context. 
And so for that reason, we believe there is going to be a need for continual boosters, whether it's annual or not and whether the multivalency continues to add more and valencies, I don't think anybody can say yet. But it's certainly a situation we're preparing for."

And this is your second question on different modalities and different parts of the antigen. So I think what is pretty clear from all the vaccines, if you look across them, but certainly if you focus on the messenger RNA vaccines is that the high degree of efficacy we're seeing in vaccines right now is based on spike protein immunogenicity. That is the antigen that's being expressed. 
Is it theoretically possible that non-spike antigens could have provided the same protection? I think it's definitely possible. So forward-looking possible. But I think you would be remiss to look past the multiple large Phase III trials that provide pretty conclusive evidence of the value of going up for spike protein and trying to prevent COVID-19. 
So I think you would probably -- if you went down that route have to redemonstrate that efficacy that may be increasingly difficult in a world where we have so many good choices in terms of vaccines. And so I'm not exactly sure how we go down that path, even theoretically."

And then you have adolescents and then you have children across the world. And then you are boosting. So when you add all those pieces, the reason we are building up to 3 billion of supply as a mix between the prime series and boosters is because we believe that this is what the world is looking for based on the daily engagements we have with governments around the world. It's a very different setup than what it was a year ago. 
A year ago, you get people saying, ""Oh, I'm going to get cheap adenovirus vaccine because it means supplied at cost."" This is not a discussion anymore today.

That looked quite good and at least as measured by immunogenicity seemed to achieve levels that were consistent with 100-microgram dose. 
So it's certainly something we're going to look at as to whether or not we could pursue a 50-microgram primary series. But how we get there will depend upon data that we don't yet have, right? So we will have to look at whether there are clear correlates of protection that we can use to bridge between those doses and/or we'll have to look at different populations in which we started those doses. As an example, this has been shared. We're evaluating 50 micrograms as a potential primary series even in pediatric populations. As you can imagine, you don't need perhaps as higher dose in younger people than you do in older ones. 
So there's a lot of things ahead of us in terms of looking at whether or not a primary series for 50 micrograms is possible. Certainly for a booster series, that is the top dose at which we're looking. And as we look forward, we'll continue to carefully evaluate whether or not we can adopt that as a target dose across all of our applications. But it will depend on data."

I guess what I'd say is it's a little early to start giving that kind of guidance for 2022. What I would say is that, if you look at our cost of goods and the cost of goods manufacturing thus far, we've been quite pleased with what we're seeing as we've ramped up production initially here in the U.S. We've seen, as I said, yields have been better than we'd foreseen as we did the initial planning. So that's obviously very helpful. 
And we reiterated today We think right now, the right planning assumption continues to be 20% cost of goods. As you move beyond '21, you get into a question of vaccines versus therapeutics. We think cost of goods manufactured will be very competitive for this product. And therefore, margins and gross margins will depend very much on price levels, which I think it's early to comment on. 
And then in terms of operating expenses, we are building out the company. We continue to do that. And as I mentioned, we -- while our overall operating expenses were quite stable at $0.5 billion in the first quarter. We do see that trending up as we now move through the year.

So the -1273 ramp has been constrained by manufacturing capacity. So if you look at this year, the only -- we ""only supply 100 million"" to those in Q1, which is an extraordinary number is because we are building the capacity. And so the way to think about it is, as Corinne and her team are working out to add new lines and to increase the capacity, the ramps of follow-on products will be much faster because today, manufacturing is slowing down the ramp. So I anticipate that as you think about the multivalent booster launches, as you think about RSV to CMV launch, we will not be on the back foot. 
As you know, as part of our 2020 budget that we did at the end of 2019, we did not plan for pandemic. We were supposed to be commercial several years down the road. And so the team has done a remarkable job to get to this point, but we are -- and we're going to stay for, I would anticipate all over year supply constrained. 
Corinne and her team would love to be able to sell more product because trust me, their phone is turning red hot by calls from around the planet and would love to be able to help protect more people, but we just can't because we were not planning a pandemic in 2020. So I anticipate that for variants and for new product launch, we will make sure that we are not capacity constrained, which is why the 3 billion supply volume that some people might think is maybe too aggressive. 
As I said in my remarks, the pipeline of the company is also going to pay with this. And so it is just behind the multivalent vaccine. So if you look at a couple of years out, and we're not building manufacturing for 6 months. We're going to be really happy to have that capacity so as we launch product.

I think for a company of what will be our size and scope and level of vertical integration, I think it's reasonable to expect that we'll continue to invest in our own capacity. And therefore, you can expect we'll have ongoing CapEx. Is it precisely in this range or somewhat above or below? I really wouldn't want to give you that precision as of yet because we're -- it's not that clear yet. But I think an ongoing CapEx trend will be appropriate for the company. 
In terms of the COGS, I think that's the right way to think about the cost of manufacturing this product. It will be impacted at some level by the amount of materials in the product. But when you're talking about micrograms of materials, it's really not that significant.

For the call, we propose to start first by looking back to fiscal year 2020 and then looking to fiscal year 2021. For fiscal year 2020, I will share a few slides to summarize the key elements of the year, before David shares with you the 2020 financials and also how we think about 2021 financial framework. For fiscal year 2021, I will share our business objectives and why we are so excited for 2021 and the inflection point this year will represent in our history. Stephen will start with an update on our approach to variance of concern and then Tal will provide an update on our clinical pipeline. 
2020 was a historic year for Moderna. We started in January as an early-stage development company. By the end of July, we had become a late-stage development company. And by December, we had positive results from our Phase III COVE study of our COVID-19 vaccine showing efficacy around 94%. Our COVID-19 vaccine was authorized by the FDA and Canada Health in mid-December and we shipped [ 80 million ] doses to the U.S. government and the Canadian governments by year-end. We laid the groundwork for a global organization, adding commercial subsidiaries in 8 countries, 8 countries. By year-end, we have signed $11.7 billion of advanced purchase agreement for our vaccine. 
A team of a little over 1,000 members did all that. And we also continue to invest in science to improve further our mRNA platform. And we also advance on 20 programs in development across 5 therapeutic areas. And we did it without a large global pharmaceutical partner. 
The Moderna team executed swiftly and superbly in carrying out the complicated Phase III study while achieving remarkable diversity. The Moderna team secured the authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine by regulators. The Moderna team built out our manufacturing capacity, scaling up across many manufacturing processes, partnered with Lonza, ROVI and Catalent, and shipped close to 80 million doses by year-end. For context, we had made less than 100,000 doses of medicine in 2019. This was roughly a 200x increase in 12 months. And we're on our way to produce as many as 1 billion doses in 2021 and more in 2022. 
In 2019, we had no authorized products. We had negative cash flows from operations every quarter. And we anticipated needing multiple capital raises over at least 5 years until CMV would produce sufficient revenues for Moderna to break even in terms of cash flows and become a self-sustaining company.  
In 2020, we had our first product authorized and our first product revenues in the last 2 weeks of Q4. We had 2 quarters of positive cash flows from operations. We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and with cash generation in 2 quarters. 
Moderna has been changed forever. Moderna has been changed in a profound way. Moderna is now a commercial company with subsidiaries in 8 countries and a direct presence in many more through commercial distributors and partners. 
mRNA is an information molecule. We have a powerful platform, and this is just the beginning. We have a scalable platform due to our investment in IT, robotics and AI over the last 7 years. We have an amazing team, as you witnessed by what the team accomplished in the 12 short months of 2020. And we have a capital to invest and scale. 
On Slide 6, you have a summary of the countries in which we received emergency use authorization or conditional approvals and all were -- started rolling submission that we did. 
On Slide 7, you get a sense for the commercial infrastructure that we built. For context, in May of 2020, Moderna did not have a single employee dedicated to commercial activities. We closed the year with 8 commercial subsidiaries, an incredible commercial team and commercial partners. We now have commercial operations in the U.S.; in Canada; in Europe, in the 5 largest markets, Germany; France; Italy; Spain; and the U.K. We established one in Switzerland, where we have both commercial capabilities to serve the Swiss market as well as manufacturing for geographies outside the U.S. with our partner Lonza and the support teams that we need in finance, HR, digital and legal. We have partnered with Medison in Israel and with Takeda in Japan. 
If you step back and think about it, this commercial network which we started building and will expand in 2021 is an incredible asset for the entire Moderna pipeline. We now have the infrastructure to commercialize all our products. These markets on the slide are some of the largest markets in the world. So by building the commercial network for the launch of our COVID-19 vaccine and deciding not to partner, we have actually financed and built the commercial network for all of our programs. 
We have become a fully integrated company, and in 12 months, proved that we're capable of running complex Phase III studies, scaling up manufacturing to commercial level, making hundreds of millions of doses per year and building our own commercial network. As I said, the Moderna team did an amazing job in 2020. 
On Slide 8, you get a glimpse of what Moderna looks like in February 2021. While most people in the world think of Moderna as a COVID-19 vaccine company, this is just the first product that we are launching. We have a platform, and our molecule mRNA is an information molecule. This is just the beginning. 
We are going to soon start a Phase III study for vaccine against CMV, cytomegalovirus, the #1 cause of birth defect. There is no approved CMV vaccine on the market. The pharma industry has strived for around 20 years to make a vaccine against CMV. This is a complex virus, a vaccine of 6 mRNAs per dose, over which are 2 from a complex protein called pentamer. We believe that CMV vaccine will present potential annual peak sales between $2 billion and $5 billion. 
We have 3 programs in Phase II of personal cancer vaccine in melanoma or OX40 ligand in ovarian cancer and injected in patients' hearts, post heart attack, to revascularize their heart with new blood vessels. We have had 12 positive Phase I results. 
In addition to our COVID-19 vaccine, we have 8 infectious vaccine candidates, all for first-in-class vaccine like against CMV or what we believe could be a best-in-class vaccine like with influenza. But we also have a remarkable therapeutic pipeline. We have candidate therapeutics in immuno-oncology with 5 medicines in the clinic, 4 in rare disease program, 2 cardio program and 2 autoimmune disease programs.  
If you think about it, Moderna is going after the 4 leading cause of death by disease area: infectious disease; cancer; cardiovascular disease; autoimmune disease. The total addressable market is very large. We are not a COVID-19 vaccine company. 
We're investing in science and leveraging our scalable platform to take more candidates from our research lab to clinical development soon. So stay tuned for that. We announced yesterday that we are increasing our base manufacturing plant for the number of COVID-19 doses we will produce in fiscal year 2021 from 600 million to 700 million doses, given the strong start of our U.S. operation and initial ramp of our outside-the-U.S. operation. Our team is still working hard to get us up to 1 billion doses for fiscal year '21. 
Now let me turn to David for Q4 and fiscal year 2021 financial framework. David?"

Before reviewing the financial section of the slide deck, I want to comment on the approach we've taken sharing this information. This starts with the 3 Cs, these being clear, complete and comprehensible. Today, we are presenting our results primarily on a U.S. GAAP basis. And in individual item level, in some cases, we also provide additional detail to provide greater clarity on underlying trends and to facilitate period-over-period comparisons in line with our 3C goal. 
Reflecting the continued uncertainties related to the course of the evolving pandemic, along with the many challenges and opportunities we face as a newly globalizing commercial company, we also seek to avoid implying an unrealistic level of precision concerning future financial projections in the face of a range of outcomes. With this background, we are providing today the analysis of actual 2020 results, along with a view of key drivers of the financial framework going forward. We will continue to update and refine this information as business evolves. 
Turning to Slide 10. I want to briefly remind you about some key accounting changes which we presented on this slide in our Q3 call in October. As a result of the successful transition to a commercial company, following the emergency use authorization by the FDA and Health Canada in December 2020, we began to record product sales. We also began to capitalize inventory based on the expectation these costs would be recoverable through commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine as opposed to expensing costs directly to R&D in the period incurred. And we also began to capitalize purchases of property and equipment and long-term lease assets as opposed to expensing costs in the period incurred through the lack of alternative use. 
With this context, let me turn now to Slide #11. Total revenue was $571 million for Q4 2020 compared to $14 million for the same period in 2019. Total revenue was $803 million for the full year 2020 compared to $60 million in the prior year. Following the authorization for emergency use by the FDA and Health Canada in December of our COVID-19 vaccine, we generated our first ever product sales. 
For 2020, we recognized $200 million of product sales for our COVID-19 vaccine, all in late December. Additionally, grant and collaboration revenue increased to $371 million in Q4 and $603 million for the full year, primarily due to increases in grant revenue from BARDA to accelerate development of our COVID-19 vaccine.
Now turning to cost of sales. We began capitalizing our COVID-19 vaccine inventory costs in December, starting after the vaccine was first authorized based upon our expectation that these costs would be recoverable through commercialization of the vaccine. Prior to the authorization of our COVID-19 vaccine, inventory costs were recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred. 
We expensed $242 million of prelaunch inventory costs in 2020. Hence, our cost of sales were only $8 million in 2020, comprised primarily of third-party royalties. If inventory sold during 2020 was valued at cost, our cost of sales for 2020 would have been $62 million or 31% of our product sales. 
Research and development expenses were $759 million for Q4 2020 compared to $118 million for the same period in 2019. Research and development expenses were $1.37 billion for the full year 2020 compared to $496 million in the prior year. The increases for both 3- and 12-month periods in 2020 were mainly due to increased COVID-19 vaccine clinical development activities, headcount increases, pre-launch inventory buildup and expenses associated with the equipment and lease facilities that were deemed to have no alternative use at the acquisition of such equipment. 
Selling, general and administration expenses were $79 million for Q4 2020 compared to $26 million for the same period in 2019. Expenses were $188 million for the full year 2020 compared to $110 million in the prior year. The increases for both periods were mainly driven by increases in personnel, outside services and start-up costs associated with preparation for commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally. We recorded a net loss of $272 million for Q4 2020 compared to $123 million in the same period in 2019 and $747 million for the full year 2020 compared to $514 million in the prior year. 
Turning to selected cash flow information on Page 12. We ended Q4 2020 with cash and investments of $5.25 billion compared to $3.97 billion at the end of Q3. The increase is primarily driven by $1.7 billion of customer deposits received in the fourth quarter for supply of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
On the top half of the page, we present information from our 10-K and 10-Q filings. And on the bottom part, we provide the quarterly trend and the cash deposits received related to supply agreements for our COVID-19 vaccine. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.03 billion for the 12 months ended December 2020, compared to net cash used of $459 million for the same period in 2019. The reversal from cash used to cash provided by operating activities is driven by total customer deposits. Cash used for purchases of capitalized property and equipment was $67 million for the full year 2020 compared to $32 million in 2019. 
Before looking forward to 2021, let me summarize a few areas from our 2020 results that are important to keep in mind when modeling 2021 financial performance. Starting with research and development and SG&A expenses shown on the top left quadrant of Slide 13. Prior to the authorization for emergency use by the FDA and Health Canada as a pre-commercial research stage company, Moderna expensed all costs related to the production of inventory as well as costs for property and equipment and lease expenses for current and some future contract manufacturing activities due to lack of alternative use. Adjusting for these items, which in the future would be capitalized and expensed as cost of sales, the underlying R&D and SG&A expense run rate for Q4 2020 was $0.5 billion for the quarter. 
Turning to the upper right quadrant of Slide 13. Cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, logistics and warehousing costs as well as third-party royalty costs. The reported expense in Q4 of $8 million reflects the fact that we expensed all inventory-related costs until authorization of our COVID-19 vaccine. If valued at cost or actual cost of sales, including initial ramp-up costs, would have been $62 million or 31% of product sales. The cash and investment balance reported as of December 31 was $5.25 billion, $2.8 billion of which related to cash deposits from customers for future supply of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
Lastly, let me comment on certain tax-related items. The significant investments in our research and development and start-up activities to develop the mRNA platform over the last decade has resulted in a net operating loss carryforward with the balance as of December 31, 2020, of $2.3 billion, up from $1 billion at year-end 2019. As of December 31, we maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets related to these loss carryforwards. We will continue to monitor the valuation allowance as we progress through 2021 and expect to utilize our loss carryforwards. 
With this context, let me now move to considerations for 2021, starting with an overview of advanced purchase agreements for our COVID-19 vaccine on Slide 14. We have disclosed advanced purchase agreements to supply our COVID-19 vaccine to 40 countries through the end of 2021, including the U.S. government for 300 million doses with options for an additional 200 million doses; the European for 310 million, with an option for an additional 150 million doses in 2022; plus 10 other countries, including Japan, Canada and South Korea, with announced doses totaling 186 million. 
We are thankful for the trust of governments around the world have placed in us to deliver a vaccine for their countries. All these agreements contain provisions for deposits and have contributed to our balance of deposits of $2.8 billion at year-end 2020. Negotiations with other countries are also ongoing, including with COVAX. 
Turning now to the 2021 financial framework on Slide 15. Already-signed APA agreements for expected delivery in 2021 reflect a total of $18.4 billion in anticipated product sales. Based on continuous progress to ramp up available supply capacity in our network, we have raised the lower end of our global manufacturing plan for 2021 from 600 million to 700 million doses at the 100-microgram dose level. Manufacturing is still working to supply up to 1 billion doses for 2021. Further, we expect a range of related -- of released doses in Q1 2021 of 100 million to 125 million doses and 200 million to 250 million doses in the second quarter. 
Our total cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing, logistics and warehousing and third-party royalties, as discussed previously. For 2021, we currently model total cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be approximately 20% for the full year, with some variation quarter-by-quarter, largely driven by the average selling price. We also expect Q1 reported cost of sales in percent of product sales to be in line with the full year average, including the benefit from the remaining 0 cost prelaunch inventory in Q1. 
Now let me comment on planned R&D and SG&A expenses. The underlying Q4 2020 expense run rate, adjusted for transitional items as discussed on Slide 13, was approximately $0.5 billion. We currently expect our quarterly reported expenses to increase on a continuous basis through 2021 compared to the Q4 2020 adjusted run rate. In Q1, we expect an increase in the low double-digit percentage range relative to the adjusted Q4 2020 expense run rate of $0.5 billion. We will provide additional updates going forward as our global business rapidly expands. 
I would also like to comment on how we think about modeling our tax rate. In 2021, Moderna will transition to taxpaying status as we deliver on our COVID-19 vaccine contracts to customers. As a U.S.-based company, we start with the statutory 21% tax rate. This is impacted by global sales mix to the extent that non-U.S. rates are generally lower than in the U.S and by recovery against our prior accumulated losses of over $2 billion. As we start the year, we expect the all-in 2021 tax rate to be in the mid-teen percentage level on an ongoing basis, including in the first quarter. We will update this view as our book of business evolves further. 
Lastly, regarding capital investments. We currently plan capital investment in the amount of $350 million to $400 million for 2021. Roughly half of the investment is to further expand our COVID-19 vaccine supply capability, including supply capacity up to 1.4 billion doses at the 100-microgram level, with the balance of planned capital investments to expand our technical development, clinical manufacturing as well as our other facility footprint. 
This concludes my remarks concerning the financial performance, and I turn the call back to Stéphane."

Let me now discuss 2021 on Slide 17. We are still in February, and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is now authorized in 37 countries, and our team is continuing to engage regulators in new geographies, like Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and more. We're also well on our way in the rolling submission process to the WHO, which will be key for low-income countries access via COVAX and UNICEF if we get the partnership done. 
We are committed to our principles of global access to our new class of medicines, where we recognize that the need for scale up of manufacturing operations have led to supply going to the U.S., Europe and other countries. We are working with COVAX to provide low-cost vaccines to the poorest countries and look forward to supplying our vaccines for COVAX Gavi and becoming a company that will be part of the global health infrastructure for many years to come. UNICEF is the procurement arm of COVAX. 
On Slide 18. As I shared in my 2020 shareholder letter, which we posted publicly on January 4 and which you can access on our blog if you have not read it, I believe that 2021 is going to be the most important inflection year in Moderna's history. You can see the evolution of the company over 2019, 2020 and 2021 on this slide over a few dimensions. But to me, the reason I say that 2021 is the most important inflection year in the company's history, is that we are not the same company. As I've told our employees in a recent town hall, I almost wished I could change the company name to help our team understand the magnitude of the change. 
We used to believe that mRNA vaccine could be authorized and become commercial. We used to have negative cash flows from operations each quarter since our founding in 2010. We used to work to raise additional capital regularly and thought we needed to do that for another 5 plus years until CMV will get the company's cash flow breakeven. But we have been through an incredible pivot. This is not the same company. 
Now we know that mRNA vaccine can be authorized and become commercial. Now we have positive cash flows from operations for 2 quarters in a row already. So now we are going to double down on our investment in science, in process development, in manufacturing, in IT, in robotics, in AI to scale our company. 
I believe that in business, there's a drastic difference between believing in an outcome and having negative cash flow versus knowing an outcome and having positive cash flow. Our appetite and our ability to invest has been transformed. We are not the same company now that we were in the last 10 years. Our thinking is going to be much more expansive. 
On Slide 19. As David shared a moment ago, we have, as of yesterday, already $18.4 billion of signed advanced purchase agreements for fiscal year 2021 deliveries. We still have multiple discussions ongoing about additional APAs for 2021. So these have not been signed yet, so they are not counted in the $18.4 billion. We'll update you each quarter about the signed APAs for fiscal year 2021 as we report sales recognized with the shipment of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
We increased our manufacturing base plan for the year to 700 million doses and are working hard to get to 1 billion. We are working with COVAX and its procurement arm, UNICEF, to maximize the availability of our vaccine around the world. 
Let me now turn to Slide 20 to talk about 2022 manufacturing capacity. We announced last night after the market closed that several factors have led us to decide to add more manufacturing capacity. First, many governments have been telling us that they now see 2 classes of COVID-19 vaccine based on efficacy, and they would like more of our vaccine given its high efficacy. Second, variants. Government and political leaders around the world are concerned about the emergence of several variants. They have been very clear about it, and some of them have started to request options for 2022.  
With the start of the fall season soon in the southern hemisphere, with a large population of the world and with a large population of immune-compromised patients, like HIV-positive patients, we're hearing daily that governments around the world and the COVID teams worry that boosting people with variants will be an important strategy over the next couple of years to get this virus under control. 
So we decided to add manufacturing capacity. We have communicated previously that our capacity for 2022, given the ramp in 2021, will be approximately up to 1.2 billion doses, assuming 100-microgram dose. We have decided and have started to buy additional capital equipment, hire more people and order more raw materials towards 200 million doses per year of capacity for 2022. So if you assume a 100-microgram dose, we will have 1.4 billion dose of capacity for fiscal year '22. In other words, we will build the manufacturing capacity to make up to 140 kilograms, yes, kilograms, of formulated mRNA in 2022. 
Now let's talk about output in number of doses. Two factors determine output: the dose of a boost; and the product mix. Given our COVID-19 vaccine, previously referred as mRNA-1273, is currently authorized for 100-microgram dose. So with using the boost like mRNA-1273.351, the South African variant candidate, needs 50 microgram per dose. On the bottom left of the slide, you see a scenario in which 100% of our output is our COVID-19 vaccine authorized, and we get 1.4 billion doses at 100 microgram. On the bottom in the middle, you see a scenario where we sell 1 billion doses for COVID-19 authorized vaccine and 0.8 billion doses for boost at 50 microgram for a total of 1.8 billion doses. And on the bottom right, you see the marks and -- another scenario on the right. 
The way to think about output will depend on the dose of the boost and the product mix. We will learn in the next few months in the clinic about the necessary dose to get a high neutralizing antibody titer for our boost. Only, one needs to think about our manufacturing capacity in terms of mass. Given the flexibility of mRNA, we can, in the same room and with the same equipment, make COVID-19 vaccine and/or 1 boost, and/or are 2 boosts, and/or 3 boosts, you get the point. We can run manufacturing campaign based on the market demand with the same manufacturing capacity, just like small molecule drug substance. 
So with mRNA, we not only have the advantage of speed, but we also have the advantage of manufacturing flexibility and we have best-in-class efficacy. I believe this will prove crucial from a competitive standpoint for the years ahead, where nobody knows where the demand mix will have to be. It's a new and still unstable virus. Nobody knows if 1 variant is going to be necessary and/or enough to boost or more in the years to come until this virus is fully under control. 
So speed to market and flexibility of product mix and scale will be critical. We have all three. Few companies do. And we also, without the partners, we don't have to get aligned with somebody else with different goals, different financial incentives, different corporate decision-making process, different culture. We have moved fast, and we will continue to move fast. 
On Slide 21. In 2021, we are continuing to scale our commercial network. We plan to open commercial subsidiaries this year in Japan, South Korea and Australia. I look forward to planting the Moderna flag in Tokyo, Seoul and Sydney. We also want to continue to help regional distributors. We are in advanced discussions with partners to cover ASEAN and also Eastern Europe. With this addition in 2021, we will have a strong commercial network across the world in most critical markets by the end of this year. 
On the next slide, we were delighted to announce earlier this year that Corinne Le Goff has joined as Moderna's first Chief Commercial Officer. Corinne's experience in global commercial leadership, until recently at Amgen, but also her critical experience as Country Manager at Roche and her experience with digital marketing will prove invaluable. 
I have had the chance to spend a lot of time with Corinne since she joined, and I'm confident she will build a Moderna commercial organization highly leveraged with digital solutions, both externally and internally. We both share the view that there are many ways to run commercial operation in a much more modern way than traditional sales force of large pharmaceutical companies. In commercial, too, Moderna will disrupt and innovate and implement best practices from many industries and build a digital commercial organization. Corinne will have a chance to share some her thoughts and present to you at our Vaccine Day on April 14.  
This morning, we also announced that Tal, our Chief Medical Officer, will be leaving the company in late September after 6 years of service. Tal joined us when we were a preclinical company and now we have our first authorized product. I am very thankful for Tal for taking a chance on us 6 years ago. It was not obvious at the time, trust me, that we were going to make it. But given his deep scientific understanding and curiosity like Stephen Hoge and I and many others on the team, he saw that this technology could change medicine if we could make it work safely in humans. 
Tal, thank you so much for everything you have done. It has been a pleasure of building Moderna with you and the team. I look forward to continuing working with you in the coming quarters. 
The company has retained Russell Reynolds to recruit a new Chief Medical Officer with global and commercial experience as the company scale up to launch the COVID-19 vaccine, of course, around the world, also prepares for potential COVID boost and prepares to file several biological license over the next few years. 
With this, now let me turn to Stephen to talk about SARS-CoV-2 variants. Stephen?"

Today, I want to take you through our current thinking on variance and our strategy to address them. I'll then turn it over to Tal to provide an update on our pipeline. Let me start with a quick overview",558,"Thank you, Stéphane, and good morning, everyone. Today, I want to take you through our current thinking on variance and our strategy to address them. I'll then turn it over to Tal to provide an update on our pipeline. 
Let me start with a quick overview of our strategy for SARS-CoV-2 variance of concern. Last week, we published a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine with data that confirmed the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, provides neutralizing activity against all variants of concern tested to date. Nonetheless, as recent reports have increased transmission and potential reinfections of the new variants have emerged, out of an abundance of caution, we have announced multiple strategies to try to increase protection against those variants. 
As has been widely reported, the immune response generated by original strains appears to be relatively weaker against the B.1.351 variant. If or when immunity wanes in the future, this might lead to a gap in protection. We plan to close this potential gap with an update to our vaccine based on the new strains. We anticipate different approaches for 2 distinct populations. 
For those who have been immunized or infected by the original strains, we anticipate boosting with a variant-specific booster vaccine, either alone or in combination with our vaccine against the ancestral strains. For those who are still naive to SARS-CoV-2 because they have not been previously infected or vaccinated, we anticipate updating our vaccine to provide immunity to both the ancestral strains and the new variants of concern. 
Now on Slide 25, you can see the clinical trials that are ongoing or planned for our COVID-19 vaccines. For mRNA-1273, the TeenCOVE Phase II/III study in adolescents ages 12 to 17 years is ongoing and recently completed enrollment. The KidCOVE study, Phase II, in pediatric populations ages 6 months to 11 years, will begin in the near term. And our Phase I/II study in Japan is ongoing, led by our partner, Takeda. 
For the variant studies, we plan to test a variant-specific booster candidate, mRNA-1273.351 based on the B.1.351 variant, first identified in the Republic of South Africa at the 50-microgram dose level and lower. In addition, we plan to test a multivalent booster candidate, mRNA-1273.211 that combines mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 in a single vaccine, again at the 50-microgram dose level and lower. And we're also evaluating a third dose of our authorized Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, at a 50-microgram dose level, which is already underway.  
Finally, we are planning to test the next-generation vaccine, mRNA-1283 that encodes for the receptor binding domain and end terminal domain of the spike protein and is being developed as a potential refrigerator stable mRNA vaccine that could facilitate easier distribution and administration in a wider range of settings, including potentially developing countries. 
We believe messenger RNA is best positioned to address the potential threat of SARS-CoV-2 variance, given several key characteristics, including high vaccine efficacy, speed and agility to make updates, ease with which we can do combinations and our manufacturing flexibility and scalability. I'm happy to say that we have already manufactured the first GMP batch of our variant booster candidate, mRNA-1273.351, and have shipped clinical trial material to the NIH for clinical testing. 
Now I'll hand it over to Tal, who will walk you through the rest of our portfolio across vaccines and therapeutics. Tal?"

With 4 other vaccine programs that are in clinical trials, the CMV vaccine is on track to start the pivotal Phase III this year. The Zika vaccine is preparing for a Phase II trial that is also expected to begin in this year. And our hMPV/PIV3 vaccine is currently enrolling in toddlers. Our RSV vaccine is being studied in 2 separate trials, 1 in children and 1 in adults. The pediatric trial is enrolling quickly, and the first 3 cohorts in the age de-escalation study have now been fully enrolled. We announced last month that we were taking our RSV vaccine into the adult population, and I'm happy to share that the first participant has since then been dosed in that trial. 
Just last month, we announced 3 new development programs in infectious disease vaccines. Our influenza vaccine program will evaluate 3 candidates comprising multiple antigen combinations against the 4 seasonal viruses recommended by the WHO, eventually moving 1 candidate into a Phase III trial.  
Our HIV vaccine program has 2 approaches. mRNA-1644 is a collaboration with IAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. It's a novel approach to an HIV vaccine strategy that's designed to elicit broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies. mRNA-1574 is a collaboration with the NIH, and this includes multiple native-like trimer antigens. 
And finally, for those unfamiliar with the Nipah virus, this is a zoonotic virus transmitted to humans from animals, that is either transmitted in food or through direct human-to-human transmission. It is included in the WHO R&D blueprint list of epidemic threats needed for urgent R&D action. mRNA-1215 is a collaboration with the NIH to develop a Nipah vaccine. 
We also have 7 clinical proof-of-concept trials ongoing in our exploratory modalities. The Phase II program in VEGF, partnered with AstraZeneca, is ongoing. The personalized cancer vaccine Phase II, which is in combination with KEYTRUDA compared to KEYTRUDA alone, that is partnered with Merck continues. And the Phase I of that program in multiple cohorts is ongoing, including the upsized head and neck cohort that is currently recruiting additional patients.  
The KRAS Phase I that is partnered with Merck continues. And in the intratumoral oncology, we have a Phase II ongoing with OX40 ligand program in ovarian cancer patients. The Phase I dose escalation for the triplet program is ongoing both as monotherapy and in combination with durvalumab. And IL-12 partnered with AstraZeneca continues in a Phase I trial. Finally, within the systemic intracellular therapeutics, the Phase I/II sites for our PA program are being initiated, and we plan to enter the clinic this year. 
This final slide has our full pipeline. And with that, let me hand it back to Stéphane."

Priority #1, to maximize the impact of our COVID-19 vaccine. The output in 2021 in terms of number of dose that we can ship to countries, the manufacturing scale-up, preparing for 2022 supply, clinical development of variants and boost, and our full commitment to bring variants of concern to the clinic. Priority #2, accelerate vaccine development and continue to bring more innovation from a research lab to clinical development. 
Priority #3, generate proof-of-concept in therapeutics, based on the success of our ability to repeat dose in human of therapeutics technology with chikungunya antibodies. But also with intratumoral, we expect key data in cardiology, oncology, rate genetic disease and the entry in the clinic of our first autoimmune programs. Priority #4, we want to continue the expansion of mRNA technology. Our appetite to invest in science and process development has not weakened, just the opposite. We believe we are still at the beginning of the S-curve of this exciting new disruptive technology. 
On Slide 33, as I shared earlier, this is an important inflection year for the company, now that we know that mRNA vaccine can be approved, that we have positive cash flow, we have the ability to invest and to scale like we've never had in our history. 
If you look at Slide 34, you see some of the key attributes that energized me. mRNA is an information molecule, Moderna has a unique platform. We have a very strong cash position. We have signed very large amount of APAs. We believe Moderna will be cash flow positive this year. We believe Moderna will be profitable in 2021. The team has done a remarkable job, and I'm so proud of this team. We have a fully integrated manufacturing plant in Massachusetts and the network of partners with Lonza, Catalent, ROVI, [indiscernible]. We have already made 100 million doses of drug substance of the COVID-19 vaccine. We have shipped approximately 60 million doses globally. And as the team reviewed, we have 24 exciting first-in-class or best-in-class development programs that we are pushing towards the clinic -- sorry, for approval. 
As our historic investors know, since I've joined Moderna as employee #2 in 2011, we have always focused on how do we grow 10x from where we are. We ask this question to ourselves regularly. I have to admit that in 2020, I did not focus on it as intensely as in the previous years. We were focused on moving mRNA-1273 to Phase I, Phase II, Phase III regulatory authorization and on building manufacturing to deliver up to 1 billion doses for 2021. 
We did not spend much time asking how do we grow 10x? We were focused on how do we get this important vaccine to the finish line and get up to 1 billion dose to help people around the world. In early December, while our team was focused on preparing for FDA VRBPAC meeting on December 17, I was starting to step back and engaged with the Board and some of our executive team members and asked all of them, ""Now that we know mRNA vaccine can get approved and that we are generating cash, how do we grow 10x from here?"" 
The last 2 months have been really fun to invent that 10x Moderna. The team is highly energized by it and so am I. We have the opportunity to become one of the most impactful biopharmaceutical company over the next 10 to 20 years in the world. The potential to maximize that impact on patients is what motivates us. 
The team and I look forward to welcoming you to our regular investor events. We will host our Vaccine Day on April 14. We will host our annual Science Day on May 27. And we will host our annual R&D Day on September 9. 
More than ever, we have a unique opportunity to have a very large impact on so many lives. This is humbling to all of us and also highly motivating to always challenge ourselves to build the best version of Moderna that we can. I would like to thank our Moderna team, our partners, our many suppliers around the world, our clinical investigators, our participants in our clinical studies. I would also like to thank our investors for your trust as we embark in this new version of Moderna.

And so I think we're quite optimistic that a substantially lower dose is necessary because the immune system has already been primed and boosted once. And this is just maturing and updating that immune response to a new variant. 
And I'll note that we've shared our Phase II data, which does show that we see at 50 micrograms, even in a primary series, really good neutralizing antibodies. And so I think we're quite optimistic that 50 micrograms or lower will suffice as the third dose booster."

There's been data, I believe with a malaria vaccine that was published a while ago that showed that if you come in months later, you can come in with a much lower dose and that is sufficient to provide a boost. So in the context of wanting to maximize the ability to provide a benefit from whatever given capacity, I think that strategy makes sense. On top of which, as Stephen alluded to, it could be that even 50 micrograms as a priming series could suffice. Recall that our dose at 100 supersedes what you see with natural infection in terms of neutralizing antibodies to begin with."

On the second question, Matthew, as you know, we have been cautious about talking about supply for the year, and we have raised the number as we have understood better the learning curve of the process, as we've had the lots made and being able to see the demonstrated output. I think it's important to always appreciate this is a new [ technology ] we have never made and nobody in the world has made at that scale so fast. 
And so it's important for people to understand, we invested and built the manufacturing capacity, the ability to make 1 billion dose. The piece, having worked myself in manufacturing at commercial scale, and of course, you know Juan Andres, who runs manufacturing -- used to run manufacturing for Novartis worldwide, there are so many unknown at this stage that as we learn more, we are upgrading our numbers. As you know, last year, early in the process, we said we feel comfortable we'll get at least 500 million dose of the 1 billion of infrastructure capacity. 
Then we raised it to 600. With what we have seen out of the U.S. supply chain, the -- as you know, Europe is around 3 months behind the U.S. because of when we started building it. We did not have a Norwood-like site in Europe, as you know. We feel good about what's happening in the U.S. The team are doing really a remarkable job. And so we feel comfortable today to up what we call our base case. We feel very comfortable that we will deliver 700 million doses. 
The team is working extremely hard to get to 1 billion dose. They know that every extra dose we can get out of Moderna supply chain will be used and will help protect people. So you have our full commitment to do everything we can to get as close as we can to 1 billion. But at this stage, what we're saying is we feel very comfortable we can deliver 700 million, base plan. And we are still working through the upside, and I will not bet against the Moderna team to be able to do better. But at this stage, 700 million is the base."

But if you look forward and say at some point in the future we're going to be perhaps in a regular boosting environment, what would be the ideal vaccine, it seems logical that a vaccine that provides the broadest immunity, so not just against ancestral strains or a boost against the new strains would perhaps be the best mode.

The current assumption is that we should be able to move even without a correlate, and that is consistent with the recent FDA guidance on the development of a variant vaccine. I think if there does emerge a correlative protection, it will make everybody's life easier, especially those coming up in our footsteps in terms of licensing new vaccines.

We do think the clinical program for testing this is pretty straightforward based on the recent FDA guidance and other public comments. It's likely to be in the hundreds of people and immunogenicity and safety as important endpoints there. But ultimately, that will be subject to discussions with the FDA. And so we think we could get to clinical data here relatively quickly. Then we'll be able to demonstrate the potential for a booster vaccine to close a potential gap in immunity. 
As far as production, that will depend a lot on the demand picture and possibly that data.

It only recognizes the protein that we teach the body to make. And so I believe that our vaccine platform is optimally suited to boost, irrespective of what primary series somebody got, whether it was a protein mRNA or, frankly, an adenovector. 
I think the challenge with the adenovector is for both the initial boost and certainly any work with variants down the road is going to be that the adenovectors generate significant immunity against the other components of the adenovirus and thus, have the risk of limiting the ability to translate the transgene. And therefore, if you look at the boosting delta, that is how much additional antibody levels do you get from a boost, with adenovectors, you can get a boost, but the magnitude of that boost is invariably less than the magnitude of the boost you get with an mRNA platform. And that is true just in the first boost. I suspect that if you needed to come with a third dose or a fourth dose or variant-specific vaccines, it would be challenging to get the requisite amount of specific immune recognition towards the new transgene."

So in terms of the mRNA-1283, it is correct. It is -- the fact that it is a shorter mRNA does help with the long term stability and does facilitate, we think, moving that into a refrigerated vaccine. It's not the only feature. As you'll know, we've had advantages on our mRNA platform based on our long history of working in it, for instance, that we're functioning right now already, as has been noted, in a normal freezer for up to 6 months and actually already doing 30 days with mRNA-1273 in a refrigerator post stalling. And so it's a benefit that we're already well on that path, even with just 1273. 
I think the second part of your question was, is it just the RBM, and 1283 covers both the RBD and the end terminal domain. And as has been widely reported, those are particularly important for neutralizing activity in the immune system against SARS-CoV-2 virus."

Look, I realize there's not much you can say on pricing beyond 2021. But as we think about your booster strategies that could be less frequent at lower doses as well as the greater supply of vaccines we should have on the market, balanced against the potential waning of the pandemic, are there scenarios where the price per dose could be either materially higher or lower than what we're looking at in 2021? 
And then my second question is from a modeling standpoint. Should we be assuming anything in the model above and beyond what was talked about today that could be owed to the U.S. government for the initial co-development of your COVID vaccine? Or is that what David was referring to with the royalties that are included as part of your cost of sales? And if so, should we just be assuming a generally stable rate going forward? Are those changed at all?"

Let me start maybe on pricing. So it's quite interesting because, as you know, this is public information, there are some vaccines that have been made available to governments at $3 per dose.

So it's quite interesting because, as you know, this is public information, there are some vaccines that have been made available to governments at $3 per dose. And as you know, we walked you through our pricing strategy back, I think, in August, on the Q2 call. The Moderna vaccine is priced much higher. 
And I think it comes down to a few things. And the most important one is efficacy. Governments care about saving lives. Governments care about getting the economies back on their feet. And so what we're hearing from governments, literally almost on a daily basis as we engage with our existing government contacts versus new ones that are calling us, is -- there starts to be very clear differentiations between the different products that are either available already or that are getting very close to authorization. 
And I wish, if I had a crystal ball last year, that we would have built more manufacturing capacity for '21. But I did not anticipate and I don't think anybody did that there will be such difference of efficacy between vaccine, that the mRNA vaccine will be such high performance. As you know, some countries decided to invest first to procure vaccine in adeno or protein technology because they were better understood. And as we know what happened in 2020 in terms of the clinical data, that has played a big role. 
So it's quite interesting that -- also seeing how people are reacting in the countries. If you follow the media, for example, in Europe, where several vaccines have been authorized. As you know, in U.S., we have as of today, I'm hopeful this will change soon with VRBPAC meeting tomorrow, but only to mRNA vaccine authorized in the U.S. 
But if you look at what's happening in some countries in Europe, also what's happening in different countries around the world, I think governments, because of essence, advisers and clinical advisers and because of really the aim to reduce the pressure on the health care system, in the hospitals. 
Also what is quite fascinating, and I'm sure you're all observing it, is that, at least the first time in my career, being 20 years in this business, that in the media every day, you hear about vaccines on TV, in the newspaper, online. And you have the product efficacy that are all over the news every day. This has never happened to my knowledge for any of our products. 
And so you have this very interesting phenomenon that's happening too, that you have the clinicians, the nurses, the pharmacists, but the consumers too, that are believing that those products are not all the same. And this, I think will be a very important differentiation as we move into '22, as we move more to a traditional commercial market, where it's not governments buying directly, but the traditional kind of retail channel. And the impact, I think, of the consumers' desire to ask for a product when he or she walks into a pharmacy or their GP's office will be quite significantly different from what we are used to with other products."

So in terms of the flexibility, as I described in my remarks, the only raw material that is different from let's say mRNA-1273 to mRNA-1273.351 is only the plasmid. The enzymes are the same, the lipid is the same, with the same equipment in the same rooms with the same people. So the flexibility of this technology is really incredible for people that have worked with recombinant, like I used to do at Lilly. And as you know, I trained as a biochemical engineer, doing neutrophil and E. coli production in bioreactors. It is literally, you come a week after we use disposable reactors, you get new consumable plastic bags and so on as your reactor. And here you go again, you just need to change -- take a different plasmid. Because we use disposable reactors and not stainless steel reactors you don't have to spend a lot of time doing cleaning, validation because we basically dispose of things. 
And so the flexibility is quite incredible. You just need a new plasmid. And so because -- so it's not a very expensive part of the cost of the total cost of the finished product that is filled in a vial, because you have to make the mRNA, you have to formulate it and you have to fill it in a vial, our doing a lot of plasmid at risk for variant is a great optionality for the company with very, very [ seldom ] payment. 
So that's a piece that I think makes this technology very unique on the ability to scale and be able to be flexible to respond to different demand. Is there a world where we potentially might end up with a different combination of mutant boost on the road in different continents? Maybe. I don't know, again, it will be market-driven. But if it is what the market requires, we can accommodate that in a way that is totally atypical to what the industry could do and at the speed, which is, I think will surprise many. Because again, we make these other products in the same reactors. 
In terms of taking down the manufacturing capacity if we don't need, let's say, in '23 or '24, the same amount of volume because of a mass of boosting, as we say, it's actually interesting because, as you know, we have now good plants where we have quite a lot of capacity. But also, we have some capacity at Lonza, in New Hampshire and also capacity in Switzerland, where they have there several lines of manufacturing. So we have actually quite a lot of flexibility to take capacity down at Lonza, either in the U.S. and/or in Europe at different time points. So that's one point. 
The other piece we should not forget is the pipeline. And I will just make 2 comments, which I think are very important to understand why actually us building manufacturing to that scale is going to be so enabling to Moderna to keep growing and growing and growing. 
First is the other vaccines. CMV is ready to move into Phase III, as we said this year. We will give you updates on the flu program, but I will remind everybody that there is an approvable endpoint with the regulator for seasonal flu vaccines. And so we anticipate that the development of the flu program will be pretty quick. 
And as we discussed on previous calls, one of our kind of optimal target product profile for down the road will be a product that is both seasonal flu, with the current strain of flu, but also a boost for COVID-19 with the relevant strain at that time in the same dose. So we anticipate we should have high efficacy for flu as much as mRNA virus. It's a pretty straightforward virus like the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
And so that is where we are going. We have more vaccines coming to the market. And then there's also our therapeutic pipeline. And the piece, I think, that is actually quite good for us that we started with vaccine, the scale-up, is I go back to mass, which is if you think about some of our products, as you know 1273 requires 100-microgram per human per dose. But if you look at the chikungunya antibody program, that use the IV-formulated mRNA that we use also in the rare disease program, for example, what we showed is very good data at 0.1 milligram per kilo. So in a 70-kilo adult, it is 7 milligram compared to 100 micrograms. 
So as we move the therapeutic pipeline further into development, but especially to commercial, we're going to need much more mass of mRNA. And so I actually -- I'm spending a lot of time thinking, one, how do we keep adding capacity to manage the entire pipeline as it's progressing. We have the flexibility with Lonza, that's why we did it this way with Juan, so we are ready to take it -- take chunks down if we need to. But if I was a betting man, I would bet with you that we're going to be more adding than taking capacity down because of the probability of technical success. As I've said all along, I believe we will launch the CMV vaccine, given the data we have, the medical need and the biology we're able to do with both the pentamer and GB. And so I'm more spending time wanting to think about how do we do more."

So as we've said all along, which is why we gave a range and not one number for expected supply in the year, I think one number is a very dangerous strategy. As we said, those type of consumables are, of course, important. We are in a regulated business, and we cannot start to make a product until we have all the components, all the raw material, the entire train team and so on and so forth. So we have a lot of -- like in an airplane, you have to check a lot of things before you can start the engine. Well, in GMP manufacturing, you have to do the same to ensure the quality and the safety of the product.
And so, well, I think the team has done a very good job last year. And as you recall, we started racing against this virus in very early January. And it's in the late January time frame that we started to say, geez, this could turn into a pandemic. And we started to think bigger. And so, one, the team and I spent quite a lot of time as we were starting to think about, okay, how do we go -- if we had to make 1 billion dose in '21, how would we do that? I used to run the supply chain at Lilly globally. And we went right away to start to talk to our suppliers. 
And one other thing we had to do, and if you recall, we did an important capital raise in May of last year, which was very important for getting us to where we are today, in some suppliers. Because the increase of mass of product we're ordering from them was so gigantic, a thousand times more, even 2,000 times more than the year before. 
As you can imagine, many of them looked at us a bit funny and were very worried. They were worried that if the drug would fail, they might be in trouble, because they will have to get this type of increase of capacity to sometime, buy new equipment, hire more people, buy their own raw materials to make our raw materials for our product, if that makes sense. 
And so sometimes what we have to do with the team is actually to pay upfront the entire purchase of product so that they will go and take that cash and start to invest to prepare for scale up. So we took a lot of business risk last year that we thought were necessary to ensure we could deliver this year on the output from the manufacturing supply chain. 
So I think we're in a good place. Do we have from time to time, one component that give us a sleepless night because it's very tight? It's happening because the ramp-up the industry is doing is unprecedented. But so far, so good, and we are extremely on top of it, including as we do things like increasing capacity that we announced last night to right away, not only buy new machine, but right away, place new orders for raw materials and make sure we keep increasing our safety stock so that we run this more and more as a regular business where you have safety stock on site. So if your supplier has a bump in the road, a pump breaking or something else, that we are able to manage that variability, which is normally manufacturing without impacting our ability to maximize our own output."

So a few bit of colors on the $2 billion to $5 billion annual peak sale estimate that we talked about now a while ago. We talked about that as a company that never had run a Phase III at the time, that had never launched a product or get a product approved at the time, that had 0 commercial employee at the time. So we did the analysis with an outside commercial consulting company and with our strategy team and the team here that many of us have commercial experience. 
So we tend to be cautious, because as a new company we want to make sure that we build credibility and credibility in life has to be earned. And so I will just make the analogy to manufacturing in the sense, we built 1 billion of capacity, and we are very upfront to the financial community about it last year when we did so. But we said, look, given the unknown on raw material supply, given the unknown on yield, we feel comfortable we should get at least 500 million dose out. And then as we learned more, we moved it to 600. And as we learned more, we moved it yesterday to 700 million. 
So do I believe it is possible as we're going to sell more than 5 billion of CMV? Yes, I believe it's possible because it's an incredible unmet medical need. As the world develops, I think the piece one has to be careful about peak sales is peak sales when peak sales slightly up [indiscernible] peak sales 25 years after launch because those vaccines are like annuity-like products. There's, of course, inflation. There's, of course, developing countries that are becoming richer and richer. So is there upside to the number? I believe there's upside to the number.

And it's likely based on the current book of business that we would consume during the year the entire loss carryforward. So that's point one. 
Point two is from an accounting perspective, what happens is you basically project the full year tax rate, including the consumption of that deferred tax asset. And then you start accounting quarter-by-quarter based on that average of the full year rate. So it actually, from an accounting perspective, doesn't matter, the timing of the release of the NOL, the deferred tax asset and the valuation reserve. So that's why I tried to be clear with the mid-teen percentage, including in Q1, because from an accounting perspective, it will -- it would be stable unless we have some other changes that caused the full year rate to change as we move forward. Hopefully, that's clear."

I think we're -- as you noted, I mean, we had nearly or essentially 100% of efficacy against severe disease, 94% against moderate or any disease. And I think that gives us great optimism about the current 1273 vaccine that's been authorized is protecting and even if the new strains are slightly more virulent, that we'll be in good shape. 
I think the question, though, is at some point, you would expect coronavirus immunity to wane. And that's because in all of the human circulating coronaviruses, that's what happens. The durability here has always been a question. Is it 1 year? Is it 3 years? Is it 5 years? I think as you see new strains emerge, like the potentially concerning strains that we've been talking about, particularly in the Republic of South Africa and Brazil, you have to ask the question, is that -- what does that look like not just now, but what does that look like 6 months from now, 1 year from now, as we start to move into a mode where we're going to see seasonal epidemics of coronaviruses, which we already see for the other coronaviruses, and you would have to assume will happen with SARS-CoV-2. 
And it's for that -- it's those gaps in immunity that I think we're particularly focused on right now, which is, to what extent do you -- to what extent in the future do at-risk populations emerge with increased risk against these new strains? It's not something you can see in the data in the first 30, 60, 90 days post vaccination in the current clinical trials. But it's something that you -- we did talk a lot about last year, and I think it's going to continue to be something we have to track closely as we look ahead."

And if we can, we will be providing updates as well against the new strains. 
I think what we're saying about the variants and strategies against it is -- I think none of us want to be in a situation where we wait until there are reinfections and increased morbidity and, God forbid, more mortality in a seasonal epidemic, for instance, this winter in the Northern Hemisphere, this coming winter. And then say, okay, now it's time to be boosting people. 
And so as we're continuing to face an evolving virus that is changing its stripes and perhaps decreasing the durability of our immunity, we're trying to be very proactive with the 3 strategies we described. And I think we'll continue to follow things like the data that you pointed to, which is how are we doing in terms of immunity and blood of people who've previously been vaccinated or previously infected. We'll obviously closely be following reinfections. And then I think we all have to be following very closely what's happening in the southern hemisphere, because as they move into their winter and a potential seasonal spike in the winter as you normally see in temperate climates, it will help us understand to what extent are we still in a -- we have to stay ahead in the concerning phase of this epidemic or pandemic or is it a place where we start to get more and more confident that the vaccines have the virus under control."

Welcome to our Q2 2021 conference call. Today, I will start by a quick business review over quarter before Corinne walks you through the commercial update. David will present the key financials. Stephen and Jackie",832,"Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 2021 conference call. Today, I will start by a quick business review over quarter before Corinne walks you through the commercial update. David will present the key financials. Stephen and Jackie will provide a clinical update highlighting new human data, both final analysis for COVID-19 vaccine Phase III COVE study and human data for COVID-19 booster candidate Phase II. I will then come back to close to share some thoughts about where we are heading. 
Let me start with Moderna COVID-19 or Spikevax. We are pleased to announce today that our final analysis vaccine efficacy of the Phase III COVE study is holding very nicely at 93%. We are starting to get authorizations for adolescent indication 12 to 17 years of age, receiving authorization in Japan this week and the positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency in July. 
An important step towards our vision of an annual respiratory combination booster is the start of a Phase I/II for mRNA-1010, which is equivalent for seasonal flu vaccine. Our teams are already preparing the Phase II/III for this program. 
We were delighted to get fast track designation from the U.S. FDA for our vaccine candidate, mRNA-1345 in adults over 60 years of age. There is no approved RSV vaccine. The burden for RSV infection is very high. In adults over 65 years of age, according to the CDC, 177,000 of hospitalizations and around 14,000 deaths occur annually in the U.S. due to RSV. Our teams are also preparing a Phase II/III for this program. 
Our Zika vaccine has now moved to Phase II. mRNA-3927 for programmic acidemia, or PA, a rare genetic disease has also started building patients in our Phase I/11. And we are pleased to announce recently that we started dosing healthy volunteers in our first autoimmune disease program, mRNA-6231, coding for IL-2. 
So Moderna is now in the clinic in 5 large therapeutic areas: infectious diseases, cancer, cardiology, autoimmune disease and rare genetics diseases. We have a strong pipeline momentum and the research teams are working hard to bring the next wave of development candidates to the clinic. 
Moving to Slide 6. We have also a strong commercial momentum. Let me start by giving you an update about Advanced Purchase Agreements, or APA, for our COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax. 
For fiscal year 2021, we have now signed APAs for $20 billion versus $19.2 billion announced in our Q1 call. We are now capacity constrained for 2021 and we are not taking any more orders for 2021 delivery. 
For fiscal year 2022, we have assigned APAs for $12 billion. We have also signed an additional $8 billion in auctions. We are having numerous discussions ongoing as we speak with countries around the world to enter into new APAs for 2022. We'll continue to give you updates on a regular basis. 
What is very interesting to see is forward-thinking countries like Israel and Switzerland have already signed APAs for 2023 to ensure supply for the endemic market. 
On the financial front, we delivered $4.4 billion of revenue and $2.8 billion of net income. The cash generation in the quarter was strong at around $4 billion, bringing our cash balance to over $12 billion at the end of June. 
We're also announcing today our first share buyback plan. Our Board of Directors has authorized share repurchase for up to $1 billion. David, and I will give you more color in a few minutes. 
For 2021, we continue to forecast supply between 800 million and 1 billion doses. For 2022, we forecast supply between 2 billion to 3 billion doses, depending on the final dose approved by the regulators for our booster, at 50 micrograms up to 3 billion doses, at 10 micrograms up to 2 billion. 
As we continue focusing on scaling the company, I am delighted to have 3 new executive committee members who joined recently by start date of the company, Shannon Klinger as our Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. She joined us from Novartis, where she was the Chief Legal Officer. Mr. Paul Burton, our Chief Medical Officer, he joined us from Johnson Pharmaceuticals, a Johnson & Johnson company, where he was Chief Global Medical Affair officers. And most recently, Kate Cronin as our newly created role of Chief Brand Officer. Kate was the CEO of Ogilvy Health. 
I look forward to working closely with Shannon, Paul and Kate as we scale Moderna to the next level. 
On Slide 9, you will find our usual summary slide. A few important things to note. We are not preparing Phase II/III for COVE seasonal flow and for RSV program. Our team continues to grow as we increase manufacturing capacity for d vaccine as we move programs from early stage clinical study to lead clinical studies and as we increase investment in research for the next wave of development candidate. 
Let me now turn to Corinne to give you a commercial update. Corinne?"
128680956,1674091533,2364404,"Moderna, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Moderna, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Stéphane, and good morning or good afternoon, everyone. I am happy to share the productive quarter the commercial organization has had in the second quarter that continues into today As we ramp up our efforts to supply the Moderna COVID-19 or",541,"Thank you, Stéphane, and good morning or good afternoon, everyone. I am happy to share the productive quarter the commercial organization has had in the second quarter that continues into today As we ramp up our efforts to supply the Moderna COVID-19 or Spikevax to countries around the world. 
Let me start by recapping the advanced purchase agreements that we have signed for delivery in 2021 on Slide 11. Since the last quarterly call, I am very happy to highlight that we have signed APAs with COVAX for 34 million doses this year, an additional 110 million doses to the USG, bringing the total of doses for the United States to about 400 million doses and 10 million doses to Australia for delivery in 2021. 
In total, we anticipate up to $20 billion in sales from these agreements as we deliver against them throughout the remainder of the year. We are proud to distribute our vaccine directly or through our network of partners across all continents and, most importantly, to ensure access to our vaccines into all countries regardless of their income level. notably through the COVAX facility structure. 
I also want to mention that we are doing our utmost to -- in supporting the U.S. government to execute the donations of Moderna doses vaccines. 
Slide 12 list outs signed APAs for deliveries in 2022 and even in 2023. The construct of the APAs signed for '22 and '23 include both confirmed orders as well as options to be triggered at the future date. 
To date, we have already contracted for 22 product sales of $12 billion and an additional $8 billion in options. Some of these APAs are for primary series, vaccines and others are for potential boosters. In light of the possibility of needing booster vaccines to increase immune responses against waning immunity and the emergence of variants of concern, Moderna has already started our COVID booster strategy that Stephen will speak to shortly. 
In the meantime, the commercial team is currently engaged in multiple conversations that are gaining urgency as we watch the Delta variant surge among unvaccinated populations. We are notably actively talking to many countries in South America, in Asia and in the Middle East. All these countries are keenly interested in securing both primary series vaccines or booster vaccines for their citizens next year. 
In the United States, as you know, Moderna has initiated the rolling submission process for approval and expects to complete its submission in August. This approval will represent an important milestone in achieving herd immunity as it might help combat vaccine hesitancy. It will also allow the commercial organization to stop preparing for the private U.S. market. 
Turning to Slide 13, which reviewed the sales breakout for the second quarter '21. Total product sales in the quarter were $4.2 billion, representing 199 million doses delivered in the quarter. Sales in the U.S. were $2.1 billion, representing 126 million doses delivered to the U.S. government and sales to the Rest of the World -- to the country that are listed on this slide were also $2.1 billion, representing 73 million doses delivered in the quarter. 
And with that, let me hand it over to David to take you through the financial details."
128680956,1674091533,2364404,"Moderna, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Moderna, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Corinne. We're providing today the analysis of actual 2021 second quarter results, along with an updated view of key drivers of financial performance going forward.

We're providing today the analysis of actual 2021 second quarter results, along with an updated view of key drivers of financial performance going forward. As in previous quarters, we are presenting our results primarily on a U.S. GAAP basis. In some cases, we also provide additional detail to provide greater clarity on underlying trends. 
Turn now please to Slide 15. The transformation of Moderna from an R&D-focused biotech to a commercial company is very apparent when reviewing our financial results. The comparison of the second quarter of 2021 to prior year is not as meaningful due to our dynamic growth, which is why we'll primarily focus on the quarter-over-quarter comparison relative to Q1 on this slide. 
Total revenue was $4.4 billion in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.9 billion in Q1. The increase of total revenue is primarily resulting from the sale of the company's COVID-19 vaccine. Product sales in Q2 were $4.2 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 142%. 
Cost of sales were $750 million or 18% of the company's product sales in the second quarter compared to $193 million in the first quarter. Research and development expenses were $421 million in Q2 2021 compared to $401 million in Q1 and $152 million in the same period in 2020. The higher spend versus prior quarter and prior year was driven by increased COVID-19 vaccine clinical development activities including our announced efforts around booster, variant-specific and multivalent vaccine candidates. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $121 million for Q2 compared to $77 million for the prior quarter. The growth in spending was driven by commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally with the biggest increases being in personnel and outside services. 
Provision for income taxes was $283 million in Q2 after $39 million in Q1 and an insignificant amount in the prior year. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 9%. 
Let me remind you of the following. The significant investments to develop the mRNA platform over the last decade, resulted in a net operating loss carryforward with a balance of $2.3 billion at the end of 2020. As of December 31, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets related to these loss carryforwards. 
As discussed in our last call, we started to release the valuation allowance this year. The majority of the allowance will flow through the P&L over the course of this year through our effective tax rate, pro rated based on the cadence of our expected pretax quarterly earnings. 
Over the course of 2021, the resulting nonrecurring benefit due to the release of the valuation allowance is about 5 percentage points on our effective tax rate. 
Our Q2 effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate, primarily due to the benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction as well as a discrete item for excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation. We recorded net income of $2.8 billion in Q2 after $1.2 billion in Q1, an increase of 128%. Diluted earnings per share for Q2 were $6.46. 
Turning now to year-to-date financial results compared to prior year on Slide 16. Total revenue was $6.3 billion for the 6 months ended June 30 compared to $75 million for the same period in 2020. The significant growth was driven by the sales of 302 million doses of the company's COVID-19 vaccine. Cost of sales was $943 million or 16% of the company's product sales for the 6 months ended June 30, including third-party royalties of $232 million. Reported cost of sales was reduced by 3 percentage points due to the consumption of previously expensed inventory of approximately $200 million. 
Research and development expenses were $822 million for the 6 months ended June 30 compared to $267 million for the same period in 2020. The growth in spending in '21 was largely driven by increased mRNA-1273 clinical development and headcount. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $198 million for the 6 months ended June 30,compared to $61 million for the same period in 2020. The growth in spending in 2021 was mainly attributable to the company's COVID-19 vaccine commercialization activities. 
For the 6 months ended June 30, we recorded provision for income taxes of $322 million compared to an insignificant amount for the period in 2020. Our effective tax rate for the 6 months ended June 30 was 7%. It was lower than the U.S. statutory rate, primarily due to the nonrecurring benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance, the ongoing benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction as well as a discrete item for excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation. 
Net income was $4 billion for the 6 months ended June 30 compared to a net loss of $241 million for the same period in 2020. Diluted earnings per share were $9.30 for the 6 months ended June 30, 2021. 
Turning to cash and selected cash flow information on Slide 17. We ended Q2 with cash and investments of $12.2 billion compared to $8.2 billion at the end of Q1. The increase is driven by our commercial sales and additional customer deposits received in the second quarter for future purchases of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in Q2 after $3 billion in Q1, totaling then $7 billion year-to-date. This compares to net cash used in operating activities of $130 million in the prior year. Cash used for purchase of property and equipment was $65 million for the 6 months ended June 30 compared to $25 million for the same period in 2020. 
Similar to last quarter, before providing an updated financial framework for the remainder of 2021, let me point out a few areas that are important to keep in mind when modeling expected '21 financial performance, starting with cost of sales on Slide 18. Cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, third-party royalties as well as logistics and warehousing costs. As you may recall, we began capitalizing our COVID-19 vaccine inventory cost in December 2020 following emergency use authorization. 
Prior to the authorization, inventory costs were recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred. In Q1, a 0 cost inventory balance of $184 million was sold and benefited our cost of sales. If inventory sold during the first quarter was valued at actual cost, our cost of sales would have been $377 million or 22% of product sales. 
In Q2, cost of sales of $750 million or 18% of product sales were no longer materially impacted by the 0 cost inventory, hence, the relevant comparison is the adjusted ratio in Q1. The reduction of cost of sales as a percent of product sales when comparing to the adjusted cost of sales in Q1 is primarily driven by a customer mix-driven increase in our average selling price during the second quarter. 
Now turning to our cash and investment position on Slide 19. The cash and investment balance reported as of June 30 was $12.2 billion, up from $8.2 billion as of March 31. The increase is driven by our commercial activities, including net increase in customer deposits for future product supply of COVID-19 vaccine. The net cash balance of customer deposits increased from $5.6 billion at the end of Q1 to $6.8 billion as of June 30. 
Turning to Slide 20. I wanted to share our capital allocation priorities. We seek to optimize our capital deployment and maximize long-term shareholder returns. Our top investment priority will continue to be reinvesting in the base business across multiple areas. For R&D, we have more than tripled spending in the first half of 2021 relative to the prior year, and we will continue to significantly increase spending in this area to advance and accelerate our pipeline. 
For manufacturing, we previously disclosed our 2021 capital expenditure plans, which will allow us to increase our production capacity. 
Additionally, we are investing heavily in digital, automation and AI as well as scaling up our global commercial operations which will allow us to maximize the impact of our mRNA platform. 
Our second investment priority is to seek attractive external investment and collaboration opportunities to further expand the reach of Moderna's technology and capabilities. We are considering attractive strategic opportunities that enable and complement our platform and take a disciplined approach in evaluating potential outside investments. 
After evaluating internal and external investment opportunities, we then assess additional uses of cash. As part of today's press release, we announced that the Board has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. This program is authorized for a 2-year period. Based on the strength of our financial results for the first half of the year and our confidence in our business outlook, we believe it is an appropriate time to initiate this program. 
Turning now to the 2021 updated financial framework on Slide 21. Signed advanced purchase agreements for expected delivery in 2021 reflect the current full year total of approximately $20 billion in anticipated product sales included the $5.9 billion of product sales already generated in the first half of this year. 
For the full year, we continue to expect a minimum supply of 800 million doses at the 100-microgram dose level. Our manufacturing team and our partners continue working to supply up to 1 billion doses for 2021. We have signed advanced purchase agreements for expected delivery in 2022 for total product sales of approximately $12 billion and options for an additional $8 billion. Numerous additional negotiations are still ongoing for 2022 APAs. We have also started to sign APAs for 2023. 
As we previously announced, we continue to make investments to increase our supply of vaccine, including by working with contract manufacturing organizations. We currently anticipate that our supply could be as high as 3 billion doses for 2022 if our sales are primarily at a 50-microgram dose level. If sales are primarily at the 100-microgram dose level, we anticipate that supply will be approximately up to 2 billion doses. The ultimate approach on dosage levels for 2022 and where we might end up in that range is subject to ongoing internal review as well as discussions with regulators and customers and will also be impacted by the mix of primary and booster series. 
Our total cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, third-party royalties as well as logistics and warehousing costs. For 2021, we now expect the average cost total of sales as a percent of product sales to be between 18% to 20% compared to our previous outlook of approximately 20% of product sales. This reflects the successful ramp-up of this global manufacturing network. 
With regard to planned R&D and SG&A expenses, Q2 expenses of approximately $542 million reflect a quarter-over-quarter increase of 13%, in line with the outlook we gave in Q1. We continue to plan for an increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis for the remainder of this year and expect this growth rate to accelerate as the business rapidly expands. 
Based on further increased visibility of the utilization of our accumulated net operating loss carryforward, expected global sales mix and the mentioned discrete benefits in the first half of this year, we now expect our all-in 2021 tax rate to be approximately 10%. This compares to our previous forecast in the low-teen range. This forecast is based on current U.S. tax policy and does not include any future potential discrete benefits related to stock-based compensation. 
Finally, regarding capital investments, we maintained our forecast for a range of $450 million to $550 million, including the planned capacity expansion investments as announced on April 29 of this year. 
This concludes my remarks, and I turn the call over to Jackie Miller."

So on Slide 24, a you'll see the top line updates to our COVE efficacy trial. And these are efficacy data that have now been followed through 4 to 6 months after subjects received their second vaccination of either mRNA-1273 or placebo. Recall that at the time of our EUA submission, our primary efficacy analysis demonstrated efficacy to COVID-19 of 94.1%. Now 4 to 6 months after second dose, we see a maintenance of that efficacy of 93.2% with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of 91%. We continue to maintain efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease with updated vaccine efficacy of 98.2% and currently have 100% of efficacy against deaths caused by COVID-19. So unfortunately, there were 3 deaths in the placebo group and up till now, none in the mRNA-1273 group. 
We continue to see consistency in our subgroup analyses, including analyses by gender, by race and by preexisting medical conditions. Our safety profile continues to be consistent with the Phase III data over the longer period of safety follow-up and also continues to be consistent across population subgroups. 
Next slide, please, on Slide 25. You'll see the efficacy data broken out by time interval. And so what you see at the top of the table is the overall efficacy we just discussed. According to the primary endpoint, we start measuring vaccine efficacy at 14 days after dose 2. And again, that's 93.1%. 
If you look between 14 days post dose 2 to less than 2 months after dose 2, we observed vaccine efficacy of 91.8% and 94% if you look 2 months after dose 2 to less than 4 months after dose 2. And finally, greater than 4 months after dose 2, we observed 92.4% efficacy. And the conclusion we take from these data is that our efficacy has remained consistently high and durable throughout the period of follow-up. And we intend to continue to follow these data that the trial is in its open-label phase. The reports will be different moving forward given that subjects in the placebo group have recently been vaccinated, but we think it's important that we continue to follow as subjects remain further out from their initial vaccination. 
So if you go to Slide 26, you'll see that these data have been consistent also in studies outside of the Moderna clinical trial. So we begin to see real-world effectiveness data demonstrate that Moderna maintains effectiveness consistent with what was seen in the COVE study. There are reports from Canada, from the United Kingdom and from [ Qatar], and importantly, these trials confirm that there is vaccine effectiveness not only against the Wuhan strain, but also against staging variance of concern, including the alpha, beta, gamma and delta variants, and this is even after partial vaccination or vaccination with a single dose. 
So if you move to Slide 27, I'm now going to hand over the presentation to Stephen Hoge, who will review our COVID-19 booster strategy and clinical data as well as a review of our pipeline. Stephen?"

I want to start with an update of our perspective on COVID-19 and how it's impacting our strategy for boosters. 
So first, our emerging perspective. we believe today that the increased force of infection that's resulting from the delta variant, fatigue with non-pharmaceutical interventions and the seasonal effects of moving indoors will eventually lead to an increase in breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. In fact, there have been reports of that already. 
While we see durable Phase III efficacy through 6 months, which Jackie just described, we do expect that neutralized hydros will continue to wane and eventually, that will impact vaccine efficacy. So given this intersection between a rising force infection and waning immunity, we believe a dose 3 of a booster will likely be necessary to keep us as safe as possible through the winter season in Northern Hemisphere. 
So how has that informed our booster strategy? Our primary approach since early this year has been to advance that portfolio of booster candidates against all of the potential emerging variants of concern and so we have a large number of ongoing clinical studies, and I'll provide some update on some today. Those boosters are being evaluated often at 2 different dose levels, 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms. And they fall broadly into 3 categories. First is our prototype vaccine mRNA-1273 for which Jackie just described the primary efficacy data out of our Phase III study. 
Second, we are looking at various specific booster candidates and now a new delta variant-specific. And third, we are looking at a multivalent platform, combining different variants into a single vaccine First, our mRNA-211 program and now a new mRNA-213 program, which includes the delta antigen. The goal of the multivalent platform is to continue to try and stay ahead of where the virus is going by combining different antigens against emerging periods of concern. 
So I'd like to provide a brief update today on the 3 pre-existing programs, mRNA-1273, our variant-specific booster candidate against the beta strain. 351 and our first multivalent vaccine. 211. 
Moving to Slide 29. I have the comparison of those 3 candidates from our Phase 201 study. So quickly, starting on the left-hand side, looking in the validated clinical assays. These are the same assays that are conducted by our collaborators at NIH that were used for our Phase III study and earlier clinical work. We can look at the wild-type virus neutralization of the 3 different booster approaches. Array left to right, you see our prototype -1273, our beta specific variant concern, -1273.3511 and the multivalent combination of -1273 and beta, which is MRNA-1273.211. 
As a reminder, all 3 of these were dosed at 50 micrograms. And what I'm showing you on the left-hand side is the pseudovirus neutralization titers in the validated assays. at day 1 immediately prior to boosting, day 29 and in some cases, day 15. 
Now all of the participants in the study, we have previously received the Moderna vaccine 2 doses just as Jackie had described. And at approximately 6 to 8 months after they had participated in 1 of our clinical studies, we offered them a chance for this booster. So you can see at the baseline day 1, 6 to 8 months after primary series, neutralizing titers are somewhat lower in all 3 cases. With a booster dose of vaccine, all 3 boosters, we were able to substantially increase the neutralization against the wild-type virus. As you can see, for 1273, 16.7 fold. Approximately 11-fold at both day 15 and day 29 for the beta variant concern; and 38 to 46 fold with the 211 multivalent platform. So that's against the infectional virus on the left. 
How do we do against the variance of concern? At the time when we initiated the study, we were particularly concerned about the B1351 variant that now it's named beta variant; and the P1 gamma variant. And what we did is we set up assays to evaluate the performance of the booster vaccine, 2 weeks after booster in all of those, and again, compared it against the ancestral virus D614G that we used elsewhere. 
What you can see in all 3 cases, when you compare the boosting that's happening and compare that to the level of titers, neutralizing titers that was seen in each of those groups of people, against their 2 months -- 1 month post their second dose, you can see strong boosting against all the variants of concern by all 3 booster strategies. In fact, it's very encouraging to see that -1273, our prototype vaccine, was able to increase titers against the 351 strain and the P1 gamma strain. 
Now as you look to the left, you'll see the level of boosting might be slightly higher with our multivalent platform, which is directionally higher titers, particularly against the 351 and T1 stream. But overall, the boosting remains strong across all 3 approaches. 
And as a result of this data, we've made the determination that against these variants of concern, we believe the prototype vaccine mRNA-1273 is more than sufficient as a booster and that there's no obvious advantage to working with the beta, including variant boosters at this time. It's also worth noting that the epidemiology has moved away from the beta variant of concern towards the delta variant of concern that we've spoken about extensively. 
So how did we do then in that -1273 against the delta variant concern. Moving to Slide 30. I'm presenting data here, which has been submitted for a manuscript. It's actually in press as we speak. 
Looking at the performance of 1273 over 6 months after primary series against the variance of concern. The third dose booster of 50-micron -1273, pseudovirus neutralization titers here in our research assays was shown. And just to orient quickly to the slide, we're looking against wild-type, beta, gamma and delta variants of concern. 
The data on the first 3 columns deals with the month 1 post-dose 2. So immediately following the primary vaccination series for which we have the really strong efficacy data that Jackie just described. And as you can see, we see high titers against the wild-type strain, 1,200 in this assay in this group and substantially lower titers against the beta and gamma variants of concern that has previously been reported. 
Following those subjects forward to months 6 to 8 after their second dose, what you can see is waning both for the wild-type virus, although it remains detectable levels of titers but also for the variance of concern, particularly beta gamma and delta. In fact, as you can appreciate in those middle 4 bars, beta, gamma and delta neutralizing titers had fallen below the detectable -- the level of detection of the assay for a decent number of participants in all 3 cases. 
Now the great news is that a 50-microgram dose of mRNA-1273 was able to boost against all 4 of those viral strengths. And 14 days post dose 3, we show the titers on the far right, again, all 4 bars. We saw 23-fold boosting against the wild-type strain to levels that are significantly above the level we've seen just after second dose, 1 month post dose 2, to saw a 32-fold boosting against beta; 43 fold boosting against gamma; and 42-fold boosting against delta. Again, all reaching levels that are significantly higher than previously seen. And that is very encouraging, and we think confirms our selection of the prototype booster as likely to be protective against the circulating variance of concern, particularly delta presently. 
So advancing that mRNA-1273 program at 50-micron booster into Phase II is something we did in parallel. And on Slide 31, I'm happy to provide an update on the Phase II results from that larger study of the prototype booster. 
So earlier this year, our Phase II study of mRNA-1273 was amended to offer a third dose of -1273 at 50 micrograms to all interested participants 6 months out from their second dose of the vaccine. A total of 344 participants elected to receive that dose. And the top line results are reported here, and we have a manuscript in preparation that we'll be submitting shortly. 
The results are generally consistent with what I've already shared from the [indiscernible] data. And that means that was that neutralizing antibody titers had wind significantly prior to boosting in 6 months, no surprise. 
At third dose, 50 micrograms of mRNA-1273 boosted neutralizing titers to levels that are above the Phase III benchmark. And again, this now being done in our clinically validated assays with our colleagues at NIH. 
After a third dose, similar levels of neutralizing titers were achieved across age groups and importantly, a subgroup analysis of older adults over the age of 65 so they were both able to boost significantly and achieve levels that are comparable to younger adults, which is really encouraging. 
And the safety profile following the dose 35 micrograms was similar to that observed previously for dose 2 of mRNA-1273. In total, we think this is really encouraging data on the potential for a 50-microgram booster of mRNA-1273. 
But moving to Slide 32, where does that leave us on our COVID booster strategy or a delayed third dose approximately 6 to 12 months after vaccination. But we believe a booster dose is likely to be necessary this fall, particularly in the face of the Delta variant. Our clinical data right now, we think, supports a 50-microgram mRNA-1273 booster, and we see no obvious advantage for beta containing variant candidates, driven both by the data I presented today and the evolving epidemiology We're going to wait for 100-microgram data in the coming weeks to confirm the dose selection of 50 micrograms as the booster before filing. 
So moving off from the COVID booster, I'd like to provide a little bit of an update on the other parts of our pipeline. So moving to Slide 33. We were excited to update today that mRNA-1010, our first seasonal influenza vaccine candidate has entered the clinic, and that -1010 is moving quickly towards -- in its ongoing Phase I/II study. I'll remind you that mRNA-1010 is a quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccine that's targeting the WHL recommended strength. And our vision is to eventually combine mRNA-1010 as a seasonal flu vaccine in a pan-respiratory vaccine booster for adult and elderly populations that combine flu, a COVID-19 booster and potentially our respiratory syncytial virus vaccine. 
Looking on Slide 34, across our infectious disease portfolio, beyond -1010, we have a number of other important updates. In our RSV vaccine, our positive interim Phase I data was announced at Vaccine Day earlier this year; and Phase I dosing in pediatric and adult vaccine is ongoing. We recently were pleased to announce that we received FDA Fast Track designation for adults over the age of 60 for this vaccine, highlighting the significant unmet need that we believe is there in this disease. 
Our hMPV/PIV3 vaccine, another multivalent respiratory vaccine, is in a Phase Ib trial that's currently enrolling in toddlers and the first cohort has been completely enrolled. Our CMV vaccine against a significant unmet need is on track to start its pivotal Phase III trial this year with roughly 8,000 participants. 
And lastly, our Zika vaccine Phase II trial is ongoing. We're currently enrolling patients in the United States and Puerto Rico. 
Moving to Slide 35. We beyond our expanding infectious disease item portfolio. We are advancing an mRNA therapeutics and now have 7 programs in ongoing clinical trials. 
In oncology, our cancer vaccines programs with Merck include the personalized cancer vaccine and KRAS. And we have 2 intratumoral programs in ongoing Phase I studies. One, a triple program ourselves; and an IL-12 program in combination with AstraZeneca. 
In our cardiovascular therapeutic area, we have 2 programs, the VEGF program ongoing with AstraZeneca in Phase II; and a preclinical Relaxin program. 
In autoimmune, we are excited to announce that we have started dosing our first patient in an IL-2 Phase I study, and that continues. And the PD-L1 program remains in preclinical development. 
And lastly, in Rare Diseases, we have been dosing for this year in our propionic acidemia program in Phase I; and MMA GSD1a and PKU programs are in preclinical, and we look forward to starting this in the clinic. 
Briefly on Page 36, you can see our expanding pipeline of clinical programs and the continued advancement across all of our therapeutic areas, but most notably of our prophylactic vaccines modality and infectious diseases. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Stéphane Bancel for closing remarks."

On this slide, we articulate how we have been speaking for many years now about using our mRNA platform to maximize our impact on patients. 
On the left, we now have 2 core modalities. For vaccines in blue, we have achieved authorized products; and for systemic secreted and cell-surface therapeutics in pink, we have achieved human proof-of-concept with our chikungunya antibodies, demonstrating we could get therapeutic level of antibodies, and we could repeat those successfully. 
In the middle, we have 4 exploratory modalities, which were in the clinic with 6 programs to understand if we achieve human proof-of-concept. Four medicines in immuno-oncology; 1 in cardiology; 1 in rare genetic disease. More coming in the coming quarters. 
On the right, you see 2 modalities which are not yet in the clinic, but for which we believe we have achieved an important derisking in nonhuman primates. Delivery of mRNA to the lung and delivery of mRNA into hematopoietic steam progenitor cells. 
Next slide, core modalities. In vaccine, we're focusing on bringing to market what we believe could be a game-changing respiratory vaccine that medicine would combine over time, COVID-19 sales, seasonal flu boosters plus RSV booster in 1 single annual shot. 
We have a great vaccine against COVID-19. Our clinical data have shown a high level of neutralizing antibodies, which has led the FDA to grant of fast track designation and quadrivalent flu vaccine is in the [indiscernible]. The flu market is 5 billion to 6 billion per year. Despite flu vaccine efficacy being [indiscernible] 60% in a year and down to around 30% in [indiscernible]. We believe we can do better with our mRNA platform given what we have demonstrated with COVID-19. 
The Moderna flu vaccine candidate could launch as early as 2023. CMV is now close to entering Phase II. And we continue to believe the market opportunity could be $2 billion to $5 billion per year. 
EBV should be in the clinic soon. There is no vaccine against CMV infection or EBV infection. 
So we are working towards moving the company from COVID-19 prime vaccination sales in 2021 to COVID-19 booster in 2021 and 2022 and beyond, and then adding through as early as 2023 and then [indiscernible] and launching CMV and the ABB. 
I am excited about this vaccine pipeline and how these vaccines could not prevent death, hospitalization and disease in billions of people over the years. 
Given the research team are not resting. We are working in our labs on more vaccine candidates and we cannot wait to share with you these new vaccine candidates in the future as we take them into clinical studies. This is where the power of mRNA as an information molecule and the industrialization and the digitalization of Moderna and our cash position will enable our teams to bring in potent vaccine to protect people at the scale and at the sales, not seem before in the domestical industry. In autoimmune disease, we aim to continue to scale that therapeutic area. 
Next slide, exploratory modalities, 6 clinical programs in 4 exploratory modalities. If we get positive clinical signal, we scale these modalities quickly as well. That's where the beauty of platform comes into play. 
Next slide, modalities in research. Vertical of our long-term mindset and our desire to maximize our impact on patients, we continue to invest in science to explore new modalities like the one in the lung and more recently presented at our Science Day in hematopoietic stem cells. 
In our lung program, we are both working on using mRNA to express a human protein in a cell that was our first Vertex partnership, but we are excited about our exploration of doing gene editing using mRNA to express a gene editing enzyme. That is our second Vertex partnership. 
Next slide. I believe that the uniqueness of Moderna is that we're expanding our impact on patients in 2 dimensions. We are expanding in 2 dimensions at the same time because we have built and industrialized our mRNA. Because mRNA is an information molecule, once we make a medicine work in a modality like the COVID-19 vaccine, then with the same 4 building blocks of life to make an other vaccine. So we scale within a modality really fast along the first dimension of the Y axis. 
On the second dimension is to keep expanding new applications of mRNA into new cell types on the x-axis. And we are doing both at the same time with different dedicated teams, all powered by our science for digital and our manufacturing infrastructure. 
David shared earlier of prime work for capital allocation, now that we are generating significant amount of cash each quarter. Our #1 priority as a company has always been and we continue to be to invest in the business. We continue to believe that we're in the early days of a new class of medicines, mRNA, and these small molecules more than 100 years ago, a large molecule 50 years ago are any indication for next 10 to 20 to 40 years are going to see a very large number of important medicines. And because mRNA is an information molecule, it would happen really fast. 
We aim to continue to build the world's leading mRNA company. So we're talking about the investments in acceleration of programs already in the clinic, investments in new development candidates moving from the labs to the clinic, investments in our platform to continue to improve the science and to include new modalities, investment in manufacturing, investment in commercial presence, including our digital commercial presence, investment in digital so we can scale our company faster and better than traditional biotech or pharma companies. 
Our second priority is to expand our horizons by complementing our platform with external technologies or products. This means we are interested in nucleic acid technologies, gene therapy, gene editing, mRNA. 
On the mRNA front, if we find new delivery technologies that could expand our current capabilities, we will look at them carefully. We would be interested in technology licenses and/or in development candidate licenses and/or if it makes sense, M&A. You can count us to be disciplined. We know what it takes to go from early research to filing regulatory agencies. And for having done it, we know the risk associated with new technologies and everything that works in the mouse will not necessarily work in a human. 
From a strategic standpoint, we are not interested in small molecule or large molecule development candidates, even if they could complement our commercial portfolio. We love information molecules too much to be interested in acquiring analog molecules, [indiscernible] molecule, large recombinant molecules or cell therapy. The share buyback is our first one. We are very optimistic about the future of Moderna and we are just getting started. Our Board of Directors will continue to regularly review that is the right thing to do to return capital to shareholders in light of our cash generation, balance against investments in our business and external investment opportunities. 
Let me talk now corporate responsibilities. It is very important for us to make a model of corporate responsibility and to build a sustainable business. Like everything we do, we don't just want to do things well. We want to do things in the best possible way. We were pleased to announce recently the establishment of our charitable foundation with an upfront [indiscernible] of $50 million with a significant focus on other sale populations. We are humbled to have been awarded the #1 spot on Fast Company 2021 for Best Place to Work for innovators, which complements our last 6 consecutive years of recognition by science as a top employer. Both awards reflect the importance we place on our employees and the culture of the company. 
Recently, [indiscernible] released its 2021 corporate reputation survey and the Moderna brand ranked third among 100 of the most visible U.S. companies, our first mention on the list and a higher shrinking for any biopharmaceutical company for corporate reputation. We have recently worked relentlessly with the U.S. government to facilitate donations of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to many low-income countries. And we are committed to minimizing our energy footprint. 
As I look through the next decade, the same north star is guiding us and since we started. We believe we have a responsibility to maximize our impact to protect healthy people and help patients. Our commitment is stronger than ever. This is just the beginning. 
We look forward to welcoming you at our annual R&D Day on September 9, whereas in previous years, we will do a detailed review of our development pipeline. The team and I will happy now to take your questions. Operator?"

We see very strong demand continuing in the context of the pandemic well into 2022. And hence, we've given you the range of 2 billion to 3 billion doses depending very much on whether our customers are still purchasing for primary series or if they're looking at boosters and then depending on the eventual dosage for booster. So I think it's really going to evolve as to exactly what that looks like in terms of dosage. 
Going beyond '22, as we said, we are starting to see now the forward planning countries that are looking beyond the very near term. We're starting to then have contract discussions and in fact, have agreed some contracts into '23. But I think it's early to really know as to how this is going to evolve in terms of the transition from pandemic to the endemic phase. 
In terms of pricing, I think it's helpful to start with where we are in 2021 to have a context for understanding pricing going forward. So really 3 buckets of pricing in 2021. We have the U.S. government where the first 100 million doses was priced at a little over $15. The subsequent 400 million doses were contracted at $1,650 million. And that pricing was considering a couple of things. 
One is the BARDA funding we received to underwrite our Phase III trial also the size of the contract, the 500 million dose contract, which is very large. 
The second category is the higher income ex-U.S. countries where, as we've said in the past, we start with a price range of $32 to $37. And there are some cases where we offer discounts based on volume, for high volume. And then the third category is low and middle-income countries, which have received the lowest tiered pricing, including those sales to COVAX, which are considerably lower than the price to the U.S. government. 
So if we start with that, framework for '21. What we can say is that the contracts that we've signed now for 2022, the pricing constructs are very consistent with that framework that we've had in 2021. And so we see a continuation in the context again of the pandemic with the pricing framework. If you look at the average price that you calculate in your model, of course, that's going to depend on the mix across these categories. And of course, we're expecting to see significant sales to the middle and low income countries and that increasing in '22. So it shouldn't be surprising if the average you see some declines. 
And then finally, I would just comment that as we move into a post-pandemic period, then we would expect, as we've said in the past, to market forces to impact our price negotiations. So hopefully, that answers your question."

And we've watched the space quite interestingly or quite significantly in terms of ways that we could help with delivering gene editing cargoes across a range of different tissues where our nanoparticles have been shown to go even in humans. And we think it's the right time for us to start to expand in that direction. If there's a general convergence, I think, out there in the gene editing space, is that messenger RNA and lipid nanoparticles are perhaps the way to go. And that's something we strongly agree with having spent the last decade working in the technology. So you'll be looking for us to bring new payloads, new capabilities, new enzymes into our existing technological capabilities, which we think are best-in-class."

Thank you, Matthew. So let me try and take the first question first. So I think we are going to always defer to what's happening with the public health officials in terms of when they think the appropriate time to recommend a booster vaccine is necessary. Where we see the data ourselves. I can't speak to the challenges they face. But what we see is the potential for waning immunity. In fact, if you look at -- back at our Vaccines Day, we had Professor Davenport,come in and present work that he's done at University of New South Wales in Australia showing what he predicted back in March would be the picture for waning immunity from the vaccine. It was recently published in Nature Medicine. I had a chance to open and it's looking remarkably prescient because the prediction he was making about the relative strength of the different vaccines suggested that small differences in efficacy would start to emerge to be larger differences in efficacy at about 200, 250 days as neutralizing antibody titers wane. And that may be what we're starting to see. And if you play that forward, if you assume he's been right about those predictions, then that picture continues and continues through a year. with continued declining -- neutralizing antibody titers over that time. And eventually, we therefore believe a real increase in breakthrough infections and disease even with vaccinated -- even with mRNA-1273. 
So we continue to want to be vigilant because that trend and those predictions, we think will come to 4. And I think the Delta variant has cost us to also be incredibly humble in the face of the virus' ability to fight back and increase its transmission. I mean, I think most of us would have thought SARS-CoV-2 was a pretty good infector earlier this year. Delta has shown us that it can make huge steps forward. 
And so for all those reasons, we think that it's appropriate to be cautious. Our approach is not to is to defer public health and when boosters are going to be necessary, but to bring forward the best option as we see them based on the science that we see in the evolving epidemiology. And that's where I think our conclusion today is given beta, gamma and particularly delta, given the real-world efficacy that we're seeing out there against delta right after vaccination -1273 and the neutralizing titers that we can see that I presented today against delta with -1273 protype dose, that we feel pretty confident that, that's actually the right way to approach this round of the fight with the SARS-CoV-2. 
Now if I give to the second and third questions you asked, this is not the last round of the fight with SARS-CoV-2. We expect it to have at least a couple more rounds and maybe annually, we're just going to continue to fight this virus back. And that's where we think multivalent boosters continue to be an important part of the scientific strategy. As you look forward to, say, early 2022, delta is what we're fighting right now, but what are we going to be fighting in 2022? What new variant of concern? There will be one. 
And I look at the evolving picture with Delta and the overall variance of concern, and there's a couple of specific things that jump out at me. There are now I think 5-point mutations in the various variants of concerns, 3 of them present in beta and gamma. We've talked about them, the .417, .484 and .501 mutations. And now there's 2 mutations in the receptor binding domain in the delta strain at. 452 and .478. 
And those 5 look like the ways in which the virus has tried to step away from or neutralizing community with our vaccine immune innovation. If you think about how this might play forward, it seems logical to us that those 3 mutations present in the beta, gamma line and those 2 mutations present in the delta might find some way to combine in new and potentially scary ways. And if that came with the increased transmissibility, force of infection that delta can achieve, that might be a significant threat. 
And so we view our multivalent platform as the best place for us to try and anticipate that threat. And logically, for us right now, that would be looking at a beta, gamma or a beta variant a concern combined with a delta variant concern and evaluating that going forward. And that's the -213 program that we're going to be looking at. But we don't think that for this cycle. We do really believe that -1273, a booster dose will hold up against delta right now. 
The long-term virus evolution question is a great one. And I would say we just got to be humble. We've not faced a variant, a virus quite like this. And again, I don't think any of us would have predicted the step change in transmissibility that was seen with delta over the last 5, 6 months. And so I wouldn't rule out that the virus doesn't have that kind of surprises in its future. 
But if you take a very, very long view, 5, 10 years view, I would say that we continue to think the model for what SARS-CoV-2 will look like in terms of an endemic market is probably predicted by other respiratory infections, the endemic coronaviruses, like OC43, which every year have rates of reinfection in adult populations and young kids every year results in hospitalizations and some deaths, including in this country. And we, therefore, believe there will be a long-term endemic market. The virulence of those viruses, as you pointed to, is lower, and that's good news. Hopefully, it's not as big of a threat as we're seeing right now. But we need to be cautious and humble because SARS-CoV-2 keeps surprising us. And maybe that variance will be something more substantial than we see in the endemic coronavirus. 
So we're hopeful that it will wait, that virus will decline, but we really do believe the virus is here to stay for the long term. And therefore, there's going to be a need to regularly boost particularly high-risk older populations against SARS-CoV-2 into the future. Hopefully that answers your questions."

So as you recall said, we've announced -- I think it was in February that based on the market feedback of the countries, given the high efficacy of our vaccine. So there was a lot of demand. And so if you recall, we decided to make very significant manufacturing capacity increase, 50% addition in the U.S. It's all at our U.S. site for drug substance in our wood and then the doubling of the OUS capacity at Lonza and Rovi. Our goal is to, as I said in my remarks, depending on the booster dose which until we have final say by the regulator and until we see the 100-microgram data for -1273 dose, as Stephen described, we won't know for sure. But if you model both the prime series APs that have already been ordered, which will be, of course, at 100 microgram. If you model what we anticipate in the mix between prime series and booster vaccines for service, if the booster dose was 50 micrograms, we could have up to $3 billion of supply. And if the booster dose were 100 microgram, that could take us up to EUR 2 billion of supply. So it's a bit hard to think about it. But we're trying to do is to not have the challenge we're having this year, which is a happy problem. 
As I said in my remarks, we are still tracking for 800 800 million to 1 billion dose this year. But I've also said that we are not taking any more orders for 2021 because we are totally maxed out. And of course, we would want to be in a position where we can answer to any countries wanting more vaccines. And so by doing those investments, we really are hoping that next year, we can make sure that we can fulfill all the demand we're going to get from the market. And as Corinne mentioned, while we have already signed 12 billion of APAs for next year with those countries and additional 8 billion on top of the 12 of options that those countries have. There are still a lot of discussions ongoing. And so what we want to do is to maximize the penetration of Spikevax around the world. And I believe that the new data of this morning showing that the efficacy -- the final efficacy of the cost study is holding very nicely. I think we'll just be yet another argument for countries to want to vaccinate as many people as we can in that country with [indiscernible] Stephen, do you want to talk about [indiscernible]?"

And so particularly in rare diseases, particularly with some early positive clinical data -- And so that's what we're trying to do right now is anticipate that positive data, expand and build out our team in that therapeutic area and begin the more foundational preparations for closing very quickly if we can get some encouraging positive clinical signs. But we're working every day to try and get the -- to accelerate the time that those are incurring early data as well as, as I said, prepare for that future."

So I'll try and take the first question, which was -- so and you pointed to well, we do not currently have a correlative protection in the world, unfortunately, for any of the vaccines. And so it's very hard to say objectively what tighter, what level is this sort of the minimum level which is why in our minds and subject to the regulators to developing their own perspective. But in our mind, the right way to benchmark this has been, let's look at that really consistent high durable efficacy in Phase III, let's look at the neutralizing titers, let's support that. And let's do that.Let's get above those titers because if we can exceed those titers and where we were just after the primary vaccination series, then it should stand to reason that we should be able to provide durable protection at or above the levels that we saw before. 
Now of course, the virus is evolving, and that's where you see delta, and we have to be humble about that. But the good news is -- it looks like in the real-world data that the vaccine -1273 is holding up against delta even with partial vaccination, as Jackie mentioned in her slides and with some of those references. 
And so we do think that getting at or above those levels should hold up quite comfortably. How much above those levels? Is it 1.0? Is it 2.0? Is it some other number? I think that's ultimately going to be a sense that we want to have between ourselves of the data that we have, the benefits of the different dose levels, 50 microgram, 100 microgram. And again, the data we've already seen in terms of Phase III and then a dialogue with regulators about how they see that benefit risk. But as it stands today, we think the 50-microgram data that we presented really looks encouraging and likely meet that standard. But we want to hold off, we look at the 100-microgram data in just a few weeks here and decide, no, that's the right call. We've got to the levels we need to. And we think we can reset immunity in a vaccinated person with a third dose at or above the levels that have been driving this durable protection to date. I'm sorry, I missed the second question. Could you just repeat it?"

But I would agree with your characterization, it's certainly our hope and view that because it's a well understood market, with things like the HAI titers that even a new platform like messenger RNA might be able to leverage some of that thinking in terms of immunogenicity and safety as we think about moving forward to approval. We'll ultimately have to show efficacy and real-world efficacy as well Because that's what's going to be of interest for payers.

Today, I will start by a quick business review of our quarter before Corinne walks you through the commercial update. David will present the key financials. Stephen and Jackie will provide the clinical update highlighting new human data about the final analysis for COVID-19 vaccine Phase III COVE study and human data for COVID-19 booster candidate Phase II. I will then come back to close to share some thoughts about where we are heading. 
Let me start with Moderna COVID-19 or Spikevax. We are pleased to announce today that our final analysis vaccine efficacy of the Phase III COVE study is holding very nicely at 93%. We are starting to get authorizations for adolescent indication 12 to 17 years of age, receiving authorization in Japan this week and the positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency in July. 
An important step towards our vision of an annual respiratory combination booster is the start of a Phase I/II for mRNA-1010, which is a quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccine. Our teams are already preparing the Phase II/III for this program.
We were delighted to get Fast Track Designation from the U.S. FDA for our RSV vaccine candidate, mRNA-1345, in adults over 60 years of age. There is no approved RSV vaccine. The burden for RSV infection is very high. In adults over 65 years of age, according to the CDC, 177,000 of hospitalizations and around 14,000 deaths occur annually in the U.S. due to RSV. Our teams are also preparing a Phase II/III for this program. 
Our Zika vaccine has now moved to Phase II. mRNA-3927 for propionic acidemia, or PA, a rare genetic disease, has also started dosing patients in our Phase I/II. And we are pleased to announce recently that we started dosing healthy volunteers in our first autoimmune disease program, mRNA-6231, coding for IL-2. 
So Moderna is now in the clinic in 5 large therapeutic areas: infectious diseases, cancer, cardiology, autoimmune disease and rare genetics diseases. We have a strong pipeline momentum, and the research teams are working hard to bring the next wave of development candidates to the clinic. 
Moving to Slide 6. We have also a strong commercial momentum. Let me start by giving you an update about Advanced Purchase Agreements, or APA, for our COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax. For fiscal year 2021, we have now signed APAs for $20 billion versus $19.2 billion announced in our Q1 call. We are now capacity constrained for 2021, and we are not taking any more orders for 2021 delivery. 
For fiscal year 2022, we have already signed APAs for $12 billion. We have also signed an additional $8 billion in options. We are having numerous discussions ongoing as we speak with countries around the world to enter into new APAs for 2022. We'll continue to give you updates on a regular basis. What is very interesting to see is that forward-thinking countries, like Israel and Switzerland, have already signed APAs for 2023 to ensure supply for the endemic market.
On the financial front, we delivered $4.4 billion of revenue and $2.8 billion of net income. The cash generation in the quarter was strong at around $4 billion, bringing our cash balance to over $12 billion at the end of June. 
We're also announcing today our first share buyback plan. Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase for up to $1 billion. David and I will give you more color in a few minutes. 
For 2021, we continue to forecast supply between 800 million and 1 billion doses. For 2022, we forecast supply between 2 billion to 3 billion doses, depending on the final dose approved by the regulators for our booster: at 50 micrograms up to 3 billion doses, at 100 micrograms up to 2 billion. 
As we continue focusing on scaling the company, I am delighted to have 3 new executive committee members who joined recently. By start date at the company: Shannon Klinger as our Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. She joined us from Novartis, where she was the Chief Legal Officer. Mr. Paul Burton, our Chief Medical Officer, he joined us from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a Johnson & Johnson company, where he was Chief Global Medical Affair Officer. And most recently, Kate Cronin has our newly created role of Chief Brand Officer. Kate was, until recently, the CEO of Ogilvy Health. I look forward to working closely with Shannon, Paul and Kate as we scale Moderna to the next level. 
On Slide 9, you will find our usual summary slide. A few important things to note. We are now preparing Phase II/III for quadrivalent seasonal flu and our RSV program. Our team continues to grow as we increase manufacturing capacity for COVID-19 vaccine as we move programs from early-stage clinical study to late-stage clinical studies, and as we increase investment in research for the next wave of development candidates. 
Let me now turn to Corinne to give you a commercial update. Corinne?"

I am happy to share the productive quarter the commercial organization has had in the second quarter that continues into today, as we ramp up our efforts to supply the Moderna COVID-19 va",544,"Thank you, Stéphane, and good morning or good afternoon, everyone. I am happy to share the productive quarter the commercial organization has had in the second quarter that continues into today, as we ramp up our efforts to supply the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, or Spikevax, to countries around the world.
Let me start by recapping the Advanced Purchase Agreements that we have signed for delivery in 2021 on Slide 11. Since the last quarterly call, I am very happy to highlight that we have signed APAs with COVAX for 34 million doses this year; an additional 110 million doses to the USG, bringing the total of doses for the United States to about 400 million doses; and 10 million doses to Australia for delivery in 2021. In total, we anticipate up to $20 billion in sales from these agreements as we deliver against them throughout the remainder of the year. 
We are proud to distribute our vaccine directly or through our network of partners across all continents and, most importantly, to ensure access to our vaccines to all countries regardless of their income level, notably through the COVAX facility structure. I also want to mention that we are doing our utmost to -- in supporting the U.S. government to execute the donations of Moderna doses of vaccines. 
Slide 12 list outs signed APAs for deliveries in 2022 and even in 2023. The construct of the APAs signed for '22 and '23 include both confirmed orders as well as options to be triggered at a future date. To date, we have already contracted for 22 product sales of $12 billion and an additional $8 billion in options. 
Some of these APAs are for primary series vaccines, and others are for potential boosters. In light of the possibility of needing booster vaccines to increase immune responses against waning immunity and the emergence of variants of concern, Moderna has already started our COVID booster strategy that Stephen will speak to shortly.
In the meantime, the commercial team is currently engaged in multiple conversations that are gaining urgency as we watch the Delta variant surge among unvaccinated populations. We are notably actively talking to many countries in South America, in Asia and in the Middle East. All these countries are keenly interested in securing both primary series vaccines or booster vaccines for their citizens next year.
In the United States, as you know, Moderna has initiated the rolling submission process for BLA approval and expects to complete its submission in August. This approval will represent an important milestone in achieving herd immunity as it might help combat vaccine hesitancy. It will also allow the commercial organization to start preparing for the private U.S. market. 
Turning to Slide 13, which reviews the sales breakout for the second quarter '21. Total product sales in the quarter were $4.2 billion, representing 199 million doses delivered in the quarter. Sales in the U.S. were $2.1 billion, representing 126 million doses delivered to the U.S. government. And sales to the rest of the world -- to the countries that are listed on this slide, were also $2.1 billion, representing 73 million doses delivered in the quarter. 
And with that, let me hand it over to David to take you through the financial details."
128680956,1674091533,2365367,"Moderna, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Moderna, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Corinne. We're providing today the analysis of actual 2021 second quarter results, along with an updated view of key drivers of financial performance going forward. As in previous quarters, we are presenting our results primarily on a U.S",1968,"Okay. Thank you, Corinne. We're providing today the analysis of actual 2021 second quarter results, along with an updated view of key drivers of financial performance going forward. As in previous quarters, we are presenting our results primarily on a U.S. GAAP basis. In some cases, we also provide additional detail to provide greater clarity on underlying trends.
Turn now please to Slide 15. The transformation of Moderna from an R&D-focused biotech to a commercial company is very apparent when reviewing our financial results. The comparison of the second quarter of 2021 to prior year is not as meaningful due to our dynamic growth, which is why we'll primarily focus on the quarter-over-quarter comparison relative to Q1 on this slide. 
Total revenue was $4.4 billion in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $1.9 billion in Q1. The increase of total revenue is primarily resulting from the sale of the company's COVID-19 vaccine. Product sales in Q2 were $4.2 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 142%. 
Cost of sales were $750 million or 18% of the company's product sales in the second quarter compared to $193 million in the first quarter. Research and development expenses were $421 million in Q2 2021 compared to $401 million in Q1 and $152 million in the same period in 2020. The higher spend versus prior quarter and prior year was driven by increased COVID-19 vaccine clinical development activities, including our announced efforts around booster, variant-specific and multivalent vaccine candidates.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $121 million for Q2 compared to $77 million for the prior quarter. The growth in spending was driven by commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally with the biggest increases being in personnel and outside services. Provision for income taxes was $283 million in Q2 after $39 million in Q1 and an insignificant amount in the prior year. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 9%.
Let me remind you of the following. The significant investments to develop the mRNA platform over the last decade resulted in a net operating loss carryforward with a balance of $2.3 billion at the end of 2020. As of December 31, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets related to these loss carryforwards. 
As discussed in our last call, we started to release the valuation allowance this year. The majority of the allowance will flow through the P&L over the course of this year through our effective tax rate, pro rated based on the cadence of our expected pretax quarterly earnings. Over the course of 2021, the resulting nonrecurring benefit due to the release of the valuation allowance is about 5 percentage points on our effective tax rate. 
Our Q2 effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate, primarily due to the benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction as well as a discrete item for excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation. We recorded net income of $2.8 billion in Q2 after $1.2 billion in Q1, an increase of 128%. Diluted earnings per share for Q2 were $6.46. 
Turning now to year-to-date financial results compared to prior year on Slide 16. Total revenue was $6.3 billion for the 6 months ended June 30 compared to $75 million for the same period in 2020. The significant growth was driven by the sales of 302 million doses of the company's COVID-19 vaccine. Cost of sales was $943 million or 16% of the company's product sales for the 6 months ended June 30, including third-party royalties of $232 million. Reported cost of sales was reduced by 3 percentage points due to the consumption of previously expensed inventory of approximately $200 million. 
Research and development expenses were $822 million for the 6 months ended June 30 compared to $267 million for the same period in 2020. The growth in spending in '21 was largely driven by increased mRNA-1273 clinical development and headcount. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $198 million for the 6 months ended June 30, compared to $61 million for the same period in 2020. The growth in spending in 2021 was mainly attributable to the company's COVID-19 vaccine commercialization activities. 
For the 6 months ended June 30, we recorded provision for income taxes of $322 million compared to an insignificant amount for the period in 2020. Our effective tax rate for the 6 months ended June 30 was 7%. It was lower than the U.S. statutory rate, primarily due to the nonrecurring benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance, the ongoing benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction as well as a discrete item for excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation. 
Net income was $4 billion for the 6 months ended June 30 compared to a net loss of $241 million for the same period in 2020. Diluted earnings per share were $9.30 for the 6 months ended June 30, 2021. 
Turning to cash and selected cash flow information on Slide 17. We ended Q2 with cash and investments of $12.2 billion compared to $8.2 billion at the end of Q1. The increase is driven by our commercial sales and additional customer deposits received in the second quarter for future purchases of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in Q2 after $3 billion in Q1, totaling then $7 billion year-to-date. This compares to net cash used in operating activities of $130 million in the prior year. Cash used for purchase of property and equipment was $65 million for the 6 months ended June 30 compared to $25 million for the same period in 2020. 
Similar to last quarter, before providing an updated financial framework for the remainder of 2021, let me point out a few areas that are important to keep in mind when modeling expected '21 financial performance, starting with cost of sales on Slide 18. Cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, third-party royalties as well as logistics and warehousing costs. As you may recall, we began capitalizing our COVID-19 vaccine inventory cost in December 2020 following Emergency Use Authorization. Prior to the authorization, inventory costs were recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred. 
In Q1, a zero-cost inventory balance of $184 million was sold and benefited our cost of sales. If inventory sold during the first quarter was valued at actual cost, our cost of sales would have been $377 million or 22% of product sales. 
In Q2, cost of sales of $750 million or 18% of product sales were no longer materially impacted by the zero-cost inventory, hence, the relevant comparison is the adjusted ratio in Q1. The reduction of cost of sales as a percent of product sales when comparing to the adjusted cost of sales in Q1 is primarily driven by a customer mix-driven increase in our average selling price during the second quarter. 
Now turning to our cash and investment position on Slide 19. The cash and investment balance reported as of June 30 was $12.2 billion, up from $8.2 billion as of March 31. The increase is driven by our commercial activities, including net increase in customer deposits for future product supply of COVID-19 vaccine. The net cash balance of customer deposits increased from $5.6 billion at the end of Q1 to $6.8 billion as of June 30.
Turning to Slide 20. I wanted to share our capital allocation priorities. We seek to optimize our capital deployment and maximize long-term shareholder returns. Our top investment priority will continue to be reinvesting in the base business across multiple areas. 
For R&D, we have more than tripled spending in the first half of 2021 relative to the prior year, and we will continue to significantly increase spending in this area to advance and accelerate our pipeline. 
For manufacturing, we previously disclosed our 2021 capital expenditure plans, which will allow us to increase our production capacity. Additionally, we are investing heavily in digital, automation and AI as well as scaling up our global commercial operations, which will allow us to maximize the impact of our mRNA platform. 
Our second investment priority is to seek attractive external investment and collaboration opportunities to further expand the reach of Moderna's technology and capabilities. We are considering attractive, strategic opportunities that enable and complement our platform and take a disciplined approach in evaluating potential outside investments.
After evaluating internal and external investment opportunities, we then assess additional uses of cash. As part of today's press release, we announced that the Board has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. This program is authorized for a 2-year period. Based on the strength of our financial results for the first half of the year and our confidence in our business outlook, we believe it is an appropriate time to initiate this program. 
Turning now to the 2021 updated financial framework on Slide 21. Signed Advanced Purchase Agreements for expected delivery in 2021 reflect the current full year total of approximately $20 billion in anticipated product sales, including the $5.9 billion of product sales already generated in the first half of this year. For the full year, we continue to expect a minimum supply of 800 million doses at the 100 microgram dose level. Our manufacturing team and our partners continue working to supply up to 1 billion doses for 2021. 
We have signed Advanced Purchase Agreements for expected delivery in 2022 for total product sales of approximately $12 billion and options for an additional $8 billion. Numerous additional negotiations are still ongoing for 2022 APAs. We have also started to sign APAs for 2023.
As we previously announced, we continue to make investments to increase our supply of vaccine, including by working with contract manufacturing organizations. We currently anticipate that our supply could be as high as 3 billion doses for 2022 if our sales are primarily at a 50 microgram dose level. If sales are primarily at the 100 microgram dose level, we anticipate that supply will be approximately up to 2 billion doses. The ultimate approach on dosage levels for 2022 and where we might end up in that range is subject to ongoing internal review as well as discussions with regulators and customers and will also be impacted by the mix of primary and booster series. 
Our total cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, third-party royalties as well as logistics and warehousing costs. For 2021, we now expect the average cost total of sales as a percent of product sales to be between 18% to 20% compared to our previous outlook of approximately 20% of product sales. This reflects the successful ramp-up of this global manufacturing network.
With regard to planned R&D and SG&A expenses, Q2 expenses of approximately $542 million reflect a quarter-over-quarter increase of 13%, in line with the outlook we gave in Q1. We continue to plan for an increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis for the remainder of this year and expect this growth rate to accelerate as the business rapidly expands. 
Based on further increased visibility of the utilization of our accumulated net operating loss carryforward, expected global sales mix and the mentioned discrete benefits in the first half of this year, we now expect our all-in 2021 tax rate to be approximately 10%. This compares to our previous forecast in the low-teen range. This forecast is based on current U.S. tax policy and does not include any future potential discrete benefits related to stock-based compensation. Finally, regarding capital investments, we maintained our forecast for a range of $450 million to $550 million, including the planned capacity expansion investments as announced on April 29 of this year. 
This concludes my remarks, and I turn the call over to Jackie Miller."

My name is Jacqueline Miller, and I lead the therapeutic area for infectious diseases. And it's my pleasure today to give you an update to the ongoing accumulation of data in our Phase III clinical study and al",579,"Yes. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. My name is Jacqueline Miller, and I lead the therapeutic area for infectious diseases. And it's my pleasure today to give you an update to the ongoing accumulation of data in our Phase III clinical study and also to talk about some of the publications of real-world evidence that have occurred outside of Moderna with the use of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
So on Slide 24, a you'll see the top line updates to our COVE efficacy trial. And these are efficacy data that have now been followed through 4 to 6 months after subjects received their second vaccination of either mRNA-1273 or placebo. Recall that at the time of our EUA submission, our primary efficacy analysis demonstrated efficacy to COVID-19 of 94.1%. Now 4 to 6 months after second dose, we see a maintenance of that efficacy of 93.2% with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of 91%. We continue to maintain efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease with updated vaccine efficacy of 98.2% and currently have 100% of efficacy against death caused by COVID-19. So unfortunately, there were 3 deaths in the placebo group and up till now, none in the mRNA-1273 group. 
We continue to see consistency in our subgroup analyses, including analyses by gender, by race and by preexisting medical condition. Our safety profile continues to be consistent with the Phase III data over the longer period of safety follow-up and also continues to be consistent across population subgroups.
Next slide, please, on Slide 25. You'll see the efficacy data broken out by time interval. And so what you see at the top of the table is the overall efficacy we just discussed. According to the primary end point, we start measuring vaccine efficacy at 14 days after dose 2. And again, that's 93.1%. 
If you look between 14 days post dose 2 to less than 2 months after dose 2, we observed vaccine efficacy of 91.8% and 94% if you look 2 months after dose 2 to less than 4 months after dose 2. And finally, greater than 4 months after dose 2, we observed 92.4% efficacy. And the conclusion we take from these data is that our efficacy has remained consistently high and durable throughout the period of follow-up. 
And we intend to continue to follow these data now that the trial is in its open-label phase. The reports will be different moving forward, given that subjects in the placebo group have recently been vaccinated, but we think it's important that we continue to see -- to follow as subjects remain further out from their initial vaccination.
So if you go to Slide 26, you'll see that these data have been consistent also in studies outside of the Moderna clinical trial. So we begin to see real-world effectiveness data that demonstrate that Moderna maintains effectiveness consistent with what was seen in the COVE study. There are reports from Canada, from the United Kingdom and from Qatar. And importantly, these trials confirm that there is vaccine effectiveness, not only against the Wuhan strain, but also against emerging variants of concern, including the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants, and this is even after partial vaccination or vaccination with a single dose. 
So if you move to Slide 27, I'm now going to hand over the presentation to Stephen Hoge, who will review our COVID-19 booster strategy and clinical data as well as a review of our pipeline. Stephen?"
128680956,1674091533,2365367,"Moderna, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Moderna, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jackie. So moving on to Slide 28. I want to start with an update of our perspective on COVID-19 and how it's impacting our strategy for boosters. So first, our emerging perspective.

I want to start with an update of our perspective on COVID-19 and how it's impacting our strategy for boosters. 
So first, our emerging perspective. We believe today that the increased force of infection that's resulting from the Delta variant, fatigue with non-pharmaceutical interventions and the seasonal effects of moving indoors will eventually lead to an increase in breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. In fact, there have been reports of that already. 
While we see durable Phase III efficacy through 6 months, which Jackie just described, we do expect that neutralizing titers will continue to wane and, eventually, that will impact vaccine efficacy. So given this intersection between a rising force of infection and waning immunity, we believe a dose 3 of a booster will likely be necessary to keep us as safe as possible through the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere. 
So how has that informed our booster strategy? Well, our primary approach since early this year has been to advance a portfolio of booster candidates against all of the potential emerging variants of concern. And so we have a large number of ongoing clinical studies, and I'll provide some update on some today. 
Those boosters are being evaluated often at 2 different dose levels: 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms. And they fall broadly into 3 categories. First is our prototype vaccine, mRNA-1273, for which Jackie just described the primary efficacy data out of our Phase III study. Second, we are looking at variant-specific booster candidates, Beta and now a new Delta variant-specific candidate. 
And third, we are looking at a multivalent platform, combining different variants into a single vaccine, first, our mRNA-211 (sic) [ mRNA-1273.211 ] program and now a new mRNA-213 (sic) [ mRNA-1273.213 ] program, which includes the Delta antigen. The goal of the multivalent platform is to continue to try and stay ahead of where the virus is going by combining different antigens against emerging variants of concern. So I'd like to provide a brief update today on the 3 pre-existing programs: MRNA-1273; our variant-specific booster candidate against the Beta strain, 351; and our first multivalent vaccine, 211. 
Moving to Slide 29. I have the comparison of those 3 candidates from our phase 201 study. So quickly, starting on the left-hand side, looking in the validated clinical assays -- these are the same assays that are conducted by our collaborators at NIH that were used for our Phase III study and earlier clinical work. 
We can look at the wild-type virus neutralization of the 3 different booster approaches. Arrayed left to right, you see our prototype, 1273; our Beta-specific variant of concern, 1273.351; and the multivalent combination of 1273 and Beta, which is MRNA-1273.211. As a reminder, all 3 of these were dosed at 50 micrograms. And what I'm showing you on the left-hand side is the pseudovirus neutralization titers in the validated assays. At day 1, immediately prior to boosting; day 29; and in some cases, day 15. 
Now all of the participants in the study have previously received the Moderna vaccine, 2 doses, just as Jackie had described. And at approximately 6 to 8 months after they had participated in one of our clinical studies, we offered them a chance for this booster. So you can see at the baseline day 1, 6 to 8 months after primary series, neutralizing titers are somewhat lower in all 3 cases. With a booster dose of vaccine, all 3 boosters, we were able to substantially increase the neutralization against the wild-type virus, as you can see, for 1273, 16.7-fold; approximately 11-fold at both day 15 and day 29 for the Beta variant of concern; and 38- to 46-fold with the 211 multivalent platform. So that's against the ancestral virus on the left. 
How do we do against the variants of concern? Well, at the time when we initiated the study, we were particularly concerned about the B1351 variant, that now it's named Beta variant; and the P1 Gamma variant. And what we did is we set up assays to evaluate the performance of the booster vaccines 2 weeks after booster in all of those, and again, compared it against the ancestral virus, D614G that we've used elsewhere. 
What you can see in all 3 cases is when you compare the boosting that's happening and compare that to the level of titers, neutralizing titers that was seen in each of those groups of people, against their 2 month -- 1 month post their second dose, you can see strong boosting against all the variants of concern by all 3 booster strategies. In fact, it's very encouraging to see that 1273, our prototype vaccine, was able to increase titers against the 351 strain and the P1 Gamma strain.
Now as you look to the left, you'll see the level of boosting might be slightly higher with our multivalent platform, which is directionally higher titers, particularly against the 351 and P1 stream. But overall, the boosting remains strong across all 3 variants of -- all 3 approaches. 
And as a result of this data, we've made the determination that against these variants of concern, we believe the prototype vaccine, mRNA-1273, is more than sufficient as a booster and that there's no obvious advantage to working with the Beta-including variant boosters at this time. It's also worth noting that the epidemiology has moved away from the Beta variant of concern towards the Delta variant of concern that we've spoken about extensively.
So how did we do then in that 1273 against the Delta variant of concern? Moving to Slide 30. I'm presenting data here, which has been submitted for -- in a manuscript. It's actually in press as we speak. 
Looking at the performance of 1273 over 6 months after primary series against the variants of concern. The third dose booster of 50 microgram of 1273, pseudovirus neutralization titers here in our research assays is shown. And just to orient you quickly to the slide, we're looking against wild-type, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants of concern. 
The data on the first 3 columns deals with the month 1, post-dose 2. So immediately following the primary vaccination series for which we have the really strong efficacy data that Jackie just described. And as you can see, we see high titers against the wild-type strain, 1,200 in this assay in this group, and substantially lower titers against the Beta and Gamma variants of concern, as has previously been reported. 
Following those subjects forward to months 6 to 8 after their second dose, what you can see is waning, both for the wild-type virus, although it remains detectable levels of titers, but also for the variants of concern, particularly Beta, Gamma and Delta. In fact, as you can appreciate in those middle 4 bars, Beta, Gamma and Delta neutralizing titers had fallen below the detectable -- the level of detection of the assay for a decent number of participants in all 4 -- all 3 cases. 
Now the great news is that a 50 microgram dose of mRNA-1273 was able to boost against all 4 of those viral strains. And 14 days post dose 3, we show the titers on the far right, again, all 4 bars. We saw 23-fold boosting against the wild-type strain to levels that are significantly above the level we've seen just after second dose, 1 month post dose 2; saw 32-fold boosting against Beta; 43-fold boosting against Gamma; and 42-fold boosting against Delta. Again, all reaching levels that are significantly higher than previously seen. And that is very encouraging, and we think confirms our selection of the prototype booster as likely to be protective against the circulating variants of concern, particularly Delta presently.
So advancing that mRNA-1273 program at 50 microgram booster into Phase II is something we did in parallel. And on Slide 31, I'm happy to provide an update on the Phase II results from that larger study of the prototype booster. 
So earlier this year, our Phase II study of mRNA-1273 was amended to offer a third dose of 1273 at 50 micrograms to all interested participants 6 months out from their second dose of the vaccine. A total of 344 participants elected to receive that dose. And the top line results are reported here, and we have a manuscript in preparation that we'll be submitting shortly. 
The results are generally consistent with what I've already shared from the Choi, et al data. And that means that was that neutralizing antibody titers had waned significantly prior to boosting at 6 months. No surprise. A third dose, 50 micrograms, of mRNA-1273 boosted neutralizing titers to levels that are above the Phase III benchmark. And again, this now being done in our clinically validated assays with our colleagues at NIH.
After a third dose, similar levels of neutralizing titers were achieved across age groups. And importantly, a subgroup analysis of older adults over the age of 65 showed they were both able to boost significantly and achieve levels that are comparable to younger adults, which is really encouraging. And the safety profile following the dose 3 50 micrograms was similar to that observed previously for dose 2 of mRNA-1273. In total, we think this is really encouraging data on the potential for a 50 microgram booster of mRNA-1273.
So moving to Slide 32, where does that leave us on our COVID booster strategy or a delayed third dose approximately 6 to 12 months after vaccination? Well, we believe a booster dose is likely to be necessary this fall, particularly in the face of the Delta variant. Our clinical data right now, we think, supports a 50 microgram mRNA-1273 booster, and we see no obvious advantage for Beta-containing variant candidates, driven both by the data I presented today and the evolving epidemiology. But we're going to wait for 100 microgram data in the coming weeks to confirm the dose selection of 50 micrograms as the booster before filing.
So moving off from the COVID booster, I'd like to provide a little bit of an update on the other parts of our pipeline. So moving to Slide 33. We were excited to update today that mRNA-1010, our first seasonal influenza vaccine candidate has entered the clinic, and that 1010 is moving quickly towards -- in its ongoing Phase I/II study. 
I'll remind you that mRNA-1010 is a quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccine that's targeting the WHO recommended strains. And our vision is to eventually combine mRNA-1010 as a seasonal flu vaccine in a pan-respiratory vaccine booster for adult and elderly populations that combine flu, a COVID-19 booster and potentially our respiratory syncytial virus vaccine. 
Looking on Slide 34. Across our infectious disease portfolio, beyond 1010, we have a number of other important updates. In our RSV vaccine, our positive interim Phase I data was announced at Vaccine Day earlier this year. And Phase I dosing in pediatric and adult vaccine is ongoing. We recently were pleased to announce that we received FDA Fast Track Designation for adults over the age of 60 in this -- for this vaccine, highlighting the significant unmet need that we believe is there in this disease.
Our hMPV/PIV3 vaccine, another multivalent respiratory vaccine, is in a Phase Ib trial that's currently enrolling in toddlers, and the first cohort has been completely enrolled. Our CMV vaccine against a significant unmet need is on track to start its pivotal Phase III trial this year with roughly 8,000 participants. And lastly, our Zika vaccine Phase II trial is ongoing. We're currently enrolling patients in the United States and Puerto Rico.
Moving to Slide 35. We beyond our expanding infectious disease vaccine portfolio, we are advancing in mRNA therapeutics and now have 7 programs in ongoing clinical trials. In oncology, our cancer vaccines programs with Merck include the personalized cancer vaccine in KRAS. And we have 2 intratumoral programs in ongoing Phase I studies: one, a triplet program ourselves; and an IL-12 program in combination with AstraZeneca.
In our cardiovascular therapeutic area, we have 2 programs: the VEGF program ongoing with AstraZeneca in Phase II; and a preclinical Relaxin program. In autoimmune, we are excited to announce that we have started dosing our first patient in an IL-2 Phase I study, and that continues. And the PD-L1 program remains in preclinical development. And lastly, in rare diseases, we have been dosing for this year in our propionic acidemia program in Phase I; and MMA, GSD1a and PKU programs are in preclinical, and we look forward to starting these in the clinic.
Briefly on Page 36. You can see our expanding pipeline of clinical programs and the continued advancement across all of our therapeutic areas, but most notably of our prophylactic vaccines modality in infectious diseases. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Stéphane Bancel for closing remarks."

On the",1482,"Thank you, Corinne, David, Jackie and Stephen. Before taking your questions, let me share a few thoughts. On this slide, we articulate how we have been thinking for many years now about using our mRNA platform to maximize our impact on patients. 
On the left, we now have 2 core modalities. For vaccines in blue, we have achieved authorized products; and for systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics in pink, we have achieved human proof-of-concept with our chikungunya antibodies, demonstrating we could get therapeutic level of antibodies, and we could repeat those successfully. 
In the middle, we have 4 exploratory modalities, which were in the clinic with 6 programs to understand if we achieve human proof-of-concept: 4 medicines in immuno-oncology; 1 in cardiology; 1 in rare genetic disease. More are coming in the coming quarters. 
On the right, you see 2 modalities which are not yet in the clinic, but for which we believe we have achieved the important derisking in nonhuman primates: delivery of mRNA to the lung and delivery of mRNA into hematopoietic stem progenitor cells. 
Next slide, core modalities. In vaccine, we're focusing on bringing to market what we believe could be a game-changing respiratory vaccine. That medicine would combine, over time, COVID-19 boosters plus seasonal flu boosters plus RSV booster in one single annual shot. 
We have a great vaccine against COVID-19. Our RSV clinical data have shown a high level of neutralizing antibodies, which has led the FDA to grant us Fast Track Designation. And our quadrivalent flu vaccine is in the clinic now. The flu market is $5 billion to $6 billion per year despite flu vaccine efficacy being notoriously suboptimal, around 60% in a good year and down to around 30% in a bad year. We believe we can do better with our mRNA platform given what we have demonstrated with COVID-19. The Moderna flu vaccine candidate could launch as early as 2023. 
CMV is now close to entering Phase III. And we continue to believe the market opportunity could be $2 billion to $5 billion per year. EBV should enter the clinic soon. There is no vaccine against CMV infection or EBV infection.
So we are working towards moving the company from COVID-19 prime vaccination sales in 2021 to COVID-19 booster in 2021 and 2022 and beyond, and then adding flu as early as 2023, and then adding RSV and launching CMV and then EBV. I am excited about this vaccine pipeline and how these vaccines could prevent death, hospitalization and disease in billions of people over the years.
Stephen and the research team are not resting. They are working in our labs on more vaccine candidates, and we cannot wait to share with you these new vaccine candidates in the future as we take them into clinical studies. This is where the power of mRNA as an information molecule and the industrialization of Moderna and the digitalization of Moderna and our cash position will enable our teams to bring important vaccine to protect people at a scale and at a pace not seen before in pharmaceutical industry. In autoimmune disease, we aim to continue to scale that therapeutic area. 
Next slide, exploratory modalities, 6 clinical programs in 4 exploratory modalities. If we get positive clinical signal, we'll scale these modalities quickly as well. That's where the beauty of a platform comes into play.
Next slide, modalities in research. Very typical of our long-term mindset and our desire to maximize our impact on patients, we continue to invest in science to explore new modalities, like the one in the lung and more recently presented at our Science Day in hematopoietic stem cells. In our lung program, we are both working on using mRNA to express a human protein in a cell. That was our first Vertex partnership. But we are excited about our exploration of doing gene editing using mRNA to express a gene editing enzyme. That is our second Vertex partnership. 
Next slide. I believe that the uniqueness of Moderna is that we're expanding our impact on patients in 2 dimensions. We are expanding in 2 dimensions at the same time because we have built an industrialized mRNA. Because mRNA is an information molecule, once we make a medicine work in a modality, like the COVID-19 vaccine, then we use the same 4 building blocks of life to make another vaccine. So we scale within a modality really fast along the first dimension of the Y axis. 
And the second dimension is to keep expanding new applications of mRNA into new cell types on the X-axis. And we are doing both at the same time with different dedicated teams, all powered by our science, or digital and our manufacturing infrastructure. 
David shared earlier our framework for capital allocation now that we are generating significant amount of cash each quarter. Our #1 priority as a company has always been and will continue to be to invest in the business. We continue to believe that we're in the early days of a new class of medicines, mRNA. And these small molecules more than 100 years ago, a large molecule 50 years ago are any indication, the next 10 to 20 to 40 years are going to see a very large number of important medicines. And because mRNA is an information molecule, it would happen really fast.
We aim to continue to build the world's leading mRNA company. So we're talking about investments in acceleration of programs already in the clinic; investments in new development candidates moving from the labs to the clinic; investments in our platform to continue to improve the science and to include new modalities; investment in manufacturing; investment in commercial presence, including our digital and commercial presence; investment in digital so we can scale our company faster and better than traditional biotech or pharma companies. 
Our second priority is to expand our horizons by complementing our platform with external technologies or products. This means we are interested in nucleic acid technologies, gene therapy, gene editing, mRNA. On the mRNA front, if we find new delivery technologies that could expand our current capabilities, we will look at them carefully. We would be interested in technology licenses and/or in development candidate licenses and/or, if it makes sense, M&A. 
You can count us to be disciplined. We know what it takes to go from early research to filing with regulatory agencies. And for having done it, we know the risk associated with new technologies, and everything that works in a mouse would not necessarily work in a human. 
From a strategic standpoint, we are not interested in small molecule or large molecule development candidates, even if they could complement our commercial portfolio. We love information molecules too much to be interested in acquiring analog molecules, small molecule, large recombinant molecules or cell therapy. 
This share buyback is our first one. We are very optimistic about the future of Moderna, and we are just getting started. Our Board of Directors will continue to regularly review what is the right thing to do to return capital to shareholders in light of our cash generation, balanced against investments in our business and external investment opportunities.
Let me talk now a minute about corporate responsibilities. It is very important for us to make Moderna a model of corporate responsibility and to build a sustainable business. Like everything we do, we don't just want to do things well. We want to do things in the best possible way. 
We were pleased to announce recently the establishment of our charitable foundation with an upfront endowment of $50 million with a significant focus on underserved populations. We are humbled to have been awarded the #1 spot on Fast Company 2021 for best place to work for innovators, which complements our last 6 consecutive years of recognition by Science as a top employer. Both awards reflect the importance we place on our employees and the culture of the company. 
Recently, Axios/Harris released its 2021 corporate reputation survey, and the Moderna brand ranked third among 100 of the most visible U.S. companies, our first mention on the list and a highest ranking for any biopharmaceutical company for corporate reputation. We have recently worked relentlessly with the U.S. government to facilitate donations of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to many low-income countries. And we are committed to minimizing our energy footprint. 
As I look through the next decade, the same North Star is guiding us since we started. We believe we have a responsibility to maximize our impact to protect healthy people and help patients. Our commitment is stronger than ever. This is just the beginning. 
We look forward to welcoming you at our annual R&D Day on September 9, whereas in previous years, we will do a detailed review of our development pipeline. The team and I will happy now to take your questions. Operator?"

We see very strong demand continuing in the context of the pandemic well into 2022. And hence, we've given you the range of 2 billion to 3 billion doses depending very much on whether our customers are still purchasing for primary series or if they're looking at boosters and then depending on the eventual dosage for boosters. So I think it's really going to evolve as to exactly what that looks like in terms of dosage. 
Going beyond '22, as we said, we are starting to see now the forward-planning countries that are looking beyond the very near term. We're starting to then have contract discussions and in fact, have agreed some contracts into '23. But I think it's early to really know as to how this is going to evolve in terms of the transition from pandemic to the endemic phase.
In terms of pricing, I think it's helpful to start with where we are in 2021 to have a context for understanding pricing going forward. So really 3 buckets of pricing in 2021. We have the U.S. government, where the first 100 million doses was priced at a little over $15. The subsequent 400 million doses were contracted at $16.50. And that pricing was considering a couple of things. One is the BARDA funding we received to underwrite our Phase III trial, and also the size of the contract, the 500 million dose contract, which is very large. 
The second category is the higher-income ex U.S. countries where, as we've said in the past, we start with a price range of $32 to $37 a dose. And there are some cases where we offer discounts based on volume, for high volume. And then the third category is low and middle-income countries, which have received the lowest-tiered pricing, including those sales to COVAX, which are considerably lower than the price to the U.S. government. 
So if we start with that framework for '21, what we can say is that the contracts that we've signed now for 2022, the pricing constructs are very consistent with that framework that we've had in 2021. And so we see a continuation in the context again of the pandemic with the pricing framework. 
If you look at the average price that you calculate in your model, of course, that's going to depend on the mix across these categories. And of course, we're expecting to see significant sales to the middle and low-income countries and that increasing in '22. So it shouldn't be surprising if the average, you see some declines. 
And then finally, I would just comment that as we move into a post-pandemic period, then we would expect, as we've said in the past, to -- market forces to impact our price negotiations. So hopefully, that answers your questions."

Look, I think we have been, as you all know, the innovator in mRNA and lipid nanoparticle delivery in therapeutics for a while. And we've watched the space quite interestingly or quite significantly in terms of ways that we could help with delivering gene editing cargoes across a range of different tissues where our lipid nanoparticles systems have been shown to go even in humans. And we think it's the right time for us to start to expand in that direction. 
If there's a general convergence, I think, out there in the gene editing space, it's that messenger RNA and lipid nanoparticles are perhaps the way to go. And that's something we strongly agree with having spent the last decade working in the technology. So you'll be looking for us to bring new kind of payloads, new capabilities, new enzymes into our existing technological capabilities, which we think are best-in-class."

So I think we are going to always defer to what's happening with the public health officials in terms of when they think the appropriate time to recommend a booster vaccine is nece",1065,"Sure. Thank you, Matthew. So let me try and take the first question first. So I think we are going to always defer to what's happening with the public health officials in terms of when they think the appropriate time to recommend a booster vaccine is necessary. Where we see the data ourselves -- I can't speak to the challenges they face. But what we see is the potential for waning immunity. In fact, if you look at -- back at our Vaccines Day, we had Professor Davenport come in and present work that he's done at University of New South Wales in Australia showing what he predicted back in March would be the picture for waning immunity from the vaccines. It was recently published in Nature Medicine. I had a chance to open and it's looking remarkably prescient because the predictions he was making about the relative strength of the different vaccines suggested that small differences in efficacy would start to emerge to be larger differences in efficacy at about 200, 250 days as neutralizing antibody titers waned. And that may be what we're starting to see. 
And if you play that forward, if you assume he's been right about those predictions, then that picture continues and continues through a year with continued declining neutralizing antibody titers over that time. And eventually, we therefore believe, a real increase in breakthrough infections and disease even with vaccinated participants, even with mRNA-1273. 
So we continue to want to be vigilant because that trend and those predictions, we think, will come to the fore. And I think the Delta variant has taught us to also be incredibly humble in the face of the virus' ability to fight back and increase its transmission. I mean I think most of us would have thought SARS-CoV-2 was a pretty good infector earlier this year. Delta has shown us that it can make huge steps forward.
And so for all those reasons, we think that it's appropriate to be cautious. Our approach is not to -- is to defer to public health on when boosters are going to be necessary, but to bring forward the best option as we see them based on the science that we see and the evolving epidemiology. 
And that's where, I think, our conclusion today is given Beta, Gamma and particularly Delta, given the real-world efficacy that we're seeing out there against Delta right after vaccination with 1273 and the neutralizing titers that we can see, that I presented today, against Delta with the 1273 prototype dose, that we feel pretty confident that, that's actually the right way to approach this round of the fight with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
Now if I jump to the second and third questions you asked, this is not the last round of the fight with SARS-CoV-2. We expect it to have at least a couple more rounds and maybe annually, we're just going to continue to fight this virus back. And that's where we think multivalent boosters continue to be an important part of the scientific strategy. 
As you look forward to, say, early 2022, Delta is what we're fighting right now. But what are we going to be fighting in 2022? What new variant of concern? There will be one. And I look at the evolving picture with Delta and the overall variants of concern, and there's a couple of specific things that jump out at me. There are now I think 5 point mutations in the various variants of concerns, 3 of them present in Beta and Gamma. We've talked about them, the 417, 484 and 501 mutations. And now there's 2 mutations in the receptor binding domain in the Delta strain at 452 and 478. And those 5 look like the ways in which the virus has tried to step away from our neutralizing immunity with our vaccine immune innovation. 
If you think about how this might play forward, it seems logical to us that those 3 mutations present in the Beta, Gamma line and those 2 mutations present in the Delta might find some way to combine in new and potentially scary ways. And if that came with the increased transmissibility, force of infection that Delta can achieve, that might be a significant threat. And so we view our multivalent platform as the best place for us to try and anticipate that threat. 
And logically, for us right now, that would be looking at a Beta, Gamma or a Beta variant of concern combined with a Delta variant of concern and evaluating that going forward. And that's the 213 program that we're going to be looking at. But we don't think that's for this cycle. We do really believe that 1273, a booster dose, will hold up against Delta right now. 
The long-term virus evolution question is a great one. And I would say we just got to be humble. We've not faced a variant, a virus quite like this. And again, I don't think any of us would have predicted the step change in transmissibility that was seen with Delta over the last 5, 6 months. And so I wouldn't rule out that the virus doesn't have that kind of surprises in its future. 
But if you take a very, very long view, 5, 10 years' view, I would say that we continue to think the model for what SARS-CoV-2 will look like in terms of an endemic market is probably predicted by other respiratory infections, the endemic coronaviruses, like OC43, which every year have rates of reinfection in adult populations and young kids, every year results in hospitalizations and some deaths, including in this country. And we, therefore, believe there will be a long-term endemic market. 
The virulence of those viruses, as you pointed to, is lower, and that's good news. Hopefully, it's not as big of a threat as we're seeing right now. But we need to be cautious and humble because SARS-CoV-2 keeps surprising us. And maybe that virulence will be something more substantial than we see in the endemic coronavirus. 
So we're hopeful that it will wane, that virulence will decline, but we really do believe the virus is here to stay for the long term. And therefore, there's going to be a need to regularly boost, particularly high-risk older populations, against SARS-CoV-2 into the future. Hopefully, those answer your questions."

So as you recall, Ted, we've announced -- I think it was in February that based on the market feedback of the countries, given the high efficacy of our vaccine, so there was a lot of demand. And so if you recall, we decided to make very significant manufacturing capacity increase, 50% addition in the U.S. It's all at our U.S. site, the drug substance in Norwood and then the doubling of the OUS capacity at Lonza and ROVI. 
Our goal is to, as I said in my remarks, depending on the booster dose which until we have final say by the regulator and until we see the 100 microgram data for 1273 third dose, as Stephen described, we won't know for sure. But if you model both the prime series APAs that have already been ordered, which will be, of course, at 100 microgram, if you model what we anticipate in the mix between prime series and booster vaccines for Spikevax, if the booster dose was 50 micrograms, we could have up to 3 billion dose of supply. And if the booster dose were 100 microgram, that could take us up to 2 billion of supply. So it's a bit hard to think about it. 
What we're trying to do is to not have the challenge we're having this year, which is a happy problem. As I said in my remarks, we are still tracking for 800 million to 1 billion dose this year. But I've also said that we are not taking any more orders for 2021 because we are totally maxed out. And of course, we would want to be in a position where we can answer to any countries wanting more vaccines. And so by doing those investments, we really are hoping that next year, we can make sure that we can fulfill all the demand we're going to get from the market. 
And as Corinne mentioned, while we have already signed $12 billion of APAs for next year and -- with those countries and additional $8 billion on top of the $12 billion of options that those countries have, there are still a lot of discussions ongoing. And so what we want to do is to maximize the penetration of Spikevax around the world. And I believe that the new data this morning showing that the efficacy -- the final efficacy of the COVE study is holding very nicely. I think will just be yet another argument for countries to want to vaccinate as many people as they can in that country with 1273. 
Stephen, do you want to talk about orphan disease?"

You show that great data on Slide 30, showing the waning of the antibodies. And I think we all see that could be a problem, and how the third dose gets you way up. But what do you think that specific data is, or put another way, the titer level for correlative protection would be to support boosting for the fall or the winter? That's question one. 
And then question 2, a little bit similar. On flu, with that data coming up later this year, is it your view that significantly higher levels of antibodies will lead to significantly higher efficacy? And that would suggest a larger study that will also be supportive of a launch, I think you said in 2023."

And so it's very hard to say objectively what titer, what level i",401,"Sure. So I'll try and take the first question, which was -- so and you point to well, we do not currently have a correlative protection in the world, unfortunately, for any of the vaccines. And so it's very hard to say objectively what titer, what level is the sort of the minimum level, which is why in our minds -- and subject to the regulators to developing their own perspective. But in our mind, the right way to benchmark this has been, let's look at that really consistent, high, durable efficacy in Phase III, let's look at the neutralizing titers that support that. And let's do better. Let's get above those titers. Because if we can exceed those titers in where we were just after the primary vaccination series, then it should stand to reason that we should be able to provide durable protection at or above the levels that we saw before. 
Now of course, the virus is evolving, and that's where you see Delta, and we have to be humble about that. But the good news is -- it looks like in the real-world data that the vaccine, 1273, is holding up against Delta even with partial vaccination, as Jackie mentioned in her slides and with some of those references. And so we do think that getting at or above those levels should hold up quite comfortably. 
How much above those levels? Is it 1.0? Is it 2.0? Is it some other number? I think that's ultimately going to be a sense that we want to have between ourselves of the data that we have; the benefits of the different dose levels, 50 microgram, 100 microgram; and again, the data we've already seen in terms of Phase III; and then a dialogue with regulators about how they see that benefit risk. 
But as it stands today, we think the 50 microgram data that we presented really looks encouraging and likely meet that standard. But we want to hold off. We'll look at the 100 microgram data in just a few weeks here and decide, nope, that's the right call. We've got to the levels we need to. And we think we can reset immunity in a vaccinated person with a third dose at or above the levels that have been driving this durable protection to date. 
I'm sorry, I missed the second question. Could you just repeat it?"

But I would agree with your characterization. It's certainly our hope and view that because it's a well-understood market, with things like the HAI titers, that even a new platform like messenger RNA might be able to leverage some of that thinking in terms of immunogenicity and safety as we think about moving forward to approval. We'll ultimately have to show efficacy and real-world efficacy as well, because that's what's going to be of interest for payers. But again, the regulatory path is going to be subject to discussions with regulators that are ongoing. So I can't provide more guidance at this time."

Today, I will start by a quick business review of the quarter before David presents the key financials. Paul will then walk you through some real-world evidence update, and Stephen will provide a clinical development update. I will then come back to close to share some thoughts about where we are heading. 
Let's start on Slide 5 with a holistic pipeline update. First, respiratory vaccines. 
We are pleased to have filed the BLA for COVID-19 vaccine to FDA and have now received a priority review designation. We received our first full approval for Spikevax back in Canada We received EUA from the FDA for a 50-microgram booster and mix and match has been authorized. We also received authorization for boosters from other major geographies, EMEA, U.K. and so on. We were informed recently that FDA may take until January 2022 to review the EUA request for 12 to 17 years of age. 
Turning now to flu. mRNA-1010 is fully enrolled for the Phase I and we expect human data soon now. For RSV, mRNA-1345, after very positive data in the Phase I with high neutralizing antibody levels after 1 dose, our teams are finalizing the proportion of the Phase II/III in all the adults. This study should start soon. 
We also announced our development candidate for COVID booster plus flu booster in a single dose, MRNA-1073, which we anticipate will be in the clinic zone. 
Let me now turn to vaccine against latent viruses. As many of you know, latent viruses are a major cause of health problems. Latent viruses are made of DNA viruses. And once a human is infected by latent virus, that virus will stay in the body. You are familiar with some latent viruses like HIV and HPV. There are many others that harms humans. 
As a company, we are committed to developing a portfolio of first-in-class vaccines and therapeutics against these latent viruses. 
Our first programs are CMV vaccine, EBV vaccine and EBV therapeutic vaccine. We have also partnered to work on 2 HIV vaccines. 
Last week marked a big milestone for Moderna. We started hosting in the clinic the first participants of our Phase III pivotal registration study for CMV vaccine mRNA-1647. This marks the second Phase III study that the company has started and brings us one step closer to getting another important vaccine to millions of people around the world. 
Our EBV vaccine mRNA-1189 should start dosing for its Phase I very soon. and our new development candidate on the EBV therapeutic vaccine, MRNA-1195, is moving toward the clinic. 
Let me now turn to Therapeutics. Our personalized cancer vaccine is in Phase II with KEYTRUDA. Monotherapy is fully enrolled, and we expect data in the back end of 2022. 
Our regenetic programs continued to progress well in the clinic. PA has its Phase I dose cohort fully enrolled. MMA is dosing patients in its Phase I. GSD1a has an open IND and has received orphan drug designation by FDA. 
As you can see, we have 3 regenetic disease programs in the clinic or soon to be in the clinic. So we look forward to sharing clinical data in the coming months. 
We are very proud to have found the way to get trivial-type 1 or CN1 to patients through a donation of IP and the assets to the institute for life-changing medicines. CN1 disease is a neutral disease with very few patients afflicted around the world. [indiscernible] disease, just the cost of clinical development will result in a very high price for a few patients around the world that could benefit. 
This model is not one that we support. So instead of developing the drug and charging a very high price, we decided to give the drug away and innovate through a creative partnership. We provide the drug to the institutes. We pay for clinical trial material, the institute pays for the clinical trial cost. If a drug is approved, we'll provide the medicines to the kids and their families for free. And we will not charge any royalty or milestone to the institute. We believe this is the right thing to do to continue to contribute to society for [indiscernible] diseases where our mRNA platform can help. 
One of the important news item announced today is the introduction of a new modality to our existing 6 modalities. We are very pleased to announce that Vertex and Moderna are now in GLP tox studies for the cystic fibrosis program, VXc-522. 
This marks our first inhaled pulmonary therapeutics program. I would like to congratulate and thank our scientific team as well as the Vertex team for having been able to develop a novel lipid formulation to allow inhaled pulmonary delivery. This is really exciting for patients. 
As we communicated previously, in addition to doing therapeutics using mRNA coding for human proteins like the ones I just described, we want to use our mRNA plus lipid technologies to develop therapeutics using mRNA coding for gene editing enzymes. We are pleased to announce our first partnership in that field. We announced earlier this week that we entered into a licensing collaboration with Metagenomi based in California, to use their next-generation gene editing enzymes. We believe that their technology, coupled with our mRNA plus lipid technologies, and our manufacturing infrastructure will produce some exciting new medicine to take into the clinic. I am very pleased with the progress of the company. We are increasing depth in vaccines and at the same time, increasing breadth of application with our 7 modalities the lung and gene editing. 
On Slide 6, you will find financial highlights. For Q3, we reported revenue of around $5 billion, enabled by delivering 208 million doses of our COVID-19 vaccine. Net income of $3.3 billion. Our cash and cash equivalents position was $15 billion at the end of September. 
Since the end of the quarter, we have been working to gain better visibility into those variables that will impact our full year results, and we have much better visibility today than we did a month ago. 
For fiscal year 2021, we are updating the range of doses we plan to deliver to 700 million to 800 million doses. The key variable of this update volume range are: first, longer lead time for exports to countries outside the U.S. and for international shipments in general. 
In Q3, we shipped more deliveries to new international market and expect Q4 to also have more international deliveries. As we deliver to these countries for the first time, we expect the process to become more a routine and delivery time to short term. However, some Q4 deliveries may still move to early 2022 as a result. 
Second, in Q3, we have expanded our [indiscernible] capacity with our manufacturing partners, which has the temporary impact on our shipments. That work is complete now, and we should see a positive impact from this expansion very soon. 
Third, the bottleneck of production has moved down the manufacturing line to product release. We added additional resources, skilled personnel to the release and of the manufacturing line, and we expect to increase the weekly number of doses released. 
We believe resolution of these factors put us in a good position heading into Q4 and 2022. 
Now if I turn to revenue for '21. The updated revenue range for [indiscernible] is $15 billion to $18 billion. This range reflects updated delivery schedule with fewer doses delivered in '21, as some doses are pushed into 2022. And also, the pricing impact of prioritization delivery to COVAX and African Union that have a lower tier pricing. 
On Slide 7, let me start by summarizing the scale of operational challenges that the team had to work through as we scale for making less than 100,000 doses in 2029 to hundreds of millions of doses in 2021. Q1 scale-up challenges were around drug substance, making mRNA in lipid. 
To do scale-up challenges, we're on drug product and ensuring we could fill in our pipes. In the first half of the year, we made great progress in these challenges, as you can see from the numbers on the right. We now have 901 million doses of drug substance that have been formulated and a large volume bags of mRNA product. And we have 770 million doses of drug products already in vials. [indiscernible] changes were around product release as the supply chain became more complex with increased deliveries to many countries around the world. At the beginning of the year, we supplied just a few large countries. 
As mentioned before, we are working through this challenges, and as November 1, we achieved 566 million doses around the world. With the progress year-to-date, we expect to be able to deliver to 700 million to 800 million doses for the full year 2021. 
We were pleased to be named last week for the seventh year in a row as 1 of the top 20 biotech and pharmacal company in the world by science. We continue to invest in science and the culture of our team. We aim at building the best MRNA science in the world in the culture of boldness, collaboration, curiosity and [indiscernible] business. 
On Slide 9, you will find our usual summary slide, which describes some of the key high-level attributes of the company as of today. 
Now let me turn it over to David."

We're providing today the analysis of actual 2021 third quarter results, along with an updated view of key drivers of financial performance going forward. Turning now to Slide 11. And starting with an overview of our sales perf",1789,"Okay. Thank you, Stéphane. We're providing today the analysis of actual 2021 third quarter results, along with an updated view of key drivers of financial performance going forward. Turning now to Slide 11. And starting with an overview of our sales performance before commenting more broadly on our financial results. 
Total product sales in the third quarter were $4.8 billion, representing 208 million doses delivered to our customers. This compares to sales of $4.2 billion and 199 million doses in Q2 and sales of $1.7 billion and 102 million doses in Q1 of this year. 
Sales to the U.S. government were $1.2 billion in the third quarter reflecting 73 million doses delivered compared to $2.1 million and 126 million doses in Q2 and sales of $1.4 billion and 88 million doses in Q1. 
Sales to the rest of the world were $3.6 billion in the third quarter, reflecting 136 million doses delivered compared to sales of $2.1 billion and 73 million doses in Q2 and $0.4 billion of sales and 14 million doses in Q1. 
This reflects the significant manufacturing ramp up outside the U.S. over the last 2 quarters. The relatively modest increase of delivered doses in Q3 versus Q2 was driven by the factors that Stéphane just explained. We continue to scale our production network and are working to achieve an increased quarter-over-quarter improvement starting in Q4. 
Turning to Slide 12. The transformation of Moderna from an R&D-focused biotech to a commercial company continues to be very apparent when reviewing our financial results. The comparison of the third quarter of 2021 to prior year is not meaningful due to our significant growth, which is why we will primarily focus on the quarter-over-quarter comparison relative to Q2 on the slide. 
Total revenue was $5 billion in the third quarter of 2021 and compared to $4.4 billion in the second quarter and $0.2 billion in the prior year period. The increase of total revenue is driven by the sale of the company's COVID-19 vaccine. Product sales in Q3 were $4.8 billion compared to $4.2 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 15%. Cost of sales was $722 million or 15% of the company's product sales in the third quarter compared to $750 million or 18% of product sales in the second quarter. 
The quarter-over-quarter percentage improvement is driven by higher average selling price as a result of shifts in our customer mix and to a smaller extent by favorable manufacturing costs. 
Research and development expenses were $521 million in the third quarter up from $421 million in Q2 and $344 million in the same period in 2020. The higher spend versus prior quarter and prior year was driven by increased COVID-19 vaccine clinical development activities, including our announced efforts around booster variant-specific and multivalent vaccine candidates, headcount increases as well as external costs to support our growing and maturing development pipeline beyond the COVID-19 vaccine activities also contributed to the expense increase. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $168 million for Q3 compared to $121 million in the prior quarter and $48 million for the same period in the prior year. 
The growth in spending was driven by the commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally with continued investments in personnel and outside services in support of the accelerated company build-out. 
Provision for income taxes was $219 million in the third quarter, following $283 million in Q2 and an insignificant amount in the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 6%. 
Let me remind you of the fact that we had a net operating loss carryforward of $2.3 billion at the end of 2020. This year, we started to release the valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets, which results in an estimated nonrecurring full year benefit to our effective tax rates of about 5 percentage points. 
Our Q3 effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate, primarily due to the just described benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and an excess tax deduction related to stock-based compensation. This last item drove the quarter-over-quarter reduction due to the increase in our share price in Q3 versus Q2. 
We recorded net income of $3.3 billion in Q3 compared to $2.8 billion in Q2, an increase of 20%. This compares to a loss of $0.2 billion in Q3 of last year. Diluted earnings per share for Q3 2021 were $7.70. 
Turning now to year-to-date financial results compared to prior year on Slide 13. Total revenue was $11.3 billion for the first 9 months of this year compared to $0.2 billion for the same period in 2020. The significant growth was driven by the sales of 510 million doses of the company's COVID-19 vaccine. 
Grant revenue of $473 million in the first 9 months of 2021, an increase of $286 million compared to the prior year was primarily driven by increases in revenue from BARDA related to the company's COVID-19 vaccine development. Cost of sales was $1.7 billion or 16% of the company's product sales for the year-to-date period as of September 30, including third-party royalties of $400 million. 
A portion of the inventory costs associated with this year's product sales was expensed as prelaunch inventory costs in 2020. If inventories sold for the first 9 months of this year was valued at cost, our cost of sales for the period would have been 17% of the product sales. 
Research and development expenses were $1.3 billion for the 9 months ended September 30 of this year compared to $0.6 billion for the same period in 2020. The growth in spending in 2021 was mainly due to increase in clinical trial expenses and to a lesser extent, personnel-related costs, manufacturing expenses and consulting outside services primarily driven by increased mRNA-1273 clinical development activities. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $0.4 billion for the first 9 months of this year compared to $0.1 billion for the same period in 2020. The growth in spending in 2021 was mainly due to increases in consulting and outside services, personnel-related costs and marketing expenses primarily attributable to the company's COVID-19 vaccine commercialization-related activities and increased headcount. 
For the 9 months ended September 30, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $541 million compared to insignificant amounts in the same period in 2020. Our effective tax rate for the first 9 months of this year was 7%. It was lower than the U.S. statutory rate, primarily due to nonrecurring benefits related to the release of the valuation allowance, the ongoing benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction as well as a discrete item for excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation. 
Net income was $7.3 billion for the 9 months ended September 30 of this year. compared to a net loss of $0.5 billion for the same period in 2020. Diluted earnings per share were $17 for the first 9 months of 2021. 
Turning to cash and selected cash flow information on Slide 14. We ended Q3 2021 with cash and investments of $15.3 billion compared to $12.2 billion at the end of Q2. The increase is driven by our commercial sales and additional customer deposits received in the third quarter for future purchases of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 billion in Q3 after $4.1 billion at Q2. The quarter-over-quarter reduction is driven by a lower amount of cash deposits for future product supply received in Q3 compared to Q2. 
On a year-to-date basis, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.3 billion compared to $0.8 billion in the prior year. 
Cash used for purchases of property and equipment was $164 million for the 9 months ended September 30 compared to $44 million for the same period in 2020, reflecting continuous investments in our manufacturing infrastructure. 
Now turning to Slide 15. Let me briefly expand further on our cash and investment position and the net balance of cash deposits for future product supply as this is an important point when modeling future cash flows. The cash and investment balance reported as of September 30 was $15.3 billion, up from $12.2 billion as of June 30. The increase is driven by our commercial activities, including cash receipts from product sales and customer deposits for future product supply. The net balance cash deposits for future product supply was $6.7 billion at the end of Q3 at the same level to the balance in Q2 of this year. 
Turning now to the 2021 updated financial framework on Slide 16. For the full year 2021, we expect a product sales range of $15 billion to $18 billion. We now expect to be able to deliver 700 million to 800 million doses at the 100-microgram dose level to our customers. This compares to the prior outlook of 800 million to 1 billion doses. 
Our total cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, third-party royalties as well as logistics and warehousing costs. Given the favorability we have observed in the year-to-date period, we now expect total cost of sales as a percent of product sales between 16% to 17% for the full year 2021. This compares to our previous outlook of 18% to 20% of product sales. 
For 2022, we currently expect the cost of sales ratio to exceed 20% driven by customer mix and multiple presentation types. 
On the R&D and SG&A expense side, we continue to plan for an increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis and expect this trend to continue for the remainder of 2021 and beyond driven by a maturing development portfolio and the scale-up of our commercial activities. 
Based on further increased visibility of the utilization of our accumulated net operating loss carryforward, expected global sales mix and the mentioned discrete benefits in the first 9 months of this year, we now expect our all-in 2021 tax rate to be in the high single-digit range. This compares to our previous forecast of approximately 10%. 
Since we won't have a material benefit from our valuation allowance in future years, we expect our reported 2022 effective tax rate will increase relative to our 2021 rate. It's also too early to further comment on impacts from a potential tax reform. 
Finally, regarding capital investments. We are now planning for approximately $0.4 billion of capital investment to fall into the 2021 calendar year compared to our previous range of $450 million to $550 million. We are strongly committed to a further build-out of our manufacturing and general company infrastructure and hence, predict capital investment in 2022 will be meaningfully above 2021 levels. 
This concludes my remarks concerning the financial performance, and I now turn the call over to Paul Burton."

With more than 150 million people worldwide now having received 2 doses of our vaccine, we are humbled to be able to see the positive impact it is having on people's lives around the world. W",1156,"Thank you, David, and good morning, good afternoon, everyone. 
With more than 150 million people worldwide now having received 2 doses of our vaccine, we are humbled to be able to see the positive impact it is having on people's lives around the world. We are reminded of the fact that almost 250 million people have been infected with COVID-19 globally and 5 million people have lost their lives. Our profound thanks, as always, go out to those on the front lines, working tirelessly to keep us safe in this ongoing fight. 
Through numerous independent studies, time and time again, we see consistent findings showing that mRNA-1273 is highly effective in saving lives, reducing hospitalizations and reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection. I will highlight a few of these independently conducted studies this morning. 
On Slide 18, I will begin with some of the data from the United States government. These data come from the CDC and show through September of this year, the difference in COVID-19 cases between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. An unvaccinated person has an 11-fold greater risk of dying from COVID-19 underscoring the importance of getting vaccinated plays in our protection and ending this pandemic. 
The data show that vaccination with mRNA-1273 provides the greatest protection not only against COVID-19 infection, but also death due to COVID-19. In fact, even during the surge of the Delta virus variant during the summer months this year, Moderna's vaccine had the lowest reported deaths associated with breakthrough infection as the CDC data demonstrate. 
Approximately 160 million doses of the Moderna vaccine have been administered in the United States. And in the next slide, I want to show you some further government-generated data in a country where the Moderna vaccine has also had extensive use in that country is Switzerland. 
You can see here exposure data on the left. Approximately 3.6 million people have been fully vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine and 1.9 million people have been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer BionTech vaccine. 
These government-generated data from the Federal Office of Public Health in Switzerland, again, are clear and show that vaccination with the Moderna vaccine is highly effective at reducing infections, hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 infection. 
For every 1 million people vaccinated use of mRNA-1273 would be expected to result in 643 fewer COVID-19 breakthrough infections, 78 hospitalizations and 38 deaths. 
Next, in Slide 20, our data from 2 other recent independent studies that build on the results I just showed you from Switzerland. The first study on the left side of this slide, followed 38 million vaccinated people in the United States, Iceland and South Korea. And again, found that those people vaccinated with mRNA-1273 were at 53% reduced risk of a COVID-19 infection and 33% reduced risk of a COVID-19 hospitalization compared to those vaccinated with the alternate mRNA vaccine. 
The data on the right hand of the slide are from a recent publication by Nordstrom and colleagues in Sweden and Norway, showing that mRNA-1273 delivered 87% vaccine effectiveness during a time of high Delta variant circulation in those countries. The data I've shared so far are from the general population. 
Let me turn now to the effectiveness of the Moderna vaccine, in particularly vulnerable populations that immunocompromised. These data were published just 2 days ago, again, by the United States CDC vision network and examine vaccine effectiveness at preventing COVID-19 hospitalization, which is so critically important in individuals with a variety of immunocompromised medical conditions between January and September of this year. 
As the authors of this study note, with the exception of those individuals with dramatic disorders, vaccine effective point estimates were generally higher for the Moderna vaccine than for the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and the difference in effectiveness in these hard to immunize populations is shown in the column on the right. 
I want to turn now to the topic of myocarditis and to put it in the context of the clinical benefits of vaccination that I've just described with mRNA-1273. It is important to recognize that the cases of myocarditis reported to occur following mRNA vaccination of rare, generally mild, typically respond to conservative treatment and self-limiting. Health authorities have reviewed many data sets and the U.S. CDC and WHO have concluded that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after receiving any mRNA vaccine. The WHO's Advisory Committee on vaccine safety notes that myocaditis can occur following SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 disease and that mRNA vaccines have a clear benefit in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19. 
Analysis from our global safety database show that the events of myocarditis are very rare. Overall, we observed 9.5 cases of myocarditis per million vaccinated individuals compared to an expected rate of 21 cases per million individuals. 
Now in common with other reports of mRNA vaccines in individuals aged 18 to 24, we see an increased rate of myocarditis of 40 cases versus 17 expected cases per million individuals. These data from our own safety database are consistent with the findings from safety databases evaluated by the CDC and other global health authorities. And the link to the CDC analysis is provided on the slide below.
mRNA-1273 has been authorized for use in adolescents, aged 12 to 18 in multiple countries around the world. Moderna's global safety database has information on an estimated 1.5 million of them, providing us an opportunity to look at the rate of myocarditis in those individuals and those data are shown in this table. We see the small absolute well-described risk of increased myocarditis rates in males aged 18 to 24 that I just described to you. But we do not see an increased risk in adolescents neither in boys nor in girls. These data are reassuring and important as we continue to offer mRNA-1273 to adults, adolescents and as we file for authorization in children. 
So in summary, the data I've shared with you today from independent government reports in the United States and in Switzerland, countries with high vaccination rates of Moderna's vaccine show that mRNA-1273 is associated with lowest breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths due to COV-19. Other independent studies in millions of individuals continue to show that mRNA-1273 is highly effective in reducing the risk of breakthrough COVID-19 as well as hospitalizations and death. And importantly, this is also true in those vulnerable and hard to vaccinate immunocompromised patient populations. 
Moderna's global safety database of 151 million vaccinated individuals shows a rate of myocarditis in males aged 18 to 24 that is consistent with analysis by CDC and others. Moderna's global safety database does not show an increased risk of myocarditis in 1.5 million individuals below the age of 18 and vaccinated with Spikevax. 
So these -- this concludes my quick overview of some recent analyses of mRNA-1273 effectiveness data and review of data from our global safety database. And I will now turn the call over to Stephen."
128680956,1685132291,2424896,"Moderna, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Moderna, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll review the progress we've made across our vaccines therapeutics pipeline. Let me start with our COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, for adult ages 18 and above, where there are a number",2047,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll review the progress we've made across our vaccines therapeutics pipeline. 
Let me start with our COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, for adult ages 18 and above, where there are a number of important regulatory updates. 
First, we have announced that the FDA granted priority review to Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine BLA. 
In October, we also received an EUA from the FDA and the European Commission's approval for a booster dose of our COVID-19 vaccine at the 50-microgram dose level for the adult cohort, ages 18 and above. 
Turning to the adolescents and pediatric settings. As a reminder, there are 2 clinical trials for each of these groups: TeenCOVE is our study in the adolescent population, 12 to 17 year olds; and KiDcove is the study in the pediatric population, age 11 and younger. For the adolescent population, 12 to 17 years old, our vaccine is authorized in a number of countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, the European Union Canada, Switzerland, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia and Argentina to name a few. We've submitted data from our KidCove study to the FDA in the United States as well as to other countries. We're recently notified by the FDA that the agency will require additional time to evaluate our proposed amendment due to recent analysis of the risk of myocarditis after vaccination in some populations. The agency expects this evaluation may extend until January 2022. 
As Paul noted, Moderna's global safety database includes an estimated 1.5 million adolescents who received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, most outside of the United States. And to date, we have not observed a rate of myocarditis from those younger than 18 years in our safety database that points to an increased risk of myocarditis in that population. We continue to believe the benefits of vaccination significantly outweigh the risks. 
In the pediatric setting, our study known as KidCove, is ongoing and is focused in 3 age groups, a group with children 6 to 11 years of age; a group of 2 to less than 6; and a group of children 6 months to less than 2. The trial consists of a dose escalation phase for each group, followed by an expansion phase once the dose has been selected. 
Last week, we shared positive top line data from the oldest of the age groups in KidCove, the 6- to 11-year-old cohort, showing the 250-microgram doses of mRNA-1273 were generally well tolerated and that the primary immunogens endpoints were met. We will submit our results soon to the EMA and other global regulatory agencies. 
For the other 2 age groups in KidCove, the 2 to less than 6 years old group and the 6-month to less than 2-year old group, our dose selection studies are ongoing. 
On the next slide, let me share with you some of the data we have in children ages 6 to less than 12 years of age. This data is after dose 1 as we are waiting for additional follow-up time to share the post-dose data. As a reminder, the study was randomized 2:1 for vaccine versus placebo. 
Based on the case definition of COVID-19 that we used in the Phase III adult study, the observed interim vaccine efficacy was 100% in this analysis, starting 2 weeks after the first dose and using that case definition. 
Vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection was also high at 80%, and vaccine efficacy against symptom asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 65%. And both endpoints that we think are incredibly important as we seek to end the pandemic. 
Turning now to our booster and next-generation COVID-19 vaccine programs on Slide 28.-- As a reminder, we are evaluating multiple COVID-19 vaccines as potential boosters to provide the broadest range of countermeasures to the virus as it continues to evolve. We were granted EUA for the 50-microgram dose of our current vaccine as a booster, as mentioned previously. And we are currently evaluating 2 variant-specific vaccines and 2 multivalent vaccine candidates, which are combinations of different variants of concern in an effort to stay ahead of the evolving virus. 
In addition, we're also evaluating mRNA-1283 as a next-generation refrigerator stable vaccine, which is in a Phase I study. The interim analysis of that Phase I data has been completed at 3 different dose levels and indicates that a lower dose of mRNA-1283 can achieve similar neutralizing antibody responses as a primary -- in primary series as our authorized vaccine mRNA-1273. 
mRNA-1283 also had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and we're moving forward towards a Phase II booster study for that candidate. This will also evaluate even lower doses of mRNA-1283 given the strong boosting performance seen in Phase I. 
The start of our booster strategy in late -- while the start of our booster strategy in late January of this year was in response to the threat of newly identified variants at that time, our booster strategy has continued to evolve as the pandemic unfolds. 
Slide 29 is a slide we shared at our Vaccines Day in April of this year. At the time, the graph on the left was illustrative of our view of the likely path for the pandemic. based on perspective on respiratory virus evolution and epidemiology, including prior coronavirus pandemics. 
Today, it's becoming clear that the SARS-CoV-2 is following the footsteps of other respiratory viruses, and is on its way to becoming a seasonal endemic threat. 
So where are we now? With Delta and the potential for other variants, the winter of 2021, 2022 still looks to be a time of moderating but persistent variant epidemic waves. Infection and reinfection continue to cause morbidity and mortality during this phase, but hopefully in fewer people. The focus will remain on suppressing the rate of viral evidence and emergence. Primary vaccination is critical. But given the high rate of background transmission, booster vaccines will also be important in all countries. 
Looking ahead, we expect 2022 will be the beginning of the seasonal endemic phase, reinfections in individuals who are at high risk, including older adults, the immunocompromised or healthy adults with more rapidly waning immunity due to under vaccination with potentially less effective vaccines will be at the greatest risk for severe outcomes. 
As with the recent Delta wave, this will include some risk of hospitalization and unfortunately, some cause of death as well as social disruption. We believe this will become the primary population for whom seasonal boosting will provide a significant enduring benefit. 
In summary, as we described earlier this year, we believe SARS-CoV-2 is following a familiar path that will ultimately become a seasonal threat to a large population of higher risk adults. Perhaps the biggest unknown in the near term is the extent to which further viral evolution in the coming Northern Hemisphere winter and Southern Hemisphere winter in 2022 will create hurdle ground for new, newly transmissible and innovating variants to emerge. If so, rapid boosting may become necessary. 
We will need to remain vigilant throughout this time as we fight the pandemic, and we are ready to advance updated boosters rapidly if they become needed. 
Now moving from COVID onto Slide 30. We announced in September that the Phase I portion of our quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccine, mRNA-1010, is fully enrolled, and we look forward to sharing data from that trial and moving to Phase II. 
soon. We also announced positive Phase I interim data from our RSV vaccine in older adults in September, and we plan to start pivotal Phase II/III RSV vaccine trial before the end of 2021. 
Separately, the pediatric RSV program continues to move forward with cohorts enrolling well in our Phase I study. 
Our hMPV/PIV3 study in pediatrics is also currently enrolling in toddlers. 
We were very excited to announce last week that our Phase III CMV vaccine trial has dosed its first participants. The start of the Phase III trial, CMVictory is an important step in evaluating our CMV vaccine against congenital CMV. 
As a reminder, CMV is the #1 cause of birth defects in the United States, and we are evaluating the safety and efficacy of mRNA-1647 in women ages 16 to 40 at the 100-microgram dose level. The trial is starting in the U.S. and will include approximately 150 sites globally, and will enroll on approximately 6,900 women of child-bearing age. Importantly, including criteria of the trial includes women at high risk of CMV exposure through direct exposure in the home, socially or occupationally to children under 5 years of age. 
Diversity in our clinical trials is also extremely important to us, and we're proud to continue our commitment from last year on clinical trial diversity. We believe setting targets and measuring ourselves against them remains one of the most important ways we can work to address the health care inequity in clinical research. 
For the CMVictory Phase III study, our goal is to have 42% of the trial participants in the United States come from communities of color, many of which are disproportionately impacted by the CMV virus. 
Moving on from vaccines. This slide highlights our mRNA therapeutics pipeline. At R&D Day, we described how our modalities and therapeutic areas overlap. 
In oncology, our PCV Phase II trial is now fully enrolled, and we expect to read out for that as early as the fourth quarter of next year. 
Separately, an expansion cohort in head and neck cancer in our Phase I trial is ongoing. We also have Phase I trials ongoing for our KRAS vaccine, which is partnered with Merck, the triplet program; and the IL-12 intratumoral program, which is partnered with AstraZeneca. 
In cardiovascular, our VEGF program is also partnered with AstraZeneca has completed the enrollment of a low-dose cohort in its Phase II study and AZ will be providing updates at a presentation of the data at the American Heart Association meeting in 2 weeks. 
Within autoimmune, our IL-2 program is in a Phase I trial in dosing. And within rare diseases, Our PA and MMA trials are ongoing in Phase I, and our GSD1a program has an open IND and is expected to start a Phase I study soon. I'm also very excited to announce that our first cystic fibrosis program has moved into preclinical development with IND naming studies now underway. We and our partners at Vertex are pleased to announce that development candidate, VXc-522. 
This program marks our first program in a brand-new modality inhaled therapeutics. As a reminder, Moderna modality encompasses a new method for utilizing our proprietary lipid nanoparticle technologies and mRNA technologies to bring forward medicines. 
Now double-clicking for a moment on the CF programs in research. Recall that we have 2 partnerships with Vertex. Our first collaboration targets the CFTR protein in trying to produce it using mRNA and LNP technologies. This is where we are advancing our candidate VXc-522. 
We also have a collaboration with Vertex using mRNA for gene editing and gene therapy. Both collaborations are focused on treating this 10% of CF patients with disease that unfortunately is not addressable with current CFTR modulators. 
For this 10% of the CF population, alternative purchase are absolutely necessary. And the exciting update today, as I said a moment ago, is that we're announcing the first development candidate to move into development from that collaboration described on the left-hand side of this slide. 
In this collaboration, we're delivering messenger RNA that encodes for CFTR protein that is missing or nonfunctional in patients who suffer from cystic fibrosis. We plan to target that 10% that I mentioned a moment ago. 
We've been working incredibly hard with Vertex to advance the candidate, and we are very excited that, that has now moved into IND-enabling studies. As Vertex announced recently, they expect to submit an IND in 2022, paving the path for clinical studies in these patients. 
In the close, I'd like to just highlight our pipeline on the following 3 slides, starting on Slide 35, which includes our respiratory vaccines in development. Slide 36 summarizes our large portfolio of latent virus vaccines and vaccines against other viruses. And on Slide 37, you will see the extensive mRNA therapeutics pipeline that we have in development. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Stéphane to close."

Slide 39 is from September 9 R&D Day and summarizes the product franchise we focus on at Moderna. 
Priority #1 is our pan-respiratory annual boost of franchise. Priority #2 is our first in-class vaccines for latent viruses. Priority #3 is our therapeutics based on mRNA-encoded proteins. And Priority #4 is the therapeutic space on mRNA-encoded gene editing enzymes. 
As we have said for several quarters now, SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay and will evolve from a pandemic to endemic setting. We believe that 2022, we'll see pandemic in low-income countries throughout the year, but at high income countries, the year would be of 2 halves, pandemic priming for children and boosting for others with an endemic boosting campaign in the fall of '22. 
On Slide 42, you can see the revenue drivers that we anticipate will pay out in 2022. We believe there are 3 components that will drive our COVID-19 vaccine revenues for next year. 
First, signed APAs. We have already signed around $17 billion of advanced purchase agreements or APAs for delivery in 2022. 
Second, APA options. They are up to $3 billion of APAs that are signed options. Some options have been converted in Q3 from options to FIM order. 
Third, the fall of '22 commercial market. We also believe that the fall of '22, assuming that BLA is granted for boosters, will drive the commercial booster market of up to $2 billion. 
So in total, at this point, we believe that 2022 revenues could be between $17 billion and $22 billion. We, of course, continue to have discussions for 2022 APAs with governments and international organizations, including COVAX, the Pan American Health Organization, or PAHO, and the African Union. 
For this pan-respiratory franchise, our goal is to evolve the COVID-19 vaccine primary series into fall of '21 boosters, which is happening as we speak and then fall of '22 boosters and then add to a COVID booster of True Booster in a single dose and then add COVID and flu and allergy booster in a single dose. 
Our flu vaccine human data should be out soon. And the team is already preparing the Phase II free for flu, and RSV is moving fast to Phase II/III. 
If we you look at the health damage of latent viruses, it is profound. EBV is a major cause of infectious [indiscernible]. EBV has been reported to increase risk of multiple sclerosis. EBV is associated with certain cancers and autoimmune diseases and EBV associated with a higher risk of long COVID. 
CMV associated with be the leading cause of birth defects. CMV is a major driver of immune dysfunction with aging, CMV associated with cardiovascular diseases, CMV associated with cancer and cognitive impairments. 
For now, our focus is CMV, EBV and [indiscernible], but we are developing in a labs vaccine against over latent viruses with short human health. Our goal is to eliminate these viruses. 
As we discussed earlier, several cancer and real genetic programs are in the clinic and will provide clinical results soon. 
On November 15, AZ will present Phase II data in patients from the VEGF program at the American Heart Association. And we are pleased to announce the new modality in health pulmonary therapeutics. 
Modernizing is our effort to expand the use of our platform to create more innovative drugs to help patients. Our strategy to invest internally under the leadership of Dr. Eric Frank, with the dedicated team and to set up licenses agreements with next-generation engineering companies. The Metagenomi partnership is a first step in that direction. 
The strategic part of the company is very clear and exciting. We want to stop people creating hospitalized from respiratory infection. We wont stop until this goal is achieved. 
We want to stop fellow human beings from suffering from these latent viruses. We want to bring to market mRNA therapeutics in oncology, cardiology, regenetic disease, autoimmune. We want to bring therapeutics using gene-editing enzymes. We believe Moderna could become the most impactful drug company in the world. 
As we scale, we realized that we needed October in setting the right framework for our team to understand what made Moderna, Moderna. So we work through Q2 and Q3 to articulate our mindset, how we behave and make decisions at Moderna. There is more information on our website, and we'll be happy to spend time with those of you who learn a lot more about them. 
Let me just summarize them at a high level. At Moderna, we act with urgency. Action today compounds the life sales tomorrow. We pursue options in parallel to make the best choice later. We accept risk as the only path to impact. We're obsessed over learning. We don't have to be the smartest. We have to run the fastest. We pivot fearlessly in the phase of [indiscernible] data. We question convention because proven models don't always fuel the future. We push pass possible. We behave like owners the solutions we are building go beyond the job description. We act with dynamic range, driving strategy and execution at the same time and at every step of the way. We will move this cost to encourage collective action. We prioritize our platform over any single product. We digitalize everything possible using the power of digital information to maximize our impact on patients. 
We want to be the most impactful drug company in the world, we care deeply about doing it the right way. It means being a great company to work for, as exemplified by our seventh consecutive year ranked as the best company to work for by science. But it also means building a company that is responsible in minimizing our impact on the planet. We are proud to have announced earlier this week that we will work to achieve net 0 carbon emission for operations globally by 2030. 
I want to thank the Moderna team for their commitment to our mission, and they will like less work to build the best Moderna for now over the next 20 years. 
Before we jump into Q&A, we wanted to share the dates of our annual investor event back for 2022. Vaccine Day on March 24; Science Day on May 17; and R&D Day on September 8.

128680956,1685132291,2424896,"Moderna, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Moderna, Inc.","Executives","Great, Salveen. So let me take those different questions. Let me start with the short term. Yes, we really believe we can fix those short-term supply issues. As I tried to explain in my remarks, those are what I would qualify as [ teething ] problems of s",700,"Great, Salveen. So let me take those different questions. Let me start with the short term. Yes, we really believe we can fix those short-term supply issues. As I tried to explain in my remarks, those are what I would qualify as [ teething ] problems of scaling up so fast. In Q1, it was all about making enough drug substance, and we are literally not waiting to have enough drug substance to field vials. And the teams scaled very nicely. 
In Q2, the change we had internally was all about filling vials. And the complexity of Q3 has really moved to the, I would say, the back end of the supply chain, which is releasing product and shipping products. 
And the complexity has been around just a number of markets we have to serve. Beginning of the year, it was mostly shipping to CDC in the U.S. and Europe, and that was it. but then as we increased the number of countries to many dozens by now, the complexity is just increasing and it's even further now that we are serving COVAX where it go country by country. 
So that's just the type of timing problems that we are experiencing right now. We have increased personnel. We have invested in digital to help the teams. So I already expect this to be weakest the drug substance changes in Q1 and the drug product changes in Q2. 
The 2022 -- in terms of drug substance, yes, we could see make up to 3 billion doses in terms of material. As you know, that number was really depending on the booster of those. And now that we're on the other side of that decision with the 50-microgram dose. We confirmed we could make up to 3 billion doses [indiscernible]. 
The challenge in 2022 is going to really be around product form because as the market moves to an endemic market, you're going to need basically vials to be able to go to less number of dose per vile. Again, in the endemic setting, as you know, we launched for a 10 dose per vial, which we think was really an update in low-income countries [indiscernible] more into vials now. 
But as we think about the endemic market, and we're trying to serve pandemic and endemic at the same time, we just need to keep adding presentation to be relevant to health care workers and health care systems around the world. 
So drug substance will not be an issue. There's, of course, as I described, potential upside to those numbers. We still have quite a number of APAs being discussed with countries around the world. We don't know what will happen in terms of epidemiology. Is there a new variant coming? Is it a variant where the current vaccines is still helpful or we need, as Stephen described, a new booster. There is, of course, a big question mark here that we'll follow in epidemiology literally on a daily basis. 
And then there's so many for boosting people around the world that have had non-mRNA vaccines. As everybody knows, there is a [indiscernible] of waning immunity over time. So time is not offering as people see the levels antibody going down. And as we have new variants like Delta or potentially others, but we should not forget that most people are on the planet have not had an mRNA vaccine injected in their body to date. 
And so we believe there is an important need to boost people with mRNA vaccines. And as Paul showed the real world evidence securing the data from CDC and Switzerland. The more we get data and the more time is helping to see -- we see a net differentiation between products. And this doesn't go unnoticed by governments around the world who are working really hard to preventing hospitalization and death. 
And so there is upside to that. Again, it's a very unpredictable environment, none of us has worked for pandemic before thankfully. But you assure that we will keep scaling up manufacturing. We keep in getting with government so that we can maximize how we can help people and the revenue should follow from that."

And then secondly, on flu, can you just comment on how you're going to interpret these results? Obviously, we're just going to get tighter results. But I think it's your premise that you can achieve a much higher efficacy flu vaccine compared to traditional flu vaccines. So do you think there is a clear correlation in titers to efficacy? And what level of titers would demonstrate very high efficacy?"

I'll take -- try and take those questions. So first, look, I think it's most important to say that what we communicated in a desire to be maximally transparent last week was that the FDA unlike other regulators ha",799,"Thank you, Matthew. So this is Stephen. I'll take -- try and take those questions. 
So first, look, I think it's most important to say that what we communicated in a desire to be maximally transparent last week was that the FDA unlike other regulators has asked for some more time to review emerging recent data. And that might take until January. I think your question is how is that different vis-a-vis what happened with the Pfizer vaccine. I think the most important thing to recognize is that the Pfizer adolescent vaccine was authorized prior to any substantial discussion about myocarditis as a benefit or as a risk. In fact, the signal emerged a few weeks later just before we made our filing. And I think a prudent approach there was to the Vertex conducted, there was ongoing discussions. 
But what we've continued to see over the course of the over the last 4 or 5 months is that for both mRNA vaccines, there's a question of whether there's an increased rate of myocarditis above background in 18 to 24-year-old males, a relatively small population, but an important ones. 
And I think it's in the face of those continuing emerging questions, that the FDA is being diligent and appropriately conservative in their approach and making sure they have the time to review those. And they have continued to come out over time. 
And so I think, principally, what we're seeing here is a difference is a function of timing, which is that the other vaccine had been authorized prior to this concern, and there has been continued emerging data around that. 
We are very grateful to the FDA for that diligence. I would note that the same information are available to other regulators. And as I have said before, we are authorized for that population internationally. And fortunately, as Paul characterized, we have not seen an increased rate of myocarditis in 12 to 17 years. And we think, over time, the substantial benefits of our vaccine will ultimately win out here. And so we look forward to continuing to work with the FDA. So that's my best version of what I think we heard from them last week. 
The question about how we see that evolving over time. Obviously, internationally, we are participating in the market. In the United States, adolescent vaccinations have substantially tailed off, as we all would note. And so the extent that there is an ongoing need in the United States for vaccination, it is a diminishing market for sure. And again, this is a primary series vaccine. And so we do hope that most people in the world will 0 convert and not need a primary series moving forward. 
The question then of what is that endemic market going forward, that is the greatest import. And I tried to summarize that in our view of the evolution of this virus and what that need will be. It is, we believe, in the future, a booster market. And to booster market targeted at those populations that are higher risk of respiratory disease. Those populations tend to be older adults and immune compromised. Places where we think mRNA-1273 is demonstrating really remarkable efficacy differentiated perhaps. But public data, publicly-reported data is really encouraging on that dimension. 
And I would note, that is not a population that's associated to date with any of the vaccines that have an increased rate of myocarditis. 
And so the benefit risk there, we think, even swings more favorably to -1273, but we'll allow data to continue to develop and ultimately drive this behavior. 
So we are quite encouraged by the performance of the vaccine in the population that we think is going to be most important in the years ahead. 
The last question was on flu, which is what do we think about that data? Obviously, as you pointed to, there are [indiscernible] of protection that have been used previously with AI titers in influenza vaccine. We will be looking at that as I'm sure everybody will as well as other responses in the immune system as we continue to try and identify the optimal dose. I'm not going to put out there a view of what I think our view of success will look like. I would just say that we have very high expectations for our platform. 
Now we do believe that our performance in older adults, including with the COVID vaccine, but also more recently with the RSV booster study in Phase I demonstrates that our platform does incredibly well in those at highest risk of these respiratory viral diseases. And so we're optimistic that we will continue to show strong performance, hopefully, strongest performance in those populations. But I won't give you a specific tighter number today."

So first, I think we're very excited about the programs that are already in the clinical space, either already dosing patients or about to start. And so I think the most important thing is looking forward to next year, the demonstration, we would hope, of proof of concept in that rare disease modality. 
As you know, we are dosing quite a large number of folks in proprionic acidemia, and we've been dosing in methylmalonic acidemia with the opening of the GSA-1A IND, we'd hope to be following a short order there. 
So all 3 of those are potentials for us to demonstrate the real proof that this technology can be used to correct in more errors of metabolism in these populations. I'll also note that there's a quite a wide range of disease going down as young as 2 years of age in the -- in some of the organic acidemias and the older adults in some of the GSD1a program. So we're going to be demonstrating quite a lot there. 
[indiscernible] presents another opportunity for that proof of concept as the PKU program when that moves forward, but those are still in preclinical, as I said. 
So the question is what do we do on the back of that proof of concept from any one or all of those programs. What you've seen us do in respiratory vaccines and in vaccines generally is probably the best predictor of how we will respond, which is, as you know, there are a very, very large number of metabolic diseases that could be addressed through the liver on therapy. We have -- we could list off large groups, but the recycle disorders, other organic acidemias, so many beyond that. And even in moving into more broadly present metabolic diseases. So what we would is we would define that systemic intracytotherapeutic modality as a core modality, just like we did with vaccines a couple of years ago. And that would cause us to dramatically expand that pipeline. 
Now I can assure you we're looking at those programs in research right now, but we will -- we have held back on moving them into preclinical development and putting them on our pipeline until we've seen the modalities perform. 
So that is probably the most important thing for me, looking at the rare and orphan disease space over the course of the coming year is when do we cross that threshold? And then ultimately, when do we expand dramatically that pipeline of programs."

So I think you already highlighted some of the other drivers. 
So on '21, so there's 2 things I think that is driving first is, of course, the lower volume. And the second one is price. As you know, we are working very hard with several governments to send products that they have bought for high-income countries like the U.S. to low-income country this side of Christmas. 
And so when you think about just the U.S., the U.S., we see that publicly. When we announced our African Union partnership, the U.S. decided to delay to Q2, the delivery over December quarter. That volume is going to African Union at a low tier price. So do you have an impact on the turnover just by doing the math of a lower price on the same volume right there. 
And some orders that are moving from December to January on the supply volume side of things. So when you're on to 22, where you have the increase of volume moved from December to January. That is one. We've signed new APAs since the last numbers. And as I said, some options have been exercised. One of them was a COVAX option. That was exercised at the end of Q3. That is now counted as a full APA because the summer film commitment and some prepayments and so on. And so those are the dynamics that are happening. 
The team also is starting to spend a lot of time on the commercial team on focusing on the fall of '22 because we think that's going to be an important moment. The mix and match, we think is critical. That is now allowed in most places. In some countries, they just mix and match for a long time. But the U.S. market, of course, is important, is allowing mix and match. 
And as Paul just shared, we believe that as time will go, the data will show that what we believe is that we have a longer duration efficacy vaccine on the market. 
And today, if you look at data and market research, very few consumer in the U.S. know that. People that are looking this call know that because you repay pros in on a daily basis. A few people in the U.S. We believe there is an opportunity for us between now and let's say next summer to make sure that people understand the facts, understand the real-world evidence so that they can make an informed decision and that includes the health care workers, the pharmacies, the doctors, the nurses that include the consumers directly. And so this is why, as we're starting to sharpen our pencils and probably spend a lot of time working towards the fall of '22, we believe that's another. That was not if you go back to our previous numbers. We only disclose APAs and options of APAs, the commercial opportunities for a 22, we think is going to be an important vector to the '22 sales.

However, as you point out, generally 0 conversion is defined as a fourfold rise in titers above baseline, and we've done that in some of our other studies. And we will be looking at that from the percentage of people who achieve that 0 conversion. 
And most important to me, we'll be looking at the consistency of that percentage across ages. In particular, the older adults where you often don't achieve the type of the same level of immunogenicity, but we believe with our platform well. There are other endpoints as well in terms of 0 protection defined as absolute titers. -- again, greater than 40 is accepted we will look how high that goes because that can also be reassuring. But I don't think right now we're ready to guide on a specific target that we will declare success other than looking again at that fourfold rise for measuring 0 conversion across the range of agents that we'll be studying in the study."

128680956,1685132291,2424896,"Moderna, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Moderna, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Cory. So let me take this part. The APAs do not have options. When we say 17 billion of APAs, those are firm orders, signed orders and all our APAs have upfront payments.

When we say 17 billion of APAs, those are firm orders, signed orders and all our APAs have upfront payments. David did a nice job walking you through the cash upfront we are receiving for those contracts. It's one of the way that we are conducting our business. We want people to be very committed and to have a material upfront of the total value of the deal when they signed. 
The options components that we characterize is up to 3 billion as of today. Those are true options, meaning people are reserving capacity. And sometimes it's for financing rhythm because, again, as I said, we do not do APAs without upfront. 
And one of the best examples today is COVAX we had to do a quarterly option with COVAX. As I said, it just exercised our Q2 option at the end of Q3. But Q3 2022 and Q4 2022 going to Cove are still options and it's mostly because of the funding issue. They don't have the cash. They get cash from their different funders, which are mostly government and foundation on the kind of a month-to-month basis. And so we did that to help go back and to do the right thing to help the planet. As you know, we don't have to do options. We say, if you want the vaccine when you sign a contract and you pay an upfront. But with COVAX, we don't get to do so. We thought it was the right thing to do. And so we expect, if they want their Q3 volume, that in Q1, they will exercise the options or so end of Q4, cash options, COVAX is. 
On the endemic and the ventilation of the sales over the year, I think it will be dangerous to assume at this stage, one way or other in terms of first half and second half because of volume and also pricing. 
As you get a sense, the COVAX, the African Union and some [indiscernible] deals we have are lower prices and David mentioned that, fewer pricing. And so there might be a large volume, but the pro way lower than what the commercial market could drive, which we believe is going to be above what has been the pandemic price again because of volume. And so we are so people stocking ahead of when they need to inject in pharmacies. I would be cautioned that assuming Q1 to be lower in Q2 is a bit too early."

And just I guess I'm trying to determine how to optimize the regimen by things like dose titration or even selecting the population by more urgent need for the COVID booster side of things."
128680956,1685132291,2424896,"Moderna, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Moderna, Inc.","Executives","Thank you for the question. It's a great one. So what we're going to be looking at in the combinations are actually the things that you just pointed to. And so in particular, we do believe the most of the value of respiratory vaccination in the near term,",628,"Thank you for the question. It's a great one. So what we're going to be looking at in the combinations are actually the things that you just pointed to. And so in particular, we do believe the most of the value of respiratory vaccination in the near term, boosting will be in older adults. 50-plus or 60-plus depending upon how you want to look at it, very similar to the RSV population, certainly for the flu population and recommendations globally. And we think COVID moves that direction as well. 
And so as we look to the first part of the question, where do we intend to optimize that ratio in immunogenicity. It really is towards those higher risk populations that do need, we think, a respiratory booster every year. When it comes to looking at the -- what are the combination of things that we're going to be doing in selecting that ratio in dose, obviously, it's mostly going to be immunogenicity and the tolerability profile. Fortunately, these vaccines have been very safe to date in these older adult populations. None of the concerns that we're having about myocarditis really exists in the 50 plus, 60 plus populations. And so we feel very confident on the overall safety profile. But the question will be, where are we in optimizing the immunogenicity against endpoints that are pretty well validated now in COVID, and where are we against the immunogenicity against endpoints that are also broadly accepted in influenza. 
We will be doing this for a range of different -- it's a 4-strain, seasonal strain vaccine. And so -- we want to make sure there's no interference between those and that we're able to achieve strong balance immunity across the 4 flu strains plus the COVID vaccine. 
I think we have approximate targets based on the immunogenicity we saw from Phase III and the immunogenicity we're seeing in the Booster studies. But the open question is are we going to need all of that for the COVID portion of our vaccine going forward. 
And so we'll continue to follow over time whether we see more durable protection and therefore, you would be able to optimize further that dose, if there was a reason to do so. And then the second part is with the seasonal annual flu component. We just want to understand, particularly in the older adult population where flu vaccines have had less clear efficacy every season, is maybe even way else say it. And there is an opportunity for improvement by raising those titers. We're going to want to look to whether or not we need to get those titers above what have been achieved by others. And I'll note that there's a precedent even for high-dose flu vaccines in that market that have been differentiated on price and grabbing market share. 
And so it could cause us to look in that 60-plus or 50-plus population at really indexing more to those flu antigens and making sure that we exceed or at least achieve that similar high degree of 0 conversion there. 
So those are the factors that we'll look at around the -1073 program that we've announced. We're looking at a range of ratios. 
Fortunately, we're going to have experience. We already have experience in flu and COVID from our prior work, and it will be a demonstration we hope, of the ability to combine vaccines. 
I will note as a final comment, we have done combination respiratory vaccines in the past, including in adults with the -1653 program. And so we do have a basis we're beginning to think about how we might combine those antigens going forward. 
But ultimately, we'll let the -1073 study and the early clinical experiences there be confirmatory around this."

So we're -- the answer from our target perspective is as fast as we can because we ultimately think there's just such a huge unmet need here, and we're excited to get the study going. There are some caveats that I should put around that, which is it probably won't be as fast as we did in COVID, which was obviously in a couple of months, because we are targeting a population at high risk of disease. And in this case, we're looking for women of child-bearing age who are exposed to 0 conversion of COVID-19 -- with CMV. And that is often those that are exposed to children because that's the primary vector for those infections. And so we want to make sure that we get the right population. And that matters because this is a case-driven study. As we're kind of familiar with based on COVID-19, the number of cases we achieve that will ultimately dictate those interim analyses that we're looking for in the time ahead. 
And so it makes sense to try and enrich for the at-risk population. So you might see a slower enrollment curve or it might go really fast. We're going to work as hard as we can go very fast. But the most important thing is that we need to be enrolling those that are at highest risk because we think that will ultimately generate the cases that accelerates the interim readout. We won't -- because it is an interim readout that's driven on the cases, I can't predict when that will happen. What I can do is I can try and enrich for those cases in the way I just described."

Is that something that we'd start to see a little bit of early next year? Is that more of a 4Q phenomenon in terms of the budgetary timing and sort of quarterly contract and Stéphane talked about. 
Secondarily, I have a few small piggy back question on the numbers. You -- on Slide 15, the $6.7 billion in deposits, that was ably all for APAs for '21 or '22? Or does some of that applied to APAs for delivery -- for contracts for 2023. 
Thirdly, your CapEx guidance a little lower than it was last Q. Is that $50 million to $150 million that you took out of that? Is that absolute savings? Or is that just going to get pushed into next year as some of the contract revenues were. 
And then finally, a little more substantive of the question. How much perspective can you give us on you're able to potentially compete for share on contracting in EU, the competitor Pfizer and have locked in pretty large contracts on volume for the next 2 years? Is there an opportunity for you guys to start capturing more share returns or relevant to the EU? 
And last and finally, we talked on the last quarter about potentially access the China market where you guys are essentially not existing at this point.

So on Q4, we already actually picked COVAX products. And the African Union will be in December, as we communicated in the press release. And it's going to be a big ramp into next year, obviously, in terms of European share, which was one of your questions. So if you look at it, there's a few things. 
First, in Europe, if you remember, we had a late and slow launch in Europe because we had no manufacturing capacity in Europe. If you recall, when we started the pandemic, we had [indiscernible] that we converted, and we were not allowed to export or we serve the U.S. market. So long that came online a bit later in [ Norwood ] because we have nothing in [indiscernible] they started some time in the summer to just get machines and get the facility ready. 
And so indeed, in Europe, we have a lesser share than we have in the U.S., except for example, for Switzerland like you saw earlier. 
And so as the country gets more and more of an understanding first that mRNA vaccines are superior. The over vaccine that [indiscernible] are not really used anymore as my understanding, they're mostly given through COVAX. 
I think we have an interesting opportunity because as I said, as you take -- you talk to health care leaders, health minister as you get more and more data that Paul shared were better and better understanding that the 2 vaccines are not the same. 
And so again, as we look into 2022, we already have a contract with Europe in '22. And we are discussing also with country by country on the data and using the benefit of the Moderna vaccine versus the other one. 
And then the other question is going to stay in Europe, which is today. contracts are done at the European level because this was organized and agreed by Europe because of the pandemic. 
The big question that's going to be out there is when do countries start to be buying by themselves because they have to make guesses of supply when they set up the '21 and the '22 agreements that might not meet the needs that they have as we understand better the different profiles of a vaccine. 
And so I think it's going to be quite interesting to see the share opportunity that we have in Europe. Also as we build our teams, you remember, we had no infrastructure in Europe and 0, not 1 Moderna employee in commercial. We have now teams in several countries in Europe, in the U.K., in Spain, New France, in Germany, building the Italian team as we speak. So I think that also helped because we get feet on the ground to be able to get the message that -- of the real world data. David, do you want to take the capital financial questions."

Secondly, in terms of CapEx, I think the answer is yes, you can expect, as I said, we're going to see a notable increase in our CapEx next year. But generally, in terms of the reduction this year, it's a combination of things moving into the first quarter of next year and also we're running, in some cases, at or below the estimated investment requirements.

Today, I will start by a quick business review of the quarter before David presents the key financials. Paul will then walk you through some real-world evidence update, and Stephen will provide a clinical development update. I will then come back to close to share some thoughts about where we are heading.  
Let's start on Slide 5 with a holistic pipeline update. First, respiratory vaccines.  
We are pleased to have filed the BLA for COVID-19 vaccine to FDA and have now received a priority review designation. We received our first full approval for Spikevax back in Canada. We received EUA from the FDA for a 50-microgram booster and mix and match has been authorized. We also received authorization for boosters from other major geographies, EMEA, U.K. and so on. We were informed recently that the FDA may take until January 2022 to review the EUA request for 12 to 17 years of age.  
Turning now to flu, mRNA-1010 is fully enrolled for the Phase I and we expect human data soon now. For RSV, mRNA-1345, after very positive data in the Phase I with high neutralizing antibody levels after 1 dose, our teams are finalizing the preparation of the Phase II/III in all the adults. This study should start soon.  
We also announced our development candidate for COVID booster plus flu booster in a single dose, mRNA-1073, which we anticipate will be in the clinic soon.  
Let me now turn to vaccine against latent viruses. As many of you know, latent viruses are a major cause of health problems. Latent viruses are made of DNA viruses. And once a human is infected by latent virus, that virus will stay in the body. You are familiar with some latent viruses like HIV and HPV. There are many others that harms humans.  
As a company, we are committed to developing a portfolio of first-in-class vaccines and therapeutics against these latent viruses.  
Our first programs are CMV vaccine, EBV vaccine and EBV therapeutic vaccine. We have also partnered to work on 2 HIV vaccines.  
Last week marked a big milestone for Moderna. We started hosting in the clinic the first participants of our Phase III pivotal registration study for CMV vaccine mRNA-1647. This marks the second Phase III study that the company has started and brings us one step closer to getting another important vaccine to millions of people around the world.  
Our EBV vaccine, mRNA-1189 should start dosing for its Phase I very soon. And our new development candidate on the EBV therapeutic vaccine, mRNA-1195, is moving toward the clinic.  
Let me now turn to therapeutics. Our personalized cancer vaccine is in Phase II. KEYTRUDA monotherapy is fully enrolled, and we expect data in the back end of 2022. Our genetic programs continued to progress well in the clinic. PA has its Phase I dose cohort fully enrolled. MMA is dosing patients in its Phase I. GSD1a has an open IND and has received Orphan Drug Designation by FDA.  
So as you can see, we have got 3 rare genetic disease programs in the clinic or soon to be in the clinic. So we look forward to sharing clinical data in the coming months.  
We are very proud to have found the way to get  Crigler Najjar type 1 of CN-1 to patients through a donation of IP and the assets to the institute for life-changing medicines. CN-1 disease is a ultra-rare disease with very few patients afflicted around the world. For ultra-rare disease, just because of clinical development will result in a very high price for a few patients around the world that could benefit.  
This model is not one that we support. So instead of developing the drug and charging a very high price, we decided to give the drug away and innovate through a creative partnership. We provide the drug to the institutes. We pay for clinical trial material, the institute pays for the clinical trial cost. If a drug is approved, we'll provide the medicines to the kids and their families for free. And we will not charge any royalty or milestone to the institutes. We believe this is the right thing to do to continue to contribute to society for ultra-rare disease where our mRNA platform can help.  
One of the important news item announced today is the introduction of a new modality to our existing 6 modalities. We are very pleased to announce that Vertex and Moderna are now in GLP tox studies for the cystic fibrosis program, VXc-522.  
This marks our first inhaled pulmonary therapeutics program. I would like to congratulate and thank our scientific team as well as the Vertex team for having been able to develop a novel lipid formulation to allow inhaled pulmonary delivery. This is really exciting for patients.  
As we communicated previously, in addition to doing therapeutics using mRNA coding for human proteins like the ones I just described, we want to use our mRNA plus lipid technologies to develop therapeutics using mRNA coding for gene editing enzymes. We are pleased to announce our first partnership in that field. We announced earlier this week that we entered into a licensing collaboration with Metagenomi based in California, to use their next-generation gene editing enzymes. We believe that their technology coupled with our mRNA plus lipid technologies, and our manufacturing infrastructure will produce some exciting new medicine to take into the clinic. I am very pleased with the progress of the company. We are increasing depth in vaccines and at the same time, increasing breadth of application with our 7 modalities the lung and gene editing.  
On Slide 6, you will find financial highlights. For Q3, we reported revenue of around $5 billion, enabled by delivering 208 million doses of our COVID-19 vaccine. Net income of $3.3 billion. Our cash and cash equivalents position was $15 billion at the end of September.  
Since the end of the quarter, we have been working to gain better visibility into those variables that will impact our full year results. And we have much better visibility today than we did a month ago.  
For fiscal year 2021, we are updating the range of doses we plan to deliver to 700 million to 800 million doses. The key variable of this update volume range are: first, longer lead time for exports to countries outside the U.S. and for international shipments in general.  
In Q3, we shipped more deliveries to new international market and expect Q4 to also have more international deliveries. As we deliver to these countries for the first time, we expect the process to become more a routine and delivery time to short term. However, some Q4 deliveries may still move to early 2022 as a result.  
Second, in Q3, we have expanded our fill finish capacity with our manufacturing partners, which has the temporary impact on our shipments. That work is complete now, and we should see a positive impact from this expansion very soon.  
Third, the bottleneck of production has moved down the manufacturing line to product release. We added additional resources, skilled personnel to the release and of the manufacturing line, and we expect to increase the weekly number of doses released.  
We believe resolution of these factors put us in a good position heading into Q4 and 2022.  
Now if I turn to revenue for '21. The updated revenue range for 2021 is $15 billion to $18 billion. This range reflects updated delivery schedule with fewer doses delivered in '21, as some doses are pushed into 2022. And also, the pricing impact of prioritization delivery to COVAX and African Union that have a lower tier pricing.  
On Slide 7, let me start by summarizing the scale of operational challenges that the team had to work through, as we scale for making less than 100,000 doses in [ 2020 ] to hundreds of millions of doses in 2021. Q1 scale-up challenges were around drug substance, making mRNA in lipid.  
To do scale-up challenges, we're on drug product and ensuring we could fill in our pipes. In the first half of the year, we made great progress in these challenges, as you can see from the numbers on the right. We now have 901 million doses of drug substance that have been formulated and a large volume bags of mRNA product. And we have 770 million doses of drug products already in vials. To do scale-up challenges, we're on product release as the supply chain became more complex with increased deliveries to many countries around the world.  
At the beginning of the year, we supplied just a few large countries.  
As mentioned before, we are working through this challenges, and as November [ 1 ], we achieved 566 million doses around the world. With the progress year-to-date, we expect to be able to deliver to 700 million to 800 million doses for the full year 2021.  
We were pleased to be named last week for the seventh year in a row as 1 of the top 20 biotech and pharmacal company in the world by science. We continue to invest in science and the culture of our team. We aim at building the best mRNA science in the world in the culture of boldness, collaboration, curiosity and relentlessness.  
On Slide 9, you will find our usual summary slide, which describes some of the key high-level attributes of the company as of today.  
Now let me turn it over to David."

We're providing today the analysis of actual 2021 third quarter results, along with an updated view of key drivers of financial performance going forward. Turning now to Slide 11 starting with an overview of our sales performan",1788,"Okay. Thank you, Stephane.  We're providing today the analysis of actual 2021 third quarter results, along with an updated view of key drivers of financial performance going forward. Turning now to Slide 11 starting with an overview of our sales performance before commenting more broadly on our financial results.  
Total product sales in the third quarter were $4.8 billion, representing 208 million doses delivered to our customers. This compares to sales of $4.2 billion and 199 million doses in Q2 and sales of $1.7 billion and 102 million doses in Q1 of this year.  
Sales to the U.S. government were $1.2 billion in the third quarter reflecting 73 million doses delivered compared to $2.1 million and 126 million doses in Q2 and sales of $1.4 billion and 88 million doses in Q1.  
Sales to the rest of the world were $3.6 billion in the third quarter, reflecting 136 million doses delivered compared to sales of $2.1 billion and 73 million doses in Q2 and $0.4 billion of sales and 14 million doses in Q1.  
This reflects the significant manufacturing ramp up outside the U.S. over the last 2 quarters. The relatively modest increase of delivered doses in Q3 versus Q2 was driven by the factors that Stephane just explained. We continue to scale our production network and are working to achieve an increased quarter-over-quarter improvement starting in Q4.  
Turning to Slide 12. The transformation of Moderna from an R&D-focused biotech to a commercial company continues to be very apparent when reviewing our financial results. The comparison of the third quarter of 2021 to prior year is not meaningful due to our significant growth, which is why we will primarily focus on the quarter-over-quarter comparison relative to Q2 on the slide.  
Total revenue was $5 billion in the third quarter of 2021 and compared to $4.4 billion in the second quarter and $0.2 billion in the prior year period. The increase of total revenue is driven by the sale of the company's COVID-19 vaccine. Product sales in Q3 were $4.8 billion compared to $4.2 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 15%. Cost of sales was $722 million or 15% of the company's product sales in the third quarter compared to $750 million or 18% of product sales in the second quarter.  
The quarter-over-quarter percentage improvement is driven by higher average selling price as a result of shifts in our customer mix and to a smaller extent by favorable manufacturing costs.  
Research and development expenses were $521 million in the third quarter, up from $421 million in Q2 and $344 million in the same period in 2020. The higher spend versus prior quarter and prior year was driven by increased COVID-19 vaccine clinical development activities, including our announced efforts around booster variant-specific and multivalent vaccine candidates. Headcount increases as well as external costs to support our growing and maturing development pipeline beyond the COVID-19 vaccine activities also contributed to the expense increase.  
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $168 million for Q3 compared to $121 million in the prior quarter and $48 million for the same period in the prior year.  
The growth in spending was driven by the commercialization of our COVID-19 vaccine globally with continued investments in personnel and outside services in support of the accelerated company build-out.  
Provision for income taxes was $219 million in the third quarter, following $283 million in Q2 and an insignificant amount in the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 6%.  
Let me remind you of the fact that we had a net operating loss carryforward of $2.3 billion at the end of 2020. This year, we started to release the valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets, which results in an estimated nonrecurring full year benefit to our effective tax rates of about 5 percentage points.  
Our Q3 effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate, primarily due to the just described benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and an excess tax deduction related to stock-based compensation. This last item drove the quarter-over-quarter reduction due to the increase in our share price in Q3 versus Q2.  
We recorded net income of $3.3 billion in Q3 compared to $2.8 billion in Q2, an increase of 20%. This compares to a loss of $0.2 billion in Q3 of last year.  
Diluted earnings per share for Q3 2021 were $7.70.  
Turning now to year-to-date financial results compared to prior year on Slide 13. Total revenue was $11.3 billion for the first 9 months of this year compared to $0.2 billion for the same period in 2020. The significant growth was driven by the sales of 510 million doses of the company's COVID-19 vaccine.  
Grant revenue of $473 million in the first 9 months of 2021, an increase of $286 million compared to the prior year was primarily driven by increases in revenue from BARDA related to the company's COVID-19 vaccine development. Cost of sales was $1.7 billion or 16% of the company's product sales for the year-to-date period as of September 30, including third-party royalties of $400 million.  
A portion of the inventory costs associated with this year's product sales was expensed as prelaunch inventory costs in 2020. If inventories sold for the first 9 months of this year was valued at cost, our cost of sales for the period would have been 17% of the product sales.  
Research and development expenses were $1.3 billion for the 9 months ended September 30 of this year compared to $0.6 billion for the same period in 2020.  The growth in spending in 2021 was mainly due to increase in clinical trial expenses and to a lesser extent personnel-related costs, manufacturing expenses and consulting an outside services primarily driven by increased mRNA-1273 clinical development activities.  
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $0.4 billion for the first 9 months of this year compared to $0.1 billion for the same period in 2020. The growth in spending in 2021 was mainly due to increases in consulting and outside services, personnel-related costs and marketing expenses primarily attributable to the company's COVID-19 vaccine commercialization-related activities and increased headcount.
For the 9 months ended September 30, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $541 million compared to insignificant amounts in the same period in 2020. Our effective tax rate for the first 9 months of this year was 7%. it was lower than the U.S. statutory rate, primarily due to nonrecurring benefits related to the release of the valuation allowance, the ongoing benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction as well as a discrete item for excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation.  
Net income was $7.3 billion for the 9 months ended September 30 of this year, compared to a net loss of $0.5 billion for the same period in 2020. Diluted earnings per share were $17 for the first 9 months of 2021.  
Turning to cash and selected cash flow information on Slide 14. We ended Q3 2021 with cash and investments of $15.3 billion compared to $12.2 billion at the end of Q2. The increase is driven by our commercial sales and additional customer deposits received in the third quarter for future purchases of our COVID-19 vaccine. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 billion in Q3 after $4.1 billion in Q2. The quarter-over-quarter reduction is driven by a lower amount of cash deposits for future product supply received in Q3 compared to Q2.  
On a year-to-date basis, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.3 billion compared to $0.8 billion in the prior year.  
Cash used for purchases of property and equipment was $164 million for the 9 months ended September 30 compared to $44 million for the same period in 2020, reflecting continuous investments in our manufacturing infrastructure.  
Now turning to Slide 15. Let me briefly expand further on our cash and investment position and the net balance of cash deposits for future product supply, as this is an important point when modeling future cash flows. The cash and investment balance reported as of September 30 was $15.3 billion, up from $12.2 billion as of June 30. The increase is driven by our commercial activities, including cash receipts from product sales and customer deposits for future product supply. The net balance cash deposits for future product supply was $6.7 billion at the end of Q3 at the similar level to the balance in Q2 of this year.  
Turning now to the 2021 updated financial framework on Slide 16. For the full year 2021, we expect a product sales range of $15 billion to $18 billion. We now expect to be able to deliver 700 million to 800 million doses at the 100-microgram dose level to our customers. This compares to the prior outlook of 800 million to 1 billion doses.  
Our total cost of sales includes the cost of goods manufactured, third-party royalties as well as logistics and warehousing costs. Given the favorability we have observed in the year-to-date period, we now expect total cost of sales as a percent of product sales between 16% to 17% for the full year 2021. This compares to our previous outlook of 18% to 20% of product sales.  
For 2022, we currently expect the cost of sales ratio to exceed 20%,driven by customer mix and multiple presentation types.  
On the R&D and SG&A expense side, we continue to plan for an increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis and expect this trend to continue for the remainder of 2021 and beyond driven by a maturing development portfolio and the scale-up of our commercial activities.  
Based on further increased visibility of the utilization of our accumulated net operating loss carryforward, expected global sales mix and the mentioned discrete benefits in the first 9 months of this year, we now expect our all-in 2021 tax rate to be in the high single-digit range. This compares to our previous forecast of approximately 10%.  
Since we won't have a material benefit from our valuation allowance in future years, we expect our reported 2022 effective tax rate will increase relative to our 2021 rate. It's also too early to further comment on impacts from a potential tax reform.  
Finally, regarding capital investments. We are now planning for approximately $0.4 billion of capital investment to fall into the 2021 calendar year compared to our previous range of $450 million to $550 million. We are strongly committed to a further build-out of our manufacturing and general company infrastructure and hence, predict capital investment in 2022 will be meaningfully above 2021 levels.  
This concludes my remarks concerning the financial performance, and I now turn the call over to Paul Burton."

With more than 150 million people worldwide now having received 2 doses of our vaccine, we are humbled to be able to see the positive impact it is having on people's lives around the world.",1157,"Thank you, David, and good morning, good afternoon, everyone.  
With more than 150 million people worldwide now having received 2 doses of our vaccine, we are humbled to be able to see the positive impact it is having on people's lives around the world. We are reminded of the fact that almost 250 million people have been infected with COVID-19 globally and 5 million people have lost their lives. Our profound thanks, as always, go out to those on the front lines, working tirelessly to keep us safe in this ongoing fight.  
Through numerous independent studies, time and time again, we see consistent findings showing that mRNA-1273 is highly effective in saving lives, reducing hospitalizations and reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection. I will highlight a few of these independently conducted studies this morning.  
In Slide 18, I will begin with some of the data from the United States government. These data come from the CDC and show through September of this year, the difference in COVID-19 cases between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. An unvaccinated person has an 11-fold greater risk of dying from COVID-19 underscoring the importance of getting vaccinated plays in our protection and ending this pandemic.  
The data showed that vaccination with mRNA-1273  provides the greatest protection, not only against COVID-19 infection, but also death due to COVID-19. In fact, even during the surge of the Delta virus variant during the summer months this year, Moderna's vaccine had the lowest reported deaths associated with breakthrough infection as the CDC data demonstrated.
Approximately 160 million doses of the Moderna vaccine have been administered in the United States. And in the next slide, I want to show you some further government-generated data in a country where the Moderna vaccine has also had extensive use and that country is Switzerland.  
You can see here exposure data on the left. Approximately 3.6 million people have been fully vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine and 1.9 million people have been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer BionTech vaccine.  
These government-generated data from the Federal Office of Public Health in Switzerland, again, are clear and showed that vaccination with the Moderna vaccine is highly effective at reducing infections, hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 infection.  
For every 1 million people vaccinated use of mRNA-1273 would be expected to result in 643 fewer COVID-19 breakthrough infections, 78 hospitalizations and 38 fewer deaths.  
Next, in Slide 20, our data from 2 other recent independent studies that build on the results I just showed you from Switzerland. The first study on the left side of this slide, followed 38 million vaccinated people in the United States, Iceland and South Korea. And again, found that those people vaccinated with mRNA-1273 were at 53% reduced risk of a COVID-19 infection and 33% reduced risk of a COVID-19 hospitalization compared to those vaccinated with the alternate mRNA vaccine.  
The data on the right hand of the slide are from a recent publication by Nordstrom and colleagues in Sweden and Norway, showing that mRNA-1273 delivered 87% vaccine effectiveness during a time of high Delta variant circulation in those countries.  
The data I've shared so far are all from the general population. Let me turn now to the effectiveness of the Moderna vaccine, in particularly vulnerable populations the immunocompromised. These data were published just 2 days ago, again, by the United States CDC vision network and examine vaccine effectiveness at preventing COVID-19 hospitalization, which is so critically important in individuals with a variety of immunocompromised medical conditions between January and September of this year.  
As the authors of this study note, with the exception of those individuals with rheumatic disorders, vaccine effective point estimates were generally higher for the Moderna vaccine than for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the difference in effectiveness in these hard to immunize populations is shown in the column on the right.  
I want to turn now to the topic of myocarditis and to put it in the context of the clinical benefits of vaccination that I've just described with mRNA-1273.  It is important to recognize that the cases of myocarditis reported to occur following mRNA vaccination of rare, generally mild, typically respond to conservative treatment and self-limiting. Health authorities have reviewed many data sets and the U.S. CDC and WHO have concluded that there is risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after receiving any mRNA vaccine.  The WHO's Advisory Committee on vaccine safety notes that myocaditis can occur following SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 disease and that mRNA vaccines have a clear benefit in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19. 
Analysis from our global safety database show that the events of myocarditis are very rare. Overall, we observed 9.5 cases of myocarditis per million vaccinated individuals compared to an expected rate of 21 cases per million individuals.
Now in common with other reports of mRNA vaccines in individuals aged 18 to 24, we see an increased rate of myocarditis of 40 cases versus 17 expected cases per million individuals. These data from our own safety database are consistent with the findings from safety databases evaluated by the CDC and other global health authorities. And the link to the CDC analysis is provided on the slide below.   
MRNA-1273 has been authorized for use in adolescents, aged 12 to 18 in multiple countries around the world. Moderna's global safety database has information on an estimated 1.5 million of them, providing us an opportunity to look at the rate of myocarditis in those individuals and those data are shown in this table. We see the small absolute well-described risk of increased myocarditis rates in males aged 18 to 24 that I just described to you. But we do not see an increased risk in adolescents neither in boys nor in girls. These data are reassuring and important as we continue to offer mRNA-1273 to adults, adolescents and as we file for authorization in children.  
So in summary, the data I've shared with you today from independent government reports in the United States and in Switzerland, countries with high vaccination rates of Moderna's vaccine showed mRNA-1273 is associated with lowest breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19. Other independent studies in millions of individuals continue to show that mRNA-1273 is highly effective in reducing the risk of breakthrough COVID-19 as well as hospitalizations and death. And importantly, this is also true in those vulnerable and hard to vaccinate immunocompromised patient populations.  
Moderna's global safety database of 151 million vaccinated individuals shows a rate of myocarditis in males aged 18 to 24 that is consistent with analysis by CDC and others. Moderna's global safety database does not show an increased risk of myocarditis in 1.5 million individuals below the age of 18 and vaccinated with Spikevax.
So these -- this concludes my quick overview of some recent analyses of mRNA-1273 effectiveness data and review of data from our global safety database. And I will now turn the call over to Stephen."
128680956,1685132291,2425593,"Moderna, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Moderna, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll review the progress we've made across our vaccines and therapeutics pipeline.  Let me start with our COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, for adult ages 18 and above, where there are a n",2045,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll review the progress we've made across our vaccines and therapeutics pipeline.  
Let me start with our COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, for adult ages 18 and above, where there are a number of important regulatory updates.  
First, we have announced that the FDA granted priority review to Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine BLA.  
In October, we also received an EUA from the FDA and the European Commission's approval for a booster dose of our COVID-19 vaccine at the 50-microgram dose level for the adult cohort, ages 18 and above.  
Turning to the adolescents and pediatric settings. As a reminder, there are 2 clinical trials for each of these groups: TeenCOVE is our study in the adolescent population, 12 to 17 year olds; and KidCove is the study in the pediatric population, age 11 and younger. For the adolescent population, 12 to 17 years old, our vaccine is authorized in a number of countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, the European Union, Canada, Switzerland, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia and Argentina to name a few. 
We've submitted data from our KidCove study to the FDA in the United States as well as to other countries. We're recently notified by the FDA that the agency will require additional time to evaluate our proposed amendment due to recent analysis of the risk of myocarditis after vaccination in some populations. The agency expects this evaluation may extend until January 2022.  
As Paul noted, Moderna's global safety database includes an estimated 1.5 million adolescents, who received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, most outside of the United States. And to date, we have not observed a rate of myocarditis from those younger than 18 years in our safety database that points to an increased risk of myocarditis in that population. We continue to believe the benefits of vaccination significantly outweigh the risks.  
In the pediatric setting, our study known as KidCove is ongoing and is focused in 3 age groups, a group with children 6 to 11 years of age; a group of 2 to less than 6; and a group of children 6 months to less than 2. The trial consists of a dose escalation phase for each group, followed by an expansion phase once the dose has been selected.  
Last week, we shared positive top line data from the oldest of the age groups in KidCove, the 6- to 11-year-old cohort, showing the 250-microgram doses of mRNA-1273 were generally well tolerated and that the primary immunogenicity endpoints were met.  
We will submit our results soon to the EMA and other global regulatory agencies.  
For the other 2 age groups in KidCove, the 2 to less than 6 years old group and the 6-month to less than 2-year old group, our dose selection studies are ongoing.  
On the next slide, let me share with you some of the data we have in children ages 6 to less than 12 years of age. This data is after dose 1 as we are waiting for additional follow-up time to share the post-dose 2 data. As a reminder, the study was randomized 2:1 for vaccine versus placebo.  
Based on the case definition of COVID-19 that we used in the Phase III adult study, the observed interim vaccine efficacy was 100% in this analysis, starting 2 weeks after the first dose and using that case definition.  
Vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection was also high at 80%, and vaccine efficacy against symptom -- asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 65%. Both endpoints that we think are incredibly important as we seek to end the pandemic.  
Turning now to our booster and next-generation COVID-19 vaccine programs on Slide 28. As a reminder, we are evaluating multiple COVID-19 vaccines as potential boosters to provide the broadest range of countermeasures to the virus, as it continues to evolve. We were granted EUA for the 50-microgram dose of our current vaccine as a booster, as mentioned previously. And we are currently evaluating 2 variant-specific vaccines and 2 multivalent vaccine candidates, which are combinations of different variants of concern in an effort to stay ahead of the evolving virus.  
In addition, we're also evaluating mRNA-1283 as a next-generation refrigerator stable vaccine, which is in a Phase I study. The interim analysis of that Phase I data has been completed at 3 different dose levels and indicates that a lower dose of mRNA-1283 can achieve similar neutralizing antibody responses as a primary -- in primary series as our authorized vaccine mRNA-1273.  
mRNA-1283 also had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and we're moving forward towards a Phase II booster study for that candidate. This will also evaluate even lower doses of mRNA-1283 given the strong boosting performance seen in Phase I.  
While the start of our booster strategy in late January of this year was in response to the threat of newly identified variants at that time, our booster strategy has continued to evolve as the pandemic unfolds.  
Slide 29 is a slide we shared at our Vaccines Day in April of this year. At the time, the graph on the left was illustrative of our view of the likely path for the pandemic, based on our perspective on respiratory virus evolution and epidemiology, including prior coronavirus pandemics.  
Today, it's becoming clear that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is following the footsteps of other respiratory viruses, and is on its way to becoming a seasonal epidemic/endemic threat.  
So where are we now? With Delta and the potential for other variants, the winter of 2021, 2022 still looks to be a time of moderating but persistent variant epidemic waves. Infection and reinfection continue to cause morbidity and mortality during this phase, but hopefully in fewer people. The focus will remain on suppressing the rate of viral evolution and emergence. Primary vaccination is critical.  
But given the high rate of background transmission, booster vaccines will also be important in all countries.  
Looking ahead, we expect 2022 will be the beginning of the seasonal endemic phase, reinfections in individuals who are at high risk, including older adults, the immunocompromised or healthy adults with more rapidly waning immunity due to under vaccination with potentially less effective vaccines will be at the greatest risk for severe outcomes.  
As with the recent Delta wave, this will include some risk of hospitalization and unfortunately, some risk of death as well as social disruption. We believe this will become the primary population for whom seasonal boosting will provide a significant enduring benefit.  
In summary, as we described earlier this year, we believe SARS-CoV-2 is following a familiar path that will ultimately become a seasonal threat to a large population of higher risk adults. Perhaps the biggest unknown in the near term is the extent to which further viral evolution in the coming Northern Hemisphere winter and Southern Hemisphere winter in 2022 will create hurdle ground for new -- newly transmissible and immune-evading variants to emerge. If so, rapid boosting may become necessary.  
We will need to remain vigilant throughout this time as we fight the pandemic, and we are ready to advance updated boosters rapidly if they become needed.  
Now moving from COVID onto Slide 30. We announced in September that the Phase I portion of our quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccine, mRNA-1010, is fully enrolled, and we look forward to sharing data from that trial and moving to Phase II soon.
We also announced positive Phase I interim data from our RSV vaccine in older adults in September, and we plan to start pivotal Phase II/III RSV vaccine trial before the end of 2021.  
Separately, the pediatric RSV program continues to move forward with cohorts enrolling well in our Phase I study.  
Our hMPV/PIV3 study in pediatrics is also currently enrolling in toddlers.  
We were very excited to announce last week that our Phase III CMV vaccine trial has dosed its first participants. The start of the Phase III trial, CMV -- CMVictory is an important step in evaluating our CMV vaccine against congenital CMV. 
As a reminder, CMV is the #1 cause of birth defects in the United States, and we are evaluating the safety and efficacy of mRNA-1647 in women ages 16 to 40 at the 100-microgram dose level. The trial is starting in the U.S. and will include approximately 150 sites globally, and will enroll on approximately 6,900 women of child-bearing age. Importantly, including criteria of the trial includes women at high risk of CMV exposure through direct exposure in the home, socially or occupationally to children under 5 years of age.  
Diversity in our clinical trials is also extremely important to us, and we're proud to continue our commitment from last year on clinical trial diversity. We believe setting targets and measuring ourselves against them remains one of the most important ways we can work to address the health care inequity in clinical research.  
For the CMVictory Phase III study, our goal is to have 42% of the trial participants in the United States come from communities of color, many of which are disproportionately impacted by the CMV virus.  
Moving on from vaccines. This slide highlights our mRNA therapeutics pipeline. At R&D Day, we described how our modalities and therapeutic areas overlap.  
In oncology, our PCV Phase II trial is now fully enrolled, and we expect to readout for that as early as the fourth quarter of next year.  
Separately, an expansion cohort in head and neck cancer in our Phase I trial is ongoing. We also have Phase I trials ongoing for our KRAS vaccine, which is partnered with Merck, the triplet program; and the IL-12 intratumoral program, which is partnered with AstraZeneca.  
In cardiovascular, our VEGF program, is also partnered with AstraZeneca, has completed the enrollment of a low-dose cohort in its Phase II study and AZ will be providing updates at a presentation of the data at the American Heart Association meeting in 2 weeks.  
Within autoimmune, our IL-2 program is in a Phase I trial in dosing. And within rare diseases, our PA and MMA trials are ongoing in Phase I, and our GSD1a program has an open IND and is expected to start a Phase I study soon. I'm also very excited to announce that our first cystic fibrosis program has moved into preclinical development with IND enabling studies now underway. We and our partners at Vertex are pleased to announce that development candidate, VXc-522.  
This program marks our first program in a brand-new modality inhaled therapeutics. As a reminder, Moderna modality encompasses a new method for utilizing our proprietary lipid nanoparticle technologies and mRNA technologies to bring forward medicines.  
Now double-clicking for a moment on the CF programs in research. Recall that we have 2 partnerships with Vertex. Our first collaboration targets the CFTR protein in trying to produce it using mRNA and LNP technologies. This is where we are advancing our candidate, VXc-522.  
We also have a collaboration with Vertex using mRNA for gene editing and gene therapy. Both collaborations are focused on treating this 10% of CF patients with disease that unfortunately is not addressable with current CFTR modulators.  
For this 10% of the CF population, alternative purchase are absolutely necessary. And the exciting update today, as I said a moment ago, is that we're announcing the first development candidate to move into development from that collaboration described on the left-hand side of this slide.  
In this collaboration, we're delivering messenger RNA that encodes for CFTR protein that is missing or nonfunctional in patients who suffer from cystic fibrosis. We plan to target that 10% that I mentioned a moment ago.  
We've been working incredibly hard with Vertex to advance the candidate, and we are very excited that, that has now moved into IND-enabling studies. As Vertex announced recently, they expect to submit an IND in 2022, paving the path for clinical studies in these patients.  
In the close, I'd like to just highlight our pipeline on the following 3 lines, starting on Slide 35, which includes our respiratory vaccines in development. Slide 36 summarizes our large portfolio of latent virus vaccines and vaccines against other viruses. And on Slide 37, you will see the extensive mRNA therapeutics pipeline that we have in development.  
With that, I'll hand it back to Stephane to close."

Priority #1 is our pan-respiratory annual boost of franchise.  
Priority #2 is our first in-class vaccines for latent viruses. 
Priority #3 is our therapeutics based on mRNA-encoded proteins.  
And Priority #4 is the therapeutic space on mRNA-encoded gene editing enzymes.  
As we have said for several quarters now, SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay and will evolve from a pandemic to endemic setting. We believe that 2022 will see pandemic in low-income countries throughout the year, but at high income countries, the year would be of 2 halves, pandemic priming for children and boosting for others with an endemic boosting campaign in the fall of '22.  
On Slide 42, you can see the revenue drivers that we anticipate will pay out in 2022. We believe there are 3 components that will drive our COVID-19 vaccine revenues for next year.  
First, signed APAs. We have already signed around $17 billion of advanced purchase agreements or APAs for delivery in 2022.  
Second, APA options. They are up to $3 billion of APAs that are in options. Some options have been converted in Q3 from options to FIM order.  
Third, the fall of '22 commercial market. We also believe that the fall of '22, assuming that BLA is granted for boosters, will drive the commercial booster market of up to $2 billion.  
So in total, at this point, we believe that 2022 revenues could be between $17 billion and $22 billion. We, of course, continue to have discussions for 2022 APAs with governments and international organizations, including COVAX, the Pan American Health Organization or PAHO, and the African Union.  
For this pan-respiratory franchise, our goal is to evolve the COVID-19 vaccine primary series into fall of '21 boosters, which is happening as we speak and then fall of '22 boosters and then add to a COVID booster of 2 booster in a single dose and then add to COVID and flu and allergy booster in a single dose.  
Our flu vaccine human data should be out soon. And the team is already preparing the Phase II/III for flu, and RSV is moving fast to Phase II/III.  
If we you look at the health damage of latent viruses, it is profound. EBV is a major cause of  infectious mononucleosis. EBV has been reported to increase risk of multiple sclerosis. EBV is associated with certain cancers and autoimmune diseases and EBV associated with a higher risk of long COVID.  
CMV associated will be the leading cause of birth defects. CMV is a major driver of immune dysfunction with aging, CMV associated with cardiovascular diseases, CMV associated with cancer and cognitive impairments.  
For now, our focus is CMV, EBV and HIV, but we are developing in a labs vaccine against over latent viruses which short human health. Our goal is to eliminate these viruses. 
As we discussed earlier, several cancer and real genetic programs are in the clinic and will provide clinical results soon. 
On November 15, AZ will present Phase II data in patients from the VEGF program at the American Health Association. And we are pleased to announce the new modality inhaled pulmonary therapeutics. 
Modernizing is our effort to expand the use of our platform to create more innovative drugs to help patients. Our strategy to invest internally under the leadership of Dr. [indiscernible] dedicated team and to set up licenses agreements with next-generation in gene editing companies. The Metagenomi partnership is a first step in that direction. 
The strategic part of the company is very clear and exciting. We want to stop people getting hospitalized from respiratory infection. We wont stop until this goal is achieved. 
We want to stop fellow human beings from suffering from these latent viruses. We want to bring to market mRNA therapeutics in oncology, cardiology, rare genetic disease, autoimmune. We want to bring therapeutics using gene-editing enzymes. We believe Moderna could become the most impactful drug company in the world. 
As we scale, we realized that we needed to go further in setting the right framework for our team to understand what made Moderna. So we work through Q2 and Q3 to articulate our mindset, how we behave and make decisions at Moderna. There is more information on our website, and we'll be happy to spend time with those of you who learn more about them. 
Let me just summarize them at a high level. At Moderna, we act with urgency. Action today compounds the life saves tomorrow. We pursue options in parallel to make the best choice later. We accept risk as the only path to impact. We're obsessed over learning. We don't have to be the smartest. We have to run the fastest. We pivot fearlessly in the pace of new data. We question convention because proven models don't always fuel the future. We push pass possible. We behave like owners, the solutions we are building go beyond any job description. We act with dynamic range, driving strategy and execution at the same time and at every step of the way. 
We will move this strategy to encourage collective action. We prioritize our platform over any single product. We digitalize everything possible using the power of digital information to maximize our impact on patients. 
We want to be the most impactful drug company in the world, we care deeply about doing it the right way. It means being a great company to work for, as exemplified by our seventh consecutive year ranked as the best company to work for by science. But it also means building a company that is responsible in minimizing our impact on the planet. We are proud to have announced earlier this week that we will work to achieve net 0 carbon emission for operations globally by 2030. 
I want to thank the Moderna team for their commitment to our mission, and their relentless work to build the best Moderna over the next 20 years. 
Before we jump into Q&A, we wanted to share the dates of our annual investor event for 2022. Vaccine Day on March 24; Science Day on May 17; and R&D Day on September 8. 
Operator, we're now happy to take any questions."

Yes, we really believe we can fix those short-term supply issues. As I tried to explain in my remarks, those are what I would qualify as  teething problems of scaling up so fast. In Q1, it was all about making enough drug substance, and we are literally not waiting to have enough drug substance to fill vials. And the teams scaled very nicely. 
In Q2, the challenging we had internally was all about filling vials. And the complexity of Q3 has really moved to the, I would say, the back end of the supply chain, which is releasing product and shipping products. 
And the complexity has been around just a number of markets we have to serve. Beginning of the year, it was mostly shipping to CDC in the U.S. and Europe, and that was it. But then as we increased the number of countries to many dozens by now, the complexity is just increasing and it's even further now that we are serving COVAX, we need to go country by country. 
So that's just the type of teething problems that we are experiencing right now. We have increased personnel. We have invested in digital to help the teams. So I already expect this to be resolved like we resolved the drug substance challenges in Q1 and the drug product challenges in Q2. 
The 2022 -- in terms of drug substance, yes, we could see make up to 3 billion doses in terms of material. As you know, that number was really depending on the booster dose. And now that we're on the other side of that decision with the 50-microgram dose, we confirmed we could make up to 3 billion doses, if there was a need for it. 
The challenge in 2022 is going to really be around product form because as the market moves to an endemic market, you're going to need basically vials to be able to go to less number of dose per vile. Again, in the pandemic setting, as you know, we launched with 10 dose per vial, which we think was really an update in low-income countries, we even add more into vials now. 
But as we think about the endemic market, and we're trying to serve pandemic and endemic at the same time, we just need to keep adding presentation to be relevant to health care workers and health care systems around the world. 
So drug substance will not be an issue. There's, of course, as I described, potential upside to those numbers. We still have quite a number of APAs being discussed with countries around the world. We don't know what will happen in terms of epidemiology. Is there a new variant coming? Is it a variant where the current vaccines is still helpful or we need, as Stephen described, a new booster. There is, of course, a big question mark here that we'll follow in epidemiology literally on a daily basis. 
And then there's so many for boosting people around the world that have had non-mRNA vaccines. As everybody knows, there is a prime of waning immunity over time. So time is not offering as people see the levels antibody going down. And as we have new variants like Delta or potentially others, but we should not forget that most people around the planet have not had an mRNA vaccine injected in their body to date. 
And so we believe there is an important need to boost people with mRNA vaccines. And as Paul showed the real world evidence securing the data from CDC and Switzerland. The more we get data and the more time is helping to see -- we see a net differentiation between products. And this doesn't go unnoticed by governments around the world, who are working really hard to preventing hospitalization and death. 
And so there is upside to that. Again, it's a very unpredictable environment. None of us has worked for pandemic before thankfully. But you will be assured that we will keep scaling up manufacturing, we keep in getting with government so that we can maximize how we can help people and the revenue should follow from that."

And then secondly, on flu, can you just comment on how you're going to interpret these results? Obviously, we're just going to get titer results.

And what level of titers would demonstrate very high efficacy?"

I'll take -- try and take those questions. So first, look, I think it's most important to say that what we communicated and desired to be maximally transparent last week was that the FDA, unlike other regulators,",803,"Thank you, Matthew. So this is Stephen. I'll take -- try and take those questions. 
So first, look, I think it's most important to say that what we communicated and desired to be maximally transparent last week was that the FDA, unlike other regulators, has asked for some more time to review emerging recent data. And that might take until January. 
I think your question is how is that different vis-a-vis what happened with the Pfizer vaccine. I think the most important thing to recognize is that the Pfizer adolescent vaccine was authorized prior to any substantial discussion about myocarditis as a benefit or as a risk. In fact, the signal emerged a few weeks later just before we made our filing. And I think a prudent approach there was to -- the Vertex conducted, there was ongoing discussions. 
But what we've continued to see over the course of -- over the last 4 or 5 months is that for both mRNA vaccines, there's a question of whether there's an increased rate of myocarditis above background in 18 to 24-year-old males, a relatively small population, but an important ones. 
And I think it's -- in the face of those continuing emerging questions, that the FDA is being diligent and appropriately conservative in their approach and making sure they have the time to review those. And they have continued to come out over time. 
And so I think, principally, what we're seeing here is -- the difference is a function of timing, which is that the other vaccine had been authorized prior to this concern, and there has been continued emerging data around that. 
We are very grateful to the FDA for that diligence. I would note that the same information are available to other regulators. And as I have said before, we are authorized for that population internationally. And fortunately, as Paul characterized, we have not seen an increased rate of myocarditis in 12 to 17 years. And we think, over time, the substantial benefits of our vaccine will ultimately win out here. And so we look forward to continuing to work with the FDA. So that's my best version of what I think we heard from them last week. 
The question about how we see that evolving over time. Obviously, internationally, we are participating in the market. In the United States, adolescent vaccinations have substantially tailed off, as we all would note. And so the extent that there is an ongoing need in the United States for vaccination, it is a diminishing market for sure. And again, this is a primary series vaccine. And so we do hope that most people in the world will 0 convert and not need a primary series moving forward. 
The question then of what is that endemic market going forward that is the greatest import. And I tried to summarize that in our view of the evolution of this virus and what that need will be. It is, we believe, in the future, a booster market. And to booster market, targeted at those populations that are higher risk of respiratory disease. Those populations tend to be older adults and immune compromised. Places where we think mRNA-1273 is demonstrating really remarkable efficacy differentiated perhaps. But public data -- publicly-reported data is really encouraging on that dimension. 
And I would note that it's not a population that's associated to date with any of the vaccines that have an increased rate of myocarditis. 
And so the benefit risk there, we think, even swings more favorably to 1273, but we'll allow data to continue to develop and ultimately drive this behavior. 
So we are quite encouraged by the performance of the vaccine in the population that we think is going to be most important in the years ahead. 
The last question was on flu, which is what do we think about that data? Obviously, as you pointed to, there are correlates of protection that have been used previously with HAI titers in influenza vaccine. We will be looking at that as I'm sure everybody will as well as other responses in the immune system as we continue to try and identify the optimal dose. I'm not going to put out there a view of what I think our view of success will look like. I would just say that we have very high expectations for our platform. 
Now we do believe that our performance in older adults, including with the COVID vaccine, but also more recently with the RSV booster study in Phase I demonstrates that our platform does incredibly well in those at highest risk of these respiratory viral diseases. And so we're optimistic that we will continue to show strong performance, hopefully, strongest performance in those populations. But I won't give you a specific titer or number today."

So first, I think we're very excited about the programs that are already in the clinical space, either already dosing patients or about to start. And so I think the most important thing is looking forward to next year, the demonstration, we would hope, of proof of concept in that rare disease modality. 
As you know, we are dosing quite a large number of folks in propionic acidemia, and we've been dosing in methylmalonic acidemia with the opening of the ; GSD1a IND, we'd hope to be following a short order there. 
So all 3 of those are potentials for us to demonstrate the real proof that this technology can be used to correct in more errors of metabolism in these populations. I'll also note that there's a quite a wide range of disease going down as young as 2 years of age in some of the organic acidemias and not the older adults in some of the GSD1a program. So we're going to be demonstrating quite a lot there. 
Crigler Najjar presents another opportunity for that proof-of-concept as well as the PKU program when that moves forward, but those are still in preclinical, as I said. 
So the question is what do we do on the back of that proof-of-concept from any one or all of those programs. What you've seen us do in respiratory vaccines and in vaccines generally is probably the best predictor of how we will respond, which is, as you know, there are a very, very large number of metabolic diseases that could be addressed to deliver through mRNA therapy. We have -- we could list off large groups, but [indiscernible] disorders, other organic acidemias, so many beyond that. And even in moving into more broadly present metabolic diseases. So what we would do is we would define that systemic intracellular therapeutic modality as a core modality, just like we did with vaccines a couple of years ago. And that would cause us to dramatically expand that pipeline. 
Now I can assure you we're looking at those programs in research right now, but we will -- we have held back on moving them into preclinical development and putting them on our pipeline until we've seen the modalities perform. 
So that is probably the most important thing for me, looking at the rare and orphan disease space over the course of the coming year is when do we cross that threshold? And then ultimately, when do we expand dramatically that pipeline of programs."

I'm just trying to understand how much our commitments versus acceptances and how to think about those 2.

So I think you already highlighted some of the other drivers. 
So on '21, so there's 2 things I think that is driving, first is, of course the lower volume. And the second one is price. As you know, we are working very hard with several governments to send products that they have bought for high-income countries like the U.S. to low-income country this side of Christmas. 
And so when you think about just the U.S., the U.S., we see that publicly. When we announced our African Union partnership, the U.S. decided to delay to Q2, the delivery over December quarter. That volume is going to African Union at a low tier price. So do you have an impact on the turnover just by doing the math of a lower price on the same volume right there. 
And some orders that are moving from December to January on the supply volume side of things. So when you're on to 22, where you have the increase of volume moved from December to January. That is one. We've signed new APAs since the last numbers. And as I said, some options have been exercised. One of them was a COVAX option. That was exercised at the end of Q3. That is now counted as a full APA because of the firm commitment and some prepayments and so on. And so those are the dynamics that are happening. 
The team also is starting to spend a lot of time to commercial team on focusing on the fall of '22 because we think that's going to be an important moment. The mix and match, we think, is critical. That is now allowed in most places. In some countries, that isn't just mix and match for a long time. But the U.S. market, of course, is important, is allowing mix and match. 
And as Paul just shared, we believe that as time will go, the data will show that what we believe is that we have a longer duration efficacy vaccine on the market. 
And today, if you look at data and market research, very few consumer in the U.S. know that. People that are listening to this call know that because you read papers in on a daily basis, a few people in the U.S. We believe there is an opportunity for us between now and let's say next summer to make sure that people understand the facts, understand the real-world evidence so that they can make an informed decision and that includes the health care workers, the pharmacies, the doctors, the nurses that include the consumers directly. 
And so this is why, as we're starting to sharpen our pencils and probably spend a lot of time working towards the fall of '22, we believe that's another -- that was not if you go back to our previous numbers. We only disclose APAs and options of APAs, the commercial opportunities for a '22, we think is going to be an important vector to the '22 sales. Stephen, answer?"

As soon as we have the data, we will provide our thorough interpretation of it. 
However, as you point out, generally seroconversion is defined as a fourfold rise in titers above baseline, and we've done that in some of our other studies. And we will be looking at that from the percentage of people who achieve that seroconversion. 
And most important to me, we'll be looking at the consistency of that percentage across ages. In particular, the older adults where you often don't achieve the type of the same level of immunogenicity, but we believe with our platform well. There are other endpoints as well in terms of seroprotection defined as absolute titers, again greater than 40 is accepted. We will look how high that goes because that can also be reassuring. But I don't think right now we're ready to guide on a specific target that we will declare success other than looking again at that fourfold rise for measuring seroconversion across the range of agents that we'll be studying in the study."

So I think in terms of -- you referenced some of the more recent communications that happened from public health officials, for instance, in the Nordics and elsewhere, I would note that those same communications literally often the same documents and include reference to the fact that there's very strong efficacy for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. 
And in fact, some of those Nordic country communications include reference to the fact that it looks to be potentially greater in terms of protection as emphasis for why the vaccine not only is still recommended in many of those jurisdictions, but ultimately, provide very favorable benefit risk. 
And so we continue to believe that whole picture looking at the benefit and quantifying that benefit, which we think is substantial and larger than any risks contemplated here is really important. And we, again, look to those communications that clearly state that. Paul, anything you would add to that?"

But as we look forward to next year and we start thinking about boosting and particularly, the seasonal market are protecting those at our highest risk, I think that calculus obviously changes pretty dramatically. 
And so I think we are in a period of time where we are, again, looking at the lowest risk populations. And I think that is transient period time ultimately because it is high risk populations that are of greatest concern looking forward from 2022."

And those health ministers were they care about going back to the risk profile that Stephen just mentioned, take care of about having the winter where they don't have hospitals exploding again. And this is driven by the 50 and above, the 40 and above, where they know the vaccine, as Paul mentioned, with the data from the U.S. or Switzerland or many other countries that 1273 vaccine seems to be a vaccine providing the longest protection of efficacy, and that's what they care about. 
And so I think that people are getting educated and looking at the data. They're just trying to look at the facts and figure out in a very practical way, how they keep the economies running, how they keep people out of our hospitals and very focused on the high population. 
As in many countries, the boosters are not approved in the younger population, whereas they are being really advertised and promoted in the older population so that people get boosted and don't get sick and hospitalized this winter.

And then my second question is, given your comments on the call about potentially moving into the endemic phase by the second half of next year. Should we think about 2022 revenue as being weighted towards the first half of the year?"

When we say 17 billion of APAs, those are firm orders -- signed orders and all our APAs have upfront payments. David did a nice job walking you through the cash upfront we are receiving for those contracts. It's one of the way that we are conducting our business. We want people to be very committed and to have a material upfront of the total value of the deal when they signed. 
The options components that we characterize is up to 3 billion as of today. Those are true options, meaning people are reserving capacity. And sometimes it's for financing rhythm because, again, as I said, we do not do APAs without upfront. 
And one of the best examples today probably is COVAX. We had to do a quarterly option with COVAX. As I said, it just exercised our Q2 option at the end of Q3. But Q3 2022 and Q4 2022 COVAX still options and it's mostly because of the funding issue. They don't have the cash. They get cash from their different funders, which are mostly government and foundation on the kind of a month-to-month basis. And so we did that to help COVAX and to do the right thing to help the planet. As you know, we don't have to do options. We say, if you want the vaccine when you sign a contract and you pay an upfront. But with COVAX, we have to do so. We thought it was the right thing to do. And so we expect, if they want their Q3 volume, that in Q1, they will exercise the options -- sorry end of Q4, they will exercise the options. 
On the endemic and the ventilation of the sales over the year, I think it will be dangerous to assume at this stage one way or other in terms of first half and second half because of volume and also pricing. 
As you get a sense, the COVAX, the African Union and some BARDA deals we have are lower prices and David mentioned that, fewer pricing. And so there might be a large volume, but probably way lower than what the commercial market could drive, which we believe is going to be above what has been the pandemic price again because of volume. And so we are so people stocking ahead of when they need to inject in pharmacies. I would be cautioned that assuming Q1 to be lower and Q2 is a bit too early."

So what we're going to be looking at in the combinations are actually the things that you just pointed to.

So what we're going to be looking at in the combinations are actually the things that you just pointed to. And so in particular, we do believe the most of the value of respiratory vaccination in the near term boosting will be in older adults, 50-plus or 60-plus depending upon how you want to look at it, very similar to the RSV population, certainly for the flu population and recommendations globally. And we think COVID moves that direction as well. 
And so as we look to the first part of the question, where do we intend to optimize that ratio in immunogenicity. It really is towards those higher risk populations that do need, we think, a respiratory booster every year. When it comes to looking at the -- what are the combination of things that we're going to be doing in selecting that ratio in dose, obviously, it's mostly going to be immunogenicity and the tolerability profile. Fortunately, these vaccines have been very safe to date in these older adult populations. None of the concerns that we're having about myocarditis really exists in the 50 plus, 60 plus populations. 
And so we feel very confident on the overall safety profile. But the question will be, where are we in optimizing the immunogenicity against endpoints that are pretty well validated now in COVID, and where are we against the immunogenicity against endpoints that are also broadly accepted in influenza. 
We will be doing this for a range of different -- it's a 4-strain, seasonal strain vaccine. And so  we want to make sure there's no interference between those and that we're able to achieve strong balance immunity across the 4 flu strains plus the COVID vaccine. 
I think we have approximate targets based on the immunogenicity we saw from Phase III and the immunogenicity we're seeing in the booster studies. But the open question is are we going to need all of that for the COVID portion of our vaccine going forward. 
And so we'll continue to follow over time whether we see more durable protection and therefore, you might be able to optimize further that dose, if there was a reason to do so. And then the second part is with the seasonal annual flu component. We just want to understand, particularly in the older adult population where flu vaccines have had less clear efficacy every season, is maybe the way of say it. And there is an opportunity for improvement by raising those titers. We're going to want to look to whether or not we need to get those titers above what have been achieved by others. And I'll note that there's a precedent even for high-dose flu vaccines in that market that have been differentiated on price and grabbing market share. 
And so it could cause us to look in that 60-plus or 50-plus population at really indexing more to those flu antigens and making sure that we exceed or at least achieve that similar high degree of seroconversion there. 
So those are the factors that we'll look at around the 1073 program that we've announced. We're looking at a range of ratios. 
Fortunately, we're going to have experience -- we already have experience in flu and COVID from our prior work, and it will be a demonstration we hope, of the ability to combine vaccines. 
I will note as a final comment, we have done combination respiratory vaccines in the past, including in adults with the 1653 program. And so we do have a basis we're beginning to think about how we might combine those antigens going forward. 
But ultimately, we'll let the 1073 study and the early clinical experiences there be confirmatory around this."

So we're -- the answer from our target perspective is as fast as we can because we ultimately think there's just such a huge unmet need here, and we're excited to get the study going. There are some caveats that I should put around that, which is it probably won't be as fast as we did in COVID, which was obviously in a couple of months, because we are targeting a population at high risk of disease. And in this case, we're looking for women of child-bearing age who are exposed to seroconversion of COVID-19 -- with CMV. And that is often those that are exposed to children because that's the primary vector for those infections. And so we want to make sure that we get the right population. And that matters because this is a case-driven study. As we're kind of familiar with based on COVID-19, the number of cases we achieve that will ultimately dictate those interim analyses that we're looking for in the time ahead. 
And so it makes sense to try and enrich for the at-risk population. So you might see a slower enrollment curve or it might go really fast. We're going to work as hard as we can go very fast. But the most important thing is that we need to be enrolling those that are at highest risk because we think that will ultimately generate the cases that accelerates the interim readout. We won't -- because it is an interim readout that's driven on the cases, I can't predict when that will happen. What I can do is I can try and enrich for those cases in the way I just described."

Secondarily, I have a few small piggy back question on the numbers. You -- on Slide 15, the $6.7 billion in deposits, that was all for APAs for '21 or '22? Or does some of that applied to APAs for delivery -- for contracts for 2023. 
Thirdly, your CapEx guidance a little lower than it was last Q. Is that $50 million to $150 million that you took out of that is that absolute savings? Or is that just going to get pushed into next year as some of the contract revenues were?
And then finally, a little more substantive of the question. How much perspective can you give us on you're able to potentially compete for share on contracting in EU, the competitor Pfizer/BioNTech locked in pretty large contracts on volume for the next 2 years?

So on Q4, we already actually picked COVAX products. And the African Union will be in December, as we communicated in the press release. And it's going to be a big ramp into next year, obviously. In terms of European share, which was one of your questions. So if you look at it, there's a few things. 
First, in Europe, if you remember, we had a late and slow launch in Europe because we had no manufacturing capacity in Europe. If you recall, when we have had the pandemic, we had Norwood that we converted, and we were not allowed to export or serve the U.S. market. So Lonza came online a bit later in Norwood because we have [indiscernible] some time in the summer to just get machines and get the facility ready. 
And so indeed, in Europe, we have a lesser share than we have in the U.S., except for example, for Switzerland like you saw earlier. 
And so as the country gets more and more of an understanding first that mRNA vaccines are superior. The other vaccines that other than mRNA, I'm not sure, used anymore as my understanding, they're mostly given through COVAX. 
I think we have an interesting opportunity because as I shared, as you take -- you talk to health care leaders, health minister, as you get more and more data that Paul shared, we have a better and better understanding that the 2 mRNA vaccines are not the same. 
And so again, as we look into 2022, we already have a contract with Europe in '22. And we are discussing also with country by country on the data and using the benefit of the Moderna vaccine versus the other one. 
And then the other question is going to stay in Europe, which is today, contracts are done at the European level because this was organized and agreed by Europe because of the pandemic. 
The big question that's going to be out there is when do countries start to be buying by themselves because they have to make guesses of supply when they set up '21 and '22 agreements that might not meet the needs that they have, as we understand that they have a different profiles of a vaccine. 
And so I think it's going to be quite interesting to see the share opportunity that we have in Europe. Also as we build our teams, you remember, we had no infrastructure in Europe, 0, not 1 Moderna employee in commercial. We have now teams in several countries in Europe, in the U.K., in Spain, New France, in Germany, building the Italian team as we speak. So I think that also helped because we get feet on the ground to be able to get the message that -- of the real world evidence data. David, do you want to take the capital financial questions."
