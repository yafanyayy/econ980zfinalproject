Altria delivered outstanding results in 2020 and manage through the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our tobacco businesses were resilient, and our employees demonstrated unwavering commitment to their work, colleagues and communities. Our employees continue to move Altria forward, and we believe we're making steady progress toward our 10-year vision to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a noncombustible future.
We continue to execute against the strategies we previously shared, including maximizing profits in our combustible businesses, responsibly expanding our noncombustible products, and demonstrating science-based leadership in the external environment. We remain active in our communities, supporting relief efforts for the pandemic and the West Coast wildfires. We're committed to driving positive change and addressing racial and economic inequities.
Change starts from within, and our employees are leading our efforts to build a more diverse inclusive and equitable organization. Our 11 employee resource groups are helping promote cultural awareness and diversity in our workplace and within our communities. Two of these organizations, Mosaic and C, were recently recognized for their contributions by the national LGBT Chamber of Commerce and by the Virginia Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, respectively.
We also acknowledge the importance of addressing environmental challenges, and we've established ambitious goals for 2030. Last month, we were among the 1% of companies awarded a AA rating from CDP for climate and water stewardship. We're proud of these efforts, and I look forward to sharing more details about our ESG initiatives next month at CAGNY.
2020 was a dynamic year in the tobacco industry, with notable changes in each category. Tobacco consumers continue to adopt noncombustible alternatives to cigarettes. Most significantly in the oral tobacco space, with rapid growth in oral nicotine pouches off of a small base and a return to moderate volume growth in moist smokeless tobacco.
The heated tobacco category also showed encouraging signs of smoker interest, though it remains in its early stages. The e-vapor category, however, which has been the biggest driver of smoker conversion over the last several years, contracted in 2020, as it continues to undergo a transition period, pending FDA market determinations. And in combustibles, cigarette volumes were little changed from 2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic alter smoker behaviors and purchasing patterns.
Looking at the tobacco space in total, estimated equivalize volumes remained stable. In fact, over the last 5 years, we estimate that total tobacco volumes have only decreased by 1% and on a compounded annual basis. While 2020 represented a pause in some industry trends away from combustible products, our plans to achieve our 10-year vision remains centered around building a deep understanding of evolving tobacco consumer preferences, meeting these preferences by expanding the awareness and availability of our noncombustible product portfolio. And when authorized by the FDA, engaging with smokers to educate them, on the benefits of switching to alternative products.
Let's now turn to our 2020 business results. Altria's full year adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 3.6%, driven by strong performance from our tobacco businesses. We also returned nearly $6.3 billion in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. And our Board increased the dividend for the 55th time in the past 51 years.
Our Smokable Products segment continues to be the engine that powers our 10-year vision. Generating significant cash that can be invested in noncombustible products and return to shareholders. This segment has demonstrated strong profit growth and a variety of marketplace conditions. Over the last 5 years, smokeable segment adjusted OCI has grown by 5.5% on a compounded annual basis and the segment has delivered excellent financial performance across varied volume and market share dynamics. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our combustible businesses, and Sal will provide more details on this segment in his remarks.
Moving to our noncombustible offerings. We're pleased with the continued strength of USSTC's most smokeless tobacco business and the encouraging results from our other noncombustible products. We believe our products and investments with the oral tobacco, e-vapor and heated tobacco categories present compelling options for the millions of U.S. smokers looking for alternatives to cigarettes.
In oral tobacco, we believe we have an unmatched portfolio of MST and all nicotine pouch products. Copenhagen remains the leading oral tobacco brand and delivered strong volume and profit performance for the year. We're also excited about the potential for on!, and believe it's a satisfying product for both smokers and dippers. Helix made significant progress in its first full year of operations. Over the last 12 months, our talented regulatory affairs team assist the Helix and falling PMTAs for the on! portfolio, which we believe demonstrate that the products are appropriate for the protection of public health. Our highly skilled engineers and machine operators supported Helix in establishing a manufacturing footprint for on! in our Richmond facility, and Helix has reached annualized capacity for on! of 50 million cans.
The team continues to install machinery and Helix expects unconstrained manufacturing capacity for the U.S. market by midyear 2021. And the Helix brand management and AGDC sales teams collaborated to steadily increase the retail distribution of on! during the year and executed innovative trial generating promotions that demonstrated the ability for on! to gain traction with smokers and dippers.
On! was sold in approximately 78,000 stores at the end of 2020, up nearly 40% from the third quarter and more than 5x the store count from the end of 2019. In stores with distribution, on! achieved a retail share of 2.4 percentage points of the oral tobacco category in 2020, with significant growth coming into the second half of the year.
Helix has strong plans for the year ahead and is focused on removing capacity constraints, reaching its retail distribution targets, building brand equity and converting smokers. We're confident in the on! proposition, and believe it's satisfying range of nicotine strengths and flavors and unique packaging position it well for success in the rapidly growing nicotine pouch space.
Moving to e-vapor. We estimate that total category volumes decreased by 10% for the full year. The category continues to undergo a transition period as FDA prepares to make market determinations on the thousands of PMTAs filed by the September 2020 statutory deadline. We continue to believe that e-vapor products can play an important role in tobacco harm reduction, and that sustainable e-vapor category will be 1 that consists solely of FDA authorized products. We believe the category's long-term trajectory will be determined by regulatory decisions, legislative and tax policy and innovation that best addresses smoker and vapor preferences.
In the heated tobacco category, PM USA continues to expand IQOS and Marlboro HeatSticks responsibly and in a disciplined manner. PM USA's 2020 accomplishments included: Launching in Charlotte with a more disruptive retail fixture; expanding the retail distribution of HeatSticks to approximately 1,000 total stores; introducing devices into select Charlotte convenience stores; developing an array of new digital tools, including mobile video chat capability, which gives PM USA's customer care experts, a virtual option to build connections and support age-verified smokers through their conversion journey. Or communicating with smokers using the FDA authorized reduced exposure claim about the benefits of switching from cigarettes.
We're excited that the FDA has authorized the IQOS 3 device for sale in the U.S. The new device offers several enhancements compared to the current 2.4 version, including a longer battery life and a faster recharging time. PM USA expects to begin selling the new device shortly and it will be available across all existing retail channels in the Atlanta, Charlotte and Richmond markets. PM USA also recently introduced new packaging for HeatSticks and has renamed the 3 currently authorized heatstick SKUs as Amber, Blue menthol and Green menthol. The new packs feature a cleaner look and PM USA believes the naming convention will facilitate heatstick line extensions in the future should additional variants be authorized by the FDA.
PM USA is focused on expanding the availability and awareness of IQOS. Achieving its contractual performance requirements and remains on track with its 2021 plans to expand IQOS and heatsticks into 4 new metro markets and surrounding geographies. We believe that PM USA has the right approach to maximize its store mover advantage while we're responsibly positioning the U.S. heated tobacco category for long-term growth and profitability.
Let's now turn to our financial outlook for 2021. Our plans for the year ahead include accelerating investments in support of our 10-year vision, which we expect to fund through the financial strength of our tobacco businesses. The external environment remains dynamic, however, and we're monitoring various factors, including unemployment rates, fiscal stimulus, tobacco consumer dynamics, including stay-at-home practices, disposable income, purchasing patterns and adoption of noncombustible products, regulatory and legislative developments, the timing and breadth of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and expectations for adjusted earnings contributions from our alcohol assets.
Taking these factors into consideration, we expect to deliver 2021 full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $4.49 to $4.62. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. Our 2021 guidance incorporates planned investments to drive smoker conversion to noncombustible products, including continued marketplace investments to expand the availability and awareness of our noncombustible offerings, building an industry-leading consumer engagement system that enhances data collection and insights in support of conversion, and increased noncombustible product research and development.
We expect our 2021 adjusted EPS growth to come in the last 3 quarters of the year, primarily due to prior year comparisons, which includes 1 fewer smokable products shipping day in the first quarter.
Altria's tobacco businesses delivered excellent results over the past year, and I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work. Their dedication drives their strong performance, and it's their passion and commitment that makes me excited for Altria's future.
I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our financial performance."
296308,701184726,2184255,"Altria Group, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Billy. Let me begin by providing an update on U.S. tobacco consumers. Economic conditions remain challenging for consumers in the fourth quarter as unemployment rates remain high and the enhanced benefits from the original pandemic assistance pack",1102,"Thanks, Billy. Let me begin by providing an update on U.S. tobacco consumers. Economic conditions remain challenging for consumers in the fourth quarter as unemployment rates remain high and the enhanced benefits from the original pandemic assistance package were fully exhausted. However, we believe consumers continue their stay-at-home practices in the fourth quarter, contributing to more to apple usage occasions and higher tobacco discretionary spending.
At retail, we estimate that the fourth quarter, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store was slightly lower than prior levels. But tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated versus the year ago period.
Turning now to our businesses. The Smokable Products segment delivered excellent financial and marketplace results in 2020. The segment grew full year adjusted OCI by over 10%, and expanded its adjusted OCI margins by almost 2 percentage points. The Smokeable segment also achieved robust net price realization of 6.7% for the year, with PM USA's revenue growth management framework, continuing to enhance the segment's top line performance.
Smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 0.0 -- I'm sorry, 0.4% in 2020 versus the prior year. When adjusted for trade inventories, calendar differences and other factors, we estimate that full year segment cigarette volumes declined by 2%.
At the industry level, we estimate that full year domestic cigarette volumes were unchanged versus the prior year after adjusting for the same factors.
Looking ahead, we expect 2021 cigarette industry volume trends to be most influenced by smoker stay at home practices, unemployment rates, fiscal stimulus, cross-category movement, the timing and breadth of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and consumer purchasing behavior following the vaccine.
Due to the uncertain timing and magnitude of each of these dynamics, we're not providing a cigarette industry outlook. We believe the degree of cross-category movement will be influenced by several factors, including consumer perceptions of the relative risk of noncombustible products compared to cigarettes, FDA determinations on PMTA filings and legislative actions. We'll continue to monitor these factors and update you on the pandemic driven and underlying smoker behaviors that we observe in the category.
Turning to marketplace performance. Marlboro's fourth quarter retail share was 43.3%, up 2/10 versus the prior year and unchanged sequentially. Marlboro continued to benefit in the fourth quarter from smoker preferences toward familiar products during disruptive times and continued lower promotional spending among competitive brands versus the first half of 2020.
For the full year, Marlboro's retail share declined 3/10 to 43%. Marlboro's full year share performance was impacted by the movement of older consumers coming back into cigarettes from e-vapor, which we observed at the beginning of 2020.
This demographic has a greater tendency to purchase discount cigarettes than the category average, which increased discount segment share to start the year.
We continue to be pleased with Marlboro's performance and believe its leading brand equity positions the brand well to deliver on its long-term profit potential.
In discount, total segment retail share was 24.5% in the fourth quarter, unchanged versus the year ago period and up 2/10 sequentially. For the full year, discount segment retail share increased 3/10 to 24.5%, driven by the cross-category movement observed at the beginning of 2020 and growth in deep discount products.
Moving to cigars. Middleton provided a strong contribution to the smokable segments financial results and continue to successfully navigate the regulatory environment.
Reported cigar shipment volumes increased 9% for the year. And black and mild remain the leading Tip cigar brand. Middleton has also received market orders or exemptions from FDA, covering over 97% of its volume.
Turning to noncombustibles. We're very pleased with the performance of the Oral Tobacco Products segment. Segment adjusted OCI increased 7.3% for the year. And it maintained its strong adjusted OCI margin of 71.7 percentage points despite increased investments behind on!. Reported oral tobacco segment volumes increased by 1.2% in 2020, driven by on! oral nicotine pouches. In MST, Copenhagen reported shipment volumes were unchanged versus the prior year.
When adjusted for calendar differences, trade inventory movements and other factors, full year oral tobacco segment volumes increased by an estimated 1%. Full year 2020 retail share for the oral tobacco segment was 49.8%, down 2.7 percentage points due to the increased adoption of oral nicotine pouches. We remain pleased with the performance of Copenhagen in the MSC category, and we're excited about the growth potential of on! as we continue to expand capacity and distribution.
In alcohol, the pandemic negatively impacted the 2020 financial performance of both Ste. Michelle and our equity investment in ABI. Ste. Michelle's full year adjusted OCI decreased approximately 30%, driven primarily by lower on-premise and direct-to-consumer sales, partially offset by higher pricing.
And in beer, we recorded $157 million of adjusted equity earnings in the fourth quarter, representing Altria's share of ABI's third quarter 2020 results, and a decrease of more than 19% from the same period last year.
For the full year, we've recorded $540 million in adjusted equity earnings from ABI, down over 36% from 2019. In our all other operating category, we recorded $172 million in adjusted losses for the year. More than half of which related to noncash reductions and the estimated residual value of certain assets at Philip Morris Capital Corporation. As of year-end 2020, the net finance assets balance for PMCC was $320 million. We expect to continue reducing this balance in 2021 through rent and asset sales and fully -- and expect to fully complete the PMCC wind down by the end of 2022.
Moving to capital allocation. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our tobacco businesses are highly cash generative. Dividends remain our primary vehicle for returning cash to shareholders. And our long-term objective is a dividend target payout ratio of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted earnings per share. We believe our dividend target payout ratio provide significant shareholder return while allowing for flexibility in our capital allocation. We perform rigorous analysis to determine the best use of excess cash. Including evaluating options for reinvesting behind our 10-year vision, refinancing our long-term debt and repurchasing shares. Yesterday, our Board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by June 30, 2022. The new authorization reflects the significant value the Board believes exists in our shares today.
With that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items.

What really drove that? I mean, you spoke in your prepared comments about well recognized brands, but I'm just trying to get underneath that there's other drivers like price gap management or the Marlboro Rewards program and how that played a role in terms of kind of shifting the share trajectory because it's been losing share for a number of quarters now."

On the excise tax front, I would remind you that we had 2 state tax increases happened at the beginning of this year.

On the excise tax front, I would remind you that we had 2 state tax increases happened at the beginning of this year. Certainly with the build that the states have racked up responding to COVID, certainly, it'd be a little bit more challenging excise tax environment. We have a great government affairs team, as you know, Nik, and they engage on both sides of the aisle across the states and really know how to engage on that.
From that standpoint, though, I think right now, most governments are focused on how to get the COVID-19 pandemic under control. And so there's a little bit of chatter across the states. But nothing to point out at this point. But certainly, it will be a challenging environment as they look to pay the bills related to their response to COVID-19.
On Marlboro, Nik, I think what you saw was -- and Sal highlighted in his comments, people were concerned at the beginning of the year. We tried to highlight for the analyst and investor community that what we saw was consumers moving back from e-vapor back into cigarettes in both premium brands and discount brands benefited from it, but because it tended to skew older adult smoker coming back, we know that they have a proclivity towards discount brands. We didn't panic when that was taking place. We knew what -- we felt like we knew what was behind that. And I think you've just seen the strength of the mobile brand through time. Certainly, there were some competitive premium brands. That had some extra resources in the marketplace at the beginning of 2020. We saw those lessen as we progress through 2020.
And to your point, the programs we have in place and the Marlboro brand team do an excellent job of engaging with the consumers and really building loyalty through time, whether you mentioned the rewards program, but other programs as well. And I think that's the strength of the mobile brand, and we're excited about where it stands."

I guess I'd be curious to hear, what does your guidance assume in terms of the tax increases that you just touched on? I mean, I'm wondering, Billy, if it does consider a potential federal excise tax increase, maybe at the low end?
And then I guess I'm a bit surprised you were unable to provide even a wide range for your cig volume expectations this year. I certainly understand there's a lot of uncertainty right now in our world. But you must have, I guess, some sense of the range of your SIG volumes, again, given your EPS guidance. So maybe you could touch on that for us a bit, just at a high level, whether or not you expect cig volumes this year will possibly revert back to historical declines, maybe below historical declines given the tough comps and the potential for greater excise tax increases?"

On the EPS guidance, really, when you think about the EPS guidance, and I know you're including kind of the cigarette volume in that, look, we run a range of scenarios around that. We really look at what do we base expectations, we have a very strong forecasting group. They forecast across the various categories. And then we run a range of scenarios around that, upside and downside. And we think about, okay, what do we feel confident about in providing a short range of EPS guidance for the year, and that's where we landed.
As far as cigarette volume, it wasn't the -- that we didn't have a forecast for volume. We feel very good about the way we go about forecasting volume. But to your point, there are a lot of uncertainties and a lot of fluidness in the environment, whether that's the consumer and how they're engaged with some of these noncombustible categories as they continue to grow or to the things we highlighted in our remarks, whether it's unemployment or the fiscal stimulus if the government passes that. So there are a range of factors there. What we think really focusing on the consumer, and that's what we try to do and are trying to do is really give more information about how we're focused on the consumer and want to win where they go. And that's exactly why we implemented the portfolio strategy is really looking at the consumer is going to make different decisions, depending on where they're at in their journey and how do we really focus on the consumer and have the best products and best brands in each of those categories as they make decisions.
Don't get me wrong, this cigarette, as I said in my remarks, really fuels. It's the engine for fueling the 10-year vision. But we think what you should hold us accountable to is our success in meeting the consumer where they're at, regardless of what category they're in."

And I'm asking because, obviously, per your guidance and your comments, you're entering a period near-term here where you're stepping up spend to kind of accelerate this plan. So it would help us to understand maybe some targets, like for you to convert your business to the noncombustible products, as you mentioned, is it fair to assume 20%, 25%, for instance, in the next, I don't know, again, 3, 5 or 5-plus years?
And then as you execute on that vision, are you also open to or considering future M&A to even accelerate this further? Or should we just assume this will all be done organically? And then I do want to hear about how you're incentivizing your employees to execute."

We've shared that 10-year vision that we have and how we expect to progress through time with our employee base. They're passionate about it. They're excited to support that. And we think we have the right incentive program in place to warrant that excitement.
As far as milestones, again, I won't go into a specific numerical value. Remember, from an overall objective, we're looking to balance strong growth -- EPS growth for investors and the associated cash involved with that. But at the same time, making investments over the long-term to advance our noncombustible portfolio. And so what we're really trying to do is have that balance. And so we're certainly going to share with you, through time, how we're making progress, but it's really about the journey of the consumer. So if you think about really driving awareness of the consumer for new categories, incenting trial, ultimately purchase and then at the final stage, conversion to these new categories. That's the way we're thinking about the consumer journey, and we're really investing to get to as close to the consumer as we can because each consumer is going to be at a different point in that journey and make different decisions across the categories. And that's exactly the portfolio approach.
And different actions are taken, whether they're regulatory actions, whether they're consumers really enjoying the category is being able to be agile enough to not starve any category that's growing and make the appropriate investments there. So that's how we're thinking about the consumer journey, and you'll see us share more through time of how we're progressing with those consumer journeys."

So from that standpoint, we're trying many things. Because remember, we launched in densely populated areas. So you have one strategy there. But then as you move from those densely populated areas out, that's exactly why we were testing the device sales in convenience stores to really meet consumers where they are. And as you get to more rural locations, really having an outlet to engage with the consumer.
We actually use all of those measures that you mentioned, whether it's direct mail, whether it's retail stores, the devices in the convenience stores, whether it's corners and various places or whether it's the mobile units. And certainly, in Charlotte, we have used the mobile units to a larger extent because what we found is as you meet a certain capacity, you can actually move those mobile devices -- mobile units from one location to another and really maximize the number of consumers you're engaging with.
Now, certainly, in the COVID world, we had some challenges there because there's a lot of engagement 101 with the consumer, but our team implemented digital tools. We talked about the mobile chat capability that they installed. And so we're excited to continue to expand, and we'll have more to say on that."

Look, we recognize that pricing is an important part of the algorithm. I would remind you that the strategy for the combustible segment, both cigarettes and cigars is to maximize profitability over the long-term while balancing investments in Marlboro and the funding the growth of our noncombustible portfolio. So certainly, profitability in the traditional tobacco space is what we're using to invest in the future in these noncombustible product arena.
And so certainly, we look at that from a standpoint of -- when you look at pricing, a couple of the factors that we think about pricing as we move forward is really, where are our consumers on an economic standpoint. What are they feeling? How do they feel? What are they thinking about it's the strength of our brands, how do we think about our brands and the strength in the consumer's mind? And then certainly, business performance and objectives factor into that.
I think when you look at price realization over the past couple of years, I think it's important to remember that's not all list price. It also has the price efficiencies we've been able to garner from the advanced analytics that we put in place. And so with the amount of data that we get in and the advanced analytics that we've invested in, I think you're seeing the benefit in price realization of being more efficient, but just as an effective, if not more, in the marketplace with the promotional spend that we have.
So it's a combination of both, and we are extremely excited about what our advanced analytics team has been able to accomplish."

The next is the strength of our brands. How do we feel about our brands in the marketplace and in the consumer's mind. And then it is around business performance and objectives.

I think it's important to remember, the underlying trend of prevalence, that trend is pretty steady. It hasn't changed. So it really is extra tobacco usage occasions in their day.

Altria delivered outstanding results in 2020 and managed through the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our tobacco businesses were resilient, and our employees demonstrated unwavering commitment to their work, colleagues and communities. Our employees continue to move Altria forward, and we believe we're making steady progress towards our 10-year vision to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a noncombustible future. 
We continue to execute against the strategies we previously shared, including maximizing profits in our combustible businesses, responsibly expanding our noncombustible products, and demonstrating science-based leadership in the external environment. We remain active in our communities, supporting relief efforts for the pandemic and the West Coast wildfires. We're committed to driving positive change and addressing racial and economic inequities. 
Change starts from within, and our employees are leading our efforts to build a more diverse inclusive and equitable organization. Our 11 employee resource groups are helping promote cultural awareness and diversity in our workplace and within our communities. Two of these organizations, Mosaic and C, were recently recognized for their contributions by the national LGBT Chamber of Commerce and by the Virginia Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, respectively. We also acknowledge the importance of addressing environmental challenges, and we've established ambitious goals for 2030. Last month, we were among the 1% of companies awarded a AA rating from CDP for climate and water stewardship. We're proud of these efforts, and I look forward to sharing more details about our ESG initiatives next month at CAGNY. 
2020 was a dynamic year in the tobacco industry, with notable changes in each category. Tobacco consumers continue to adopt noncombustible alternatives to cigarettes. Most significantly in the oral tobacco space, with rapid growth in oral nicotine pouches off of a small base and a return to moderate volume growth in moist smokeless tobacco. 
The heated tobacco category also showed encouraging signs of smoker interest, though it remains in its early stages. The e-vapor category, however, which has been the biggest driver of smoker conversion over the last several years contracted in 2020 as it continues to undergo a transition period, pending FDA market determinations. And in combustibles, cigarette volumes were a little changed from 2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic alter smoker behaviors and purchasing patterns. 
Looking at the tobacco space in total, estimated equivalized volumes remained stable. In fact, over the last 5 years, we estimate that total tobacco volumes have only decreased by 1% on a compounded annual basis. While 2020 represented a pause in some industry trends away from combustible products, our plans to achieve our 10-year vision remains centered around building a deep understanding of evolving tobacco consumer preferences, meeting these preferences by expanding the awareness and availability of our noncombustible product portfolio and when authorized by the FDA, engaging with smokers to educate them, on the benefits of switching to alternative products. 
Let's now turn to our 2020 business results. Altria's full year adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 3.6%, driven by strong performance from our tobacco businesses. We also returned nearly $6.3 billion in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. And our Board increased the dividend for the 55th time in the past 51 years. 
Our Smokable Product segment continues to be the engine that powers our 10-year vision. Generating significant cash that can be invested in noncombustible products and return to shareholders. This segment has demonstrated strong profit growth in a variety of marketplace conditions. Over the last 5 years, smokeable segment adjusted OCI has grown by 5.5% on a compounded annual basis, and its segment has delivered excellent financial performance across varied volume and market share dynamics. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our combustible businesses, and Sal will provide more details on this segment in his remarks. 
Moving to our noncombustible offerings. We're pleased with the continued strength of USSTC's most smokeless tobacco business and the encouraging results from our other noncombustible products. We believe our products and investments with the oral tobacco, e-vapor and heated tobacco categories present compelling options for the millions of U.S. smokers looking for alternatives to cigarettes. 
In oral tobacco, we believe we have an unmatched portfolio of MST and all nicotine pouch products. Copenhagen remains the leading oral tobacco brand and delivered strong volume and profit performance for the year. We're also excited about the potential for on! and believe it's a satisfying product for both smokers and dippers. 
Helix made significant progress in its first full year of operations. Over the last 12 months, our talented regulatory affairs team assist the Helix and falling PMTAs for the on! portfolio, which we believe demonstrate that the products are appropriate for the protection of public health. Our highly skilled engineers and machine operators supported Helix in establishing a manufacturing footprint for on! in our Richmond facility, and Helix has reached annualized capacity for on! of 50 million cans. 
The team continues to install a machinery, and Helix expects unconstrained manufacturing capacity for the U.S. market by midyear 2021. And the Helix brand management and AGDC sales teams collaborated to steadily increase the retail distribution of on! during the year and executed innovative trial generating promotions that demonstrated the ability for on! to gain traction with smokers and dippers. 
on! was sold in approximately 78,000 stores at the end of 2020, up nearly 40% from the third quarter and more than 5x the store count from the end of 2019. In stores with distribution, on! achieved a retail share of 2.4 percentage points of the oral tobacco category in 2020, with significant growth coming into the second half of the year. 
Helix has strong plans for the year ahead and is focused on removing capacity constraints, reaching its retail distribution targets, building brand equity and converting smokers. We're confident in the on! proposition and believe its satisfying range of nicotine strengths and flavors and unique packaging position it well for success in the rapidly growing nicotine pouch space.
Moving to e-vapor. We estimate that total category volumes decreased by 10% for the full year. The category continues to undergo a transition period as FDA prepares to make market determinations on the thousands of PMTAs filed by the September 2020 statutory deadline. We continue to believe that e-vapor products can play an important role in tobacco harm reduction and that sustainable e-vapor category will be one that consists solely of FDA authorized products. We believe the category's long-term trajectory will be determined by regulatory decisions, legislative and tax policy and innovation that best addresses smoker and vapor preferences. 
In the heated tobacco category, PM USA continues to expand IQOS and Marlboro Heatsticks responsibly and in a disciplined manner. PM USA's 2020 accomplishments included: Launching in Charlotte with a more disruptive retail fixture; expanding the retail distribution of Heatsticks to approximately 1,000 total stores; introducing devices into select Charlotte convenience stores; developing an array of new digital tools, including mobile video chat capability, which gives p.m. USA's customer care experts, a virtual option to build connections and support age-verified smokers through their conversion journey and communicating with smokers using the FDA-authorized reduced exposure claim about the benefits of switching from cigarettes. 
We're excited that the FDA has authorized the IQOS 3 device for sale in the U.S. The new device offers several enhancements compared to the current 2.4 version, including a longer battery life and a faster recharging time. PM USA expects to begin selling the new device shortly and it will be available across all existing retail channels in the Atlanta, Charlotte and Richmond markets. PM USA also recently introduced new packaging for Heatsticks and has renamed the 3 currently authorized heatstick SKUs as Amber, Blue menthol and Green menthol. The new packs feature a cleaner look, and PM USA believes the naming convention will facilitate heatstick line extensions in the future should additional variants be authorized by the FDA. 
PM USA is focused on expanding the availability and awareness of IQOS, achieving its contractual performance requirements and remains on track with its 2021 plans to expand IQOS and heatsticks into 4 new metro markets and surrounding geographies. We believe that P.M. USA has the right approach to maximize its store mover advantage while we're responsibly positioning the U.S. heated tobacco category for long-term growth and profitability. 
Let's now turn to our financial outlook for 2021. Our plans for the year ahead include accelerating investments in support of our 10-year vision, which we expect to fund through the financial strength of our tobacco businesses. The external environment remains dynamic, however, and we're monitoring various factors, including unemployment rates, fiscal stimulus, tobacco consumer dynamics, including stay-at-home practices, disposable income, purchasing patterns and adoption of noncombustible products, regulatory and legislative developments, the timing and breadth of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and expectations for adjusted earnings contributions from our alcohol assets. 
Taking these factors into consideration, we expect to deliver 2021 full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $4.49 to $4.62. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. Our 2021 guidance incorporates planned investments to drive smoker conversion to noncombustible products, including continued marketplace investments to expand the availability and awareness of our noncombustible offerings, building an industry-leading consumer engagement system that enhances data collection and insights in support of conversion and increased noncombustible product research and development. We expect our 2021 adjusted EPS growth to come in the last 3 quarters of the year, primarily due to prior year comparisons, which includes 1 fewer smokable products shipping day in the first quarter. Altria's tobacco businesses delivered excellent results over the past year, and I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work. Their dedication drives their strong performance, and it's their passion and commitment that makes me excited for Altria's future. 
I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our financial performance."
296308,701184726,2184335,"Altria Group, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Billy. Let me begin by providing an update on U.S. tobacco consumers. Economic conditions remain challenging for consumers in the fourth quarter as unemployment rates remain high and the enhanced benefits from the original pandemic assistance pack",1099,"Thanks, Billy. Let me begin by providing an update on U.S. tobacco consumers. Economic conditions remain challenging for consumers in the fourth quarter as unemployment rates remain high and the enhanced benefits from the original pandemic assistance package were fully exhausted. However, we believe consumers continue their stay-at-home practices in the fourth quarter, contributing to more tobacco usage occasions and higher tobacco discretionary spending. 
At retail, we estimate that the fourth quarter, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store was slightly lower than prior levels. But tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated versus the year ago period. 
Turning now to our businesses. The Smokable Products segment delivered excellent financial and marketplace results in 2020. The segment grew full year adjusted OCI by over 10% and expanded its adjusted OCI margins by almost 2 percentage points. The Smokeable segment also achieved robust net price realization of 6.7% for the year, with PM USA's revenue growth management framework continuing to enhance the segment's top line performance. 
Smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 0.0 -- I'm sorry, 0.4% in 2020 versus the prior year. When adjusted for trade inventories, calendar differences and other factors, we estimate that full year segment cigarette volumes declined by 2%. 
At the industry level, we estimate that full year domestic cigarette volumes were unchanged versus the prior year after adjusting for the same factors. 
Looking ahead, we expect 2021 cigarette industry volume trends to be most influenced by smoker stay-at-home practices, unemployment rates, fiscal stimulus, cross-category movement, the timing and breadth of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and consumer purchasing behavior following the vaccine. 
Due to the uncertain timing and magnitude of each of these dynamics, we're not providing a cigarette industry outlook. We believe the degree of cross-category movement will be influenced by several factors, including consumer perceptions of the relative risk of noncombustible products compared to cigarettes, FDA determinations on PMTA filings and legislative actions. We'll continue to monitor these factors and update you on the pandemic driven and underlying smoker behaviors that we observe in the category. 
Turning to marketplace performance. Marlboro's fourth quarter retail share was 43.3%, up 2/10 versus the prior year and unchanged sequentially. Marlboro continued to benefit in the fourth quarter from smoker preferences toward familiar products during disruptive times and continued lower promotional spending among competitive brands versus the first half of 2020.
For the full year, Marlboro's retail share declined 3/10 to 43%. Marlboro's full year share performance was impacted by the movement of older consumers coming back into cigarettes from e-vapor, which we observed at the beginning of 2020.  This demographic has a greater tendency to purchase discount cigarettes than the category average, which increased discount segment share to start the year. We continue to be pleased with Marlboro's performance and believe its leading brand equity positions the brand well to deliver on its long-term profit potential.
In discount, total segment retail share was 24.5% in the fourth quarter, unchanged versus the year ago period and up 2/10 sequentially. For the full year, discount segment retail share increased 3/10 to 24.5%, driven by the cross-category movement observed at the beginning of 2020 and growth in deep discount products.
Moving to cigars, Middleton provided a strong contribution to the smokable segments financial results and continue to successfully navigate the regulatory environment. Reported cigar shipment volumes increased 9% for the year. And Black & Mild remain the leading Tip cigar brand. Middleton has also received market orders or exemptions from FDA, covering over 97% of its volume.
Turning to noncombustibles. We're very pleased with the performance of the Oral Tobacco Products segment. Segment adjusted OCI increased 7.3% for the year. And it maintained its strong adjusted OCI margin of 71.7 percentage points despite increased investments behind on!. Reported oral tobacco segment volumes increased by 1.2% in 2020, driven by on! oral nicotine pouches. In MST, Copenhagen reported shipment volumes were unchanged versus the prior year.
When adjusted for calendar differences, trade inventory movements and other factors, full year oral tobacco segment volumes increased by an estimated 1%. Full year 2020 retail share for the oral tobacco segment was 49.8%, down 2.7 percentage points due to the increased adoption of oral nicotine pouches. We remain pleased with the performance of Copenhagen in the MSC category, and we're excited about the growth potential of on! as we continue to expand capacity and distribution.
In alcohol, the pandemic negatively impacted the 2020 financial performance of both Ste. Michelle and our equity investment in ABI. Ste. Michelle's full year adjusted OCI decreased approximately 30%, driven primarily by lower on-premise and direct-to-consumer sales, partially offset by higher pricing.  And in beer, we recorded $157 million of adjusted equity earnings in the fourth quarter, representing Altria's share of ABI's third quarter 2020 results, and a decrease of more than 19% from the same period last year.
For the full year, we've recorded $540 million in adjusted equity earnings from ABI, down over 36% from 2019. In our all other operating category, we recorded $172 million in adjusted losses for the year, more than half of which related to noncash reductions and the estimated residual value of certain assets at Philip Morris Capital Corporation. As of year-end 2020, the net finance assets balance for PMCC was $320 million. We expect to continue reducing this balance in 2021 through rent and asset sales and fully -- and expect to fully complete the PMCC wind down by the end of 2022.
Moving to capital allocation. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our tobacco businesses are highly cash generative. Dividends remain our primary vehicle for returning cash to shareholders. And our long-term objective is a dividend target payout ratio of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted earnings per share. We believe our dividend target payout ratio provide significant shareholder return while allowing for flexibility in our capital allocation. We perform rigorous analysis to determine the best use of excess cash, including evaluating options for reinvesting behind our 10-year vision, refinancing our long-term debt and repurchasing shares. Yesterday, our Board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by June 30, 2022. The new authorization reflects the significant value the Board believes exists in our shares today.
With that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items.

On the excise tax front, I would remind you that we had 2 state excise tax increases happened at the beginning of this year. Certainly with the build that the states have racked up responding to COVID, certainly it'd be a little bit more challenging excise tax environment. We have a great government affairs team, as you know, Nik, and they engage on both sides of the aisle across the states and really know how to engage on that.
From that standpoint, though, I think right now, most governments are focused on how to get the COVID-19 pandemic under control. And so there's a little bit of chatter across the states. But nothing to point out at this point. But certainly, it will be a challenging environment as they look to pay the bills related to their response to COVID-19.
On Marlboro, Nik, I think what you saw was -- and Sal highlighted in his comments. People were concerned at the beginning of the year. We tried to highlight for the analyst and investor community that what we saw was consumers moving back from e-vapor back into cigarettes and both premium brands and discount brands benefited from it, but because it tended to skew older adult smoker coming back, we know that they have a proclivity towards discount brands. We didn't panic when that was taking place. We knew what -- we felt like we knew what was behind that. And I think you've just seen the strength of the mobile brand through time. Certainly, there were some competitive premium brands that had some extra resources in the marketplace at the beginning of 2020. We saw those lessen as we progress through 2020.
And to your point, the programs we have in place and the Marlboro brand team do an excellent job of engaging with the consumers and really building loyalty through time, whether you mentioned the rewards program but other programs as well. And I think that's the strength of the mobile brand, and we're excited about where it stands."

And then I guess I'm a bit surprised you were unable to provide even a wide range for your cig volume expectations this year. I certainly understand there's a lot of uncertainty right now in our world. But you must have, I guess, some sense of the range of your SIG volumes, again, given your EPS guidance. So maybe you could touch on that for us a bit, just at a high level, whether or not you expect cig volumes this year will possibly revert back to historical declines, maybe below historical declines given the tough comps and the potential for greater excise tax increases?"

On the EPS guidance, really, when you think about the EPS guidance, and I know you're including kind of the cigarette volume in that, look, we run a range of scenarios around that. We really look at what do we -- our base expectations, we have a very strong forecasting group. They forecast across the various categories. And then we run a range of scenarios around that, upside and downside. And we think about, okay, what do we feel confident about in providing a short range of EPS guidance for the year. And that's where we landed.
As far as cigarette volume, it wasn't the -- that we didn't have a forecast for volume. We feel very good about the way we go about forecasting volume. But to your point, there are a lot of uncertainties and a lot of fluidness in the environment, whether that's the consumer and how they're engaged with some of these noncombustible categories as they continue to grow or to the things we've highlighted in our remarks, whether it's unemployment or the fiscal stimulus if the government passes that. So there are a range of factors there. What we think really focusing on the consumer, and that's what we try to do and are trying to do is really give more information about how we're focused on the consumer and want to win where they go. And that's exactly why we implemented the portfolio strategy is really looking at the consumer is going to make different decisions, depending on where they're at in their journey and how do we really focus on the consumer and have the best products and best brands in each of those categories as they make decisions.
Don't get me wrong. This cigarette, as I said in my remarks, really fuels. It's the engine for fueling the 10-year vision. But we think what you should hold us accountable to is our success in meeting the consumer where they're at regardless of what category they're in."

As far as the employees, they have such passion, but you're right, incentivizing them in the right direction certainly directs that passion. We've shared that 10-year vision that we have and how we expect to progress through time with our employee base. They're passionate about it. They're excited to support that. And we think we have the right incentive program in place to warrant that excitement.
As far as milestones, again, I won't go into a specific numerical value. Remember, from an overall objective, we're looking to balance strong growth -- EPS growth for investors and the associated cash involved with that but, at the same time, making investments over the long-term to advance our noncombustible portfolio. And so what we're really trying to do is have that balance. And so we're certainly going to share with you, through time, how we're making progress, but it's really about the journey of the consumer. 
So if you think about really driving awareness of the consumer for new categories, incenting trial, ultimately purchase and then, at the final stage, conversion to these new categories. That's the way we're thinking about the consumer journey. And we're really investing to get to as close to the consumer as we can because each consumer is going to be at a different point in that journey and make different decisions across the categories. And that's exactly the portfolio approach.
And different actions are taken, whether they're regulatory actions, whether they're consumers really enjoying the category is being able to be agile enough to not starve any category that's growing and make the appropriate investments there. So that's how we're thinking about the consumers' journey. And you'll see us share more through time of how we're progressing with those consumer journeys."

Look, we're very excited about what we've experienced in the first 3 lead markets. From a standpoint of the exact way to engage with the consumer, what's most important we found is the consumer education, that they understand what the IQOS device delivers and the Marlboro HeatSticks, what flavor expectations they can have and then really how to use the device.
So from that standpoint, we're trying many things. Because remember, we launched in densely populated areas. So you have one strategy there. But then as you move from those densely populated areas out, that's exactly why we were testing the device sales in convenience stores to really meet consumers where they are. And as you get to more rural locations, really having an outlet to engage with the consumer.
We actually use all of those measures that you mentioned, whether it's direct mail, whether it's retail stores, the devices in the convenience stores, whether it's corners in various places or whether it's the mobile units. And certainly, in Charlotte, we have used the mobile units to a larger extent because what we found is as you meet a certain capacity, you can actually move those mobile devices -- mobile units from one location to another and really maximize the number of consumers you're engaging with.
Now, certainly, in the COVID world, we had some challenges there because there's a lot of engagement 101 with the consumer, but our team implemented digital tools. We talked about the mobile chat capability that they installed. And so we're excited to continue to expand, and we'll have more to say on that."

So if you think about that total framework, what it should address is it should address underage use. It should establish industry product standards, and that includes safety standards. It really needs to be guided by the science so that from a standpoint of everything should be science driven. And it really should deal with the social justice issues that are involved in that space.

Look, we recognize that pricing is an important part of the algorithm. I would remind you that the strategy for the combustible segment, both cigarettes and cigars is to maximize profitability over the long-term while balancing investments in Marlboro and the funding the growth of our noncombustible portfolio. So certainly, profitability in the traditional tobacco space is what we're using to invest in the future in these noncombustible product arena.
And so certainly, we look at that from a standpoint of -- when you look at pricing, a couple of the factors that we think about pricing as we move forward is really, where are our consumers on an economic standpoint. What are they feeling? How do they feel? What are they thinking about? It's the strength of our brands, how do we think about our brands and the strength in the consumer's mind. And then certainly, business performance and objectives factor into that.
I think when you look at price realization over the past couple of years, I think it's important to remember that's not all list price. It also has the price efficiencies we've been able to garner from the advanced analytics that we put in place. And so with the amount of data that we get in and the advanced analytics that we've invested in, I think you're seeing the benefit in price realization of being more efficient, but just as effective, if not, more in the marketplace with the promotional spend that we have. So it's a combination of both, and we are extremely excited about what our advanced analytics team has been able to accomplish."

And so that's how I would think about 2021 costs.
As far as PMCC, the folks at PMCC over the last many years have done a wonderful job of really unwinding that business. And it has been lumpy at times. We're selling assets. When you think about '21 and '22, we've got the net finance assets at a low level. It's significantly lower than when we began to wind down that business.

Altria delivered outstanding results in 2020 and managed through the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our tobacco businesses were resilient, and our employees demonstrated unwavering commitment to their work, colleagues and communities. Our employees continue to move Altria forward, and we believe we're making steady progress towards our 10-year vision to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a noncombustible future. 
We continue to execute against the strategies we previously shared, including maximizing profits in our combustible businesses, responsibly expanding our noncombustible products, and demonstrating science-based leadership in the external environment. We remain active in our communities, supporting relief efforts for the pandemic and the West Coast wildfires. We're committed to driving positive change and addressing racial and economic inequities. 
Change starts from within, and our employees are leading our efforts to build a more diverse inclusive and equitable organization. Our 11 employee resource groups are helping promote cultural awareness and diversity in our workplace and within our communities. Two of these organizations, Mosaic and C, were recently recognized for their contributions by the national LGBT Chamber of Commerce and by the Virginia Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, respectively. We also acknowledge the importance of addressing environmental challenges, and we've established ambitious goals for 2030. Last month, we were among the 1% of companies awarded a AA rating from CDP for climate and water stewardship. We're proud of these efforts, and I look forward to sharing more details about our ESG initiatives next month at CAGNY. 
2020 was a dynamic year in the tobacco industry, with notable changes in each category. Tobacco consumers continue to adopt noncombustible alternatives to cigarettes. Most significantly in the oral tobacco space, with rapid growth in oral nicotine pouches off of a small base and a return to moderate volume growth in moist smokeless tobacco. 
The heated tobacco category also showed encouraging signs of smoker interest, though it remains in its early stages. The e-vapor category, however, which has been the biggest driver of smoker conversion over the last several years contracted in 2020 as it continues to undergo a transition period, pending FDA market determinations. And in combustibles, cigarette volumes were a little changed from 2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic alter smoker behaviors and purchasing patterns. 
Looking at the tobacco space in total, estimated equivalized volumes remained stable. In fact, over the last 5 years, we estimate that total tobacco volumes have only decreased by 1% on a compounded annual basis. While 2020 represented a pause in some industry trends away from combustible products, our plans to achieve our 10-year vision remains centered around building a deep understanding of evolving tobacco consumer preferences, meeting these preferences by expanding the awareness and availability of our noncombustible product portfolio and when authorized by the FDA, engaging with smokers to educate them, on the benefits of switching to alternative products. 
Let's now turn to our 2020 business results. Altria's full year adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 3.6%, driven by strong performance from our tobacco businesses. We also returned nearly $6.3 billion in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. And our Board increased the dividend for the 55th time in the past 51 years. 
Our Smokable Product segment continues to be the engine that powers our 10-year vision. Generating significant cash that can be invested in noncombustible products and return to shareholders. This segment has demonstrated strong profit growth in a variety of marketplace conditions. Over the last 5 years, smokeable segment adjusted OCI has grown by 5.5% on a compounded annual basis, and its segment has delivered excellent financial performance across varied volume and market share dynamics. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our combustible businesses, and Sal will provide more details on this segment in his remarks. 
Moving to our noncombustible offerings. We're pleased with the continued strength of USSTC's most smokeless tobacco business and the encouraging results from our other noncombustible products. We believe our products and investments with the oral tobacco, e-vapor and heated tobacco categories present compelling options for the millions of U.S. smokers looking for alternatives to cigarettes. 
In oral tobacco, we believe we have an unmatched portfolio of MST and all nicotine pouch products. Copenhagen remains the leading oral tobacco brand and delivered strong volume and profit performance for the year. We're also excited about the potential for on! and believe it's a satisfying product for both smokers and dippers. 
Helix made significant progress in its first full year of operations. Over the last 12 months, our talented regulatory affairs team assist the Helix and falling PMTAs for the on! portfolio, which we believe demonstrate that the products are appropriate for the protection of public health. Our highly skilled engineers and machine operators supported Helix in establishing a manufacturing footprint for on! in our Richmond facility, and Helix has reached annualized capacity for on! of 50 million cans. 
The team continues to install a machinery, and Helix expects unconstrained manufacturing capacity for the U.S. market by midyear 2021. And the Helix brand management and AGDC sales teams collaborated to steadily increase the retail distribution of on! during the year and executed innovative trial generating promotions that demonstrated the ability for on! to gain traction with smokers and dippers. 
on! was sold in approximately 78,000 stores at the end of 2020, up nearly 40% from the third quarter and more than 5x the store count from the end of 2019. In stores with distribution, on! achieved a retail share of 2.4 percentage points of the oral tobacco category in 2020, with significant growth coming into the second half of the year. 
Helix has strong plans for the year ahead and is focused on removing capacity constraints, reaching its retail distribution targets, building brand equity and converting smokers. We're confident in the on! proposition and believe its satisfying range of nicotine strengths and flavors and unique packaging position it well for success in the rapidly growing nicotine pouch space.
Moving to e-vapor. We estimate that total category volumes decreased by 10% for the full year. The category continues to undergo a transition period as FDA prepares to make market determinations on the thousands of PMTAs filed by the September 2020 statutory deadline. We continue to believe that e-vapor products can play an important role in tobacco harm reduction and that sustainable e-vapor category will be one that consists solely of FDA authorized products. We believe the category's long-term trajectory will be determined by regulatory decisions, legislative and tax policy and innovation that best addresses smoker and vapor preferences. 
In the heated tobacco category, PM USA continues to expand IQOS and Marlboro Heatsticks responsibly and in a disciplined manner. PM USA's 2020 accomplishments included: Launching in Charlotte with a more disruptive retail fixture; expanding the retail distribution of Heatsticks to approximately 1,000 total stores; introducing devices into select Charlotte convenience stores; developing an array of new digital tools, including mobile video chat capability, which gives p.m. USA's customer care experts, a virtual option to build connections and support age-verified smokers through their conversion journey and communicating with smokers using the FDA-authorized reduced exposure claim about the benefits of switching from cigarettes. 
We're excited that the FDA has authorized the IQOS 3 device for sale in the U.S. The new device offers several enhancements compared to the current 2.4 version, including a longer battery life and a faster recharging time. PM USA expects to begin selling the new device shortly and it will be available across all existing retail channels in the Atlanta, Charlotte and Richmond markets. PM USA also recently introduced new packaging for Heatsticks and has renamed the 3 currently authorized heatstick SKUs as Amber, Blue menthol and Green menthol. The new packs feature a cleaner look, and PM USA believes the naming convention will facilitate heatstick line extensions in the future should additional variants be authorized by the FDA. 
PM USA is focused on expanding the availability and awareness of IQOS, achieving its contractual performance requirements and remains on track with its 2021 plans to expand IQOS and heatsticks into 4 new metro markets and surrounding geographies. We believe that P.M. USA has the right approach to maximize its store mover advantage while we're responsibly positioning the U.S. heated tobacco category for long-term growth and profitability. 
Let's now turn to our financial outlook for 2021. Our plans for the year ahead include accelerating investments in support of our 10-year vision, which we expect to fund through the financial strength of our tobacco businesses. The external environment remains dynamic, however, and we're monitoring various factors, including unemployment rates, fiscal stimulus, tobacco consumer dynamics, including stay-at-home practices, disposable income, purchasing patterns and adoption of noncombustible products, regulatory and legislative developments, the timing and breadth of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and expectations for adjusted earnings contributions from our alcohol assets. 
Taking these factors into consideration, we expect to deliver 2021 full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $4.49 to $4.62. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. Our 2021 guidance incorporates planned investments to drive smoker conversion to noncombustible products, including continued marketplace investments to expand the availability and awareness of our noncombustible offerings, building an industry-leading consumer engagement system that enhances data collection and insights in support of conversion and increased noncombustible product research and development. We expect our 2021 adjusted EPS growth to come in the last 3 quarters of the year, primarily due to prior year comparisons, which includes 1 fewer smokable products shipping day in the first quarter. Altria's tobacco businesses delivered excellent results over the past year, and I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work. Their dedication drives their strong performance, and it's their passion and commitment that makes me excited for Altria's future. 
I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our financial performance."
296308,701184726,2252343,"Altria Group, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Billy. Let me begin by providing an update on U.S. tobacco consumers. Economic conditions remain challenging for consumers in the fourth quarter as unemployment rates remain high and the enhanced benefits from the original pandemic assistance pack",1099,"Thanks, Billy. Let me begin by providing an update on U.S. tobacco consumers. Economic conditions remain challenging for consumers in the fourth quarter as unemployment rates remain high and the enhanced benefits from the original pandemic assistance package were fully exhausted. However, we believe consumers continue their stay-at-home practices in the fourth quarter, contributing to more tobacco usage occasions and higher tobacco discretionary spending. 
At retail, we estimate that the fourth quarter, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store was slightly lower than prior levels. But tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated versus the year ago period. 
Turning now to our businesses. The Smokable Products segment delivered excellent financial and marketplace results in 2020. The segment grew full year adjusted OCI by over 10% and expanded its adjusted OCI margins by almost 2 percentage points. The Smokeable segment also achieved robust net price realization of 6.7% for the year, with PM USA's revenue growth management framework continuing to enhance the segment's top line performance. 
Smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 0.0 -- I'm sorry, 0.4% in 2020 versus the prior year. When adjusted for trade inventories, calendar differences and other factors, we estimate that full year segment cigarette volumes declined by 2%. 
At the industry level, we estimate that full year domestic cigarette volumes were unchanged versus the prior year after adjusting for the same factors. 
Looking ahead, we expect 2021 cigarette industry volume trends to be most influenced by smoker stay-at-home practices, unemployment rates, fiscal stimulus, cross-category movement, the timing and breadth of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and consumer purchasing behavior following the vaccine. 
Due to the uncertain timing and magnitude of each of these dynamics, we're not providing a cigarette industry outlook. We believe the degree of cross-category movement will be influenced by several factors, including consumer perceptions of the relative risk of noncombustible products compared to cigarettes, FDA determinations on PMTA filings and legislative actions. We'll continue to monitor these factors and update you on the pandemic driven and underlying smoker behaviors that we observe in the category. 
Turning to marketplace performance. Marlboro's fourth quarter retail share was 43.3%, up 2/10 versus the prior year and unchanged sequentially. Marlboro continued to benefit in the fourth quarter from smoker preferences toward familiar products during disruptive times and continued lower promotional spending among competitive brands versus the first half of 2020.
For the full year, Marlboro's retail share declined 3/10 to 43%. Marlboro's full year share performance was impacted by the movement of older consumers coming back into cigarettes from e-vapor, which we observed at the beginning of 2020.  This demographic has a greater tendency to purchase discount cigarettes than the category average, which increased discount segment share to start the year. We continue to be pleased with Marlboro's performance and believe its leading brand equity positions the brand well to deliver on its long-term profit potential.
In discount, total segment retail share was 24.5% in the fourth quarter, unchanged versus the year ago period and up 2/10 sequentially. For the full year, discount segment retail share increased 3/10 to 24.5%, driven by the cross-category movement observed at the beginning of 2020 and growth in deep discount products.
Moving to cigars, Middleton provided a strong contribution to the smokable segments financial results and continue to successfully navigate the regulatory environment. Reported cigar shipment volumes increased 9% for the year. And Black & Mild remain the leading Tip cigar brand. Middleton has also received market orders or exemptions from FDA, covering over 97% of its volume.
Turning to noncombustibles. We're very pleased with the performance of the Oral Tobacco Products segment. Segment adjusted OCI increased 7.3% for the year. And it maintained its strong adjusted OCI margin of 71.7 percentage points despite increased investments behind on!. Reported oral tobacco segment volumes increased by 1.2% in 2020, driven by on! oral nicotine pouches. In MST, Copenhagen reported shipment volumes were unchanged versus the prior year.
When adjusted for calendar differences, trade inventory movements and other factors, full year oral tobacco segment volumes increased by an estimated 1%. Full year 2020 retail share for the oral tobacco segment was 49.8%, down 2.7 percentage points due to the increased adoption of oral nicotine pouches. We remain pleased with the performance of Copenhagen in the MSC category, and we're excited about the growth potential of on! as we continue to expand capacity and distribution.
In alcohol, the pandemic negatively impacted the 2020 financial performance of both Ste. Michelle and our equity investment in ABI. Ste. Michelle's full year adjusted OCI decreased approximately 30%, driven primarily by lower on-premise and direct-to-consumer sales, partially offset by higher pricing.  And in beer, we recorded $157 million of adjusted equity earnings in the fourth quarter, representing Altria's share of ABI's third quarter 2020 results, and a decrease of more than 19% from the same period last year.
For the full year, we've recorded $540 million in adjusted equity earnings from ABI, down over 36% from 2019. In our all other operating category, we recorded $172 million in adjusted losses for the year, more than half of which related to noncash reductions and the estimated residual value of certain assets at Philip Morris Capital Corporation. As of year-end 2020, the net finance assets balance for PMCC was $320 million. We expect to continue reducing this balance in 2021 through rent and asset sales and fully -- and expect to fully complete the PMCC wind down by the end of 2022.
Moving to capital allocation. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our tobacco businesses are highly cash generative. Dividends remain our primary vehicle for returning cash to shareholders. And our long-term objective is a dividend target payout ratio of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted earnings per share. We believe our dividend target payout ratio provide significant shareholder return while allowing for flexibility in our capital allocation. We perform rigorous analysis to determine the best use of excess cash, including evaluating options for reinvesting behind our 10-year vision, refinancing our long-term debt and repurchasing shares. Yesterday, our Board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by June 30, 2022. The new authorization reflects the significant value the Board believes exists in our shares today.
With that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items.

On the excise tax front, I would remind you that we had 2 state excise tax increases happened at the beginning of this year. Certainly with the build that the states have racked up responding to COVID, certainly it'd be a little bit more challenging excise tax environment. We have a great government affairs team, as you know, Nik, and they engage on both sides of the aisle across the states and really know how to engage on that.
From that standpoint, though, I think right now, most governments are focused on how to get the COVID-19 pandemic under control. And so there's a little bit of chatter across the states. But nothing to point out at this point. But certainly, it will be a challenging environment as they look to pay the bills related to their response to COVID-19.
On Marlboro, Nik, I think what you saw was -- and Sal highlighted in his comments. People were concerned at the beginning of the year. We tried to highlight for the analyst and investor community that what we saw was consumers moving back from e-vapor back into cigarettes and both premium brands and discount brands benefited from it, but because it tended to skew older adult smoker coming back, we know that they have a proclivity towards discount brands. We didn't panic when that was taking place. We knew what -- we felt like we knew what was behind that. And I think you've just seen the strength of the mobile brand through time. Certainly, there were some competitive premium brands that had some extra resources in the marketplace at the beginning of 2020. We saw those lessen as we progress through 2020.
And to your point, the programs we have in place and the Marlboro brand team do an excellent job of engaging with the consumers and really building loyalty through time, whether you mentioned the rewards program but other programs as well. And I think that's the strength of the mobile brand, and we're excited about where it stands."

But to your point, there are a lot of uncertainties and a lot of fluidness in the environment, whether that's the consumer and how they're engaged with some of these noncombustible categories as they continue to grow or to the things we've highlighted in our remarks, whether it's unemployment or the fiscal stimulus if the government passes that. So there are a range of factors there. What we think really focusing on the consumer, and that's what we try to do and are trying to do is really give more information about how we're focused on the consumer and want to win where they go. And that's exactly why we implemented the portfolio strategy is really looking at the consumer is going to make different decisions, depending on where they're at in their journey and how do we really focus on the consumer and have the best products and best brands in each of those categories as they make decisions.
Don't get me wrong. This cigarette, as I said in my remarks, really fuels. It's the engine for fueling the 10-year vision. But we think what you should hold us accountable to is our success in meeting the consumer where they're at regardless of what category they're in."

And I'm asking because, obviously, per your guidance and your comments, you're entering a period near-term here where you're stepping up spend to kind of accelerate this plan. So it would help us to understand maybe some targets, like for you to convert your business to the noncombustible products, as you mentioned, is it fair to assume 20%, 25%, for instance, in the next, I don't know, again, 3, 5 or 5-plus years?
And then as you execute on that vision, are you also open to or considering future M&A to even accelerate this further? Or should we just assume this will all be done organically? And then I do want to hear about how you're incentivizing your employees to execute."

We've shared that 10-year vision that we have and how we expect to progress through time with our employee base. They're passionate about it. They're excited to support that. And we think we have the right incentive program in place to warrant that excitement.
As far as milestones, again, I won't go into a specific numerical value. Remember, from an overall objective, we're looking to balance strong growth -- EPS growth for investors and the associated cash involved with that but, at the same time, making investments over the long-term to advance our noncombustible portfolio. And so what we're really trying to do is have that balance. And so we're certainly going to share with you, through time, how we're making progress, but it's really about the journey of the consumer. 
So if you think about really driving awareness of the consumer for new categories, incenting trial, ultimately purchase and then, at the final stage, conversion to these new categories. That's the way we're thinking about the consumer journey. And we're really investing to get to as close to the consumer as we can because each consumer is going to be at a different point in that journey and make different decisions across the categories. And that's exactly the portfolio approach.
And different actions are taken, whether they're regulatory actions, whether they're consumers really enjoying the category is being able to be agile enough to not starve any category that's growing and make the appropriate investments there. So that's how we're thinking about the consumers' journey. And you'll see us share more through time of how we're progressing with those consumer journeys."

So from that standpoint, we're trying many things. Because remember, we launched in densely populated areas. So you have one strategy there. But then as you move from those densely populated areas out, that's exactly why we were testing the device sales in convenience stores to really meet consumers where they are. And as you get to more rural locations, really having an outlet to engage with the consumer.
We actually use all of those measures that you mentioned, whether it's direct mail, whether it's retail stores, the devices in the convenience stores, whether it's corners in various places or whether it's the mobile units. And certainly, in Charlotte, we have used the mobile units to a larger extent because what we found is as you meet a certain capacity, you can actually move those mobile devices -- mobile units from one location to another and really maximize the number of consumers you're engaging with.
Now, certainly, in the COVID world, we had some challenges there because there's a lot of engagement 101 with the consumer, but our team implemented digital tools. We talked about the mobile chat capability that they installed. And so we're excited to continue to expand, and we'll have more to say on that."

Look, we recognize that pricing is an important part of the algorithm. I would remind you that the strategy for the combustible segment, both cigarettes and cigars is to maximize profitability over the long-term while balancing investments in Marlboro and the funding the growth of our noncombustible portfolio. So certainly, profitability in the traditional tobacco space is what we're using to invest in the future in these noncombustible product arena.
And so certainly, we look at that from a standpoint of -- when you look at pricing, a couple of the factors that we think about pricing as we move forward is really, where are our consumers on an economic standpoint. What are they feeling? How do they feel? What are they thinking about? It's the strength of our brands, how do we think about our brands and the strength in the consumer's mind. And then certainly, business performance and objectives factor into that.
I think when you look at price realization over the past couple of years, I think it's important to remember that's not all list price. It also has the price efficiencies we've been able to garner from the advanced analytics that we put in place. And so with the amount of data that we get in and the advanced analytics that we've invested in, I think you're seeing the benefit in price realization of being more efficient, but just as effective, if not, more in the marketplace with the promotional spend that we have.

As far as the cost base, in 2020, remember, we were lapping the cost reduction program that we implemented in 2019. And of course, cost management remains top of mind for us. When you think about 2021, we think we have the right structure for the business and the right size of the business. It's really about reallocating our spending, right? So we're moving spending from the combustible business as we invest into the noncombustible business. And our employees do a terrific job of thinking about efficiencies on their infrastructure and their processes and how that frees up resources to reinvest in our 10-year vision and in our noncombustible platform. So the right-sized organization, we feel really good about it. We have terrific employees. They've done a wonderful job of continuing to provide productivity during the pandemic. And so that's how I would think about 2021 costs.
As far as PMCC, the folks at PMCC over the last many years have done a wonderful job of really unwinding that business. And it has been lumpy at times. We're selling assets. When you think about '21 and '22, we've got the net finance assets at a low level. It's significantly lower than when we began to wind down that business. And really, it's about rents received and the sale of assets. So there might be some lumpiness in there, but we feel good about the portfolio that remains and the ability to unwind the business. And we expect to be completely wound down in 2022."

Altria delivered outstanding results in 2020 and managed through the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our tobacco businesses were resilient, and our employees demonstrated unwavering commitment to their work, colleagues and communities. Our employees continue to move Altria forward, and we believe we're making steady progress towards our 10-year vision to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a noncombustible future. 
We continue to execute against the strategies we previously shared, including maximizing profits in our combustible businesses, responsibly expanding our noncombustible products, and demonstrating science-based leadership in the external environment. We remain active in our communities, supporting relief efforts for the pandemic and the West Coast wildfires. We're committed to driving positive change and addressing racial and economic inequities. 
Change starts from within, and our employees are leading our efforts to build a more diverse inclusive and equitable organization. Our 11 employee resource groups are helping promote cultural awareness and diversity in our workplace and within our communities. Two of these organizations, Mosaic and C, were recently recognized for their contributions by the national LGBT Chamber of Commerce and by the Virginia Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, respectively. We also acknowledge the importance of addressing environmental challenges, and we've established ambitious goals for 2030. Last month, we were among the 1% of companies awarded a AA rating from CDP for climate and water stewardship. We're proud of these efforts, and I look forward to sharing more details about our ESG initiatives next month at CAGNY. 
2020 was a dynamic year in the tobacco industry, with notable changes in each category. Tobacco consumers continue to adopt noncombustible alternatives to cigarettes. Most significantly in the oral tobacco space, with rapid growth in oral nicotine pouches off of a small base and a return to moderate volume growth in moist smokeless tobacco. 
The heated tobacco category also showed encouraging signs of smoker interest, though it remains in its early stages. The e-vapor category, however, which has been the biggest driver of smoker conversion over the last several years contracted in 2020 as it continues to undergo a transition period, pending FDA market determinations. And in combustibles, cigarette volumes were a little changed from 2019 as the COVID-19 pandemic alter smoker behaviors and purchasing patterns. 
Looking at the tobacco space in total, estimated equivalized volumes remained stable. In fact, over the last 5 years, we estimate that total tobacco volumes have only decreased by 1% on a compounded annual basis. While 2020 represented a pause in some industry trends away from combustible products, our plans to achieve our 10-year vision remains centered around building a deep understanding of evolving tobacco consumer preferences, meeting these preferences by expanding the awareness and availability of our noncombustible product portfolio and when authorized by the FDA, engaging with smokers to educate them, on the benefits of switching to alternative products. 
Let's now turn to our 2020 business results. Altria's full year adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 3.6%, driven by strong performance from our tobacco businesses. We also returned nearly $6.3 billion in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. And our Board increased the dividend for the 55th time in the past 51 years. 
Our Smokable Product segment continues to be the engine that powers our 10-year vision. Generating significant cash that can be invested in noncombustible products and return to shareholders. This segment has demonstrated strong profit growth in a variety of marketplace conditions. Over the last 5 years, smokeable segment adjusted OCI has grown by 5.5% on a compounded annual basis, and its segment has delivered excellent financial performance across varied volume and market share dynamics. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our combustible businesses, and Sal will provide more details on this segment in his remarks. 
Moving to our noncombustible offerings. We're pleased with the continued strength of USSTC's most smokeless tobacco business and the encouraging results from our other noncombustible products. We believe our products and investments with the oral tobacco, e-vapor and heated tobacco categories present compelling options for the millions of U.S. smokers looking for alternatives to cigarettes. 
In oral tobacco, we believe we have an unmatched portfolio of MST and all nicotine pouch products. Copenhagen remains the leading oral tobacco brand and delivered strong volume and profit performance for the year. We're also excited about the potential for on! and believe it's a satisfying product for both smokers and dippers. 
Helix made significant progress in its first full year of operations. Over the last 12 months, our talented regulatory affairs team assist the Helix and falling PMTAs for the on! portfolio, which we believe demonstrate that the products are appropriate for the protection of public health. Our highly skilled engineers and machine operators supported Helix in establishing a manufacturing footprint for on! in our Richmond facility, and Helix has reached annualized capacity for on! of 50 million cans. 
The team continues to install a machinery, and Helix expects unconstrained manufacturing capacity for the U.S. market by midyear 2021. And the Helix brand management and AGDC sales teams collaborated to steadily increase the retail distribution of on! during the year and executed innovative trial generating promotions that demonstrated the ability for on! to gain traction with smokers and dippers. 
on! was sold in approximately 78,000 stores at the end of 2020, up nearly 40% from the third quarter and more than 5x the store count from the end of 2019. In stores with distribution, on! achieved a retail share of 2.4 percentage points of the oral tobacco category in 2020, with significant growth coming into the second half of the year. 
Helix has strong plans for the year ahead and is focused on removing capacity constraints, reaching its retail distribution targets, building brand equity and converting smokers. We're confident in the on! proposition and believe its satisfying range of nicotine strengths and flavors and unique packaging position it well for success in the rapidly growing nicotine pouch space.
Moving to e-vapor. We estimate that total category volumes decreased by 10% for the full year. The category continues to undergo a transition period as FDA prepares to make market determinations on the thousands of PMTAs filed by the September 2020 statutory deadline. We continue to believe that e-vapor products can play an important role in tobacco harm reduction and that sustainable e-vapor category will be one that consists solely of FDA authorized products. We believe the category's long-term trajectory will be determined by regulatory decisions, legislative and tax policy and innovation that best addresses smoker and vapor preferences. 
In the heated tobacco category, PM USA continues to expand IQOS and Marlboro Heatsticks responsibly and in a disciplined manner. PM USA's 2020 accomplishments included: Launching in Charlotte with a more disruptive retail fixture; expanding the retail distribution of Heatsticks to approximately 1,000 total stores; introducing devices into select Charlotte convenience stores; developing an array of new digital tools, including mobile video chat capability, which gives p.m. USA's customer care experts, a virtual option to build connections and support age-verified smokers through their conversion journey and communicating with smokers using the FDA-authorized reduced exposure claim about the benefits of switching from cigarettes. 
We're excited that the FDA has authorized the IQOS 3 device for sale in the U.S. The new device offers several enhancements compared to the current 2.4 version, including a longer battery life and a faster recharging time. PM USA expects to begin selling the new device shortly and it will be available across all existing retail channels in the Atlanta, Charlotte and Richmond markets. PM USA also recently introduced new packaging for Heatsticks and has renamed the 3 currently authorized heatstick SKUs as Amber, Blue menthol and Green menthol. The new packs feature a cleaner look, and PM USA believes the naming convention will facilitate heatstick line extensions in the future should additional variants be authorized by the FDA. 
PM USA is focused on expanding the availability and awareness of IQOS, achieving its contractual performance requirements and remains on track with its 2021 plans to expand IQOS and heatsticks into 4 new metro markets and surrounding geographies. We believe that P.M. USA has the right approach to maximize its store mover advantage while we're responsibly positioning the U.S. heated tobacco category for long-term growth and profitability. 
Let's now turn to our financial outlook for 2021. Our plans for the year ahead include accelerating investments in support of our 10-year vision, which we expect to fund through the financial strength of our tobacco businesses. The external environment remains dynamic, however, and we're monitoring various factors, including unemployment rates, fiscal stimulus, tobacco consumer dynamics, including stay-at-home practices, disposable income, purchasing patterns and adoption of noncombustible products, regulatory and legislative developments, the timing and breadth of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and expectations for adjusted earnings contributions from our alcohol assets. 
Taking these factors into consideration, we expect to deliver 2021 full year adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $4.49 to $4.62. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. Our 2021 guidance incorporates planned investments to drive smoker conversion to noncombustible products, including continued marketplace investments to expand the availability and awareness of our noncombustible offerings, building an industry-leading consumer engagement system that enhances data collection and insights in support of conversion and increased noncombustible product research and development. We expect our 2021 adjusted EPS growth to come in the last 3 quarters of the year, primarily due to prior year comparisons, which includes 1 fewer smokable products shipping day in the first quarter. Altria's tobacco businesses delivered excellent results over the past year, and I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work. Their dedication drives their strong performance, and it's their passion and commitment that makes me excited for Altria's future. 
I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our financial performance."
296308,701184726,2252344,"Altria Group, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2021",2021-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Billy. Let me begin by providing an update on U.S. tobacco consumers. Economic conditions remain challenging for consumers in the fourth quarter as unemployment rates remain high and the enhanced benefits from the original pandemic assistance pack",1099,"Thanks, Billy. Let me begin by providing an update on U.S. tobacco consumers. Economic conditions remain challenging for consumers in the fourth quarter as unemployment rates remain high and the enhanced benefits from the original pandemic assistance package were fully exhausted. However, we believe consumers continue their stay-at-home practices in the fourth quarter, contributing to more tobacco usage occasions and higher tobacco discretionary spending. 
At retail, we estimate that the fourth quarter, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store was slightly lower than prior levels. But tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated versus the year ago period. 
Turning now to our businesses. The Smokable Products segment delivered excellent financial and marketplace results in 2020. The segment grew full year adjusted OCI by over 10% and expanded its adjusted OCI margins by almost 2 percentage points. The Smokeable segment also achieved robust net price realization of 6.7% for the year, with PM USA's revenue growth management framework continuing to enhance the segment's top line performance. 
Smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 0.0 -- I'm sorry, 0.4% in 2020 versus the prior year. When adjusted for trade inventories, calendar differences and other factors, we estimate that full year segment cigarette volumes declined by 2%. 
At the industry level, we estimate that full year domestic cigarette volumes were unchanged versus the prior year after adjusting for the same factors. 
Looking ahead, we expect 2021 cigarette industry volume trends to be most influenced by smoker stay-at-home practices, unemployment rates, fiscal stimulus, cross-category movement, the timing and breadth of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and consumer purchasing behavior following the vaccine. 
Due to the uncertain timing and magnitude of each of these dynamics, we're not providing a cigarette industry outlook. We believe the degree of cross-category movement will be influenced by several factors, including consumer perceptions of the relative risk of noncombustible products compared to cigarettes, FDA determinations on PMTA filings and legislative actions. We'll continue to monitor these factors and update you on the pandemic driven and underlying smoker behaviors that we observe in the category. 
Turning to marketplace performance. Marlboro's fourth quarter retail share was 43.3%, up 2/10 versus the prior year and unchanged sequentially. Marlboro continued to benefit in the fourth quarter from smoker preferences toward familiar products during disruptive times and continued lower promotional spending among competitive brands versus the first half of 2020.
For the full year, Marlboro's retail share declined 3/10 to 43%. Marlboro's full year share performance was impacted by the movement of older consumers coming back into cigarettes from e-vapor, which we observed at the beginning of 2020.  This demographic has a greater tendency to purchase discount cigarettes than the category average, which increased discount segment share to start the year. We continue to be pleased with Marlboro's performance and believe its leading brand equity positions the brand well to deliver on its long-term profit potential.
In discount, total segment retail share was 24.5% in the fourth quarter, unchanged versus the year ago period and up 2/10 sequentially. For the full year, discount segment retail share increased 3/10 to 24.5%, driven by the cross-category movement observed at the beginning of 2020 and growth in deep discount products.
Moving to cigars, Middleton provided a strong contribution to the smokable segments financial results and continue to successfully navigate the regulatory environment. Reported cigar shipment volumes increased 9% for the year. And Black & Mild remain the leading Tip cigar brand. Middleton has also received market orders or exemptions from FDA, covering over 97% of its volume.
Turning to noncombustibles. We're very pleased with the performance of the Oral Tobacco Products segment. Segment adjusted OCI increased 7.3% for the year. And it maintained its strong adjusted OCI margin of 71.7 percentage points despite increased investments behind on!. Reported oral tobacco segment volumes increased by 1.2% in 2020, driven by on! oral nicotine pouches. In MST, Copenhagen reported shipment volumes were unchanged versus the prior year.
When adjusted for calendar differences, trade inventory movements and other factors, full year oral tobacco segment volumes increased by an estimated 1%. Full year 2020 retail share for the oral tobacco segment was 49.8%, down 2.7 percentage points due to the increased adoption of oral nicotine pouches. We remain pleased with the performance of Copenhagen in the MSC category, and we're excited about the growth potential of on! as we continue to expand capacity and distribution.
In alcohol, the pandemic negatively impacted the 2020 financial performance of both Ste. Michelle and our equity investment in ABI. Ste. Michelle's full year adjusted OCI decreased approximately 30%, driven primarily by lower on-premise and direct-to-consumer sales, partially offset by higher pricing.  And in beer, we recorded $157 million of adjusted equity earnings in the fourth quarter, representing Altria's share of ABI's third quarter 2020 results, and a decrease of more than 19% from the same period last year.
For the full year, we've recorded $540 million in adjusted equity earnings from ABI, down over 36% from 2019. In our all other operating category, we recorded $172 million in adjusted losses for the year, more than half of which related to noncash reductions and the estimated residual value of certain assets at Philip Morris Capital Corporation. As of year-end 2020, the net finance assets balance for PMCC was $320 million. We expect to continue reducing this balance in 2021 through rent and asset sales and fully -- and expect to fully complete the PMCC wind down by the end of 2022.
Moving to capital allocation. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our tobacco businesses are highly cash generative. Dividends remain our primary vehicle for returning cash to shareholders. And our long-term objective is a dividend target payout ratio of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted earnings per share. We believe our dividend target payout ratio provide significant shareholder return while allowing for flexibility in our capital allocation. We perform rigorous analysis to determine the best use of excess cash, including evaluating options for reinvesting behind our 10-year vision, refinancing our long-term debt and repurchasing shares. Yesterday, our Board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by June 30, 2022. The new authorization reflects the significant value the Board believes exists in our shares today.
With that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items.

What really drove that? I mean, you spoke in your prepared comments about well recognized brands, but I'm just trying to get underneath that there's other drivers like price gap management or the Marlboro Rewards program and how that played a role in terms of kind of shifting the share trajectory because it's been losing share for a number of quarters now."

On the excise tax front, I would remind you that we had 2 state excise tax increases happened at the beginning of this year. Certainly with the build that the states have racked up responding to COVID, certainly it'd be a little bit more challenging excise tax environment. We have a great government affairs team, as you know, Nik, and they engage on both sides of the aisle across the states and really know how to engage on that.
From that standpoint, though, I think right now, most governments are focused on how to get the COVID-19 pandemic under control. And so there's a little bit of chatter across the states. But nothing to point out at this point. But certainly, it will be a challenging environment as they look to pay the bills related to their response to COVID-19.
On Marlboro, Nik, I think what you saw was -- and Sal highlighted in his comments. People were concerned at the beginning of the year. We tried to highlight for the analyst and investor community that what we saw was consumers moving back from e-vapor back into cigarettes and both premium brands and discount brands benefited from it, but because it tended to skew older adult smoker coming back, we know that they have a proclivity towards discount brands. We didn't panic when that was taking place. We knew what -- we felt like we knew what was behind that. And I think you've just seen the strength of the mobile brand through time. Certainly, there were some competitive premium brands that had some extra resources in the marketplace at the beginning of 2020. We saw those lessen as we progress through 2020.
And to your point, the programs we have in place and the Marlboro brand team do an excellent job of engaging with the consumers and really building loyalty through time, whether you mentioned the rewards program but other programs as well.

And then I guess I'm a bit surprised you were unable to provide even a wide range for your cig volume expectations this year. I certainly understand there's a lot of uncertainty right now in our world. But you must have, I guess, some sense of the range of your SIG volumes, again, given your EPS guidance. So maybe you could touch on that for us a bit, just at a high level, whether or not you expect cig volumes this year will possibly revert back to historical declines, maybe below historical declines given the tough comps and the potential for greater excise tax increases?"

On the EPS guidance, really, when you think about the EPS guidance, and I know you're including kind of the cigarette volume in that, look, we run a range of scenarios around that. We really look at what do we -- our base expectations, we have a very strong forecasting group. They forecast across the various categories. And then we run a range of scenarios around that, upside and downside. And we think about, okay, what do we feel confident about in providing a short range of EPS guidance for the year. And that's where we landed.
As far as cigarette volume, it wasn't the -- that we didn't have a forecast for volume. We feel very good about the way we go about forecasting volume. But to your point, there are a lot of uncertainties and a lot of fluidness in the environment, whether that's the consumer and how they're engaged with some of these noncombustible categories as they continue to grow or to the things we've highlighted in our remarks, whether it's unemployment or the fiscal stimulus if the government passes that. So there are a range of factors there. What we think really focusing on the consumer, and that's what we try to do and are trying to do is really give more information about how we're focused on the consumer and want to win where they go. And that's exactly why we implemented the portfolio strategy is really looking at the consumer is going to make different decisions, depending on where they're at in their journey and how do we really focus on the consumer and have the best products and best brands in each of those categories as they make decisions.
Don't get me wrong. This cigarette, as I said in my remarks, really fuels. It's the engine for fueling the 10-year vision. But we think what you should hold us accountable to is our success in meeting the consumer where they're at regardless of what category they're in."

So it would help us to understand maybe some targets, like for you to convert your business to the noncombustible products, as you mentioned, is it fair to assume 20%, 25%, for instance, in the next, I don't know, again, 3, 5 or 5-plus years?

We've shared that 10-year vision that we have and how we expect to progress through time with our employee base. They're passionate about it. They're excited to support that. And we think we have the right incentive program in place to warrant that excitement.
As far as milestones, again, I won't go into a specific numerical value. Remember, from an overall objective, we're looking to balance strong growth -- EPS growth for investors and the associated cash involved with that but, at the same time, making investments over the long-term to advance our noncombustible portfolio. And so what we're really trying to do is have that balance. And so we're certainly going to share with you, through time, how we're making progress, but it's really about the journey of the consumer. 
So if you think about really driving awareness of the consumer for new categories, incenting trial, ultimately purchase and then, at the final stage, conversion to these new categories. That's the way we're thinking about the consumer journey. And we're really investing to get to as close to the consumer as we can because each consumer is going to be at a different point in that journey and make different decisions across the categories. And that's exactly the portfolio approach.
And different actions are taken, whether they're regulatory actions, whether they're consumers really enjoying the category is being able to be agile enough to not starve any category that's growing and make the appropriate investments there. So that's how we're thinking about the consumers' journey. And you'll see us share more through time of how we're progressing with those consumer journeys."

So from that standpoint, we're trying many things. Because remember, we launched in densely populated areas. So you have one strategy there. But then as you move from those densely populated areas out, that's exactly why we were testing the device sales in convenience stores to really meet consumers where they are. And as you get to more rural locations, really having an outlet to engage with the consumer.
We actually use all of those measures that you mentioned, whether it's direct mail, whether it's retail stores, the devices in the convenience stores, whether it's corners in various places or whether it's the mobile units. And certainly, in Charlotte, we have used the mobile units to a larger extent because what we found is as you meet a certain capacity, you can actually move those mobile devices -- mobile units from one location to another and really maximize the number of consumers you're engaging with.
Now, certainly, in the COVID world, we had some challenges there because there's a lot of engagement 101 with the consumer, but our team implemented digital tools. We talked about the mobile chat capability that they installed. And so we're excited to continue to expand, and we'll have more to say on that."

So certainly, profitability in the traditional tobacco space is what we're using to invest in the future in these noncombustible product arena.
And so certainly, we look at that from a standpoint of -- when you look at pricing, a couple of the factors that we think about pricing as we move forward is really, where are our consumers on an economic standpoint. What are they feeling? How do they feel? What are they thinking about? It's the strength of our brands, how do we think about our brands and the strength in the consumer's mind. And then certainly, business performance and objectives factor into that.
I think when you look at price realization over the past couple of years, I think it's important to remember that's not all list price. It also has the price efficiencies we've been able to garner from the advanced analytics that we put in place. And so with the amount of data that we get in and the advanced analytics that we've invested in, I think you're seeing the benefit in price realization of being more efficient, but just as effective, if not, more in the marketplace with the promotional spend that we have.

But I wouldn't say that we're just gliding along. We're going to move where the consumer moves. And so it's that keen focus on the consumer. It's about driving the portfolio that we have. And so if you think about investments around on! and in the heated tobacco space with IQOS and Mobile Heatsticks, it's about driving investments there, driving awareness, getting the distribution we desire at retail and having it in the consumers' consideration.
When you go to the next category about this digital platform, it's really about thinking about how do you -- we make great strides in analytics, and I think you've seen the benefit in the performance of our businesses. Now it's about those insights being really focused on the consumer and how do we get as close to the consumer and understand where each consumer is at on their journey to conversion for whatever category they're choosing and making sure that we're able to communicate and keep pace with them in that journey.
And then the final one is as we've seen in all of these categories, continued development around the product space is extremely important to the consumer and investing there to make sure we're keeping pace with the consumer. So that's how we're thinking about it. We're extremely excited about the portfolio we have. It's about getting it there to have it in the consumer consideration set, meeting them where they're at and communicating with them along the journey and then making sure that our products keep pace with the consumers' future wants and desires."

When you think about 2021, we think we have the right structure for the business and the right size of the business. It's really about reallocating our spending, right? So we're moving spending from the combustible business as we invest into the noncombustible business. And our employees do a terrific job of thinking about efficiencies on their infrastructure and their processes and how that frees up resources to reinvest in our 10-year vision and in our noncombustible platform. So the right-sized organization, we feel really good about it. We have terrific employees. They've done a wonderful job of continuing to provide productivity during the pandemic. And so that's how I would think about 2021 costs.
As far as PMCC, the folks at PMCC over the last many years have done a wonderful job of really unwinding that business. And it has been lumpy at times. We're selling assets. When you think about '21 and '22, we've got the net finance assets at a low level. It's significantly lower than when we began to wind down that business. And really, it's about rents received and the sale of assets. So there might be some lumpiness in there, but we feel good about the portfolio that remains and the ability to unwind the business.

Remember, last year, the Board of Directors receded the share buyback program, and we were very focused on it. And I think you've articulated the uses of cash for this year. We're excited that the -- and really pleased that the Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by June 30, 2022. So we're excited about that. I think it's the appropriate level. It reflects the value in our shares and enhances shareholder value, but we also maintain capital allocation flexibility. 
We remain committed to the 80% target payout ratio for our dividends against adjusted earnings per share. And when you think about our cash position, in a typical year after paying the dividend, making the necessary investments, capital investments in our business, we traditionally have about $1 billion in excess cash. And we will run through our capital allocation analysis to determine the best use of that cash."

We're off to a strong start to the year and believe our businesses are on track to deliver against their full year plans. Against a challenging comparison, our tobacco businesses performed well in the first quarter, and we continue to make progress advancing our noncombustible product portfolio. This morning, we announced another important milestone in the Altria's journey to move beyond smoking. We now have full global ownership of on! oral nicotine pouches as we recently closed transactions to acquire the remaining 20% global interest. We are excited about the opportunity we have with on! to convert smokers, and we have talented teams supporting the global plans for the brand. 
Before discussing our first quarter results in more detail, we would like to honor the memory of Tom Farrell, our late Chairman of the Board. Tom served 13 distinguished years on our Board, offered valuable insights and guidance during his tenure and was a true visionary. We will miss his leadership, contributions and friendship. The Board will appoint a new Chair at its meeting following our Annual Shareholders Meeting in May. 
Let's now turn to our first quarter results. Our first quarter adjusted diluted EPS declined 1.8%, primarily driven by unfavorable timing of interest expense, and a higher adjusted income tax rate. In the Smokable Product's segment, we continue to execute our strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles, while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro, with funding the growth of noncombustible products. Segment adjusted OCI margins expanded, and Marlboro continued its retail share momentum from the back half of 2020. For volumes, reported Smokable segment domestic cigarette volume declined 12% in the first quarter, reflecting year-over-year trade inventory movements, 1 fewer shipping day and other factors. When adjusted for these factors, cigarette volume declined by an estimated 3.5%. We believe that in the first quarter of 2020, wholesalers built inventories by approximately 900 million units, driven in part by COVID-19 dynamics, compared with a depletion of approximately 300 million units in the first quarter of 2021. At the industry level, we estimate that first quarter adjusted domestic cigarette volume declined 2%. 
Looking at smoker retail dynamics, we estimated that total cigarette triped in the first quarter remained below pre-pandemic levels. Also, estimated expenditures per trip remained elevated when compared to pre pandemic levels and were steady sequentially. We are continuing to monitor the impacts from external factors on tobacco consumer purchasing patterns and behavior. In March, the federal government passed a third stimulus package. An increasing number of people became vaccinated and consumability improved sharply. We're keeping a close eye on the tobacco consumer, and we will continue to provide our insights on the underlying factors as the year progresses. 
Moving to our noncombustible products. We are pleased to now have full ownership of on! nicotine pouches globally. We completed transactions in December and April to acquire the remaining 20% of the global on! business for approximately $250 million. When we made the initial 80% acquisition in 2019, the oral nicotine pouch category in the U.S. was rapidly growing off of a small base. Subsequently, oral nicotine pouch growth has exceeded our original estimates. In the first quarter of 2021, we estimate that retail share for all nicotine pouches was approximately 13% of the total oral tobacco category. Double its share in the year ago period. We expect continued growth from the oral nicotine pouch products and estimate that category volume in the U.S. will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 25% and over the next 5 years. 
Since 2019, Helix, supported by the enterprise, significantly increased on! manufacturing capacity, broadened retail distribution, grew tobacco consumer awareness and followed PMTAs for the entire product portfolio. Helix achieved an annualized manufacturing capacity of 50 million cans by the end of last year, and as of the end of the first quarter, on! was sold in approximately 93,000 stores. In the U.S. market, on! momentum continued. In the first quarter, on! share of the total oral tobacco category grew significantly to 1.7%. On a 12-month moving basis, in-store selling and providing point-of-sale data, on!'s retail share was 3.1%, an increase of $0.07 from the 2020 full year share. Going forward, we intend to report on! share of the total U.S. old tobacco category as Helix expects to be in stores covering 90% of the industry's oral tobacco volume by midyear. 
Our primary focus continues to be on increasing on!'s growth in the U.S. Internationally, we see potential to strengthen on! in the Swedish market. We also see longer-term prospects in Europe to expand on! and gain consumer feedback on potential noncombustible products for the U.S. To explore these additional opportunities, we have expanded the international on! team. We believe on! presents a compelling noncombustible alternative for smokers and we look forward to supporting their conversion journey. 
Moving to e-vapor. We estimate that total category volume increased 24% versus the year ago period. As a reminder, in Q1 2020, the FDA restricted the sales of all flavored e-vapor products among pod systems with the exception of tobacco and menthol. Sequentially, we estimate that the category volume increased 7% as competitive marketplace activity continued. As a result of these dynamics, JUUL's first quarter retail share of the total e-vapor category decreased to 33%. We continue to believe that a responsible e-vapor category, consisting solely of FDA authorized products can play an important role in tobacco action. As for our JUUL investment, the FTC trial is now scheduled for June of this year, and we remain committed to vigorously defending our investment. 
In heated tobacco, PM USA is continuing to expand IQOS and Marlboro HeatSticks. Beginning this month, HeatSticks are available in retail stores statewide across Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Marlboro HeatSticks retail volume and share continued to grow in the first quarter. In Atlanta stores with distribution Marlboro HeatSticks retail share of the cigarette category was 1.1%, an increase of 2/10 sequentially. And in Charlotte, HeatSticks retail share was 1%, an increase of 3/10 sequentially. Last month, PM USA began selling the IQOS 3 device, which offers a longer battery life and faster recharging as compared to the 2.4 version. The new device is being offered through device and HeatSticks bundles and through the lending program, which has been effective at generating trial and driving purchase. We're encouraged to see that many consumers are upgrading their 2.4 devices, representing approximately 25% of all IQOS 3 device sales in the first quarter. Along with geographic expansion, PM USA is increasing the use of its digital platforms like marlboro.com and get iqos.com to engage with smokers and communicate the benefits of IQOS including the MRTP claim on the IQOS 2.4 system. For marlboro.com, IQOS content is now available nationwide. Smokers can sign up to receive communications and be notified when IQOS is available in their area. PM USA is also using its Marlboro's Rewards program to drive IQOS awareness and value delivery. Smokers can earn mobile rewards points by learning about IQOS and can also redeem their points for discounts on the IQOS device. In June, PM USA plans to open IQOS boutique in the Tysons Corner Mall, which is a center point for the highly populated Northern Virginia Metro area outside of Washington, D.C. 
As a reminder, PM USA plans to expand IQOS into 3 additional metro throughout the year and to expand the availability of Marlboro HeatSticks to geographies covering approximately 25% and of U.S. cigarette volume by year-end. We are making progress in driving awareness and availability of on! and IQOS, while investing in future innovative noncombustible products. And we continue to acquire more tobacco consumer insights to inform our strategies to actively transit smokers to our noncombustible portfolio. 
Our Smokable Products segment continues to support our vision, generating significant cash that can be invested in noncombustible products and return to shareholders. 
Turning to our financial outlook. We reaffirm our 2021 guidance to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $4.49 to $4.62. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. The guidance includes continued investments to support the transition of adult smokers to a noncombustible future. We will continue to monitor various factors that could impact our guidance. 
Our employees continue to drive the success of our businesses. They've risen to the challenge together to deliver results and are supporting each other and their communities. Over the past years, the challenges associated with the pandemic have been compounded by the continued social injustice and in equities that black and brown Americans still face every day. And the Asian American community is hurting as and hateful attacks on Asian skyrocket. We condemn any form of hatred and discrimination against any person. Through our Asian, black and brown employees, we will continue to stand with you and we stand for you. We recently released our report on supporting our people and communities, which details the many ways we're making progress, enhancing our culture and positively impacting our communities. It is part of a series of corporate responsibility progress reports that we are issuing this year, and it is available on altria.com. 
I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on our first quarter results."

Moving to our results. Our tobacco businesses continue to perform well in the first quarter. The Smokeable Products segment delivered over $2.3 billion in adjusted OCI and expanded adjusted OCI margins by 2.2 percentage points to 57.5%. PM USA's revenue growth management framework supported the segment's strong net price realization of 8% for the quarter. 
We continue to be pleased with Marlboro's performance and category leadership. In the first quarter, Marlboro's retail share was 43.1%, an increase of 4/10 versus prior year. We believe that Marlboro is continuing to benefit from smoker preferences for familiar products during disruptive times, and is lapping the year ago comparison quarter where we observed the older consumers coming back to cigarettes from e-vapor. 
In the first quarter, Marlboro's price gap to the lowest effective price cigarette increased to 37%, primarily driven by heavy competitive promotional activity in the branded discount segment. Despite this activity, branded discount share declined by 4/10 in the first quarter as deep discount gained share. The total discount segment retail share was 25.3%, an increase of 1/10 versus the year ago period. In cigars, Black and Mild continued its long-standing leadership in the profitable tip cigar segment. Middleton's reported cigar shipment volume increased over 11% in the first quarter. 
Turning to noncombustibles. Oral Tobacco Products segment, adjusted OCI grew by 3.1%, and adjusted OCI margins declined by 0.9 percentage points to 72.1%. Adjusted OCI results were driven primarily by higher pricing, partially offset by higher investments behind on!. Total reported Oral Tobacco Products segment volume increased 0.6%, driven by on!. When adjusted for trade inventory movements, calendar differences and other factors, segment volume increased by an estimated 0.5%. 
First quarter retail share for the Oral Tobacco Products segment was 48.1%, down 2.3 percentage points due to the continued growth of oral nicotine pouches. Copenhagen continue to be the leading MST brand and on! gained traction in the oral nicotine pouches. 
In alcohol, St. Michelle's first quarter adjusted OCI increased approximately 46% to $19 million, driven primarily by higher pricing and lower costs. And in beer, we recorded $190 million of adjusted equity earnings in the first quarter, which was unchanged from the year ago period, and represents Altria's share of ABI's fourth quarter 2020 results. 
Moving to our equity investment in Cronos. We recorded an adjusted loss of $27 million representing Altria's share of Cronos' fourth quarter 2020 results. We continue to support our investment in Cronos by advocating for a federally legal, regulated and responsible U.S. cannabis market. We joined the recently launched Coalition for Cannabis Policy, Education and Regulation. This coalition is comprised of members across diverse industries and public policy experts who plan to inform the development of comprehensive cannabis policy that prevents underage use, advance of science, creates quality and safety standards and addresses social inequity. 
And finally, on capital allocation, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares, totaling $325 million in the first quarter. We have approximately $1.7 billion remaining under the currently authorized $2 billion share buyback program, which we expect to complete by June 30, 2022. Our balance sheet remains strong. And as of the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.5x. In the first quarter, we executed a series of transactions to take advantage of favorable market conditions to adjust our debt maturity profile and extend the weighted average maturity of our debt. We issued new long-term notes totaling $5.5 billion and repurchased over $5 billion in outstanding long-term notes. In May, we expect to retire $1.5 billion of notes coming due with available cash. 
With that, we'll wrap up. And Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com.

Certainly, as we progress forward, we highlighted that we are seeing mobility for our consumers increase significantly. But then you also have the offsets. You have the government stimulus that just came out, and we'll see how the consumer thinks about that as their mobility has increased and what other areas of discretionary spend, they could use that stimulus towards. So certainly through the first quarter, we saw a continuance. Even though it was a tough comp, a continuance of what we saw at the end of the last year.

But let's just",416,"Yes. I think when you think about the regulatory framework, the 2 topics that have been in the headlines, and look, we expect to have continued headline news in the tobacco industry as you have a new administration that tends to take place. But let's just take them in turn. If you think about menthol, the FDA has been considering this for years. And when you step back from it and you really think about it, we have a common goal, which is to transition the adult cigarette consumer to a noncombustible future. Where we disagree is prohibition just doesn't work. It has unintended consequences and criminalizing menthol has significant consequences. We think a better approach is to have an established marketplace of FDA authorized noncombustible products. We've only heard what you've heard. So certainly, whatever the FDA announces, we'll review what the FDA announces, and we'll engage and and continue to focus on the science and evidence of what would be a multiyear process. I think when you think about lower nicotine in cigarettes, it's very similar. It's something they've been considering for years. We know they're running studies related to this. Again, we don't believe prohibition works because it has so many unintended consequences. The better approach is to have that established portfolio of FDA authorized noncombustible products. In addition to that, we don't think it's practical or feasible from a standpoint of what's been suggested. And so when you look at overall the signs and evidence, and you can see the comments that we submitted to the FDA as they were considering these previously, there are significant hurdles there from a science and evidence base that it has the impact that they have suggested. From an FTT standpoint, I think it remains to be seen. There hasn't been a lot of discussion, as you mentioned, it was a bit of a headline news last week. When you step back from the specifics, it's something that's been introduced before, and it didn't get very far. I think when you think about some of the statements that President Biden has made about not wanting to raise taxes on individuals making less than $400,000 a year. Excise tax increase runs counter to that. I'd just remind you, we have an excellent government affairs team, is ready to engage on all of these topics and our regulatory affairs team as well. So we're ready. But I would caution that we will see, we believe, continued headline news."

We're extremely excited to now have 100% of the economics of on!, both in the U.S. and on a global basis. When you think about the novel oil, I think it's very intuitive that it will interact with the adult dipper from the traditional MST. That consumer is used to putting things in their mouth. I think what has us so excited about on! is its engagement with the adult cigarette consumer. And so as we do always, we run various scenarios, I think, certainly, you can see the adult dipper converting to it. And it depends on how successful we are engaging with the adult cigarette consumer of how big that category can get through time. So we're extremely excited, and we'll be very excited to get past the manufacturing capacity constraint which we expect to do by midyear. I think from a competitive standpoint, you can expect that in new categories as volume grows, the various manufacturers that are participating in the category are trying to capture consumers and have them choose their products and brands. Certainly, through time, I think all companies are in it for profitability. So there will be some competitive activities as volume grows and consumers are at play. And then you would expect for a turn towards profitability."

I think when you think about it, certainly, we've seen, and we try to have some of this available in previous presentations, it tends to have a higher than normal from the MST category interaction with the female cigarette consumers because they just don't appreciate putting tobacco in their mouth.

But from a standpoint of that interaction, I think right now, it's too early to tell, and it's very small when you try to diagnose who's coming over from the cigarette category."

I guess what I'm curious by is if you think about the products that the FDA has approved so far, there's reduced risk products, there's been 2 of them. And it feels like you need to have a larger stable of products and products that consumers are aware of before they could ever really implement significant regulation at the risk of creating unintended consequences. That's obviously my opinion. But I just thought I get your thoughts on that. And I guess with that backdrop, does that influence or define timetable the FDA has to pursue this regulation?

You heard my earlier remarks on an outright prohibition, whether it be menthol or great reduction in nicotine in cigarettes, we believe having that portfolio of noncombustible that's authorized by the FDA and then eventually through the MRTP process is a much better pathway because the consumer that uses conventional cigarettes has already shown an inclination that they want to transition. And so we believe we can get there with the right products and with the insights we have on the consumer, certainly having a regulatory pathway that allows that to happen in the right order, makes perfect sense to us."

During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2020. Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. Please review the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of today's earnings release for various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. 
Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's Board. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. Adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. Descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings release and on our website at altria.com. 
Finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment, refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Billy."

We're off to a strong start to the year and believe our businesses are on track to deliver against their full year plans. Against a challenging comparison, our tobacco businesses performed well in the first quarter, and we continue to make progress advancing our noncombustible product portfolio. 
This morning, we announced another important milestone in the Altria's journey to move beyond smoking. We now have full global ownership of on! oral nicotine pouches as we recently closed transactions to acquire the remaining 20% global interest. We are excited about the opportunity we have with on! to convert smokers, and we have talented teams supporting the global plans for the brand. 
Before discussing our first quarter results in more detail, we would like to honor the memory of Tom Farrell, our late Chairman of the Board. Tom served 13 distinguished years on our Board, offered valuable insights and guidance during his tenure and was a true visionary. We will miss his leadership, contributions and friendship. The Board will appoint a new Chair at its meeting following our Annual Shareholders Meeting in May. 
Let's now turn to our first quarter results. Our first quarter adjusted diluted EPS declined 1.8%, primarily driven by unfavorable timing of interest expense, and a higher adjusted income tax rate. In the Smokeable Product's segment, we continue to execute our strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles, while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro, with funding the growth of noncombustible products. Segment adjusted OCI margins expanded, and Marlboro continued its retail share momentum from the back half of 2020. 
For volumes, reported Smokeable segment domestic cigarette volume declined 12% in the first quarter, reflecting year-over-year trade inventory movements, one fewer shipping day and other factors. When adjusted for these factors, cigarette volume declined by an estimated 3.5%. We believe that in the first quarter of 2020, wholesalers built inventories by approximately 900 million units, driven in part by COVID-19 dynamics, compared with a depletion of approximately 300 million units in the first quarter of 2021. At the industry level, we estimate that first quarter adjusted domestic cigarette volume declined 2%. 
Looking at smoker retail dynamics, we estimated that total cigarette trips in the first quarter remained below pre-pandemic levels. Also, estimated expenditures per trip remained elevated when compared to pre-pandemic levels and were steady sequentially. We are continuing to monitor the impacts from external factors on tobacco consumer purchasing patterns and behavior. In March, the federal government passed a third stimulus package. An increasing number of people became vaccinated and consumability improved sharply. We're keeping a close eye on the tobacco consumer, and we will continue to provide our insights on the underlying factors as the year progresses. 
Moving to our noncombustible products. We are pleased to now have full ownership of on! oral nicotine pouches globally. We completed transactions in December and April to acquire the remaining 20% of the global on! business for approximately $250 million. When we made the initial 80% acquisition in 2019, the oral nicotine pouch category in the U.S. was rapidly growing off of a small base. Subsequently, oral nicotine pouch growth has exceeded our original estimates. 
In the first quarter of 2021, we estimate that retail share for all nicotine pouches was approximately 13% of the total oral tobacco category, double its share in the year ago period. We expect continued growth from the oral nicotine pouch products and estimate that category volume in the U.S. will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 25% over the next 5 years. 
Since 2019, Helix, supported by the enterprise, significantly increased on! manufacturing capacity, broadened retail distribution, grew tobacco consumer awareness and followed PMTAs for the entire product portfolio. Helix achieved an annualized manufacturing capacity of 50 million cans by the end of last year, and as of the end of the first quarter, on! was sold in approximately 93,000 stores. 
In the U.S. market, on!'s momentum continued. In the first quarter, on!'s share of the total oral tobacco category grew significantly to 1.7%. On a 12-month moving basis, in-store selling and providing point-of-sale data, on!'s retail share was 3.1%, an increase of $0.07 from the 2020 full year share. Going forward, we intend to report on!'s share of the total U.S. oral tobacco category as Helix expects to be in stores covering 90% of the industry's oral tobacco volume by midyear. 
Our primary focus continues to be on increasing on!'s growth in the U.S. Internationally, we see potential to strengthen on! in the Swedish market. We also see longer-term prospects in Europe to expand on! and gain consumer feedback on potential noncombustible products for the U.S. To explore these additional opportunities, we have expanded the international on! team. We believe on! presents a compelling noncombustible alternative for smokers and we look forward to supporting their conversion journey. 
Moving to e-vapor. We estimate that total category volume increased 24% versus the year ago period. As a reminder, in Q1 2020, the FDA restricted the sales of all flavored e-vapor products among pod systems with the exception of tobacco and menthol. Sequentially, we estimate that the category volume increased 7% as competitive marketplace activity continued. As a result of these dynamics, JUUL's first quarter retail share of the total e-vapor category decreased to 33%. 
We continue to believe that a responsible e-vapor category, consisting solely of FDA authorized products can play an important role in tobacco hard reduction. As for our JUUL investment, the FTC trial is now scheduled for June of this year, and we remain committed to vigorously defending our investment. 
In heated tobacco, PM USA is continuing to expand IQOS and Marlboro HeatSticks. Beginning this month, HeatSticks are available in retail stores statewide across Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Marlboro HeatSticks retail volume and share continued to grow in the first quarter. In Atlanta stores with distribution, Marlboro HeatSticks retail share of the cigarette category was 1.1%, an increase of 2/10 sequentially. And in Charlotte, HeatSticks retail share was 1%, an increase of 3/10 sequentially. 
Last month, PM USA began selling the IQOS 3 device, which offers a longer battery life and faster recharging as compared to the 2.4 version. The new device is being offered through device and HeatSticks bundles and through the lending program, which has been effective at generating trial and driving purchase. We're encouraged to see that many consumers are upgrading their 2.4 devices, representing approximately 25% of all IQOS 3 device sales in the first quarter. 
Along with geographic expansion, PM USA is increasing the use of its digital platforms like  Marlboro.com and getIQOS.com to engage with smokers and communicate the benefits of IQOS, including the MRTP claim on the IQOS 2.4 system. For Marlboro.com, IQOS content is now available nationwide. Smokers can sign up to receive communications and be notified when IQOS is available in their area. 
PM USA is also using its Marlboro's Rewards program to drive IQOS awareness and value delivery. Smokers can earn Marlboro rewards points by learning about IQOS and can also redeem their points for discounts on the IQOS device. In June, PM USA plans to open IQOS boutique in the Tysons Corner Mall, which is a center point for the highly populated Northern Virginia Metro area outside of Washington, D.C. 
As a reminder, PM USA plans to expand IQOS into 3 additional metro markets throughout the year and to expand the availability of Marlboro HeatSticks to geographies covering approximately 25% of U.S. cigarette volume by year-end. We are making progress in driving awareness and availability of on! and IQOS, while investing in future innovative noncombustible products. And we continue to acquire more tobacco consumer insights to inform our strategies to actively transition smokers to our noncombustible portfolio. 
Our Smokeable Products segment continues to support our vision, generating significant cash that can be invested in noncombustible products and return to shareholders. 
Turning to our financial outlook. We reaffirm our 2021 guidance to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $4.49 to $4.62. This range represents an adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. The guidance includes continued investments to support the transition of adult smokers to a noncombustible future. We will continue to monitor various factors that could impact our guidance. 
Our employees continue to drive the success of our businesses. They've risen to the challenge together to deliver results and are supporting each other and their communities. Over the past years, the challenges associated with the pandemic have been compounded by the continued social injustice and in equities that black and brown Americans still face every day. And the Asian American community is hurting as violent and hateful attacks on Asians skyrocketed. 
We condemn any form of hatred and discrimination against any person. Through our Asian, black and brown employees, we will continue to stand with you and we stand for you. We recently released our report on supporting our people and communities, which details the many ways we're making progress, enhancing our culture and positively impacting our communities. It is part of a series of corporate responsibility progress reports that we are issuing this year, and it is available on altria.com. 
I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on our first quarter results."

Moving to our results. Our tobacco businesses continue to perform well in the first quarter. The Smokeable Products segment delivered over $2.3 billion in adjusted OCI and expanded adjusted OCI margins by 2.2 percentage points to 57.5%. PM USA's revenue growth management framework supported the segment's strong net price realization of 8% for the quarter. 
We continue to be pleased with Marlboro's performance and category leadership. In the first quarter, Marlboro's retail share was 43.1%, an increase of 4/10 versus prior year. We believe that Marlboro is continuing to benefit from smoker preferences for familiar products during disruptive times, and is lapping the year ago comparison quarter where we observed the older consumers coming back to cigarettes from e-vapor. 
In the first quarter, Marlboro's price gap to the lowest effective price cigarette increased to 37%, primarily driven by heavy competitive promotional activity in the branded discount segment. Despite this activity, branded discount share declined by 4/10 in the first quarter as deep discount gained share. The total discount segment retail share was 25.3%, an increase of 1/10 versus the year ago period. In cigars, Black & Mild continued its long-standing leadership in the profitable tipped cigar segment. Middleton's reported cigar shipment volume increased over 11% in the first quarter. 
Turning to noncombustibles. Oral Tobacco Products segment, adjusted OCI grew by 3.1%, and adjusted OCI margins declined by 0.9 percentage points to 72.1%. Adjusted OCI results were driven primarily by higher pricing, partially offset by higher investments behind on!. Total reported Oral Tobacco Products segment volume increased 0.6%, driven by on!. When adjusted for trade inventory movements, calendar differences and other factors, segment volume increased by an estimated 0.5%. 
First quarter retail share for the Oral Tobacco Products segment was 48.1%, down 2.3 percentage points due to the continued growth of oral nicotine pouches. Copenhagen continue to be the leading MST brand and on! gained traction in the oral nicotine pouches. 
In alcohol, Ste. Michelle's first quarter adjusted OCI increased approximately 46% to $19 million, driven primarily by higher pricing and lower costs. And in beer, we recorded $190 million of adjusted equity earnings in the first quarter, which was unchanged from the year ago period, and represents Altria's share of ABI's fourth quarter 2020 results. 
Moving to our equity investment in Cronos. We recorded an adjusted loss of $27 million representing Altria's share of Cronos' fourth quarter 2020 results. We continue to support our investment in Cronos by advocating for a federally legal, regulated and responsible U.S. cannabis market. We joined the recently launched Coalition for Cannabis Policy, Education, and Regulation. This coalition is comprised of members across diverse industries and public policy experts who plan to inform the development of comprehensive cannabis policy that prevents underage use, advance of science, creates quality and safety standards and addresses social inequity. 
And finally, on capital allocation, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares, totaling $325 million in the first quarter. We have approximately $1.7 billion remaining under the currently authorized $2 billion share buyback program, which we expect to complete by June 30, 2022. Our balance sheet remains strong. And as of the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.5x. 
In the first quarter, we executed a series of transactions to take advantage of favorable market conditions to adjust our debt maturity profile and extend the weighted average maturity of our debt. We issued new long-term notes totaling $5.5 billion and repurchased over $5 billion in outstanding long-term notes. In May, we expect to retire $1.5 billion of notes coming due with available cash. 
With that, we'll wrap up. And Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items. Let's open the question-and-answer period. 
Operator, do we have any questions?"

You ask a good one because the market is very fluid, as we mentioned in our remarks. I think when you look at the first quarter, and we provided the 12-month moving decomp, you can see that we still have somewhat of a tailwind, and we believe, as we believed at the end of last year, that is the consumer stay-at-home practices as they had nicotine occasions to their day. 
Certainly, as we progress forward, we highlighted that we are seeing mobility for our consumers increase significantly. But then you also have the offsets. You have the government stimulus that just came out, and we'll see how the consumer thinks about that as their mobility has increased and what other areas of discretionary spend they could use that stimulus towards. 
So certainly, through the first quarter, we saw a continuance. Even though it was a tough comp, a continuance of what we saw at the end of the last year. I think it remains to be seen what trends the consumer has picked up during the COVID pandemic that will remain. And what will revert back to -- and I'll use your phrase to pre-pandemic or normal levels that they had in place prior to the pandemic. But thanks for the question."

I think when you think about the regulatory framework, the 2 topics that have been in the headlines, and look, we expect to have continued headline news in the tobacco industry as you have a new administration that tends to take place. But let's just take them in turn. If you think about menthol, the FDA has been considering this for years. And when you step back from it and you really think about it, we have a common goal, which is to transition the adult cigarette consumer to a noncombustible future. Where we disagree is prohibition just doesn't work. It has unintended consequences and criminalizing menthol has significant consequences. 
We think a better approach is to have an established marketplace of FDA authorized noncombustible products. We've only heard what you've heard. So certainly, whatever the FDA announces, we'll review what the FDA announces, and we'll engage and continue to focus on the science and evidence of what would be a multiyear process. 
I think when you think about lower nicotine in cigarettes, it's very similar. It's something they've been considering for years. We know they're running studies related to this. Again, we don't believe prohibition works because it has so many unintended consequences. The better approach is to have that established portfolio of FDA authorized noncombustible products. 
In addition to that, we don't think it's practical or feasible from a standpoint of what's been suggested. And so when you look at overall the signs and evidence, and you can see the comments that we submitted to the FDA as they were considering these previously, there are significant hurdles there from a science and evidence base that it has the impact that they have suggested. 
From an FET standpoint, I think it remains to be seen. There hasn't been a lot of discussion. As you mentioned, it was a bit of a headline news last week. When you step back from the specifics, it's something that's been introduced before, and it didn't get very far. I think when you think about some of the statements that President Biden has made about not wanting to raise taxes on individuals making less than $400,000 a year. Excise tax increase runs counter to that. I'd just remind you, we have an excellent government affairs team, is ready to engage on all of these topics and our regulatory affairs team as well. So we're ready. But I would caution that we will see, we believe, continued headline news."

We're extremely excited to now have 100% of the economics of on!, both in the U.S. and on a global basis. When you think about the novel oral, I think it's very intuitive that it will interact with the adult dipper from the traditional MST. That consumer is used to putting things in their mouth. I think what has us so excited about on! is its engagement with the adult cigarette consumer. 
And so as we do always, we run various scenarios, I think, certainly, you can see the adult dipper converting to it. And it depends on how successful we are engaging with the adult cigarette consumer of how big that category can get through time. So we're extremely excited, and we'll be very excited to get past the manufacturing capacity constraint which we expect to do by midyear. 
I think from a competitive standpoint, you can expect that in new categories as volume grows, the various manufacturers that are participating in the category are trying to capture consumers and have them choose their products and brands. Certainly, through time, I think all companies are in it for profitability. So there will be some competitive activities as volume grows and consumers are at play and then you would expect for a turn towards profitability."

But from a standpoint of that interaction, I think right now, it's too early to tell, and it's very small when you try to diagnose who's coming over from the cigarette category."

I guess what I'm curious by is if you think about the products that the FDA has approved so far, there's reduced risk products, there's been 2 of them. And it feels like you need to have a larger stable of products and products that consumers are aware of before they could ever really implement significant regulation at the risk of creating unintended consequences. That's obviously my opinion. But I just thought I get your thoughts on that. And I guess with that backdrop, does that influence or define the timetable the FDA has to pursue this regulation?

They just need those products that satisfy them and meet their needs.

I think for the upside, from a total standpoint of growth, I think we're excited about on! because not only is it engaging with the adult dipper, but as I mentioned, also engaging with the adult smoker. So the more successful we are with that, you can see the size of the consumer base that you're able to engage with. I think your question related to international, it's important to remember that on! already had a presence internationally. So we highlighted in our remarks, we're going to certainly pay attention to where it's at in market, make sure that we have the right look and the right products in the marketplace, introduce products that are in the pipeline through time. And then look at what other opportunities we have.

Certainly, we're going to be influenced by always being able to put our best foot forward. Now having the IQOS 3 device approved, having the MRTP claim on the 2.4 system gives us a much better indication and a much better engagement plan with the consumer, but we are learning along the way. I would say the Charlotte launch was more successful based on the learnings we had in Richmond and Atlanta. And so we're going to continue that disciplined approach. But I don't want you to think that we're trying to get these SET agreements with the state legislatures to influence how fast or how we think about the launch, that will not be an influence in how we proceed with the IQOS launch."

Altria delivered outstanding results in the second quarter, thanks to the continued strength of our tobacco businesses and the hard work of employees. Teams have continued their commitment to moving beyond smoking by deepening their understanding of tobacco consumer preferences, expanding the awareness and availability of our smoke-free product portfolio and amplifying our voice on harm reduction within the scientific and public health community. Their passion gives me even greater confidence that we can responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future.
Let's now turn to our business results. Altria grew its second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of 12.8% to $1.23 primarily through the strength of our tobacco businesses. The smokeable products segment continued to deliver on its strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles, while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products.
Marlboro continued to lead the cigarette category, while second quarter adjusted operating company's income grew 11%. For the first half, the segment generated adjusted OCI growth [indiscernible]. In the oral tobacco products segment, Copenhagen continued to lead the MST category and delivered strong profit performance. The oral tobacco products segment grew adjusted OCI by 3.5% in the second quarter and by 3.3% for the first half as strength in MST more than offset investments in support of [indiscernible]. The oil nicotine pouch category continued to grow and Helix remained focused on expanding capacity broadening distribution and driving awareness [indiscernible].
the team has successfully achieved uterine capacity for the current U.S. market and as the category grows, Helix plans to further increase on capacity ahead of expected demand. Additionally, Helix and AGDC broadened on retail distribution to 105,000 retail stores, which represents approximately 80% of U.S. oral tobacco volume and 70% of U.S. cigarette volume. In the second quarter, own retail share of oral tobacco was 2 percentage points, up $0.03 sequentially.
In a heightened competitive environment, we believe Helix has made consistent progress against its 2021 goals, having achieved unconstrained manufacturing capacity increased distribution and nearly doubling on retail share over the first half. Helix deploys a broad suite of marketing tools to continue to build on brand equity and transition smokers. At retail, Helix uses disruptive point-of-sale and trial and awareness generating promotions.
Retail initiatives are complemented by one-to-one communications and digital marketing channels, which we believe provide a more immersive and educational [indiscernible] are tailored based on consumer preferences and insights to better resonate with individual smokers and dippers.
Turning to heated tobacco, PM USA expanded IQOS and Marlboro Heatsticks to retail stores across Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. This 4-state expansion is helping PM USA garner key learnings about scaling new innovative products. Over 2/3 of U.S. cigarette volume is sold through the convenience store channel. So we believe the ability to effectively educate smokers about the IQOS system is critical to the long-term success of the product.
Although early, we're encouraged that nearly half of second quarter IQOS device sales came from convenience stores. This highlights the impact of our sales force and their strong relationships with key retail partners. In line with our strategy to build IQOS in large metro markets, PM USA expanded IQOS and Marlboro Heatsticks to Northern Virginia, its fourth metro market. We believe our commercialization team proved its execution as we move into new metro markets.
In early -- Northern Virginia metro market results, device penetration as a percent of the smoker population has surpassed the performance of the Atlanta and Charlotte rollouts. We've discussed for some time the importance of bringing a strong commercialization package to smokers to help them on their journey. In the Northern Virginia market, we have deployed our full range of flexible marketing tools such as kiosk, mobile units and experts. We also opened an IQOS boutique in the Tysons Corner Mall, which is the center point for the area. We believe the favorable results in Northern Virginia reflect the strategic locations and enhanced execution within these marketing channels, the availability of the IQOS 3 device and built up awareness from the Richmond market.
We previously stated the importance of responsibility and discipline in our IQOS expansion approach. PM USA has been mindful of the pending International Trade Commission case, which may result in a ban on the importation of IQOS into the United States. Due to this uncertainty, PM USA has [indiscernible] of IQOS and Marlboro HeatSticks.
Each quarter, we make progress toward our vision. As we do so, we strengthened the capabilities that we believe are necessary to effectively transition smokers to our current and future innovative product portfolio. These capabilities include a flexible manufacturing system, which allows us to quickly redeploy our highly skilled employees and existing footprint in products, a robust consumer engagement system that includes enhanced data collection, a portfolio of engagement tools and our trade partner relationships and strong regulatory capabilities, including the talent to develop compelling PMTAs for smoke-free products, and the establishment of required post-market surveillance infrastructure.
Tobacco harm reduction must be grounded in sound science, encouraged by reasonable regulation and executed responsibly. We believe it's critical to have transparent and constructive dialogue about the science and evidence supporting tobacco harm reduction with all stakeholders. So far this year, we published -- scientific journals, participated on 4 panels and presented 24 posters and policy conferences.
Unfortunately, not all stakeholders believe that industry participants should be part of these exchanges. Recently, a scientific organization decided to ban industry participation at its annual conference. We believe this is a mistake and that limiting the exchange of scientific research impedes tobacco harm reduction and hurt smokers looking for less harmful products. We will continue to advocate for open and inclusive dialogue among all stakeholders, which we believe is essential to addressing the significant public health opportunity in front of us.
Let's now turn to guidance. With our strong financial performance in the first half, we've raised the lower end of our full year 2021 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $4.56 to $4.62. This range represents a growth rate of 4.5% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. This updated guidance reflects continued confidence in our tobacco businesses, investment in smoke-free products and the expected impact of the recently announced agreement to sell our Ste. Michelle Wine Estates business.
I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results."

In the second quarter, the consumer behaviors we've observed over the past few quarters largely continued.

In the second quarter, the consumer behaviors we've observed over the past few quarters largely continued. Although overall consumer mobility increased, workplace mobility appeared to be relatively unchanged, which we believe contributed to more tobacco usage occasions during the quarter as compared to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, disposable income remained elevated, partially due to the residual effects of the third federal government stimulus package in March.
At retail, we estimate that compared to pre-pandemic levels, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store continued to be depressed, but tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated. We are keeping a close eye on tobacco consumer behaviors, and we will continue the insights on the factors impacting those behaviors as the year progresses.
Moving to our businesses. The smokeable products segment expanded its adjusted OCI margins by 0 percentage points to 58.4% for the second quarter and by 1.5 percentage points to 58% for the first half. This performance was supported by PM USA's revenue growth management framework, which leverages advanced analytics to guide the strategic and efficient allocation of our promotional resources. As a result, PM USA achieved strong net price realization of 8.3% in the second quarter and 8.1% for the first half.
Smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes increased by 1.4% in the second quarter. For the first half, reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 5.3%. When adjusted for calendar differences, trade inventory movements and other factors, second quarter and first half domestic cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 4.5% and 4%, respectively. At the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 5% in the second quarter and by 4% in the first half.
Marlboro sustained the strong retail performance demonstrated in recent quarters and benefited from the overall strength of the premium segment in the second quarter. Marlboro's second quarter retail share of the total cigarette category was up [ 0.1 ] sequentially to 43.2% and up [ 0.5 ] versus the year ago period.
In discount, total segment retail share in the second quarter increased 0.1 year-over-year but declined 0.3 sequentially to 25%. Sequential share losses in both branded and deep discount products drove the contraction as consumers benefited from the federal government's third stimulus package and continued heightened promotional spending among competitive premium brands.
We continue to observe some elevated promotional activity within the branded discount segment during the second quarter. And as a result, price gap to the lowest effective price cigarette [indiscernible] at 37%.
In cigars, Middleton continues to perform well and Black & Mild maintained its leadership position within the profitable tip cigar segment. Reported cigar shipment volume increased by 9.6% in the first half.
Turning to the oral tobacco products segment. Segment adjusted OCI margins decreased to 71.7% for the second quarter and to 71.9% for the first half. We expect oral tobacco products margins to be impacted by increased investments behind on and shifting mix between MST and oral nicotine pouches. We remain extremely pleased with the strong overall margins for the segment.
Total reported oral tobacco products segment volume increased by 1.8% and by 1.2% for the second quarter and first half, respectively. The segment's volume growth was driven by on! which more than offset a moderate to volumes, adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, segment volume increased by an estimated 1% for the second quarter and 0.5% for the first half.
Oral tobacco Products segment retail share for the second quarter declined 2.2 percentage points versus the prior year and sequentially to 47.8% due to the continued growth of the oral nicotine pouch category. As Billy stated, Copenhagen maintained its leadership position in the MST category. And we continue to work diligently to execute our plans to transition smokers to on!.
In e-vapor, total estimated volumes in the second quarter increased 15% versus a year ago and 2% sequentially as a result of heightened competitive activity. The category continues to undergo a transition period as FDA prepares to make market determinations on the millions of PMTAs filed by the September 2020 statutory deadline. We continue to believe that e-vapor products can play an important role in tobacco harm reduction and that a sustainable e-vapor category will be one that consists solely of FDA-authorized products. We expect the category's long-term trajectory to be determined by regulatory decisions, legislative and tax policy and innovation that best addresses smoker and vapor preferences.
In alcohol, we recorded $113 million of pretax adjusted equity earnings from ABI in the second quarter [indiscernible] of approximately 15% from the year-ago period and represents Altria's share of ABI's first quarter 2021 results. In wine, Ste. Michelle's second quarter adjusted OCI increased approximately 80% to $27 million. St. Michelle's adjusted OCI growth was primarily due to higher volumes, including from the flagship Chateau Ste. Michelle brand and luxury brands [indiscernible] as wine consumer preferences trended to more premium products.
3 weeks ago, we announced the definitive agreement to sell our Ste. Michelle Wine Estates business in an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion and the assumption of certain Ste. Michelle liabilities. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year, and we expect to use the net proceeds for additional share repurchases subject to approval by our Board. We believe this transaction demonstrates Altria's continued commitment to value creation for shareholders and to our vision as it allows our management team to maintain its focus on responsibly transitioning adult smokers to a smoke-free future. Ste. Michelle and its talented employees have built an outstanding portfolio of premium wine brands, and we wish them future success.
In our other operating category, we continue to make [indiscernible] of Philip Morris Capital Corporation. As of June 30, the net finance assets balance was $261 million, down $59 million since the end of last year due to rents received and asset sales in the first and second quarters. We expect to continue reducing this balance in 2021 and expect to complete the PMCC wind-down by the end of 2022.
Turning to our equity investment in Cronos. We recorded a pretax loss of $21 million, representing Altria's share of Cronos' first quarter results. In the second quarter, Cronos announced that it had purchased an option to acquire [indiscernible] 10.5% on a fully diluted basis. PharmaCann is one of the largest vertically integrated cannabis companies in the United States. The option exercise will be based upon various factors, including the status of U.S. federal cannabis legalization and regulatory approvals.
In support of our investment in Cronos, we continue to advocate for a federally legal, regulated and responsible U.S. cannabis market. And we're encouraged by the current momentum towards federal legalization.
Next, let's discuss capital allocation. The highly cash-generative nature of our tobacco businesses continues -- contributes to our strong balance sheet. We believe this, in turn, allows us to invest in our vision while rewarding shareholders with cash returns. We were active in the capital markets during the second quarter as we repaid $1.5 billion of notes upon maturity, paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased 6.6 million shares totaling [ $325 million ]. We have $1.35 billion remaining under the current authorized $2 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by June 30, 2022. Because the current program is limited to $2 billion, additional share buybacks in connection with the sale of Ste. Michelle are subject to Board approval.
Moving to corporate responsibility. We disclosed several updates in the ESG section of our release this morning. These updates included following through on our commitment to transparency around Altria's workforce data and publishing our ESG data tables and a report on value chain responsibility. As a reminder, additional corporate responsibility information can be found on altria.com.
With that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventories in the question-and-answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?"

We wanted to let you guys know and our investors know that we're delaying that until we get some certainty around that.
As far as plans, if it should ultimately go against us, and you know the process, I'm sure you're well aware of the process that we will step through related to the actual case. But we're working closely with PMI on contingency plans. I think it's a bit of details of what those come or could be. And so we'll share those when it's appropriate."

I guess what are the implications for cigarette volumes as you think about elasticity relative to other categories? And separately, does that, in any way, influence the ability to raise cigarette prices when you see higher prices elsewhere?"

I mean, I appreciate the fact that you recognize that we had a strong first half I think when you think about the puts and takes or the headwinds, tailwinds, and these could go either way.
I think the major factors that we're going to be watching for impact to volume are really the state home practices of our consumer. Do they decide that -- are they required by their employee to go back to the work site or do they still have stay-at-home practices? I think you've seen various news on unemployment rates and any associated stimulus. How does that play out for the remainder of the year?
I think it's important to keep an eye across category movement. We know that the FDA has a lot of applications in front of them for PMTAs. So we'll see what their decisions are and how they could impact it. But most importantly, it's the consumer purchasing behavior.
As you know, we believe that adding nicotine occasions to their day. And so how do they think about that in this, whether it's a resurgence or vaccination rates or how the vaccine gets rolled out, how does that impact consumer purchasing behavior.
Your question related to pricing is -- and first, I'll talk about the input side. As far as -- we really haven't seen any material inflation impact the input side of our business. As far as decisions that we take into consideration when we make pricing decisions, it's really the economic health of our consumer. How are they feeling? Right now, they still have elevated discretionary income -- It's the brand strength, and you can see [indiscernible] has been performing extremely well, and we are very pleased with is the strength of that brand.
And I think last and most is company objectives and how are we thinking about investing in our innovative product portfolios and expanding that. And we mentioned some of the investment areas earlier. So those are really the factors that go into our pricing decisions."

As far as a delay, I want -- just to be clear on the delay in your question about the 10-year vision. I think when you think about the 10-year vision, it's important to step back and remember it's 10 years out. And so that's a long time. If you just take in where we are today and look back 10 years, whether you think about the industry or Altra itself, there's been significant change in 10 years.
And so we thought it prudent to finish the expansions we were in the midst of, but to delay those. And knowing that we have 10 years, and we know the consumer wants to move -- and we want to have the products that they want to move to.

But you saw earlier this week that the ITC accepted review of the ALG findings and recommendations on certain issues, and that included the patent infringement claims and the scope of remedies. And they will review the benefit to public health.
And so it's a bit different with the ITC. If you think about the factors around IQOS, it's the only inhalable smoke-free product authorized by the FDA. And then authorizing IQOS, the FDA found that the product would benefit the public health. And so we would expect to have a final ITC decision in September or October. And then you remember the process after that is it can be -- it goes to presidential review and that can take up to a period of 60 days after the ITC decision is final. And then any decision from the ITC can be appealed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. And so that will be the process that plays out depending on how things progress."

And we feel good about -- as you saw in the -- you heard in the remarks, the amount of device sales that we had through the C-store channel.

And then based on the data you have on Slide 23 of your presentation, it seems e-cigarettes have also gained 1 percentage point of share.

I think when you think about e-vapor, if I understand the gist of your question, really what's going to impact how e-vapor progresses in the U.S., and we believe it can play a significant role in harm reduction is really 3 things. It's regulatory decisions. And you'll recall, all of the products are with the FDA for their review. It's the legislative and tax policy, how will excise taxes evolve in that space. And to Sal's earlier remarks, innovation, how will companies think about innovating in the future and applying for authorization from the FDA. So those will be the 3 major factors that play. But yes, it is less than what we experienced in 2019."

As far as competitive pricing and worried about what they took or who went first, those are not the factors. I really gave the factors earlier to Pamela. It's economic health of our consumer, its brand strength and company objectives. And so that's the way we think about our pricing decisions in the marketplace. Competitive actions don't factor into that.
I think when you think about our pricing -- and look, I would say -- over 8% both in the quarter and for the first half is pretty nice based on the results we've seen across the entire company here, we're pleased with that. Remember, we have 2 factors that come into our price realization. One is list price, which you're referring to.

To your point, our consumers are more of a 10- to 15-second decision. How do you disrupt them at retail where they're making that purchase decision and really give them the guided trial.
For instance, they built relationships with retail clerks that were smokers previously and walk them through this transition from smoking cigarettes to using the heated tobacco product. And so I think when you think about that, now you have the retail clerk can speak from personal experience to smokers to also disrupt their purchasing decisions.

Altria delivered outstanding results in the second quarter, thanks to the continued strength of our tobacco businesses and the hard work of our highly talented employees. Our teams have continued t",1118,"Thanks, Mac. Good morning and thank you for joining us. 
Altria delivered outstanding results in the second quarter, thanks to the continued strength of our tobacco businesses and the hard work of our highly talented employees. Our teams have continued their commitment to moving beyond smoking by deepening their understanding of tobacco consumer preferences, expanding the awareness and availability of our smoke-free product portfolio and amplifying our voice on harm reduction within the scientific and public health communities. Their passion in pursuit of our vision gives me even greater confidence that we can responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future. 
Let's now turn to our business results. Altria grew its second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of 12.8% to $1.23 primarily through the strength of our tobacco businesses. The smokeable products segment continued to deliver on its strategy of maximizing profitability in combustibles while appropriately balancing investments in Marlboro with funding the growth of smoke-free products.  Marlboro continued to lead the cigarette category while second quarter adjusted operating company's income grew 11%. For the first half, the segment generated adjusted OCI growth of 5.3%. 
In the oral tobacco products segment, Copenhagen continued to lead the MST category and delivered strong profit performance. The oral tobacco products segment grew adjusted OCI by 3.5% in the second quarter and by 3.3% for the first half as strength in MST more than offset investments in support of on!  
The oral nicotine pouch category continued to grow and Helix remained focused on expanding capacity, broadening distribution and driving awareness and trial. The team has successfully achieved unconstrained manufacturing capacity for the current U.S. market. And as the category grows, Helix plans to further increase on capacity ahead of expected demand. 
Additionally, Helix and AGDC broadened on! retail distribution to 105,000 retail stores, which represents approximately 80% of U.S. oral tobacco volume and 70% of U.S. cigarette volume. In the second quarter, on! retail share of oral tobacco was 2 percentage points, up 0.03% sequentially. 
In a heightened competitive environment, we believe Helix has made consistent progress against its 2021 goals, having achieved unconstrained manufacturing capacity, increased distribution and nearly doubling on retail share over the first half. Helix deploys a broad suite of marketing tools to continue to build on brand equity and transition smokers. 
At retail, Helix uses disruptive point-of-sale and trial and awareness generating promotions.  Retail initiatives are complemented by one-to-one communications and digital marketing channels, which we believe provide a more immersive and educational on! experience. These communications are tailored based on consumer preferences and insights to better resonate with individual smokers and dippers.  
Turning to heated tobacco, PM USA expanded IQOS and Marlboro HeatSticks to retail stores across Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. This 4-state expansion is helping PM USA garner key learnings about scaling new, innovative products. 
Over 2/3 of U.S. cigarette volume is sold through the convenience store channel. So we believe the ability to effectively educate smokers about the IQOS system in C stores is critical to the long-term success of the product.  Although early, we're encouraged that nearly half of second quarter IQOS device sales came from convenience stores. This highlights the impact of our sales force and their strong relationships with key retail partners. 
In line with our strategy to build IQOS in large metro markets, PM USA expanded IQOS and Marlboro HeatSticks to Northern Virginia, its fourth metro market. We believe our commercialization team continues to improve its execution as we move into new metro markets.  In early Northern Virginia metro market results, device penetration as a percent of the smoker population has surpassed the performance of the Atlanta and Charlotte rollouts. 
We've discussed for some time the importance of bringing a strong commercialization package to smokers to help them on their journey. In the Northern Virginia market, we have deployed our full range of flexible marketing tools, such as kiosk, mobile units and experts. We also opened an IQOS boutique in the Tysons Corner Mall, which is the center point for the area. We believe the favorable results in Northern Virginia reflect the strategic locations and enhanced execution within these marketing channels, the availability of the IQOS 3 device and built up awareness from the Richmond market.  
We previously stated the importance of responsibility and discipline in our IQOS expansion approach. PM USA has been mindful of the pending International Trade Commission case, which may result in a ban on the importation of IQOS and Marlboro HeatSticks into the United States. Due to this uncertainty, PM USA had delayed further expansion of IQOS and Marlboro HeatSticks.  
Each quarter, we make progress toward our vision. As we do so, we strengthen the capabilities that we believe are necessary to effectively transition smokers to our current and future innovative product portfolio. These capabilities include: a flexible manufacturing system, which allows us to quickly redeploy our highly skilled employees and existing footprint in support of smoke-free products; a robust consumer engagement system that includes enhanced data collection, a portfolio of a smoker engagement tools and our trade partner relationships; and strong regulatory capabilities, including the talent to develop compelling PMTAs for smoke-free products; and the establishment of required post-market surveillance infrastructure. 
Tobacco harm reduction must be grounded in sound science, encouraged by reasonable regulation and executed responsibly. We believe it's critical to have transparent and constructive dialogue about the science and evidence supporting tobacco harm reduction with all stakeholders. So far this year, we published 10 articles and scientific journals, participated on 4 panels and presented 24 posters at scientific and policy conferences. 
Unfortunately, not all stakeholders believe that industry participants should be part of these exchanges. Recently, a scientific organization decided to ban industry participation at its annual conference. We believe this is a mistake and that limiting the exchange of scientific research impedes tobacco harm reduction and hurt smokers looking for less harmful products.  We will continue to advocate for open and inclusive dialogue among all stakeholders, which we believe is essential to addressing the significant public health opportunity in front of us.  
Let's now turn to guidance. With our strong financial performance in the first half, we've raised the lower end of our full year 2021 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in the range of $4.56 to $4.62. This range represents a growth rate of 4.5% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. This updated guidance reflects continued confidence in our tobacco businesses, investment in smoke-free products and the expected impact of the recently announced agreement to sell our Ste. Michelle Wine Estates business.  
I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results."

In the second quarter, the consumer behaviors we've observed over the past few quarters largely continued. Although overall consumer mobility increased, workplace mobility appeared to be relatively unchanged, which we believe contributed",1383,"Thanks, Billy. 
In the second quarter, the consumer behaviors we've observed over the past few quarters largely continued. Although overall consumer mobility increased, workplace mobility appeared to be relatively unchanged, which we believe contributed to more tobacco usage occasions during the quarter as compared to prepandemic levels. Additionally, disposable income remained elevated partially due to the residual effects of the third federal government stimulus package in March.  
At retail, we estimate that compared to prepandemic levels, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store continued to be depressed, but tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated. We are keeping a close eye on tobacco consumer behaviors, and we will continue to provide our insights on the factors impacting those behaviors as the year progresses.  
Moving to our businesses. The smokeable products segment expanded its adjusted OCI margins by 0.6 percentage points to 58.4% for the second quarter and by 1.5 percentage points to 58% for the first half. This performance was supported by PM USA's revenue growth management framework, which leverages advanced analytics to guide the strategic and efficient allocation of our promotional resources. As a result, PM USA achieved strong net price realization of 8.3% in the second quarter and 8.1% for the first half. 
Smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes increased by 1.4% in the second quarter. For the first half, reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 5.3%. When adjusted for calendar differences, trade inventory movements and other factors, second quarter and first half domestic cigarette volumes declined by an estimated 4.5% and 4%, respectively. At the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 5% in the second quarter and by 4% in the first half.  
Marlboro sustained a strong retail performance demonstrated in recent quarters and benefited from the overall strength of the premium segment in the second quarter. Marlboro's second quarter retail share of the total cigarette category was up 1/10 sequentially to 43.2% and up 5/10 versus the year ago period.  
In discount, total segment retail share in the second quarter increased 1/10 year-over-year but declined 3/10 sequentially to 25%. Sequential share losses in both branded and deep discount products drove the contraction as consumers benefited from the federal government's third stimulus package and continued heightened promotional spending among competitive premium brands.  We continue to observe some elevated promotional activity within the branded discount segment during the second quarter. And as a result, Marlboro's price gap to the lowest effective price cigarette remained elevated at 37%. 
In cigars, Middleton continues to perform well and Black & Mild maintained its leadership position within the profitable tipped cigar segment. Reported cigar shipment volume increased by 9.6% in the first half.  
Turning to the oral tobacco products segment. Segment adjusted OCI margins decreased to 71.7% for the second quarter and to 71.9% for the first half. We expect oral tobacco products margins to be impacted by increased investments behind on! and shifting mix between MST and oral nicotine pouches. We remain extremely pleased with the strong overall margins for the segment.  
Total reported oral tobacco products segment volume increased by 1.8% and by 1.2% for the second quarter and first half, respectively. The segment's volume growth was driven by on!, which more than offset a moderate decline in MST volumes. When adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences, segment volume increased by an estimated 1% for the second quarter and 0.5% for the first half.  
Oral tobacco products segment retail share for the second quarter declined 2.2 percentage points versus the prior year and 3/10 sequentially to 47.8% due to the continued growth of the oral nicotine pouch category. As Billy stated, Copenhagen maintained its leadership position in the MST category. And we continue to work diligently to execute our plans to transition smokers to on!  
In e-vapor, total estimated volumes in the second quarter increased 15% versus a year ago and 2% sequentially as a result of heightened competitive activity. The category continues to undergo a transition period as FDA prepares to make market determinations on the millions of PMTAs filed by the September 2020 statutory deadline. We continue to believe that e-vapor products can play an important role in tobacco harm reduction and that a sustainable e-vapor category will be one that consists solely of FDA-authorized products. We expect the category's long-term trajectory to be determined by regulatory decisions, legislative and tax policy and innovation that best addresses smoker and vapor preferences.  
In alcohol, we recorded $113 million of pretax adjusted equity earnings from ABI in the second quarter. This was an increase of approximately 15% from the year ago period and represents Altria's share of ABI's first quarter 2021 results. 
In wine, Ste. Michelle's second quarter adjusted OCI increased approximately 80% to $27 million. Ste. Michelle's adjusted OCI growth was primarily due to higher volumes, including from the flagship Chateau Ste. Michelle brand and luxury brand Stag’s Leap, as wine consumer preferences trended to more premium products.
Three weeks ago, we announced the definitive agreement to sell our Ste. Michelle Wine Estates business in an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion and the assumption of certain Ste. Michelle liabilities. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year, and we expect to use the net proceeds for additional share repurchases, subject to approval by our Board. We believe this transaction demonstrates Altria's continued commitment to value creation for shareholders and to our vision as it allows our management team to maintain its focus on responsibly transitioning adult smokers to a smoke-free future. Ste. Michelle and its talented employees have built an outstanding portfolio of premium wine brands, and we wish them future success.
And in our all other operating category, we continue to make progress on our wind-down of Philip Morris Capital Corporation. As of June 30, the net finance assets balance was $261 million, down $59 million since the end of last year due to rents received and asset sales in the first and second quarters. We expect to continue reducing this balance in 2021 and expect to complete the PMCC wind-down by the end of 2022.
Turning to our equity investment in Cronos. We recorded a pretax loss of $21 million, representing Altria's share of Cronos' first quarter results. In the second quarter, Cronos announced that it had purchased an option to acquire an ownership stake in PharmaCann of approximately 10.5% on a fully diluted basis. PharmaCann is one of the largest vertically integrated cannabis companies in the United States. The option exercise will be based upon various factors, including the status of U.S. federal cannabis legalization and regulatory approvals.  In our -- in support of our investment in Cronos, we continue to advocate for a federally legal, regulated and responsible U.S. cannabis market. And we're encouraged by the current momentum towards federal legalization.
Next, let's discuss capital allocation. The highly cash-generative nature of our tobacco businesses continues -- contributes to our strong balance sheet. We believe this, in turn, allows us to invest in our vision while rewarding shareholders with cash returns. We were active in the capital markets during the second quarter as we repaid $1.5 billion of notes upon maturity, paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased 6.6 million shares totaling $325 million. We have $1.35 billion remaining under the current authorized $2 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by June 30, 2022. Because the current program is limited to $2 billion, additional share buybacks in connection with the sale of Ste. Michelle are subject to Board approval.  
Moving to corporate responsibility. We disclosed several updates in the ESG section of our release this morning. These updates included following through on our commitment to transparency around Altria's workforce data and publishing our ESG data tables and a report on value chain responsibility. As a reminder, additional corporate responsibility information can be found on altria.com.  
With that, we'll wrap up, and Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items.

It was just beyond that where we had previously announced by the end of the year, we'd be in geographies representing 25% of cigarette volume. We wanted to let you guys know and our investors know that we're delaying that until we get some certainty around that.
As far as plans if it should ultimately go against us, and you know the process, I'm sure you're well aware of the process that we will step through related to the actual case. But we're working closely with PMI on contingency plans. I think it's a bit too early to share the details of what those contingency plans are or could be.

And then I wanted to ask about how you're thinking about industry growth in the second half of the year and kind of discuss the puts and takes that might influence the category relative to the performance in the first half. 
And in relation to that, we're seeing an inflationary pricing environment with companies across the CPG space intending on raising prices.  I guess what are the implications for cigarette volumes as you think about price elasticity relative to other categories? And separately, does that, in any way, influence the ability to raise cigarette prices when you see higher prices elsewhere?"

I think when you think about -- and I refer to cigarette volume, I know you said industry volume, so I'm assuming that's what you're talking about. I mean I appreciate the fact that you recognize that we had a strong first half.  
I think when you think about the puts and takes or the headwinds, tailwinds, and these could go either way.  I think the major factors that we're going to be watching for impact to volume are really the stay-at-home practices of our consumer. Do they decide that -- are they required by their employee to go back to the work site or do they still have stay-at-home practices? I think you've seen various news on unemployment rates and any associated stimulus. How does that play out for the remainder of the year?
I think it's important to keep an eye across category movement. We know that the FDA has a lot of applications in front of them for PMTAs. So we'll see what their decisions are and how they could impact it. But most importantly, it's the consumer purchasing behavior.  As you know, we believe they're adding nicotine occasions to their day. And so how do they think about that in this, whether it's a resurgent or vaccination rates or how the vaccine gets rolled out, how does that impact consumer purchasing behavior?
Your question related to pricing is -- and first, I'll talk about the input side. As far as -- we really haven't seen any material inflation impact the input side of our business. As far as decisions that we take into consideration when we make pricing decisions, it's really the economic health of our consumer. How are they feeling? Right now, they still have elevated discretionary income. It's the brand strength, and you can see Marlboro's been performing extremely well, and we are very pleased with its -- the strength of that brand.
And I think last and utmost is company objectives and how are we thinking about investing in our innovative product portfolios and expanding that. And we mentioned some of the investment areas earlier. So those are really the factors that go into our pricing decisions."

As far as the delay, I want -- just to be clear on the delay and your question about the 10-year vision. I think when you think about the 10-year vision, it's important to step back and remember it's 10 years out. And so that's a long time. If you just take in -- where we are today and look back 10 years, whether you think about the industry or Altria itself, there's been significant change in 10 years.  
And so we thought it prudent to finish the expansions we were in the midst of, but to delay those and knowing that we have 10 years, and we know the consumer wants to move and we want to have the products that they want to move to. And so certainly, there could be bumps in the road, but we think we have a great plan and feel confident about achieving our 10-year vision."

I think when you think about our approach in novel oral, we have been behind a manufacturing capacity constraints and we've been somewhat limited.

They can fully engage with consumers with one-to-one in digital channels.  And so we look forward to being able to turn them loose, which they are now, and have them disrupting the marketplace. 
I think whenever you think about a new category, you have to think about there is going to be competitive activity, and we've seen it in this space. And so you're going to want to dislodge those consumers. But at some point in time, that typically settles down, even if you take it outside of tobacco. And so we feel very good about being able to achieve tobacco-like margins in the future. Right now, we're focused on consumer engagement and making them aware of our on! product in the marketplace."

So when you think about the ITC -- just to level set on where we're at in that process. So you think about that in May, we had the administrative law judge found in favor of the 2 of the plaintiff's patent challenges. And so they recommended that the administrative law judge recommended the importation for ban on the IQOS system. But you saw earlier this week that the ITC accepted review of the ALJ findings and recommendations on certain issues, and that included the patent infringement claims and the scope of remedies, and they will review the benefit to public health.
And so it's a bit different with the ITC. If you think about the factors around IQOS, it's the only inhalable, smoke-free product authorized by the FDA. And in authorizing IQOS, the FDA found that the product would benefit the public health. And so we would expect to have a final ITC decision in September or October. And then you remember the process after is it can be -- it goes to presidential review and that can take up to a period of 60 days after the ITC decision is final. And then any decision from the ITC can be appealed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. And so that will be the process that plays out depending on how things progress."

You talked about moving resources to Northern Virginia. I just want to understand that concept.

But I want to understand kind of how you looked at that and then how you redeployed resources in Northern Virginia from some of those initial markets."

And let me take a couple of things that went into that consideration. I think first and foremost, you remember, we had flexible marketing tools at our disposal, whether you consider it kiosks or mobile units. And so you move those from launch market to launch market. 
I think the other thing that's important to remember is we've always said we wanted to put our best commercialization foot forward. And as we got through to Charlotte, remember when we first launched Charlotte, we had the 2.4 device that did not have an MRTP authorization nor did we have authorization on 3.0.  
And so as you move into a market, you're going to put your best foot forward, we feel like that is the right package. And I think you've seen the results from the learnings as well as those -- both version 3 and the MRTP authorization in Northern Virginia.  And so it doesn't mean we won't go back and relaunch in some of those markets with those added benefits to the consumer and consumer engagement, but we thought it was prudent to move that.
And then the last note is as you move from densely populated areas to a fully expanded across the state, you evolve your commercialization practice. And we know to launch across the total U.S., we're going to have to have that C-store experience. And so it's perfecting that. And we feel good about -- as you saw in the -- you heard in the remarks, the amount of device sales that we had through the C-store channel. If you step back and just look in the second quarter, volume -- consumer takeaway overall volume was up 40%. And so I would consider that a great achievement."

So the additional cost category movement is only minus 0.3% over the last 12 months. And we know that oral nicotine pouches have gained about 1 percentage point of share. 
And then based on the data you have on Slide 23 of your presentation, it seems e-cigarettes have also gained 1 percentage point of share. So that would imply that the cross-category movement has like -- it has significantly reduced versus what we saw in 2018, 2019. Is that a correct way of looking at this data?"

When you think about it, remember, in secular decline, to your point, about 1% was cross category.

And so you can see in the chart that as of 6/30/21, on a 12 months ended, it was 0.3% above that. And so that is really what is the impact to the cigarette industry from cross-category movement and it includes novel oral, it includes e-vapor.
I think when you think about e-vapor, if I understand the gist of your question, really what's going to impact how e-vapor progresses in the U.S., and we believe it can play a significant role in harm reduction, is really 3 things. It's regulatory decisions. And you'll recall, all of the products are with the FDA for their review. It's the legislative and tax policy, how will excise taxes evolve in that space. And to Sal's earlier remarks, innovation, how will companies think about innovating in the future and applying for authorization from the FDA. So those will be the 3 major factors that play. But yes, it is less than what we experienced in 2019."

Certainly, during the pandemic, and we've highlighted to you guys and investors is that we saw consumers add nicotine occasions to their day, which we believe was stay-at-home practices and some of those factors.

As far as competitive pricing and worries about what they took or who went first, those are not the factors. I really gave the factors earlier to Pamela. It's economic health of our consumer, its brand strength and company objectives. And so that's the way we think about our pricing decisions in the marketplace. Competitive actions don't factor into that.
I think when you think about our pricing and look, I would say 8 point -- over 8% both in the quarter and for the first half is pretty nice based on the results we've seen across the entire company here. We're pleased with that. Remember, we have 2 factors that come into our price realization. One is list price, which you're referring to.

But I think when you think about what AGDC has been able to do is really look at our retailers think about how to display the product at retail. To your point, our consumers are more of a 10- to 15-second decision. How do you disrupt them at retail where they're making that purchase decision and really give them the guided trial.
For instance, they built relationships with retail clerks that were smokers previously and walked them through this transition from smoking cigarettes to using the heated tobacco product. And so I think when you think about that, now you have the retail clerk can speak from personal experience to smokers to also disrupt their purchasing decisions. And so it's really still about the guided trial. It is about engagement through those channels, but it's disrupting them right at the point of purchase."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, Altria continued to balance maximizing profitability from our core tobacco businesses with investing to realize a vision of responsibly leading the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future. Our tobacco business has performed well against difficult year-over-year comparisons, and we are encouraged by the significant retail share growth from On in the third quarter. We also continue to reward shareholders with a strong and growing dividend, and announced today the expansion of our share repurchase program to $3.5 billion. Both Altria and the tobacco industry are evolving and with transformation comes opportunity. It also brings uncertainty and adversity, including the recently International Trade Commission decision related to IQOS. We knew our journey to a smoke-free future would not be easy. -- but our determined and talented employees have demonstrated they are up to the challenge. The pursuit of our vision is not based on a single brand or product platform. Our vision is built on our understanding of tobacco consumers, their capabilities as a leading tobacco company and a portfolio of smoke-free brands and product formats. We make progress through the performance of our current smoke-free portfolio and advancements in regulatory sciences, data analytics and a robust consumer engagement system. Our tobacco businesses remain strong, and our vision keeps us focused and guides us forward. 
Let's now turn to our business results. Altria grew its third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share, 2.5% despite a backdrop of challenging comparisons and unfavorable year-over-year trade inventory movement. For the first 9 months of the year, adjusted EPS grew 4.5%, primarily driven by the strong financial performance of our tobacco businesses and higher ABI adjusted earnings. Our smokeable products segment continues to generate significant cash and return -- return to shareholders in fuel or vision. Third quarter adjusted operating company's income decreased 2.2%, reflecting the impact of trade inventory swings, but grew 2.6% to $7.9 billion for the first 9 months, while Marlboro remained strong. 
The oral tobacco products segment continued to deliver robust profit margins, while Copenhagen maintained its leadership position. In all nicotine pouches, we have accelerated investment behind Helix and believe that the on! portfolio is well positioned in this fast-growing category. We're advancing the sophistication of our analytics across our companies. The Helix team uses this capability to evaluate the impact of promotional tools on tobacco consumers and understand what actions effectively drive trial, repeat purchase and adoption. On! retail share of oil tobacco increased a full share point sequentially, reaching 3 share points for the third quarter and nearly tripling since the end of last year. These strong results were driven by increased smoker trial and repeat purchase from existing on! consumers. We're excited by the performance of on! during the first 9 months of the year and believe consumer insights disruptive retail executions and consumer engagement will continue to fuel its growth. 
Last year, we submitted premarket tobacco applications to the FDA for the entire on! portfolio. While the FDA has made substantial progress in reviewing millions of PMTAs they received, our applications for on! are still pending. A week ago, the FDA authorized the marketing of 4 of our oral nicotine products, FervDiscs and Burches in the flavors of green met and blue mint and determined that the marketing of these products is appropriate for the protection of public health. This is the first flavored product authorization issued by the FDA for newly deemed tobacco products. While our Verv products are not currently in market, we believe the learnings we gained from developing our Verb submission were critical in filing compelling and timely submissions for an which we completed in only 9 months after closing the on! transaction. We're also actively working on modified risk product applications for on!. We believe an MRTP would be an impactful point of differentiation for the brand and an important tool in educating and ultimately transitioning smokers to less harmful products. 
In e-vapor, we estimate that the total category volume increased 17% versus the year ago period and increased 2% sequentially as a result of continued elevated levels of competitive activity. While we had hoped for clarity on the category's outlook as manufacturers receive PMTA decisions, the future of e-vapor is still uncertain. For most of the leading e-vapor products, the applications are still pending, including those submitted by JUUL. 
Moving forward, we expect e-vapor volume trends to be influenced by regulatory activity, which has the potential to impact the degree of cross-category movement. Recently, the CDC published an update from their National Youth Tobacco survey. While caution is warranted when comparing results year-over-year due to the impact of the pandemic on the surveys methodology, underage e-vapor use, including use of JUUL, shows continued signs of decline. We're encouraged by the progress, but more still needs to be done, and we remain committed to continuing our work to drive down underage use. 
Turning to heated tobacco. The IQOS team continued to refine its go-to-market approach for new and innovative products. Across the 4 states where IQOS is available, total Marlboro HeatSticks volume continue to grow, with repeat purchase accounting for approximately 85% of sales. According to IQOS consumers, our IQOS experts program played a significant role in their repeat purchases. The program offers smokers personalized support and encouragement through consistent tailored engagements. In the Northern Virginia lead market device penetrations as a percent of the smoker population continue to exceed the performance of previous rollouts. In the last 4 weeks of the third quarter, Heatsticks achieved a cigarette category retail share of 1.8% in Northern Virginia stores with distributions. As we mentioned earlier, the International Trade Commission recently imposed an importation ban and issued season desist orders on IQOS, Mobile HeatSticks and infringing components. We're disappointed in this decision as IQOS is the only inhalable tobacco product to have received FDA authorization as a modified risk tobacco product. The ITC's importation ban will make the product unavailable for all consumers have switched to IQOS, reduce the options for over 20 million smokers looking for alternatives to cigarettes and ultimately is detrimental to public health. 
We continue to believe the plaintiff patents are invalid and that IQOS does not infringe on those patents. The ITC's decision is currently under 60-day review by the administration's U.S. Trade Representative. In the event that the administration does not reject the decision, we're preparing to comply with the order. We've been focused on our contingency plans surrounding sales and distribution and have been in communication with PMI on their domestic manufacturing plans. We view the ITC's decision as a frustrating obstacle, but we are not deterred from the work required to realize our vision. We remain committed to the heated tobacco category and believe it can play an important role in transitioning smokers to a smoke-free future. Going forward, we expect to apply the knowledge and capabilities we gained from introducing and responsibly marketing a brand-new product category. For example, we've learned how to blend behavioral science, data insights and consumer engagement to support smokers on their smoke-free journey, leverage MRTPs to educate consumers on the benefits of reduced risk products and establish a robust post-market surveillance system as required to monitor FDA-authorized products. 
I'm optimistic about the future for tobacco harm reduction in the U.S. We have an unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in shifting millions of smokers away from cigarettes if we follow the science and foster innovation with the support of reasonable regulation. 
Let's turn to our financial outlook. We're raising the lower end of our full year 2021 guidance and now expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $4.58 and to $4.62. This range represents a growth rate of 5% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. I'd also like to welcome Mark Connolly and Matt Davis to our Board of Directors as announced this morning. They bring significant combined expertise in operations, business strategy, consumer insights, and public policy and will be tremendous assets as we pursue our vision. 
I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results."

I'd like to begin by discussing the macroeconomic factors we believe influence the tobacco consumer. We believe rising gas prices, inflation and the conclusion of COVID-19 relief programs led to a decrease in disposable income versus the previous quarter. In addition, increased consumer mobility offer consumers more options for their discretionary spending. At retail, trends were unchanged sequentially. We estimate that compared to pre-pandemic levels, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store continue to be depressed, but tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated. We continue to monitor tobacco consumer behaviors and will provide our insights on the factors impacting those behaviors as we move forward. 
Moving to our businesses. The smokable products segment expanded its adjusted OCI margins to 58%, an increase of 0.5 percentage point for the third quarter and more than 1 percentage point for the first 9 months. This performance was supported by strong net price realization of 11.3% in the third quarter and 9.2% for the first 9 months. Smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 12.9% in the third quarter and 8% in the first 9 months. We believe reported volumes reflect an absolute wholesale inventory swing of 1.5 billion sticks as wholesalers build inventory in the third quarter of last year but depleted inventories this quarter. When adjusted for trade inventory movement, calendar differences and other factors, domestic cigarette volumes for the third quarter and first 9 months declined by an estimated 7% and 5%, respectively. At the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 6.5% in the third quarter and by 5% in the first 9 months. 
Marlboro remains strong and resilient despite a widening price gap and a dynamic macroeconomic environment. In the third quarter, Marlboro retail share of the total cigarette category was unchanged, both sequentially and versus the year ago period at 43.2%. And in discount, total segment retail share in the third quarter continued to fluctuate, increasing 0.3 percentage points sequentially to 25.3%. In cigars, we continue to believe Black & Mild is the most profitable brand in the large mass machine-made cigar category. Reported cigar shipment volume increased by 2.7% in the first 9 months of 2021. 
Turning to the oral tobacco products segment. Adjusted OCI and adjusted OCI margins contracted for the third quarter and first 9 months primarily due to increased spending behind on! and shifting mix between MST and oral nicotine pouches. We're pleased with the strong overall margins for the segment and continue to be excited about the opportunity for on! in the oral nicotine pouch category. Total reported oral tobacco products segment volume decreased by 3.8% for the third quarter and by 0.5% for the first 9 months. When adjusted for trade inventory movement in calendar differences, segment volume decreased by an estimated 2.5% for the third quarter and 0.5% for the first 9 months. Oral Tobacco Products segment retail share for the third quarter was sequentially unchanged as strong share gains for on! offset declines in MST. The segment declined 2.2 percentage points versus the third quarter last year due to the continued growth of the oral nicotine pouch category. 
Looking ahead, we're monitoring several factors as we move towards the end of this year and into the next. Many industries are experiencing rising input costs and supply chain disruptions, thanks to the foresight and hard work of our procurement team, we are successfully managing through these issues without significant impact to date. For Altria, we foresee modest inflation in the year ahead. This could have some impact on the input costs and the inflation adjustment to our master settlement agreement payments. However, our tobacco businesses remain strong, and we are confident in our ability to manage through short-term economic challenges. As a reminder, we contemplate an array of scenarios in our financial forecast and intend to incorporate these factors into our 2022 EPS guidance, which we expect to provide in January. 
Turning to our investment in ABI. The 5-year lockup on our restricted shares expired earlier this month. We've been an investor in the beer category since 1970 and our original investment of $230 million has served us extremely well over the past half century. In fact, since 2003, our beer investment has served as a diverse income stream that contributed over $12 billion of adjusted equity earnings, contributed over $10 billion of cash from both dividends and 2016 merger proceeds and strengthened our balance sheet. We've performed rigorous analyses regarding the ABI investment. First, as part of the preparation of our third quarter financial statements; and second, in anticipation of the expiration of the lockup. 
In preparing our third quarter financials, we assessed the latest outlook for ABI's business under the applicable accounting guidance and recorded an impairment to the asset. While we continue to believe ABI's share price will recover, we now do not expect it to fully recover to its carrying value as soon as previously expected. As a result, we have written our investment in ABI down to its September 30 market value of $11.2 billion. 
Regarding our decisions around the lockup, we view our ABI stake as a financial investment, and our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. We consider several factors as we analyze the investment, including the strategic rationale of continuing as a long-term investor in the beer category. ABI's share price, which has declined by more than 30% since October 2019, due in large part to impacts of the COVID pandemic. Our expectations of ABI's business, alternative uses of capital and tax considerations. We have determined that selling our ABI investment at this time would not maximize long-term shareholder value. Therefore, we continue to plan to maintain our ABI investment. We continue to have confidence in ABI's long-term strategies, premium global brands, experienced management team and capability to successfully navigate near-term challenges. We will continue to monitor and evaluate market conditions and the analytical factors mentioned previously on a regular basis, consistent with our goal of maximizing the long-term value of this investment for our shareholders. We remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our significant capital returns, which we demonstrated in the third quarter by paying approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and raising the dividend for the 56th time in 52 years, selling St. Michelle Wine Estates and expanding our share repurchase program from $2 billion to $3.5 billion and repurchasing 6.7 million shares totaling $322 million. We have approximately $2.5 billion remaining under the newly expanded $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by December 31, 2022. 
With that, we'll wrap up. And Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items.

I think when you think about pricing, it's important to remember, our price realization is really 2 major components. The first component everybody is all aware of and talks about regularly, which are list price increases, and that's across our portfolios. When you think about the other component, it's the -- and we've referred to it before as the investments we made around advanced analytics and the amount of data we get from retail. And with that advanced analytics, some companies refer to it as revenue growth management but it's really taken the retail promotions we put in the marketplace for consumers and really making it more efficient and as effective or maybe at times more effective than  without the revenue growth management. 
So that's allowing us to increase the price realization. I think that's what you experienced through the quarter and through the first 9 months. From a standpoint of L&M, look, we've increased our profitability on L&M. We have seeded some share there, but we're a premium-focused company. We like the results that we've experienced in L&M. And I think you see with the advanced analytics, mobile has been rock solid for, call it, now 5 to 6 quarters."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, Altria continued to balance maximizing profitability from our core tobacco businesses with investing to realize a vision of responsibly leading the transition of adult ers to a smoke-free future. Our tobacco business has performed well against difficult year-over-year comparisons, and we are encouraged by the significant retail share growth from on! in the third quarter.
We also continue to reward shareholders with a strong and growing dividend and announced today the expansion of our share repurchase program to $3.5 billion. Both Altria and the tobacco industry are evolving and with transformation comes opportunity. It also brings uncertainty and adversity, including the recently International Trade Commission decision related to IQOS. We knew our journey to a smoke-free future would not be easy, but our determined and talented employees have demonstrated they are up to the challenge.
The pursuit of our vision is not based on a single brand or product platform. Our vision is built on our understanding of tobacco consumers, their capabilities as a leading tobacco company and a portfolio of smoke-free brands and product formats. We make progress through the performance of our current smoke-free portfolio and advancements in regulatory sciences, data analytics and a robust consumer engagement system. Our tobacco businesses remain strong, and our vision keeps us focused and guides us forward.
Let's now turn to our business results. Altria grew its third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share, 2.5% despite a backdrop of challenging comparisons and unfavorable year-over-year trade inventory movement. For the first 9 months of the year, adjusted EPS grew 4.5%, primarily driven by the strong financial performance of our tobacco businesses and higher ABI adjusted earnings. Our smokeable products segment continues to generate significant cash and return -- return to shareholders in fuel or vision. Third quarter adjusted operating company's income decreased 2.2%, reflecting the impact of trade inventory swings, but grew 2.6% to $7.9 billion for the first 9 months, while Marlboro remained strong.
The oral tobacco product segment continued to deliver robust profit margins, while Copenhagen maintained its leadership position. In all nicotine pouches, we have accelerated investment behind Helix and believe that the on! portfolio is well positioned in this fast-growing category. We're advancing the sophistication of our analytics across our companies. The Helix team uses this capability to evaluate the impact of promotional tools on tobacco consumers and understand what actions effectively drive trial, repeat purchase and adoption.
On! retail share of oral tobacco increased a full share point sequentially, reaching 3 share points for the third quarter and nearly tripling since the end of last year. These strong results were driven by increased smoker trial and repeat purchase from existing on! consumers. We're excited by the performance of on! during the first 9 months of the year and believe consumer insights, disruptive retail executions and consumer engagement will continue to fuel its growth.
Last year, we submitted premarket tobacco applications to the FDA for the entire on! portfolio. While the FDA has made substantial progress in reviewing millions of PMTAs they received, our applications for on! are still pending. A week ago, the FDA authorized the marketing of 4 of our oral nicotine products, Verve discs and Verve chews in the flavors of green mint and blue mint and determined that the marketing of these products is appropriate for the protection of public health.
This is the first flavored product authorization issued by the FDA for newly deemed tobacco products. While our Verve products are not currently in market, we believe the learnings we gained from developing our Verve submission were critical in filing compelling and timely submissions for on!, which we completed in only 9 months after closing the on! transaction.
We're also actively working on modified risk product applications for on!. We believe an MRTP would be an impactful point of differentiation for the brand and an important tool in educating and ultimately transitioning smokers to less harmful products.
In e-vapor, we estimate that the total category volume increased 17% versus the year ago period and increased 2% sequentially as a result of continued elevated levels of competitive activity. While we had hoped for clarity on the category's outlook as manufacturers receive PMTA decisions, the future of e-vapor is still uncertain. For most of the leading e-vapor products, the applications are still pending, including those submitted by JUUL.  
Moving forward, we expect e-vapor volume trends to be influenced by regulatory activity, which has the potential to impact the degree of cross-category movement. Recently, the CDC published an update from their National Youth Tobacco Survey. While caution is warranted when comparing results year-over-year due to the impact of the pandemic on the surveys methodology, underage e-vapor use, including use of JUUL, shows continued signs of decline. We're encouraged by the progress, but more still needs to be done, and we remain committed to continuing our work to drive down underage use.
Turning to heated tobacco. The IQOS team continued to refine its go-to-market approach for new and innovative products. Across the 4 states where IQOS is available, total Marlboro HeatSticks volume continue to grow, with repeat purchase accounting for approximately 85% of sales. According to IQOS consumers, our IQOS experts program played a significant role in their repeat purchases. The program offers smokers personalized support and encouragement through consistent tailored engagements.
In the Northern Virginia lead market device penetrations as a percent of the smoker population continue to exceed the performance of previous rollouts. In the last 4 weeks of the third quarter, Marlboro HeatSticks achieved a cigarette category retail share of 1.8% in Northern Virginia stores with distributions.
As we mentioned earlier, the International Trade Commission recently imposed an importation ban and issued season desist orders on IQOS, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components. We're disappointed in this decision as IQOS is the only inhalable tobacco product to have received FDA authorization as a modified risk tobacco product. The ITC's importation ban will make the product unavailable for all consumers have switched to IQOS, reduce the options for over 20 million smokers looking for alternatives to cigarettes and ultimately is detrimental to public health.
We continue to believe the plaintiff’s patents are invalid and that IQOS does not infringe on those patents. The ITC's decision is currently under 60-day review by the administration's U.S. Trade Representative. In the event that the administration does not reject the decision, we're preparing to comply with the order. We've been focused on our contingency plans surrounding sales and distribution and have been in communication with PMI on their domestic manufacturing plans. We view the ITC's decision as a frustrating obstacle, but we are not deterred from the work required to realize our vision. We remain committed to the heated tobacco category and believe it can play an important role in transitioning smokers to a smoke-free future.
Going forward, we expect to apply the knowledge and capabilities we gained from introducing and responsibly marketing a brand-new product category. For example, we've learned how to blend behavioral science, data insights and consumer engagement to support smokers on their smoke-free journey, leverage MRTPs to educate consumers on the benefits of reduced risk products and establish a robust post-market surveillance system as required to monitor FDA-authorized products.
I'm optimistic about the future for tobacco harm reduction in the U.S. We have an unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in shifting millions of smokers away from cigarettes if we follow the science and foster innovation with the support of reasonable regulation.
Let's turn to our financial outlook. We're raising the lower end of our full year 2021 guidance and now expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in a range of $4.58 to $4.62. This range represents a growth rate of 5% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. I'd also like to welcome Marj Connelly and Matt Davis to our Board of Directors as announced this morning. They bring significant combined expertise in operations, business strategy, consumer insights, and public policy and will be tremendous assets as we pursue our vision.
I'll now turn it over to Sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results."

I'd like to begin by discussing the macroeconomic factors we believe influence the tobacco consumer. We believe rising gas prices, inflation and the conclusion of COVID-19 relief programs led to a decrease in disposable income versus the previous quarter. In addition, increased consumer mobility offer consumers more options for their discretionary spending.
At retail, trends were unchanged sequentially. We estimate that compared to pre-pandemic levels, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store continue to be depressed, but tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated. We continue to monitor tobacco consumer behaviors and will provide our insights on the factors impacting those behaviors as we move forward.
Moving to our businesses. The smokable products segment expanded its adjusted OCI margins to 58%, an increase of 0.5 percentage point for the third quarter and more than 1 percentage point for the first 9 months. This performance was supported by strong net price realization of 11.3% in the third quarter and 9.2% for the first 9 months.
Smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 12.9% in the third quarter and 8% in the first 9 months. We believe reported volumes reflect an absolute wholesale inventory swing of 1.5 billion sticks as wholesalers build inventory in the third quarter of last year, but depleted inventories this quarter.
When adjusted for trade inventory movement, calendar differences and other factors, domestic cigarette volumes for the third quarter and first 9 months declined by an estimated 7% and 5%, respectively. At the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 6.5% in the third quarter and by 5% in the first 9 months.
Marlboro remains strong and resilient despite a widening price gap in a dynamic macroeconomic environment. In the third quarter, Marlboro retail share of the total cigarette category was unchanged, both sequentially and versus the year ago period at 43.2%. And in discount, total segment retail share in the third quarter continued to fluctuate, increasing 0.3 percentage points sequentially to 25.3%.
In cigars, we continue to believe Black & Mild is the most profitable brand in the large mass machine-made cigar category. Reported cigar shipment volume increased by 2.7% in the first 9 months of 2021.
Turning to the oral tobacco products segment. Adjusted OCI and adjusted OCI margins contracted for the third quarter and first 9 months primarily due to increased spending behind on! and shifting mix between MST and oral nicotine pouches. We're pleased with the strong overall margins for the segment and continue to be excited about the opportunity for on! in the oral nicotine pouch category.
Total reported oral tobacco products segment volume decreased by 3.8% for the third quarter and by 0.5% for the first 9 months. When adjusted for trade inventory movement in calendar differences, segment volume decreased by an estimated 2.5% for the third quarter and 0.5% for the first 9 months.
Oral tobacco products segment retail share for the third quarter was sequentially unchanged as strong share gains for on! offset declines in MST. The segment declined 2.2 percentage points versus the third quarter last year due to the continued growth of the oral nicotine pouch category.
Looking ahead, we're monitoring several factors as we move towards the end of this year and into the next. Many industries are experiencing rising input costs and supply chain disruptions. Thanks to the foresight and hard work of our procurement team, we are successfully managing through these issues without significant impact to date.
For Altria, we foresee modest inflation in the year ahead. This could have some impact on the input costs and the inflation adjustment to our Master Settlement Agreement payments. However, our tobacco businesses remain strong, and we are confident in our ability to manage through short-term economic challenges. As a reminder, we contemplate an array of scenarios in our financial forecast and intend to incorporate these factors into our 2022 EPS guidance, which we expect to provide in January.
Turning to our investment in ABI. The 5-year lockup on our restricted shares expired earlier this month. We've been an investor in the beer category since 1970 and our original investment of $230 million has served us extremely well over the past half century. In fact, since 2003, our beer investment has served as a diverse income stream that contributed over $12 billion of adjusted equity earnings, contributed over $10 billion of cash from both dividends and 2016 merger proceeds and strengthened our balance sheet. We've performed rigorous analyses regarding the ABI investment. First, as part of the preparation of our third quarter financial statements; and second, in anticipation of the expiration of the lockup.
In preparing our third quarter financials, we assessed the latest outlook for ABI's business under the applicable accounting guidance and recorded an impairment to the asset. While we continue to believe ABI's share price will recover, we now do not expect it to fully recover to its carrying value as soon as previously expected. As a result, we have written our investment in ABI down to its September 30 market value of $11.2 billion.
Regarding our decisions around the lockup, we view our ABI stake as a financial investment, and our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. We consider several factors as we analyze the investment, including the strategic rationale of continuing as a long-term investor in the beer category. ABI's share price, which has declined by more than 30% since October 2019, due in large part to impacts of the COVID pandemic.
Our expectations of ABI's business, alternative uses of capital and tax considerations. We have determined that selling our ABI investment at this time would not maximize long-term shareholder value. Therefore, we continue to plan to maintain our ABI investment. We continue to have confidence in ABI's long-term strategies, premium global brands, experienced management team and capability to successfully navigate near-term challenges.
We will continue to monitor and evaluate market conditions and the analytical factors mentioned previously on a regular basis, consistent with our goal of maximizing the long-term value of this investment for our shareholders. We remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our significant capital returns, which we demonstrated in the third quarter by paying approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and raising the dividend for the 56th time in 52 years, selling Ste. Michelle Wine Estates and expanding our share repurchase program from $2 billion to $3.5 billion and repurchasing 6.7 million shares totaling $322 million. We have approximately $2.5 billion remaining under the newly expanded $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to complete by December 31, 2022.
With that, we'll wrap up. And Billy and I will be happy to take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, I'll remind you that today's earnings release and our non-GAAP reconciliations are available on altria.com. We've also posted our usual quarterly metrics, which include pricing, inventory and other items.
Let's open the question-and-answer period. Operator, do we have any questions?"

I think when you think about pricing, it's important to remember, our price realization is really 2 major components. The first component everybody is all aware of and talks about regularly, which are list price increases, and that's across our portfolios. When you think about the other component, it's the -- and we've referred to it before as the investments we made around advanced analytics and the amount of data we get from retail. And with that advanced analytics, some companies refer to it as revenue growth management, but it's really taken the retail promotions we put in the marketplace for consumers and really making it more efficient and as effective or maybe at times more effective than without the revenue growth management.
So that's allowing us to increase the price realization. I think that's what you experienced through the quarter and through the first 9 months. From a standpoint of L&M, look, we've increased our profitability on L&M. We have seeded some share there, but we're a premium-focused company. We like the results that we've experienced in L&M. And I think you see with the advanced analytics, Marlboro has been rock solid for, call it, now 5 to 6 quarters."

I think if you look at the slides we provided, I'll take the discount question first. You can see discount bounces around from time to time. It's still in the range where it has been for quite a while. I think you see the propensity for consumers to still vastly value premium brands over discount brands.
From a standpoint of how we think about pricing, and I'll be careful not to talk about future pricing. I mentioned before, there are several factors we think about. We think about the health of our brands, the demographics that are associated with our brands, are we being relevant across all adult cohorts. And we think about the economic health of our consumers that is a factor that we factor in. And then we think about overall corporate objectives.
And so we look to balance how we make decisions there. I think when you think about the overall strategy that we apply to the combustible segment, it's really about maximizing profitability over the long term, while making appropriate investments and balancing investments in Marlboro with investments in the noncombustible portfolio."

It's important to remember here, disrupting the consumer and introducing them to a new category that's growing extensively. And so we're not just investing in price promotion, we're investing in making it a premium and brand and really engaging with the consumer both digitally as well as with equity images so that they understand the nature of the brand.
So you're disrupting at retail and then you're reinforcing it with equity through time. And so that's how we're approaching the oral tobacco category. We believe on! through time, we can achieve tobacco-like margins. But certainly, we're in the investment phase right now."

And then second question, just wanted to come back to the ABI stake and some of the full process around that and specifically potentially creating more value from holding on to that versus potentially owning JUUL outright. So I mean, JUUL got the potential to be hyper growth, especially if it gets traction internationally. It's also a segment that's cannibalizing cigarettes, so incentive to own all the economics. And then arguably as well, it can also boost your ESG credentials. Then on the flip side, you've got ABI arguably at growth not cannibalizing your cigarettes and it was nothing for ESG credentials.
