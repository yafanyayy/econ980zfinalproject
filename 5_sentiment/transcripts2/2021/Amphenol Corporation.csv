This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2020 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were released this morn",935,"Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2020 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions. 
As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. 
The company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $2.426 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.15 and $1.13, respectively. Sales were up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currencies and organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies and organically. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. The interconnect business, which comprise 96% of our sales. Was up 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year. 
Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was down 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2020, sales were $8.599 billion, which was up 5% in U.S. dollars, 4% in local currencies and 2% organically compared to 2019. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. 
From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, which increased from 22.0% the fourth quarter of 2019 and 22.4% in the third quarter of 2020. In the cable segment, margins were 10.3%, which increased from 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and decreased from 10.7% in the third quarter of 2020. 
For the full year, 2020, adjusted operating income was $1.650 billion, which was slightly up from 2019, and resulted in a full year 2020 adjusted operating margin of 19.2% compared to 20% in 2019. This 80 basis point decline reflects the challenges and resulting impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the first half of the year. 
Given the unprecedented challenges we saw this year, we are extremely proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which has enabled us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment. 
The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.7%, which compared to 20.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019. 
For the full year, the company's GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 20.5% and 20.2%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate for both the full year 2020 and 2019 was 20.5 -- 24.5%. 
On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS increased by 12% to $1.15 in the fourth quarter compared to $1.03 in the prior year period. Our adjusted diluted EPS increased by 15% to $1.13 in the fourth quarter of 2020 from $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $3.91, a 4% increase from 2019 GAAP diluted EPS of $2.75. Adjusted diluted EPS was $3.74 for 2020, which was unchanged compared to 2019. The this was a strong performance considering the significant challenges in related to incremental costs resulting from the pandemic. 
Orders for the quarter were $2.512 billion, which was up 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 10% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of [ 1. 041 ]. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. We are proud that operating and free cash flow for both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 were all records for the company. Cash flow from operations was a strong $441 million in the fourth quarter or 124% of net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $371 million or 104% of net income. 
Cash flow from operations for the full year was $1.592 billion, or approximately 132% of net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2020 was $1.328 billion or 110% of net income. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 79, 72 and 61 days, respectively, all within our normal range. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $182 million under the $2 billion open market stock repurchase plan, bringing total repurchases for the year to 6 million shares or $641 million. 
Total debt at December 31 was $3.9 billion, and net debt at the end of the year was $2.1 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.2 billion, which included total cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion, plus the availability under our credit facilities. 
Fourth quarter and full year 2020 EBITDA was approximately $600 million and $2 billion, respectively, and at December 31, 2020, our net leverage ratio was 1.1x. 
Lastly, the company announced a 2 for 1 stock split, which will be effective as of March 4, 2021. I will now turn it back to Adam, who will provide some commentary and current trends.

And I hope it's not too late to wish everybody a happy new year as we're still here in the month of January. First, I just want to express my hope that all of you on the call here today, that you, your family, your friends and colleagues are all staying safe and healthy throughout the pandemic. I'm going to highlight our achievements in the fourth quarter and the full year. As Craig mentioned, I'll discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll then make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter. And then, of course, we'll have time at the end for questions. 
Now with respect to the fourth quarter and amidst what has, no doubt, been an unprecedented and volatile year, I'm truly proud that we finished 2020 with record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, both of which were significantly above our guidance. Sales grew 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, reaching a new record  [ $2. 426 ] billion. This organic growth, which was very strong, was driven by growth in mobile devices, industrial and automotive end markets, in particular. The company booked a record of $2.512 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, and that's a strong book-to-bill of [ 104: 1 ]. 
Despite continuing to face some operational challenges related to the ongoing pandemic, adjusted operating margins were strong in the quarter, reaching 20.6% and a 10 basis point increase from third quarter levels and 60 basis points from prior year. Craig already highlighted the operating and free cash flow of the company, very strong at $441 million and  $371 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter, both just excellent reflections of the quality of the company's earnings. 
I just want to say, with this fourth quarter, how proud I am of our team around the world. And our results this quarter, once again, reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst an environment that still has continued challenges. Our small acquisition team was also very busy in the fourth quarter and here in the last few weeks of January. As we announced on December 9, we're very pleased to have signed an agreement to acquire MTS Systems, a leading supplier of advanced test systems, motion simulators and precision sensors for $58.5 a share. The MTS acquisition continues to be subject to MTS shareholder approval, certain regulatory approvals as well as customary closing conditions. 
In addition, last week, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Illinois Toolworks, under which ITW will acquire MTS' test and simulation segment following the closing of our acquisition of MTS. This sale is also subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. 
We continue to expect that both the acquisition of MTS as well as the follow-on sale of the test and simulation business to ITW will both occur approximately in the middle of 2021. And I can just say that we've long been attracted by the outstanding technology and deep entrepreneurial culture of MTS Sensors, and look forward to welcoming this wonderful team of people into the Amphenol family. This acquisition, which is highly complementary to our current sensor offering, represents a further broadening of our high-technology sensor offering to customers across the automotive, industrial, military and commercial air industries. We expect the addition of MTS Sensors to add approximately $350 million in revenues and to generate approximately $0.10 per share of earnings accretion in the first year post closing. 
Now here in the last few weeks of January, we're also pleased to have closed 2 additional acquisitions of outstanding entrepreneurial companies, which we purchased for a combined price of $160 million. First, Positronic is a provider of high reliability, harsh environment connectors for customers primarily in the military aerospace, IT datacom and industrial markets. Based in Springfield, Missouri, and with also operations in France, India and Singapore, and with annual sales of approximately $80 million, Positronic represents a great addition to our harsh environment product offering. 
Next, LCAB, which is based in Poland, is a manufacturer of cable assemblies and related interconnect products, primarily serving the industrial market, and with annual sales of approximately $55 million. What I'm very pleased by is that both Positronic and LCAB are private, family-owned companies, with rich histories, leading technologies and excellent positions with customers in their target markets. As we welcome the outstanding Positronic and LCAB teams to the Amphenol family, and as we look forward to eventually welcoming the talented MTS Sensors organization in the coming months, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. 
Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. 
Now if we just look back on 2020, and some of the highlights from the year, despite the many challenges we all faced in 2020, from both a personal and a professional standpoint, Amphenol's dedicated entrepreneurial team performed just incredibly well. And I just could not be more proud of our performance this year. Sales reached a record $8.6 billion, growing 5% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, and actually surpassed our prepandemic outlook that we had given back a year ago. 
Our full year adjusted operating margins of 19.2% did decline 80 basis points from prior year, but this decline was due to the significant cost challenges we experienced in the first half of 2020, after which, our team was able to return to more typical profit levels in the second half. And that enabled us to achieve adjusted diluted EPS of $3.74, which was the same level as we achieved in 2019, no question, an impressive result given the circumstances. 
We generated record operating and free cash flow of $1.592 billion and $1.328 billion, respectively, excellent confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management even in these most unprecedented times. 
Our acquisition program stays strong despite the challenges related to the pandemic with 2 new companies added to the Amphenol family in 2020, Exa Thermometrics and [indiscernible] as well as Positronic and LCAB here in January and the signing of MTS that we already discussed. These acquisitions expand our position across a broad array of technologies and markets while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol organization. We're particularly excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance. In addition, in 2020, we bought back over 6 million shares under our buyback program, and increased our quarterly dividend to 16%. And as Craig mentioned, we're announcing today a 2 for 1 stock split of the company's shares. 
So while the overall market environment in 2020 was highly uncertain, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can now drive superior long-term performance. 
Now turning to the trends and our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create value for the company, with no single end market representing more than 22% of our sales in the year 2020. We believe that this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets that was particularly important here in 2020, but while also exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. The military market represented 11% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 12% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the quarter grew modestly from prior year, increasing by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter, with growth in naval, space and avionics applications offset in part by moderations in ground vehicles, rotorcraft and airframe. Sequentially, our sales increased, as we had expected, coming into the quarter by 3%. The for the full year 2020, our sales grew by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, reflecting our leading market position and strong execution across virtually all segments of the military market, offset in part by the impact of the pandemic-related production disruptions that we experienced in the first half of 2020. 
Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to decrease modestly from these fourth quarter levels. I just want to say that our organization working in the military market has worked long and hard for many years to strengthen our broad technology position, while increasing our capacity to serve customers across all segments of this important market. 
Our performance in 2020, especially given the many disruptions related to the pandemic, is a great reflection of the results of those efforts. Given the ongoing and favorable military spending environment, our team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we execute on the demands of our customers by supporting the many next-generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware. 
The commercial air market represented 2% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 3% of our sales for the full year. Not surprisingly, fourth quarter sales were down significantly, reducing by approximately 50% and as the commercial air market continued to experience unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry. 
Sequentially, our sales were a little bit better than expected, declining 10% from the third quarter. And for the full year 2020, sales declined by 34%, reflecting the significant impact of the pandemic on travel and aircraft production. 
Looking into the first quarter of 2021, we expect a sequential moderation in sales from these levels. Look, there's no doubt that these are difficult times for the entire travel industry, which is seriously impacting the market for commercial airplanes. Nevertheless, our team, who's just been so resilient over the course of this year, remains committed to leveraging the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms as well as next-generation systems that are integrated into those airplanes. And we remain well positioned when this market, ultimately, returns to growth. The industrial market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter and in the full year 2020. And our sales in this market significantly exceeded expectations that we had coming into the quarter, increased by a very strong 29% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically from prior year. This robust growth was driven especially by the battery and electric vehicle, instrumentation, heavy equipment, factory automation and medical segments of the industrial market. 
On a sequential basis, sales increased by 4% from the third quarter. We're really pleased with our results in industrial for the full year, with sales growing 15% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically as we saw strong demand in really those same markets, battery and EV, instrumentation, heavy equipment, also alternative energy, and of course, medical, which was a very strong segment in the year. 
Looking into the first quarter, we expect a slight moderation from the strong fourth quarter sales levels. I'm truly proud of our team working in the industrial market. Whether enabling the growth in volumes of a wide array of medical equipment or managing through significant increases in demand for semiconductor capital goods and next-generation batteries, our global organization has reacted quickly to ensure that our customers are fully supported regardless of the many operational challenges that have arisen during the pandemic. 
The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 17% of our sales for the full year 2020. Sales in this market were also much stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter, with revenue growing by 24% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically in the fourth quarter, and that was really driven by broad-based growth across all geographies in the automotive market. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by a very strong 22% as we continue to benefit from the broad recovery in the global automotive market. 
For the full year 2020, our sales declined by 6% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically, and that really reflected the significant challenges and factory shutdowns experienced by the auto industry in the first half of the year related to the pandemic, but was partially offset by our strong recovery that we drove in the second half. 
Looking into 2021, we do expect a sequential moderation from these high sales levels in the first quarter. Look, no doubt about it. The automotive industry faced 1 of the most difficult periods in recent memory during the first half of 2020, in particular, in the second quarter. And that was followed by an unexpectedly robust recovery here in the second half. I'm just so proud of our team working in this important market, who has clearly demonstrated their agility and resiliency through these most turbulent times, and, thereby, secured the company's position with our customers across the automotive market. 
Regardless of this most dynamic of years, we have continued to expand our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of traditional fuel and electric-powered vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world. This consistent strategy will continue to benefit us long into the future. 
The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 15% of our sales for the full year. Our sales in the quarter to mobile device customers increased by a much stronger-than-expected 32% from prior year, with strength in all product types, but particularly in wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales increased by 15%, and that was driven by higher sales to smartphones and wearable devices. 
For the full year 2020, sales in the mobile devices market increased by a very strong 16% as we continue to benefit from our agility in reacting to changes in demand in this dynamic market. For the full year, we saw particularly strong sales growth in products Incorporated into laptops, tablets, wearables and other accessories as well as production-related products, and that was offset in part by a slight moderation of sales of products incorporated into smartphones. 
Looking into the first quarter, we anticipate a typically significant seasonal sequential decline of approximately 40%. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2021 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, all positioning us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and 6% of our sales for the full year 2020. Sales in the quarter decreased from prior year by 8% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, with declines in sales to both equipment manufacturers as well as operators. 
Sequentially, our sales did increase by a bit less than we had expected, 12%. For the full year 2020, sales declined by 16% from prior year, which reflected the impact of the U.S. government restrictions on certain Chinese customers that had been imposed in 2019 as well as other impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase from this quarter's levels as operators expand their investments in next-generation mobile networks. Regardless of the challenging demand environment in the mobile networks market in 2020, we're confident in the company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next-generation equipment and networks. And as customers ramp up investment of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. 
The information technology and data communications market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and 21% of our sales for the full year of 2020. Sales in the quarter were stronger than expected, rising by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from prior year as stronger sales of networking equipment and server-related products were offset by lower sales of storage-related products. Sequentially, our sales declined by 8% from our very robust third quarter. 
We're very pleased with our performance for the full year for IT datacom, with our sales growing a very strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically as we capitalized on increased demand from our OEM and service provider customers as they work to accelerate bandwidth capacity expansions, in particular, to support home-based work, school and entertainment. Our team working in support of these customers has clearly distinguished themselves this year, reacting quickly to capitalize on unprecedented demand for our industry-leading high-speed and power products. At the same time, we've not slowed down our efforts to further develop that broad range of leading interconnect products in support of data communication networks around the world. 
Looking into the first quarter of 2021, we expect a typical seasonal moderation of sales here in the quarter. But nevertheless, we remain very encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers around the world continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom. 
The broadband communications market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the full year. Sales increased by 3% in the fourth quarter from prior year, driven by stronger demand for home installation related equipment from our broadband operators. On a sequential basis, sales decreased as expected by 9% and from the third quarter. For the full year 2020, sales were flat, and that's despite the significant disruptions to production and demand that we experienced in the first quarter offset by the accelerated investments in support of bandwidth later in the year. 
Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels, and we remain encouraged by the company's position in the broadband market. With our expanded range of products, together with strong relationships with customers around the world, we look forward to benefiting as operators increase their network investments in the future. 
Now just to summarize, there's no question that 2020 was one of the most challenging years we've all experienced. But in the face of these challenges, I am just so proud of the entire team of Amphenolians around the world who have managed extraordinarily well throughout the pandemic and the related disruptions to the economy. Through our dual-pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program, the company continues to expand our market position, while strengthening our financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diverse end markets, a worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program, and I can say, most importantly, in this pandemic-impacted 2020, an agile and entrepreneurial management team. 
Now turning to our outlook, and regardless of our strong performance in the fourth quarter, there still remains significant economic uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we will not be providing full year guidance at this time. 
Assuming no new material disruptions from the pandemic as well as constant exchange rates, for the first quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $2.120 billion to $2.180 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.90 to $0.94. And I would just note that on a post split basis, this adjusted diluted EPS guidance would be $0.45 to $0.47. The this guidance represents sales growth in the first quarter of 14% to 17% year-over-year and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 27% to 32%, again compared to the first quarter of 2020. 
I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our position and expand our profitability. Our entire organization remains committed to delivering strong financial results, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. Most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly heroic efforts here in the fourth quarter and throughout the entirety of 2020. 
And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions if there may be."

Look, customers place orders to us, and we can't always exactly pinpoint what the demand is, except we know that when they tell us they want the product. And I wouldn't tell you that we've seen any dramatic lengthening of lead times or longer-dated orders per se. 
You mentioned the widely reported discussions around semiconductor availability in a variety of markets. I think our customers are pretty smart. And while they may be chasing lots of semiconductors or trying to put orders on those kind of products, they know that our products are available for them. And we haven't disappointed them throughout this year, even with the disruptions early in the year, even with the significant increases in certain of our markets in the second half. So I wouldn't necessarily say that customers are lumping us into that kind of semiconductor category. I think that customers are looking to us, no question about it, on the basis of the fact that we were there for them when they needed us most, in particular, as many of our customers coming out of the pandemic had certain -- some parts of their supply chain, which still had a lot of disruptions. And the excellent job that our team did in recovering from those disruptions, whether that was early on in the year with bringing all of our factories in China back to full production substantially earlier than many, or continuing into later part of the year with the recoveries that we saw, for example, in automotive, in industrial and other markets. 
So I think that our team is doing a good job of making sure that we get more than our fair share of our customers' bandwidth and orders, and we're going to keep driving for that."

We're not giving guidance for the full year. We have done an outstanding job of supporting our customers when they needed us in the ramp-up after the various disruptions. 
And regardless of what happens in end demand, I believe that our position with customers is stronger than ever. 
Now I should also mention that, whether it's in industrial or in automotive, and obviously, industrial has a lot of different segments within it, we see continued content gains in both of those areas, which are greater than just the end unit demand. And that's the trend of adoption of electronics into all types of systems, all types of equipment, all types of products. And if anything, we've seen that adoption accelerates over the course of this year for a variety of reasons. And much has been reported about the acceleration, for example, of electric drivetrains in cars, where we benefited greatly for that. But we've seen a lot of very similar dynamics across the multiple segments within the industrial market. 
So look, what does this mean for the second half of 2021? Again, we're not giving guidance for the year. There's a lot of uncertainty related to pandemic, but I think our position with our customers is stronger than ever before."

And this is $1.7 billion, less the proceeds from the test and SIM business. So I wouldn't say that the size is unique, but the process is a little bit more unique with the public company process. And then with the strategic review that we did that ultimately resulted in an outstanding outcome of us negotiating together with Illinois Toolworks or ITW, the disposition of the Test and Simulation segment to ITW. And ITW is just an outstanding company, MTS is an outstanding company, and you know how we feel about Amphenol. 
So I think this is just 3 really outstanding companies ending up in a real win-win-win for all parties, whether that's the shareholders of MTS, whether that's Amphenol or whether that is, in fact, ITW. From our position, the MTS sensors business, which is what, ultimately, attracted us to MTS, is just extraordinarily complementary. I mean, I'd say virtually no overlap with our own sensor offering, extremely harsh environment products used in a variety of really high-technology applications. These are sensors that are used in force and vibration, pressure, position, really at the highest level of reliability, with also complex interconnect systems associated therewith. 
And so from a -- when we talk about the complementary aspect of the MTS sensors business, it is really just that uniquely complementary set of products across the end markets where we're very excited by. And then you add to all of that just a wonderful, wonderful management team across the business. And by the way, all of MTS, we've just been so impressed with the people at MTS. But particularly with the MTS Sensors team, we're just so excited by this entrepreneurial organization, and it's a team that we've known for a long time. 
This was not a kind of last-minute thing here, far from it. We've known this organization for a very long time, and we're very excited, subject to the shareholder approval, subject to the regulatory and other closing conditions, we're very excited 1 day to welcome them into the Amphenol family."

For sure. And it's very different than the situation with MTS. In the case of MTS, we were drawn to MTS because of the sensor business, we were impressed, by the way, very impressed with the team and with the business of test and simulation, but it's a different business for us, really categorically different. And that was why we talked about having a strategic review, and in the end, I think, a great outcome for all parties with the agreed sale to ITW. In the case of our cable products, cable products are an integral part of an interconnect system that is used, in particular, for getting high-speed bandwidth to customers and to companies. And what we've said all along is, yes, the cable products segment may underperform from an operating margin perspective for the moment, we don't want to be in the business of picking the winners and losers of how people and companies are going to get Internet connectivity to their homes, to their businesses, to their universities, to the governments. 
We want to be betting really on every possible way of doing that. And thus, our position with the cable operators, with the MSOs, is a very important strategic position for Amphenol. And that importance, by the way, carries over into our interconnect segment, where the strength that we have, the reputation that we have, our ability to service these service providers as opposed to OEMs has been a fabulous value to the rest of the company, in particular, as we've seen other markets move more towards the service provider market. And let me just give you an example of that. If you take the IT datacom market, which traditionally we were selling products that go just directly to equipment manufacturers. Well, as I think everybody on the call knows, over the recent 5 or more years, maybe even a little bit more than half a decade, we've seen increasing strength and increasing demand from web service providers. How you work with a service provider is very, very different than how you work with an OEM, who, ultimately, is making in a piece of equipment in a factory. And our experience in the cable products has been invaluable to our team in making sure that we can react to the demand and the volatility of the demand that is really endemic in any service provider business. 
When I look at our results this year, in particular, in IT datacom, we did see extremely strong demand from service providers, our ability to react on a moment's notice, the mindset of that is a mindset that we developed, that we incubated originally in our cable business. And I think that, that's just a great reflection of the broad value that we see in that business beyond just the fact that it does have, today, a little bit lower margins. It's a much smaller piece of our business than it once was, but it's still an important part of Amphenol's strategy."

We came into the year with an expectation of the market being flat. I will tell you, I mean, we didn't give guidance at the time, but had you asked me at the end of Q1, what would mobile devices be for the year? I probably would have thought it'd be even down given the disruptions that we saw in the first quarter to our China facilities. And the vast majority, if not all, of our mobile device production is really in China. And all of those factories were shut down, as you know, for the better part of 3 weeks due to the early stage of the coronavirus. 
And then our team just did an unbelievable job of reacting to the strength in the market. And the strength this year, while there was, on a sequential basis, in the fourth quarter, strength in smartphones, where we really saw a lot of strength this year was maybe not surprisingly in devices that are needed by people when they're working, when they're learning, when they're being entertained at home. So things like laptops, things like tablets, we saw a lot of strength in wearables. I know a lot of people got on health kicks and maybe these wearables can be very useful there. A lot of strength in things that go in your ears, your hearable devices, as we call them. And probably because you have a lot of people doing work in school from home, and they might have other people in the same house, and they want to have some privacy, whatever the reason is, there was just a great amount of strength, and our team was able to react to quite unexpected demand. 
And so, as you go into the first quarter, I think that we would expect normally some relaxation of that demand. I mean, look, anecdotally, I tried to buy Christmas' presence for my wife and my daughter of a computer because they both have really old computers. And I totally failed as a father in a husband, and they each got their present. One got it about a month late, and the other one still hasn't gotten hers. 
So there was a real demand back in the fourth quarter, in particular, for these devices. And I think we wouldn't expect such a continuation here in the first quarter."

And so that interaction, as you call it cross pollination, we call it inside Amphenol collaboration, is something that we're doing all the time, and that's collaboration from a product development, making sure that we're bringing a full suite of products to customers in each of those markets and really capitalizing on that trend of electrification that we're seeing, again, not just in automotive, but we're seeing that trend very significantly in the industrial market as well. And I'd say that when you look at our performance in both of those end markets, which we talked about with one of the earlier questions, it's not totally coincident that we're seeing those strong content growth in both of those markets, some of which is being driven by this trend of electrification."

And I'm wondering if, A, you could help us think through what the reasons are, if it is truly COVID inefficiencies? And if it is, how large are these?

So I guess I woul",512,"Yes, I think -- I mean, if you look about -- look back in the first quarter of '19, we were certainly operating at very strong profitability at that point, honestly, and we finished the fourth quarter at very strong profitability levels. So I guess I wouldn't necessarily just kind of look back into '19 to kind of see a time where we're operating at strong profitability levels. If you look at the fourth quarter, we already reached 20.6% here in the quarter. We certainly still see some disruption related to the pandemic, and that's certainly embedded in those numbers, maybe slightly offset by some other benefits we have in things like T&E. So I think I said last quarter that we kind of see a relatively neutral impact in the second half of the year. 
As we kind of go into the first quarter, our guidance really reflects, I would say, a sequential seasonal decline, and we talked about approximately 10% kind of seasonal decline in sale. And that does, as you mentioned, kind of imply a conversion rate maybe slightly higher than our normal 30% downside, which would maybe get to the profitability level in the 19, kind of -- a little above 19% range. So I think that that's probably the basis of your question. I mean I wouldn't say this conversion isn't -- certainly isn't so significant given the level of sequential decline we're seeing kind of going into the first quarter. In addition, combined with the continued challenging kind of cost environment, we are seeing still COVID-related efficiencies. And I think that the company has really done a great job thus far, as you saw in 2020 of dealing with those inefficiencies and really snapping back in a profitability level, but we are seeing a little bit of a decline going into the first quarter from a sales perspective. Which is going to have some impact, and I think the team has done a great job dealing with that, and we'll continue to deal with that. And so I'm really proud of kind of where we ended up in 2020. And I have no doubt that we'll get back to those levels. As it -- the other thing that's happening in the first quarter certainly is the acquisitions we just closed on here in January, are having some small effect on the conversion, if you look sequentially into the first quarter. And the ones we did in 2019, certainly wouldn't haven't made necessarily the progress that maybe we would have expected in 2020 for very understandable reasons, I think, with -- dealing with the pandemic, during 2020. 
So I think there's a few reasons. But all in all, we're really happy with where we are with profitability, certainly, in the second half here of 2020, and to be quite honest, even in the first half, given the challenges we had. And certainly, we are really confident that, as we go into 2021, you'll see those levels of snap back to normal levels once COVID is behind us."

You have to remember, in our industry, there is not a monolithic competitive landscape. There are, obviously, some companies that are publicly traded and well known, which are excellent companies. But there's a whole diaspora of competition in the interconnect industry and each application may have a different landscape of competitors than the application before it. 
So I guess, by definition, yes, you're going to have some different competitors.

And our ability to collaboratively share some of those underlying core technologies across our team, a little bit like we discussed just a few moments ago, has really positioned the company well to be an enabler of those next-generation systems, which are really mission-critical. 
So I think we're very happy to have a whole diaspora of competition across all our markets, and that includes within automotive."

I mean the family who founded and still until we just closed recently Positronic, I've known that family for, I don't know, a decade and a half. I mean, it's an outstanding company, Positronic, just a real marquee brand in the interconnect industry, known for harsh environment, in particular, board level, power connectors and some data connectors. These are IO connectors, these go on the Board. They're used in a wide variety of systems in the military as well as in datacom for power and industrial applications. And it's very complementary, actually. A lot of the products that they have, Positronic, they have just a real proprietary position across their customer base. And sometimes you look at admiration at the strength of a company's position because of the uniqueness of their technology. And that's something that we have done for many years with Positronic. LCAB is a little bit of a different story. LCAB, first of all, is our first company that's really fully based in Poland. Poland is an outstanding location for low-cost manufacturing with proximity to all of Europe. And they have an excellent position in cable assemblies for industrial applications and, in particular, next-generation, electric-powered industrial vehicles and whether that's buses, whether that's trucks, delivery vehicles. They're also involved in marine-related cable assemblies. But what really attracted us to them is they're just leading position in to sort of EV revolution, industrial EV revolution. And that's something we've done a great job of in Asia, we've done a great job of it in North America, and we've done a really a good job in Europe, but this accelerates our position in those -- in that electrification of industrial vehicles in Europe. And again, a fabulous team, family-owned company, great management, great products, great position. Those are the factors that we always look for in acquisitions, and I think both Positronic and LCAB deliver wholeheartedly in all those areas."

I think what I talked about was battery in EV and factory automation, but not necessarily together. But the fact is you raise a very good point, which is, for sure, whenever you have a massive build-out of factories, be that for batteries, where there's a lot of automation, next-generation vehicles, whatever, and we've seen a lot of build-out of factories. By the way, semiconductor factories as well. You've seen the strength that we've had in instrumentation. Our position in factory automation and instrumentation, test equipment and otherwise, interconnect for all of those, puts us in a very strong position to benefit from the expansion of these facilities. 
But when we talk about our sales of industrial products into battery applications, it's really actual interconnect sensors that get integrated into these high technology, high-voltage battery systems, both to allow the signal of the battery, the power to come in and out of the battery and also the control systems for these batteries, which is a wonderful opportunity, where there's a lot of kind of interconnect and sensor applications where you're selling to customers just a complete solution to allow them to manage these batteries and, thereby, get more efficiency and safety out of them once they're integrated into vehicles."

I think you listed a lot of them. I mean the fact is, if I look over the long term, and you've followed us for a very long time and so you have a you have a great sense of the arc of the progress of our automotive business over these many years. We started out in automotive many, many years ago as the innovator of airbag connectors. And that was kind of our first thing we did, and we're talking a long time ago. I think the first airbag was like in 1990 or something like that. So we're talking a 30-year time period. And over time, we developed into interconnect products for satellite, radio and GPs and other infotainment. We built through acquisitions and other -- and organic means presence in emissions control and engine control, other electronics. And essentially, as the car adopted new electronic systems, we were positioning ourselves, either organically or through acquisition, to participate in those next-generation systems. 
Our growth in automotive was never a question of kind of taking someone else's business that was a legacy business. Rather, it was positioning ourselves as these new systems were developed to be there for customers, for Tier 1s, for Tier 2s, whomever. And I think that's been very successful over all these years. We believe there's still a lot more potential left in our automotive business. The growth in content in the car is really outstanding, and we're not the only one to talk about that. In many ways, to me, a car is becoming kind of a data center on wheels, it's becoming an electric powertrain on wheels, I mean, you name it. And each of those new systems, many of which you mentioned, are contributors to the growth of the company. But what I wouldn't say is that any of them are disproportionate to our long-term success in that market. I think it's been actually a relatively balanced contribution to that long-term success that, in particular, we've seen over really the last decades."

I mean, yes, great performance in battery EV, great performance and instrumentation, great performance in medical. Again, I could give you a long list of the positive contributors to our industrial market. Will there be some areas where there'll be a little bit of a tougher comparison? Obviously, the second quarter was a particularly acute quarter for Medical, where our team -- I mean, I just -- I cannot emphasize enough how proud we were to be a contributor to the fight against COVID through our reactivity to the demand for new medical equipment, whether that be respiratory therapy devices and the sensors and interconnect products that are contained therein, whether that be hospital equipment to outfit ICUs and other patient care devices. I mean that is something that we, at Amphenol, will forever be proud of, the contributions that our team made to the fight against COVID to protect lives and to enable countries around the world to have a fighting chance against this virus. And so yes, will there be a little bit less maybe of some of those more acute care things? There could be, but who knows. There was also, as many have talked about, reductions in elective procedures, which actually reduced demand for certain medical equipment in some areas, too. And so maybe that has the chance to come back. I think there is not the visibility today, and thus, why we are not giving the guidance for the year for me to say which of those segments, as we go through the course of the year, going to have the stronger or the weaker performance. But for sure, we have positioned ourselves with our customers by being there for them when they needed us most and they're in really the most critical of time periods. Such that to the extent that they have business to give, I would expect that they will give, at least, if not more than our fair share to Amphenol."

We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2020 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions.
As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information.
The company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $2.426 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.15 and $1.13, respectively. Sales were up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currencies and organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies and organically.
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. The interconnect business, which comprise 96% of our sales, was up 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was down 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
For the full year 2020, sales were $8.599 billion, which was up 5% in U.S. dollars, 4% in local currencies and 2% organically compared to 2019. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, which increased from 22.0% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 22.4% in the third quarter of 2020. In the cable segment, margins were 10.3%, which increased from 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and decreased from 10.7% in the third quarter of 2020.
For the full year, 2020, adjusted operating income was $1.650 billion, which was slightly up from 2019 and resulted in a full year 2020 adjusted operating margin of 19.2% compared to 20% in 2019. This 80 basis point decline reflects the challenges and resulting impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the first half of the year.
Given the unprecedented challenges we saw this year, we are extremely proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which has enabled us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment.
The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.7%, which compared to 20.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019.
For the full year, the company's GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 20.5% and 20.2%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate for both the full year 2020 and 2019 was 20.5 -- 24.5%.
On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS increased by 12% to $1.15 in the fourth quarter compared to $1.03 in the prior year period. Our adjusted diluted EPS increased by 15% to $1.13 in the fourth quarter of 2020 from $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2019.
For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $3.91, a 4% increase from 2019 GAAP diluted EPS of $2.75. Adjusted diluted EPS was $3.74 for 2020, which was unchanged compared to 2019. The was a strong performance considering the significant challenges and related to incremental costs resulting from the pandemic. Orders for the quarter were $2.512 billion, which was up 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 10% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.041.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. We are proud that operating and free cash flow for both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 were all records for the company. Cash flow from operations was a strong $441 million in the fourth quarter or 124% of net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $371 million or 104% of net income.
Cash flow from operations for the full year was $1.592 billion or approximately 132% of net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2020 was $1.328 billion or 110% of net income.
From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 79, 72 and 61 days, respectively, all within our normal range. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $182 million under the $2 billion open market stock repurchase plan, bringing total repurchases for the year to 6 million shares or $641 million. Total debt at December 31 was $3.9 billion, and net debt at the end of the year was $2.1 billion.
Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.2 billion, which included total cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion, plus the availability under our credit facilities. Fourth quarter and full year 2020 EBITDA was approximately $600 million and $2 billion, respectively, and at December 31, 2020, our net leverage ratio was 1.1x. Lastly, the company announced a 2-for-1 stock split, which will be effective as of March 4, 2021.
I will now turn it back to Adam, who will provide some commentary and current trends."

And I hope it's not too late to wish everybody a happy new year as we're still here in the month of January. First, I just want to express my hope that all of you on the call here today, that you, your family, your friends and colleagues are all staying safe and healthy throughout the pandemic.
I'm going to highlight our achievements in the fourth quarter and the full year. As Craig mentioned, I'll discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll then make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter. And then, of course, we'll have time at the end for questions.
Now with respect to the fourth quarter and amidst what has, no doubt, been an unprecedented and volatile year, I'm truly proud that we finished 2020 with record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, both of which were significantly above our guidance. Sales grew 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, reaching a new record  $2.426 billion. This organic growth, which was very strong, was driven by growth in mobile devices, industrial and automotive end markets, in particular. The company booked a record of $2.512 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, and that's a strong book-to-bill of 104:1.
Despite continuing to face some operational challenges related to the ongoing pandemic, adjusted operating margins were strong in the quarter, reaching 20.6%, a 10 basis point increase from third quarter levels and 60 basis points from prior year. Craig already highlighted the operating and free cash flow of the company, very strong at $441 million and $371 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter, both just excellent reflections of the quality of the company's earnings.
I just want to say, with this fourth quarter, how proud I am of our team around the world. And our results this quarter, once again, reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst an environment that still has continued challenges.
Our small acquisition team was also very busy in the fourth quarter and here in the last few weeks of January. As we announced on December 9, we're very pleased to have signed an agreement to acquire MTS Systems, a leading supplier of advanced test systems, motion simulators and precision sensors, for $58.5 a share. The MTS acquisition continues to be subject to MTS shareholder approval, certain regulatory approvals as well as customary closing conditions.
In addition, last week, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Illinois Tool Works, under which ITW will acquire MTS' test and simulation segment following the closing of our acquisition of MTS. This sale is also subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We continue to expect that both the acquisition of MTS as well as the follow-on sale of the test and simulation business to ITW will both occur approximately in the middle of 2021.
I can just say that we've long been attracted by the outstanding technology and deep entrepreneurial culture of MTS Sensors, and look forward to welcoming this wonderful team of people into the Amphenol family. This acquisition, which is highly complementary to our current sensor offering, represents a further broadening of our high-technology sensor offering to customers across the automotive, industrial, military and commercial air industries. We expect the addition of MTS Sensors to add approximately $350 million in revenues and to generate approximately $0.10 per share of earnings accretion in the first year post-closing.
Now here in the last few weeks of January, we're also pleased to have closed 2 additional acquisitions of outstanding entrepreneurial companies, which we purchased for a combined price of $160 million. First, Positronic is a provider of high reliability, harsh environment connectors for customers primarily in the military, aerospace, IT datacom and industrial markets. Based in Springfield, Missouri, and with also operations in France, India and Singapore and with annual sales of approximately $80 million, Positronic represents a great addition to our harsh environment product offering.
Next, El-Cab, which is based in Poland, is a manufacturer of cable assemblies and related interconnect products, primarily serving the industrial market, and with annual sales of approximately $55 million. What I'm very pleased by is that both Positronic and El-Cab are private, family-owned companies, with rich histories, leading technologies and excellent positions with customers in their target markets. As we welcome the outstanding Positronic and El-Cab teams to the Amphenol family, and as we look forward to eventually welcoming the talented MTS Sensors organization in the coming months, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.
Now if we just look back on 2020 and some of the highlights from the year, despite the many challenges we all faced in 2020, from both a personal and a professional standpoint, Amphenol's dedicated entrepreneurial team performed just incredibly well. And I just could not be more proud of our performance this year. Sales reached a record $8.6 billion, growing 5% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, and actually surpassed our pre-pandemic outlook that we had given back a year ago.
Our full year adjusted operating margins of 19.2% did decline 80 basis points from prior year, but this decline was due to the significant cost challenges we experienced in the first half of 2020, after which, our team was able to return to more typical profit levels in the second half. And that enabled us to achieve adjusted diluted EPS of $3.74, which was the same level as we achieved in 2019, no question, an impressive result given the circumstances.
We generated record operating and free cash flow of $1.592 billion and $1.328 billion, respectively, excellent confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management even in these most unprecedented times.
Our acquisition program remains strong despite the challenges related to the pandemic with 2 new companies added to the Amphenol family in 2020, Exa Thermometrics and Onanon as well as Positronic and El-Cab here in January and the signing of MTS that we already discussed. These acquisitions expand our position across a broad array of technologies and markets while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol organization. We're particularly excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance.
In addition, in 2020, we bought back over 6 million shares under our buyback program, and increased our quarterly dividend to 16%. And as Craig mentioned, we're announcing today a 2-for-1 stock split of the company's shares.
So while the overall market environment in 2020 was highly uncertain, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can now drive superior long-term performance.
Now turning to the trends and our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end-market diversification continues to create value for the company, with no single end market representing more than 22% of our sales in the year 2020. We believe that this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets that was particularly important here in 2020, but while also exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry.
The military market represented 11% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 12% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the quarter grew modestly from prior year, increasing by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter, with growth in naval, space and avionics applications offset in part by moderations in ground vehicles, rotorcraft and airframe.
Sequentially, our sales increased as we had expected, coming into the quarter by 3%. For the full year 2020, our sales grew by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, reflecting our leading market position and strong execution across virtually all segments of the military market, offset in part by the impact of the pandemic-related production disruptions that we experienced in the first half of 2020. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to decrease modestly from these fourth quarter levels.
I just want to say that our organization working in the military market has worked long and hard for many years to strengthen our broad technology position, while increasing our capacity to serve customers across all segments of this important market. Our performance in 2020, especially given the many disruptions related to the pandemic, is a great reflection of the results of those efforts. Given the ongoing and favorable military spending environment, our team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we execute on the demands of our customers by supporting the many next-generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware.
The commercial air market represented 2% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 3% of our sales for the full year. Not surprisingly, fourth quarter sales were down significantly, reducing by approximately 50%, as the commercial air market continued to experience unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry.
Sequentially, our sales were a little bit better than expected, declining 10% from the third quarter. And for the full year 2020, sales declined by 34%, reflecting the significant impact of the pandemic on travel and aircraft production. Looking into the first quarter of 2021, we expect a sequential moderation in sales from these levels.
Look, there's no doubt that these are difficult times for the entire travel industry, which is seriously impacting the market for commercial airplanes. Nevertheless, our team, who's just been so resilient over the course of this year, remains committed to leveraging the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms as well as next-generation systems that are integrated into those airplanes. And we remain well positioned when this market, ultimately, returns to growth.
The industrial market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter and in the full year 2020. Our sales in this market significantly exceeded expectations that we had coming into the quarter, increased by a very strong 29% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically from prior year. This robust growth was driven especially by the battery and electric vehicle, instrumentation, heavy equipment, factory automation and medical segments of the industrial market. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 4% from the third quarter.
We're really pleased with our results in industrial for the full year, with sales growing 15% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically as we saw strong demand in really those same markets, battery and EV, instrumentation, heavy equipment, also alternative energy and, of course, medical, which was a very strong segment in the year. Looking into the first quarter, we expect a slight moderation from the strong fourth quarter sales levels.
I'm truly proud of our team working in the industrial market. Whether enabling the growth in volumes of a wide array of medical equipment or managing through significant increases in demand for semiconductor capital goods and next-generation batteries, our global organization has reacted quickly to ensure that our customers are fully supported regardless of the many operational challenges that have arisen during the pandemic.
The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 17% of our sales for the full year 2020. Sales in this market were also much stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter, with revenue growing by 24% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically in the fourth quarter, and that was really driven by broad-based growth across all geographies in the automotive market. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by a very strong 22% as we continue to benefit from the broad recovery in the global automotive market.
For the full year 2020, our sales declined by 6% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically, and that really reflected the significant challenges and factory shutdowns experienced by the auto industry in the first half of the year related to the pandemic but was partially offset by our strong recovery that we drove in the second half. Looking into 2021, we do expect a sequential moderation from these high sales levels in the first quarter.
Look, no doubt about it. The automotive industry faced one of the most difficult periods in recent memory during the first half of 2020, in particular, in the second quarter. And that was followed by an unexpectedly robust recovery here in the second half. I'm just so proud of our team working in this important market, who has clearly demonstrated their agility and resiliency through these most turbulent times and, thereby, secured the company's position with our customers across the automotive market.
Regardless of this most dynamic of years, we have continued to expand our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of traditional fuel and electric-powered vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world. This consistent strategy will continue to benefit us long into the future.
The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 15% of our sales for the full year. Our sales in the quarter to mobile device customers increased by a much stronger-than-expected 32% from prior year, with strength in all product types, but particularly in wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales increased by 15%, and that was driven by higher sales to smartphones and wearable devices.
For the full year 2020, sales in the mobile devices market increased by a very strong 16% as we continue to benefit from our agility in reacting to changes in demand in this dynamic market. For the full year, we saw particularly strong sales growth in products Incorporated into laptops, tablets, wearables and other accessories as well as production-related products, and that was offset in part by a slight moderation of sales of products incorporated into smartphones.
Looking into the first quarter, we anticipate a typically significant seasonal sequential decline of approximately 40%. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2021 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, all positioning us well for the long term.
The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and 6% of our sales for the full year 2020. Sales in the quarter decreased from prior year by 8% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, with declines in sales to both equipment manufacturers as well as operators.
Sequentially, our sales did increase by a bit less than we had expected, 12%. For the full year 2020, sales declined by 16% from prior year, which reflected the impact of the U.S. government restrictions on certain Chinese customers that had been imposed in 2019 as well as other impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase from this quarter's levels as operators expand their investments in next-generation mobile networks.
Regardless of the challenging demand environment in the mobile networks market in 2020, we're confident in the company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next-generation equipment and networks. And as customers ramp up investment of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world.
The information technology and data communications market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and 21% of our sales for the full year of 2020. Sales in the quarter were stronger than expected, rising by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from prior year as stronger sales of networking equipment and server-related products were offset by lower sales of storage-related products. Sequentially, our sales declined by 8% from our very robust third quarter.
We're very pleased with our performance for the full year for IT datacom, with our sales growing a very strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically as we capitalized on increased demand from our OEM and service provider customers as they work to accelerate bandwidth capacity expansions, in particular, to support home-based work, school and entertainment. Our team working in support of these customers has clearly distinguished themselves this year, reacting quickly to capitalize on unprecedented demand for our industry-leading high-speed and power products. At the same time, we've not slowed down our efforts to further develop that broad range of leading interconnect products in support of data communication networks around the world.
Looking into the first quarter of 2021, we expect a typical seasonal moderation of sales here in the quarter. But nevertheless, we remain very encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers around the world continue to drive their equipment to ever-higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom.
The broadband communications market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the full year. Sales increased by 3% in the fourth quarter from prior year, driven by stronger demand for home installation-related equipment from our broadband operators. On a sequential basis, sales decreased as expected by 9% and from the third quarter. For the full year 2020, sales were flat, and that's despite the significant disruptions to production and demand that we experienced in the first quarter offset by the accelerated investments in support of bandwidth later in the year.
Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels. And we remain encouraged by the company's position in the broadband market. With our expanded range of products, together with strong relationships with customers around the world, we look forward to benefiting as operators increase their network investments in the future.
Now just to summarize, there's no question that 2020 was one of the most challenging years we've all experienced. But in the face of these challenges, I am just so proud of the entire team of Amphenolians around the world who have managed extraordinarily well throughout the pandemic and the related disruptions to the economy.
Through our dual-pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program, the company continues to expand our market position, while strengthening our financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diverse end markets, a worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and, I can say, most importantly, in this pandemic-impacted 2020, an agile and entrepreneurial management team.
Now turning to our outlook. And regardless of our strong performance in the fourth quarter, there still remains significant economic uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we will not be providing full year guidance at this time.
Assuming no new material disruptions from the pandemic as well as constant exchange rates, for the first quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $2.120 billion to $2.180 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.90 to $0.94. And I would just note that on a post-split basis, this adjusted diluted EPS guidance would be $0.45 to $0.47. This guidance represents sales growth in the first quarter of 14% to 17% year-over-year and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 27% to 32%, again compared to the first quarter of 2020.
I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our position and expand our profitability. Our entire organization remains committed to delivering strong financial results, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. Most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly heroic efforts here in the fourth quarter and throughout the entirety of 2020.
And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions if there may be."

Look, customers place orders to us, and we can't always exactly pinpoint what the demand is, except we know that when they tell us they want the product. And I wouldn't tell you that we've seen any dramatic lengthening of lead times or longer-dated orders per se.
You mentioned the widely reported discussions around semiconductor availability in a variety of markets. I think our customers are pretty smart. And while they may be chasing lots of semiconductors or trying to put orders on those kind of products, they know that our products are available for them. And we haven't disappointed them throughout this year, even with the disruptions early in the year, even with the significant increases in certain of our markets in the second half. So I wouldn't necessarily say that customers are lumping us into that kind of semiconductor category.
I think that customers are looking to us, no question about it, on the basis of the fact that we were there for them when they needed us most, in particular, as many of our customers coming out of the pandemic had certain -- some parts of their supply chain, which still had a lot of disruptions. And the excellent job that our team did in recovering from those disruptions, whether that was early on in the year with bringing all of our factories in China back to full production substantially earlier than many or continuing into later part of the year with the recoveries that we saw, for example, in automotive, in industrial and other markets.
So I think that our team is doing a good job of making sure that we get more than our fair share of our customers' bandwidth and orders, and we're going to keep driving for that."

But does that mean that they're taking our product and putting it on the shelf? No, I mean, we don't see that whatsoever. But at the same time, there is still uncertainty in the marketplace. We're not giving guidance for the full year. We have done an outstanding job of supporting our customers when they needed us in the ramp-up after the various disruptions. And regardless of what happens in end demand, I believe that our position with customers is stronger than ever.
Now I should also mention that, whether it's in industrial or in automotive, and obviously, industrial has a lot of different segments within it, we see continued content gains in both of those areas, which are greater than just the end-unit demand. And that's the trend of adoption of electronics into all types of systems, all types of equipment, all types of products.
And if anything, we've seen that adoption accelerates over the course of this year for a variety of reasons. And much has been reported about the acceleration, for example, of electric drivetrains in cars, where we benefited greatly for that. But we've seen a lot of very similar dynamics across the multiple segments within the industrial market.
So look, what does this mean for the second half of 2021? Again, we're not giving guidance for the year. There's a lot of uncertainty related to the pandemic, but I think our position with our customers is stronger than ever before."

And this is $1.7 billion, less the proceeds from the test and sim business. So I wouldn't say that the size is unique, but the process is a little bit more unique with the public company process.
And then with the strategic review that we did that ultimately resulted in an outstanding outcome of us negotiating together with Illinois Tool Works or ITW, the disposition of the test and simulation segment to ITW. And ITW is just an outstanding company, MTS is an outstanding company, and you know how we feel about Amphenol. So I think this is just 3 really outstanding companies ending up in a real win-win-win for all parties, whether that's the shareholders of MTS, whether that's Amphenol or whether that is, in fact, ITW.
From our position, the MTS Sensors business, which is what, ultimately, attracted us to MTS, is just extraordinarily complementary. I mean, I'd say virtually no overlap with our own sensor offering. Extremely harsh environment products used in a variety of really high-technology applications. These are sensors that are used in force and vibration, pressure, position, really at the highest level of reliability, with also complex interconnect systems associated therewith.
And so from a -- when we talk about the complementary aspect of the MTS Sensors business, it is really just that uniquely complementary set of products across the end markets where we're very excited by. And then you add to all of that just a wonderful, wonderful management team across the business. And by the way, all of MTS, we've just been so impressed with the people at MTS. But particularly with the MTS Sensors team, we're just so excited by this entrepreneurial organization, and it's a team that we've known for a long time.

In the case of MTS, we were drawn to MTS because of the Sensor business, we were impressed, by the way, very impressed with the team and with the business of test and simulation, but it's a different business for us, really categorically different. And that was why we talked about having a strategic review. And in the end, I think, a great outcome for all parties with the agreed sale to ITW.
In the case of our cable products, cable products are an integral part of an interconnect system that is used, in particular, for getting high-speed bandwidth to customers and to companies. And what we've said all along is, yes, the cable products segment may underperform from an operating margin perspective for the moment, we don't want to be in the business of picking the winners and losers of how people and companies are going to get internet connectivity to their homes, to their businesses, to their universities, to the governments. We want to be betting really on every possible way of doing that.
And thus, our position with the cable operators, with the MSOs, is a very important strategic position for Amphenol. And that importance, by the way, carries over into our interconnect segment, where the strength that we have, the reputation that we have, our ability to service these service providers as opposed to OEMs has been a fabulous value to the rest of the company, in particular, as we've seen other markets move more towards the service provider market.
And let me just give you an example of that. If you take the IT datacom market, which traditionally we were selling products that go just directly to equipment manufacturers. Well, as I think everybody on the call knows, over the recent 5 or more years, maybe even a little bit more than half a decade, we've seen increasing strength and increasing demand from web service providers.
How you work with a service provider is very, very different than how you work with an OEM, who, ultimately, is making in a piece of equipment in a factory. And our experience in the cable products has been invaluable to our team in making sure that we can react to the demand and the volatility of the demand that is really endemic in any service provider business.
When I look at our results this year, in particular, in IT datacom, we did see extremely strong demand from service providers, our ability to react on a moment's notice, the mindset of that is a mindset that we developed, that we incubated originally in our cable business. And I think that, that's just a great reflection of the broad value that we see in that business beyond just the fact that it does have, today, a little bit lower margins. It's a much smaller piece of our business than it once was, but it's still an important part of Amphenol's strategy."

We came into the year with an expectation of the market being flat. I will tell you, I mean, we didn't give guidance at the time, but had you asked me at the end of Q1, what would mobile devices be for the year? I probably would have thought it'd be even down given the disruptions that we saw in the first quarter to our China facilities. And the vast majority, if not all, of our mobile device production is really in China. And all of those factories were shut down, as you know, for the better part of 3 weeks due to the early stage of the coronavirus. And then our team just did an unbelievable job of reacting to the strength in the market.
And the strength this year, while there was, on a sequential basis, in the fourth quarter, strength in smartphones, where we really saw a lot of strength this year was maybe not surprisingly in devices that are needed by people when they're working, when they're learning, when they're being entertained at home. So things like laptops, things like tablets, we saw a lot of strength in wearables. I know a lot of people got on health kicks and maybe these wearables can be very useful there. A lot of strength in things that go in your ears, your hearable devices, as we call them, and probably because you have a lot of people doing work and school from home, and they might have other people in the same house, and they want to have some privacy, whatever the reason is, there was just a great amount of strength, and our team was able to react to quite unexpected demand.
And so, as you go into the first quarter, I think that we would expect normally some relaxation of that demand I mean, look, anecdotally, I tried to buy Christmas present, for my wife and my daughter, of a computer because they both have really old computers. And I totally failed as a father and a husband, and they each got their present. One got it about a month late, and the other one still hasn't gotten hers. So there was a real demand back in the fourth quarter, in particular, for these devices. And I think we wouldn't expect such a continuation here in the first quarter."

There's an enormous amount of interaction from a technology, from a customer perspective to ensure that we're maximizing our position with customers, whether they are making an electric bus or an electric sports car.
And so that interaction, as you call it cross-pollination, we call it inside Amphenol collaboration, is something that we're doing all the time, and that's collaboration from a product development, making sure that we're bringing a full suite of products to customers in each of those markets and really capitalizing on that trend of electrification that we're seeing, again, not just in automotive, but we're seeing that trend very significantly in the industrial market as well.
And I'd say that when you look at our performance in both of those end markets, which we talked about with one of the earlier questions, it's not totally coincident that we're seeing those strong content growth in both of those markets, some of which is being driven by this trend of electrification."

You're slightly below that, embedded in your guidance over here on slightly higher revenues versus 1Q '19.
Clearly, these are unprecedented times. There's been a lot of cost inefficiencies that have crept in because of COVID. Can you maybe characterize if that is the reason why the margins are where they are? I mean, clearly, very strong in the face of what has actually transpired, but still below a couple of years ago.
And I'm wondering if, a, you could help us think through what the reasons are, if it is truly COVID inefficiencies? And if it is, how large are these? And how long do you expect them to persist, after which we should start to see sort of back to historical levels of margin?"

I think -- I mean, if you look about -- look back in the first quarter of '19, we were certainly operating at very strong profitability at that point, honestly, and we finished the fourth quarter at very strong profita",518,"Yes, Wamsi, thanks for the question. I think -- I mean, if you look about -- look back in the first quarter of '19, we were certainly operating at very strong profitability at that point, honestly, and we finished the fourth quarter at very strong profitability levels. So I guess I wouldn't necessarily just kind of look back into '19 to kind of see a time where we're operating at strong profitability levels.
If you look at the fourth quarter, we already reached 20.6% here in the quarter. We certainly still see some disruption related to the pandemic, and that's certainly embedded in those numbers, maybe slightly offset by some other benefits we have in things like T&E. So I think I said last quarter that we kind of see a relatively neutral impact in the second half of the year.
As we kind of go into the first quarter, our guidance really reflects, I would say, a sequential seasonal decline, and we talked about approximately 10% kind of seasonal decline in sale. And that does, as you mentioned, kind of imply a conversion rate may be slightly higher than our normal 30% downside, which would maybe get to the profitability level in the 19%, kind of -- a little above 19% range.
So I think that that's probably the basis of your question. I mean I wouldn't say this conversion isn't -- certainly isn't so significant given the level of sequential decline we're seeing kind of going into the first quarter. In addition, combined with the continued challenging kind of cost environment, we are seeing still COVID-related inefficiencies. And I think that the company has really done a great job thus far, as you saw in 2020 of dealing with those inefficiencies and really snapping back in a profitability level, but we are seeing a little bit of a decline going into the first quarter from a sales perspective, which is going to have some impact, and I think the team has done a great job dealing with that, and we'll continue to deal with that. And so I'm really proud of kind of where we ended up in 2020. And I have no doubt that we'll get back to those levels.
As it -- the other thing that's happening in the first quarter certainly is the acquisitions we just closed on here in January, are having some small effect on the conversion, if you look sequentially into the first quarter. And the ones we did in 2019, certainly wouldn't haven't made necessarily the progress that maybe we would have expected in 2020 for very understandable reasons, I think, with -- dealing with the pandemic, during 2020.
So I think there's a few reasons. But all in all, we're really happy with where we are with profitability, certainly, in the second half here of 2020 and, to be quite honest, even in the first half, given the challenges we had. And certainly, we are really confident that, as we go into 2021, you'll see those levels of snap back to normal levels once COVID is behind us."

The EVs, not only do they tend to have potentially a little more content, but the nature of the content can be more attractive and more interesting for a company because of the high reliability, the harsh environment, the high-power aspects of those vehicles. So look, we'll see how the year progresses. We're not giving, again, guidance, but we have seen good strength in EV, and we would expect to see that going forward."

Are there different competitors in an EV versus an internal combustion engine? There may be -- I mean, there's different competitors for all different systems in the car.
You have to remember, in our industry, there is not a monolithic competitive landscape. There are, obviously, some companies that are publicly traded and well known, which are excellent companies. But there's a whole diaspora of competition in the interconnect industry and each application may have a different landscape of competitors than the application before it.
So I guess, by definition, yes, you're going to have some different competitors. I think our strength in EV, in part, stretches back to the fact that we've been making high-power, high-voltage connectors for really the entire history of Amphenol. That is a legacy. We would call it even a birthright of Amphenol with our military, our industrial business.
And our ability to collaboratively share some of those underlying core technologies across our team, a little bit like we discussed just a few moments ago, has really positioned the company well to be an enabler of those next-generation systems, which are really mission-critical.

These are IO connectors, these go on the Board. They're used in a wide variety of systems in the military as well as in datacom for power and industrial applications.
And it's very complementary, actually. A lot of the products that they have, Positronic, they have just a real proprietary position across their customer base. And sometimes you look in admiration at the strength of a company's position because of the uniqueness of their technology. And that's something that we have done for many years with Positronic.
El-Cab is a little bit of a different story. El-Cab, first of all, is our first company that's really fully based in Poland. Poland is an outstanding location for low-cost manufacturing with proximity to all of Europe. And they have an excellent position in cable assemblies for industrial applications and, in particular, next-generation, electric-powered industrial vehicles and whether that's buses, whether that's trucks, delivery vehicles. They're also involved in marine-related cable assemblies.

I think you listed a lot of them. I mean the fact is, if I look over the long term, and you've followed us for a very long time, and so you have a great sense of the arc of the progress of our automotive business over these many years. We started out in automotive many, many years ago as the innovator of airbag connectors. And that was kind of our first thing we did, and we're talking a long time ago. I think the first airbag was like in 1990 or something like that. So we're talking a 30-year time period.
And over time, we developed into interconnect products for satellite, radio and GPS and other infotainment. We built through acquisitions and other -- and organic means presence in emissions control and engine control, other electronics. And essentially, as the car adopted new electronic systems, we were positioning ourselves, either organically or through acquisition, to participate in those next-generation systems.
Our growth in automotive was never a question of kind of taking someone else's business that was a legacy business. Rather, it was positioning ourselves as these new systems were developed to be there for customers, for Tier 1s, for Tier 2s, whomever. And I think that's been very successful over all these years.
We believe there's still a lot more potential left in our automotive business. The growth in content in the car is really outstanding, and we're not the only one to talk about that. In many ways, to me, a car is becoming kind of a data center on wheels. It's becoming an electric powertrain on wheels, I mean, you name it. And each of those new systems, many of which you mentioned, are contributors to the growth of the company.
But what I wouldn't say is that any of them are disproportionate to our long-term success in that market. I think it's been actually a relatively balanced contribution to that long-term success that, in particular, we've seen over really the last decade."

But when I look at the breadth of our performance here at the end of the year as we closed out the year, and also throughout the course of the year, it's just -- there's no single-story to the strength.
I mean, yes, great performance in battery EV, great performance in instrumentation, great performance in medical. Again, I could give you a long list of the positive contributors to our industrial market. Will there be some areas where there'll be a little bit of a tougher comparison? Obviously, the second quarter was a particularly acute quarter for medical, where our team -- I mean, I just -- I cannot emphasize enough how proud we were to be a contributor to the fight against COVID through our reactivity to the demand for new medical equipment, whether that be respiratory therapy devices and the sensors and interconnect products that are contained therein, whether that be hospital equipment to outfit ICUs and other patient care devices. I mean that is something that we, at Amphenol, will forever be proud of, the contributions that our team made to the fight against COVID to protect lives and to enable countries around the world to have a fighting chance against this virus.
And so yes, will there be a little bit less maybe of some of those more acute care things? There could be, but who knows. There was also, as many have talked about, reductions in elective procedures, which actually reduced demand for certain medical equipment in some areas, too. And so maybe that has the chance to come back.
I think there is not the visibility today, and thus, why we are not giving the guidance for the year for me to say which of those segments, as we go through the course of the year, going to have the stronger or the weaker performance. But for sure, we have positioned ourselves with our customers by being there for them when they needed us most and they're -- in really the most critical of time periods. Such that to the extent that they have business to give, I would expect that they will give, at least, if not more than our fair share to Amphenol."

We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2021 conference call, and our first quarter 2021 results were released this morni",1165,"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO. And I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2021 conference call, and our first quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions. 
As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, as a result of our previously announced 2-for-1 stock split effective on March 4, 2021, all share and per-share data discussed on this earnings call is on a post-split basis. 
The company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.377 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.53 and $0.52, respectively. Sales were up 28% in U.S. dollars, 25% local currencies and 23% organically compared to the first quarter of 2020. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in U.S. dollars, 3% in local currencies and 4% organically. 
Orders for the quarter were $2.734 billion, which was up 27% compared to the first quarter of 2020 and up 9% sequentially and resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.15:1. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. The interconnect business, which comprised 96% of sales, was up 28% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year. Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 17% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year's. 
Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $465 million in the first quarter of 2021. Operating margin of 19.6% was down 100 basis points sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 adjusted operating margin and up a strong 260 basis points compared to the first quarter 2020. The year-over-year improvement in operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, combined with the benefit of a lower cost impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment. 
The sequential decline in operating margin was driven by normal conversion on the reduced sales levels as well as a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment. From a segment standpoint, the interconnect segment -- in the interconnect segment, margins were 21.5% in the first quarter of 2021 which increased from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2020 and decreased 100 basis points sequentially. 
In the cable segment, margins were 8.8% which increased from 7.6% in the first quarter of 2020 and decreased from 10.3% in the fourth quarter. Given the continuing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are very proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which has enabled us to capitalize on the many opportunities for incremental sales, while driving strong operating performance in this very dynamic market environment. 
The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.9%, which compared to 15.9% in the first quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in the first quarter of both 2021 and 2020. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS increased by 33% to $0.53 compared to $0.40 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 49% to $0.52 from 35% -- $0.35 in the first quarter of 2020. 
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $321 million in the first quarter or 97% of GAAP net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $243 million or 74% of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 73 and 59 days, respectively, all within the normal ranges. 
During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $153 million. And during the month of April, the company repurchased a small amount of remaining stock authorized under our existing stock repurchase plan. As a result and as mentioned in today's earnings release, yesterday, the company's Board of Directors approved a new 3-year open market stock repurchase plan for the purchase of up to $2 billion of the company's common stock. At March 31, cash and short-term investments were $2.4 billion, of which $963 million was held in the U.S. with the remainder held outside of the U.S. The elevated level of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter was driven by borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program in anticipation of the MTS closing in early April. 
Total debt was $4.6 billion, and net debt was $2.3 billion. Total available liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, which included total cash and short-term investments on hand. First quarter 2021 EBITDA was $559 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.0x. Following the close of the quarter, on April 7, we completed the acquisition of MTS, which Adam will discuss in more detail in a moment. The MTS acquisition was funded by a combination of cash and cash equivalents on hand as well as additional borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program. On a pro forma basis, including the MTS acquisition and the anticipated divestiture of the test and simulation business, total available liquidity and net leverage at March 31, 2020, would be $3.2 billion and 1.4x, respectively. divestiture of the MTS test and simulation business has closed, we will account for and report the test and simulation business as a discontinued operation. 
As such, the expected sales and earnings of the test and simulation business are not included in our guidance. Our guidance also excludes cash and noncash expenses that will be expensed in the second quarter related to the MTS acquisition. These expenses, which we expect to total approximately $85 million or $0.12 per share include costs related to the early extinguishment of debt, noncash purchase accounting-related expenses, external transaction expenses, severance and other costs. In conjunction with the divestiture of the test and simulation business, the company will also incur certain additional cash tax related and other acquisition-related costs, which will not be included in income from continuing operations. 
Our guidance does incorporate the expected results of the MTS Sensors business which as previously announced, is expected to generate $350 million in sales and $0.05 in diluted EPS in the first 12 months after closing. I will now turn it over -- now turn it over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends as well as our recently completed acquisitions."

And I certainly hope that you, your family, your friends and all of your colleagues are continuing to stay safe and healthy. As Craig mentioned,",2473,"Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to also extend my welcome to everybody on the call here today. And I certainly hope that you, your family, your friends and all of your colleagues are continuing to stay safe and healthy. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the first quarter. I'll then discuss our trends and our progress across our diversified served markets. And then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll have time for Q&A at the end. 
Our results in the first quarter were substantially better than we had expected coming into the quarter as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales as well as adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 28% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currencies. And on an organic basis, sales increased by 23%. And we had organic growth in nearly all of our end markets and driven particularly by growth in the automotive, mobile devices, industrial and IT datacom markets. And I'll talk about each of those markets in a few moments. 
Craig mentioned, we booked record orders in the quarter of $2.734 billion, and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.15:1. Despite continuing to face a range of operational challenges related to the ongoing pandemic as well as increased costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures, our operating margins were very healthy in the quarter, reaching 19.6%, which was a 260 basis point increase from last year's levels. 
Craig mentioned our adjusted diluted EPS grew a very robust 49% from prior year, which is again an excellent reflection of the Amphenol organization's strong execution. We generated operating and free cash flow of $321 million and $243 million in the first quarter, respectively, both clear reflections of the high quality of the company's earnings. I just want to say how proud I am of our team this quarter. And our results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the very dynamic and challenging environment. 
I'd like to make a few comments on our acquisitions in the quarter. As you can tell, our small acquisition team here in Wallingford, was very busy in the first quarter, closing 3 additional acquisitions since our last earnings release and bringing our total number of acquisitions closed this year to 5. First, as we announced on April 7, we were very pleased to close on the acquisition of MTS Systems earlier than originally anticipated. 
Also, as previously announced, we had signed an agreement to sell the MTS test and simulation business to Illinois Tool Works for a sale price of $750 million. And that is -- that remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments and excludes transaction-related expenses. We expect this sale to close following the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. 
We're really excited to welcome the talented MTS Sensors team to the Amphenol family. We especially look forward to the strength of the combined breadth of our company's highly complementary sensor product portfolios, which, we believe, will enable us to offer our customers an expanded array of innovative technologies across multiple end markets. 
We expect the MTS Sensors business to add approximately $350 million of sales and $0.05 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first 12 months after closing. More importantly, though, we look forward to realizing the long-term benefits of the opportunities created by the collective strengths of Amphenol and MTS Sensors for many years to come. We're really excited about this significant acquisition, which ultimately has positioned Amphenol as one of the broadest and most diversified sensor companies in the industry. 
In addition to the MTS acquisition, we also closed on 2 other small acquisitions during the first quarter. In February, we acquired Euromicron, a manufacturer of highly engineered fiber optic interconnect solutions for the mobile networks and IT datacom markets. Based in Germany, with annual sales of approximately $25 million, Euromicron represents a great addition to our interconnect product offering for customers across the European communications market. 
And then in March, we completed the acquisition of Cabelcon from Corning Inc. Cabelcon, which also has sales of approximately $25 million, is a Denmark based designer and manufacturer of high-technology connectors and interconnect assemblies, primarily for customers in the European broadband market. As we welcome these outstanding companies to the Amphenol family, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. 
Now turning to our trends across our served markets. I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create great value. We believe this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while continuing to expose us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. This diversification has become ever more valuable given the many market dynamics related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Now turning first to the military market. The military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And as we had expected coming into the quarter, sales grew by 3% from prior year and were essentially flat organically with growth in naval, unmanned aerial vehicles, communications and vehicle ground systems, offset by declines or flat performance in other applications. Sequentially, our sales were modestly down by about 3%. 
Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to grow in the low double digits from these first quarter levels as we benefit from the addition of MTS Sensors together with the increased demand for interconnect products. We're especially excited by the addition of the sensors products of MTS to our military product offering. Together with our already leading interconnect products as well as our broad exposure across virtually all defense programs, we look forward to supporting the continued adoption of next-generation electronics into a wide array of military hardware. 
The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. And not surprisingly, and as expected, sales were down significantly, declining by 47% from prior year as the commercial aircraft market continued to experience unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the ongoing pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry. Sequentially, our sales were a bit better than expected, moderating by just 3% from the fourth quarter. 
And looking into the second quarter, we do expect a sequential improvement in sales as we benefit from our recently completed acquisitions. Regardless of the ongoing challenging environment in commercial air, our team working in this market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those airplanes. 
The industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in industrial in the first quarter were better than expected, growing a very strong 33% in U.S. dollars and 33% organically. This was driven by robust growth in battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, instrumentation, factory automation, alternative energy and medical, really a broad performance across many of the segments. 
On a sequential basis, sales grew by a better-than-expected 6% versus the fourth quarter. Looking into the second quarter, we expect the industrial market to once again grow in the low teens versus the first quarter. And as we benefit from the addition of MTS Sensors, while continuing to gain momentum in many segments of the industrial market. The acquisition of MTS Sensors has expanded our range of sensors sold into the industrial market, adding position, vibration, force and shock sensors that are used in a wide array of industrial applications. 
Together with our existing sensor operations, we now have a diversified range of sensors supporting virtually all of the segments of the industrial market that we serve. I remain truly proud of our team working across the industrial market around the world. Our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering positions us strongly with customers who are accelerating their adoption of electronics no matter the application. The automotive market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in this market were also much stronger than we expected, growing 52% in U.S. dollars and 44% organically, as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market. 
In particular, we saw very strong growth of our products that are used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles in the quarter. A great confirmation of our global team long-term efforts at designing in high-voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these important next-generation platforms. Sequentially, our sales increased by 6% from the fourth quarter. Now as has been widely reported, there are a variety of supply chain challenges facing the automotive industry. 
Accordingly, as we look towards the second quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in sales as the global supply chain disruptions temporarily impact certain pockets of new vehicle production. I'm extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They have really demonstrated their agility and resiliency through these most turbulent times and thereby, have secured the company's position with our customers across the automotive market. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future. 
The mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased by a better-than-expected 51% from prior year with strength across all product types, including particularly in wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales declined by 35%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter and is within the typical range of first quarter seasonality that we have seen traditionally in the mobile devices market. 
Looking at the second quarter, we anticipate a further high single-digit sequential sales decline, which is also not atypical for this market in the second quarter. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and uniquely agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2021 and beyond. 
Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long term. Now turning to the mobile networks market. This market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and sales did grow from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically, as strength from products sold to OEMs was offset in part by a moderation of our sales to network operators. We were encouraged, though, to realize a better-than-expected sequential growth of 19% in the mobile networks market in the quarter as mobile network operators increased their spending on next-generation networks. 
Looking to the second quarter, we do expect a modest increase in sales from these first quarter levels, helped by the addition of Euromicron, which expands our offering for mobile networks operators in Europe and positions us well to support future network upgrades. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our position in next-generation equipment and systems around the world. And as our customers ramp up the investment of these advanced networks, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both original equipment manufacturers as well as mobile network service providers. 
The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the quarter were stronger than expected, rising 25% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically from prior year, really on broad-based strength across networking, storage and server applications. While we had expect sales to decline coming out of the fourth quarter, we were pleased to realize actually a sequential growth of 6% as customers continue to increase their demand for our high-technology products use service providers and in data centers around the world. Looking to the second quarter, we expect increase of sales in the mid-single digits from these levels as customer demand continues to accelerate. 
We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding technology position in the global datacom market. Our customers around the world, no doubt about it, are continuing to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power, significantly focused on enabling with high-speed, power and other interconnect products. the broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by very strong 16% from prior year as broadband spending levels remained elevated. 
On a sequential basis, sales grew slightly from the fourth quarter. We do expect to highlight sequential sales increase in the second quarter as customers continue to upgrade the capacity of their networks to support the significant increase in demand with and as we benefit from our recent acquisitions, including Cabelcon. The addition of Cabelcon and our for broadband customers in the European market to provide a more diversified range of products for their next-generation networks and the related upgrades. 
We look forward to continuing to offer this expanded product offering to broadband service operators around the world, all of whom are working to increase bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. Now turning to our outlook, and given the current still dynamic market environment as well as assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and constant exchange rates. 
For the second quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $2.415 billion to $2.475 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.55. This would represent strong sales growth of 22% to 25% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 33% to 38% compared to the second quarter of last year. And I would just note that the second quarter of last year, as you will recall, was already a strong recovery quarter for the company coming out of the first quarter. 
I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the ongoing challenges that are in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. The entire Amphenol organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And most importantly, I'd like to just take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be happy to take whatever questions there may be."

I mean first, relative to supply chain and our robust results in the first quarter, I mean I would tell you that across the board, customers want our product because their end customers, by and large, also need the prod",573,"Yes. Well, thanks very much, Chris. I mean first, relative to supply chain and our robust results in the first quarter, I mean I would tell you that across the board, customers want our product because their end customers, by and large, also need the product. Whether that's delivering IT datacom connectors that go into web service providers to satisfy the demand for bandwidth that is happening, whether it's automotive customers, scrambling to build as many cars as they can, given the low inventory -- low dealer inventories that are out there. We really saw customers taking product and converting that product into their end systems. And we don't -- obviously don't get full visibility into the warehouses of our customers, but we do get some visibility into the distribution channel. And there, we did not see any material increases in inventory or any noticeable inventory builds. I mean actually, to the contrary, our growth in distribution, our book-to-bill in distribution was not meaningfully higher than what we saw across the total company. Relative to the second quarter, look, we think there's a very strong guidance from server perspectives. First and foremost, there are these supply chain challenges. And I think some of these have been widely reported, in particular, in places like the automotive market, where I talked about, that we do see the automotive market, having a slight downtick in demand in the second quarter as certain customers have had to take factories offline or otherwise curtail production because of supply chain challenges. So there's no doubt that we see that. As well, when you look at on a year-over-year basis, our second quarter guidance, as I mentioned just a few moments ago, this is a very strong guidance, 25% growth at the high end of guidance, and that's on top of a second quarter last year where we had grown already 7% sequentially from the first quarter. You'll also remember that in our mobile devices business, we had a very strong comeback last year in the second quarter. And so that 25% comparison when seen in the context of last year, I think, is a very, very robust demand. In terms of the orders, yes, these are very strong orders that we received in the quarter. And could there be some customers who are maybe opening up the aperture of their order scheduling, ordering a little bit longer out. There could be some of that. I think we have some customers, there are many across the supply chain who are a little skittish because of some of the challenges that are so widely reported and that I'm sure all of you know even better than I do. And that can cause some customers to maybe order a little bit more in advance, not to build inventory per se, but to get it on the books. But look, all that being said, if you look at our orders on a year-over-year basis, they also grew at a similar rate to what our sales grew, about 27%, I think, was the order growth. And I think they're reflective of strong demand on our products from our customers, who we have consistently supported through all cycles of this crisis. And when you look at our performance across each of the individual markets, It's clear that customers are coming back to us because we were there for them when they needed us the most."

So I take everything with a grain of salt in particular, with the political system that we have now in the U.S. But look, I think we have a lot of our businesses that do stand to play a role in upgrading the infrastructure of the U.S., especially because infrastructure is being defined as I would think it should be in a very broad sense. It's not just roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and airports, which which would stimulate demand for a wide variety of products that we sell into heavy equipment and otherwise. But infrastructure means the domestic capacity to produce electronic components in certain cases. Infrastructure means bandwidth. Infrastructure means access to data, access to devices. And I think that all of these things ultimately today have a common threat, and that is that the adoption of electronics. And in turn, our ability to enable that adoption of electronics plays a significant role in the upgrade of those various elements of infrastructure. And so whatever the ends up coming out of kind of the sausage factory of Washington, if you will, there's no question to me that electronics is going to play a significant role in helping this country to upgrade its infrastructure in the broadest sense. And I think we're very well positioned across our end markets to play some constructive role in that."

Look, I think the numbers here a little bit speak for themselves. When you look at our overall growth, growing 28% or 23% organically in the quarter, or when you look at some of the individual markets where we had significant growth in a number of our markets, clearly outpacing the industry growth rate will be. And I'm not an expert in exactly what various industry growth rates are. But clearly, growing in industrial by 33% organically in automotive by 44% organically and mobile devices by 51% organically and IT datacom by 25%. Those are clearly ahead of the overall industry growth rates. And you're correct. I think there is a meaningful component of that growth, which is our ability to react quickly despite a very challenging environment. It should not be understated. There still remains many challenges today in the world, both with COVID and with the supply chain. But our ability to react quickly in an entrepreneurial and agile fashion, to satisfy the demand of customers when they need it, has been, I think, through this whole cycle, an extraordinary advantage that we brought to bear. And as customers think for the long term about with whom do they want to partner, it's going to be very hard to forget who was there for you when the chips were down at the greatest moment. Who was there for you during the depths of the pandemic when bandwidth was at set a premium and factories were closing all over place because of shutdown orders and the spread of the virus. And who was there to react when you needed to help you support your end customers. And I think that is something that our customers reflect on, integrate into their buying behavior, incorporate into their decisions about who should be their partner going forward. And so does that mean that we have a high potential to continue to outpace the market. And we've outgrown the market for now 2 decades. And I think that this just reinforces for our customers why having Amphenol as your first phone call, is a really important principle and a very helpful way to run your supply chain"

And then second, do they have unique enabling technologies that ultimately solve real problems for their customers. And then when we found those companies, we don't focus on either growth or on improvement in operating performance. We try to do both of those things. And our acquisition program, which has been so successful over so many years, has really been successful because we were able to find ways to accelerate the growth of those companies and find ways to improve their operating performance. And so I would say that the 3 acquisitions that we're talking about today, of course, MTS being far and a way bigger than Euromicron or Cabelcon, they all share that great potential, both from a top line growth perspective, taking advantage of being part of Amphenol, taking advantage of being part of a global company with strong partnership, preferred supplier relationships with customers across all of our end markets, but also being part of a company that has access to low-cost manufacturing when appropriate, who has access to collaborative initiatives across the company from a technology or sourcing perspective that ultimately can help to drive better operating performance. And so I would say with these 3 companies, we think that they all have great growth and profitability improvement potential despite their very different scales."

Thanks, Matt. Yes, I mean, I just want to start by saying we are actually extremely proud of the ability of to achieve these strong operating margins in the first quarter, I mean, 19.6% in this challenging environment, but we still have COVID costs. And then on top of that, we've seen certainly increasingly challenging commodity and supply chain environment. I think it's really just a great achievement, and I really -- I'm happy with the performance of the general managers to be able to offset some of these costs that they're seeing. The reality is, is that we have seen increasing challenging environment as we come into the first quarter. To quantify that is a little bit difficult. But I think the way I would think about it is that if you -- as we kind of came into the first quarter from the fourth quarter, sequentially, we would expect a typical close to 30% kind of sequential downside conversion. So really, the gap between that is -- the vast majority of that, I think, is really the pressures from the the commodity and supply chain environment. I mean there is some small component related to some of the acquisitions of Positronic as well as Euromicron that we closed earlier in the quarter. But the vast majority really would be that kind of cost environment that we're seeing some headwinds from. In terms of how long that will last, I mean there's certainly -- we're doing -- I think the team again doing a good job of trying to offset some of that, I think, through taking some cost actions and over time, maybe also through passing on some of those increases to customers to the extent you can do it within the factories. But I don't think this is necessarily something that we're going to be able to necessarily get through in the quarter. So that certainly still included in kind of our second quarter guidance that we gave is expect to still have some of those headwinds we haven't guided to the rest of the year. So I guess I won't comment on that. But certainly, I think that this environment that we find ourselves in now, I'm very happy with kind of what we've been able to achieve in terms of offsetting a certain level of those costs. But I think that the reality is that the -- we're probably sitting here at least for another quarter here with some of those cost headwinds that we see today."

There are certain parts of this, which are pretty significant cost differences in commodities, for example, I mean, they're all very well reported. And the way that Amphenol operates is we have close to 125 general managers around the world. And each of them is really tuning their operation in light of the costs that are hitting them, in particular. So you take an example, a general manager in our cable business, which has a very high component of material cost, very significant in our cable segment, there's not a choice, but to go and work with customers and to make sure you take a leadership position in adjusting price to account for those commodity prices. And we would certainly expect that others in the industry would have that same dynamic. And that's just one example of how it goes. But the beauty is that these general managers have every tool available to them to adjust whether it's from the price you sell to the customer to every element of cost are all in the power of the general managers. And when you see a sudden increase in some of these things, it can take a short while to work through it.

I mean, look, the answer I'll give you is really 2 sides. The answer is no. We think that our approach, our culture, the unique entrepreneurial organizational structure that we have had in Amphenol for many decades is uniquely tailored to an environment like we've been in and to an environment like we headed into. But the other answer is yes, every day, meaning we're making changes every day. We're not making those changes from here at headquarters. We're not deciding on a blanket like we're going to go out of one country and go into this country or we're going to increase our inventory this much or we're going to change how we're sourcing things. But those general managers around the world are every day making course corrections. And some of them pretty significant course corrections in the moment to react to the environment that is around them. So when tariffs came in, you'll remember this already. It seems like so long ago that there was the thing called tariffs several years ago. But our team immediately reacted to that in every way possible from moving production to changing logistical flows, to doing lots of other things to passing on the price to customers when there was no other option. And that was a real time in the moment kind of transformation, but not at a corporate level, rather it was at the individual operating unit levels. And I think as we've gone through the pandemic as we see the very robust demand coming out of this part of the cycle, we're making lots of changes every day to make sure that we remain the most competitive that we are able to outperform the market at the highest degree possible and that we're able to deliver to the bottom line, superior operating profitability and ultimately convert that to cash. And those are just day-to-day decisions that are made by our general managers, obviously, in some consultation with us. But ultimately, the proof, I think, is really in the pudding of that approach."

I think you're roughly accurate about the operating margins with MTS. Obviously, there will be some amortization, and we include amortization in our numbers, so that can have a little bit of a downward impact on the operating margins. But you're right. I mean every company who comes into Amphenol thinks about how are they going to achieve ultimately, that growth in margins to get up to the Amphenol corporate average or above. Obviously, an average is just an average, and there are some above and some below. And I would tell you that the management team in the MTS Sensors business is an extraordinarily capable team of individuals. The gentleman who leads that business, who led the business inside of MTS, who, by the way, led the predecessor family-owned company that was acquired by MTS. I mean this is just truly outstanding individual who also like to see that this company is doing as well as his sister companies. And there's no doubt about it that there's a little bit of peer pressure inside of Amphenol when you come in and see the the margins of your peers. And something tells me that that's an organization that does not want to be below the average. And how long is that going to take? That's always a question. But when there's is a will, there's a way. And I think this is a team that has extraordinary will to make that happen. In terms of the markets with the MDS Sensors business, I talked already that they have strong position in industrial and military and then in commercial air and automotive, roughly in that order, I would say, in terms of magnitude. And they participate in just some of the most exciting applications within those. MTS mix products, that they're really at the cutting edge of the harsh environment, high-performance requirements of some of these systems. So when you're making like a turbine, and that turbine, be it a gas turbine or a windmill, and you want to know that, that thing is operating with good function and smoothly and that there's no issues inside the turbine. You're going to use a sensor from MTS, a number of sensors, let me say, that are going to be in the most harsh of environments, hot, out in the middle of the ocean, you name it, that are going to ultimately tell you is your system working or not and you need to go maintain that. That's just one example of these extraordinary harsh environment vibration, force, pressure and position sensors that they sell. I had the good fortune to go around to several of the factories just in the last couple of weeks. And I had been there, of course, before, but going now as the owner is a little bit different. And not only do you see products that are truly at the high leading edge of sensor technology, but these are sensor products where the harsh environment interconnect packaging of those sensors is almost of equal import to the good functioning of the product in the systems where they participate. And so we see just great opportunities in the industrial market across many segments of the industrial market, in the military market, as I spoke earlier, where we have already a leading position in military interconnect. We're just really excited to now have a significant position also in sensors in the military market as well in automotive and in commercial air. And so we see great opportunities really across the markets of MTS and look forward to taking full advantage for many years to come."

I don't know that I would necessarily say that I'm kind of calling a bottom, so to speak. But Clearly, the rate is declining. The rate of decline on a sequential basis is getting smaller. It's down by just 3% sequentially in the quarter, which is, I guess, a green shoot of encouragement, if you will. But the commercial air market has a tough road ahead of it. And our team working in that market is doing everything they can to continue to diversify their business to make sure that the products that they sell, which have other applications are being proliferated and we're re devoting resources to designing in those products into other applications, where they can be very enabling technologies such that when the commercial air market does eventually come back, which it will.

And we've heard some say that the ability to like leverage all of their individual businesses as 1 big customer kind of gives them leverage at suppliers. I think you guys are probably going the other way. Can you kind of talk about how the structure of Amphenol as kind of small independent companies essentially gives them an advantage when sourcing? Is it because some of these businesses are small enough that there -- it's not a big quantity that they need? Can you maybe just talk us through that relative to some other maybe ways to accomplish that?"

And so at the end of the day, sourcing happens under the purview of those 125 general managers around the world. And sometimes it's good to be small and sometimes it's good to be big. And what we try to do is we present ourselves as whichever is most beneficial in the moment. So we oftentimes are a few general managers who buy a common material will work together and they may go together to a vendor. That's what gets us the results that we need. But in other cases, it's a very local decision where maybe a purchasing person says to a local sales rep, hey, just sneak me what I need here, no one's going to notice. And in between both of those, there's a whole spectrum of techniques, strategies, tactics that our supply chain team around the world will be taking. The most important principle there is this. If you have supply chain disconnected from the business, it's actually really hard to decide, ultimately, am I doing the right thing? How do I -- what if I need to redesign something? Well, if there's this monolithic engineering team and a monolithic sourcing team and the sourcing team says, we can't get this part, we need to redesign it, and it has to go sort of up and down the corporate chain to get that redesigned resources to be allocated to convince the engineer to do so, that can be a very laborious process. Whereas in our organization, the purchasing person is sitting in the door right next to the engineering person reporting to the General Manager whose 2 doors down from her. And they can just get in the room together and say, look, we can't find this thing, let's redesign it right now, let's reallocate the resources, let's make it happen. And it's that kind of real time connected to the business approach. Whether it is dealing with shortages, whether it's dealing with logistical challenges, whether it's dealing with quality issues, whether it's dealing with new design, whatever, we've always found that, that approach can be very effective. But we try to be what will make us be the most successful, let's say that."

But what I would tell you is our team in all regions really performed very strongly here. And we saw great growth really across the board, across the regions. And we saw disproportionate growth from new programs that we're -- that we've long worked to design ourselves in on relative to EVs. But it wasn't exclusively EVs. We saw growth in lots of other new platforms as well. And I think our long-term share gains in the automotive market, and I referenced this earlier, is really a function of us focusing our efforts on next-generation technologies in car, next-generation systems, next-generation applications, everything from passenger comfort and connectivity to safety, to engine management, emissions control and obviously, high voltage related to EVs and hybrid EVs. And I think all of those things are helping us to outperform the broader market in a quarter like we just had here in the first quarter, but also over a very long time period. We're really talking about the better part of the decade, where we have had a relatively consistent performance that is a decent amount, if not far in excess of the underlying unit production volumes that are out there. So there's not like 1 silver bullet to this. I think it's been a collective approach. It's been our acquisition program, where we've added new companies, both interconnect, antenna and sensor companies. And it's a lot of work on engineering of next-generation systems that go into these cars across all of the regions. And I think when you put all that together, ultimately, we've seen strong performance."

But we've always talked about the fact that our team has been working diligently over many years to design in our products into next-generation systems and networks, be they 5G or otherwise. And I think we start to see kind of some early progress with that here in the first quarter. And to the extent that operators are expanding their investment, we would hope to benefit from that. It may not always be in a perfect quarter-to-quarter correlation. We don't have a position with absolutely every operator with the exact same degree of success. But we have a very strong position on the equipment, that is really going to enable 5G for the long term.

Yes. No, you picked up on the very astutely. We participate in the electrification of vehicles, whether those are passenger vehicles or commercial vehicles, and both have been really great drivers for us in recent quarters and years. And in the industrial, we talk about that industrial battery and the heavy vehicles. There's a wide range of vehicles that are undergoing electrification right now from big trucks and there's plenty of news media around that to postal vehicles and trash trucks and buses and goods vehicles, delivery vans, you name it. And so all of that is what we classify really in our industrial business or industrial market as that battery heavy vehicle. And then when we talk about automotive, the hybrid EV, that's really passenger cars and the related products. In addition, we think about the charging infrastructure for electrification as really an infrastructure piece and that we think about in our Industrial business as well. And that's all -- those are all components of areas where we've seen strong performance in -- certainly in the first quarter and over a number of years and look forward to that. Because I think if you confine your view of electrification just to passenger vehicles, you're missing a really exciting area of the electronics revolution, which is that electrification more broadly. By the way, I mean, we're working as well with the Department of Defense in certain countries on the electrification of military vehicles, which, I think, is going to be a long process. But over the long term, we see that as an area that can also be another benefit and another growth lever along this just real kind of, call it, a megatrend, if you will, of electrification across kind of all things that move."

This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO. And I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2021 conference call, and our first quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions.  
As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, as a result of our previously announced 2-for-1 stock split effective on March 4, 2021, all share and per share data discussed on this earnings call is on a post-split basis.  
The company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.377 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.53 and $0.52, respectively. Sales were up 28% in U.S. dollars, 25% local currencies and 23% organically compared to the first quarter of 2020. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in U.S. dollars, 3% in local currencies and 4% organically. Orders for the quarter were $2.734 billion, which was up 27% compared to the first quarter of 2020 and up 9% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.15:1.  
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. The interconnect business, which comprised 96% of sales, was up 28% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year. Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 17% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year's.  
Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $465 million in the first quarter of 2021. Operating margin of 19.6% was down 100 basis points sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 adjusted operating margin and up a strong 260 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year improvement in operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, combined with the benefit of a lower cost impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment.  
The sequential decline in operating margin was driven by normal conversion on the reduced sales levels as well as a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment. From a segment standpoint, the interconnect segment -- in the interconnect segment, margins were 21.5% in the first quarter of 2021, which increased from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2020 and decreased 100 basis points sequentially.  
In the cable segment, margins were 8.8%, which increased from 7.6% in the first quarter of 2020 and decreased from 10.3% in the fourth quarter. Given the continuing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are very proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which has enabled us to capitalize on the many opportunities for incremental sales, while driving strong operating performance in this very dynamic market environment. 
The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.9%, which compared to 15.9% in the first quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in the first quarter of both 2021 and 2020. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS increased by 33% to $0.53 compared to $0.40 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 49% to $0.52 from 35% -- $0.35 in the first quarter of 2020.  
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $321 million in the first quarter or 97% of GAAP net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $243 million or 74% of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 73 and 59 days, respectively, all within their normal ranges.  
During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $153 million. And during the month of April, the company repurchased a small amount of remaining stock authorized under our existing stock repurchase plan. As a result and as mentioned in today's earnings release, yesterday, the company's Board of Directors approved a new 3-year open market stock repurchase plan for the purchase of up to $2 billion of the company's common stock. 
At March 31, cash and short-term investments were $2.4 billion, of which $963 million was held in the U.S., with the remainder held outside of the U.S. The elevated level of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter was driven by borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program in anticipation of the MTS closing in early April. Total debt was $4.6 billion, and net debt was $2.3 billion. Total available liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, which included total cash and short-term investments on hand. First quarter 2021 EBITDA was $559 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.0x. 
Following the close of the quarter, on April 7, we completed the acquisition of MTS, which Adam will discuss in more detail in a moment. The MTS acquisition was funded by a combination of cash and cash equivalents on hand as well as additional borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program. On a pro forma basis, including the MTS acquisition and the anticipated divestiture of the test and simulation business, total available liquidity and net leverage at March 31, 2020 would be $3.2 billion and 1.4x, respectively. Until the divestiture of the MTS test and simulation business has closed, we will account for and report the test and simulation business as a discontinued operation.  
As such, the expected sales and earnings of the test and simulation business are not included in our guidance. Our guidance also excludes cash and noncash expenses that will be expensed in the second quarter related to the MTS acquisition. These expenses, which we expect to total approximately $85 million or $0.12 per share, include costs related to the early extinguishment of debt, noncash purchase accounting-related expenses, external transaction expenses, severance and other costs. In conjunction with the divestiture of the test and simulation business, the company will also incur certain additional cash tax-related and other acquisition-related costs, which will not be included in income from continuing operations.  
Our guidance does incorporate the expected results of the MTS Sensors business, which as previously announced, is expected to generate $350 million in sales and $0.05 in diluted EPS in the first 12 months after closing. 
I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends as well as our recently completed acquisitions."

And I certainly hope that you, your family, your friends and all of your colleagues are continuing to stay safe and healthy. As Craig mentioned,",2497,"Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to also extend my welcome to everybody on the call here today. And I certainly hope that you, your family, your friends and all of your colleagues are continuing to stay safe and healthy. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the first quarter. I'll then discuss our trends and our progress across our diversified served markets. And then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll have time for Q&A at the end.  
Our results in the first quarter were substantially better than we had expected coming into the quarter as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales as well as adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 28% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currencies. And on an organic basis, sales increased by 23%. And we had organic growth in nearly all of our end markets and driven particularly by growth in the automotive, mobile devices, industrial and IT datacom markets. And I'll talk about each of those markets in a few moments.  
Craig mentioned, we booked record orders in the quarter of $2.734 billion, and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.15:1. Despite continuing to face a range of operational challenges related to the ongoing pandemic as well as increased costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures, our operating margins were very healthy in the quarter, reaching 19.6%, which was a 260 basis point increase from last year's levels.  
Craig mentioned our adjusted diluted EPS grew a very robust 49% from prior year, which is again an excellent reflection of the Amphenol organization's strong execution. We generated operating and free cash flow of $321 million and $243 million in the first quarter, respectively, both clear reflections of the high quality of the company's earnings. I just want to say how proud I am of our team this quarter. And our results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the very dynamic and challenging environment.  
And I'd like to make a few comments on our acquisitions in the quarter. As you can tell, our small acquisition team here in Wallingford was very busy in the first quarter, closing 3 additional acquisitions since our last earnings release and bringing our total number of acquisitions closed this year to 5. First, as we announced on April 7, we were very pleased to close on the acquisition of MTS Systems earlier than originally anticipated. 
Also, as previously announced, we had signed an agreement to sell the MTS test and simulation business to Illinois Tool Works for a sale price of $750 million. And that is -- that remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments and excludes transaction-related expenses. We expect this sale to close following the receipt of all required regulatory approvals.  
We're really excited to welcome the talented MTS Sensors team to the Amphenol family. We especially look forward to the strength of the combined breadth of our company's highly complementary sensor product portfolios, which, we believe, will enable us to offer our customers an expanded array of innovative technologies across multiple end markets.  
We expect the MTS Sensors business to add approximately $350 million of sales and $0.05 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first 12 months after closing. More importantly, though, we look forward to realizing the long-term benefits of the opportunities created by the collective strengths of Amphenol and MTS Sensors for many years to come. We're truly excited about this significant acquisition, which ultimately has positioned Amphenol as one of the broadest and most diversified sensor companies in the industry. 
In addition to the MTS acquisition, we also closed on 2 other small acquisitions during the first quarter. In February, we acquired Euromicron, a manufacturer of highly engineered fiber optic interconnect solutions for the mobile networks and IT datacom markets. Based in Germany, with annual sales of approximately $25 million, Euromicron represents a great addition to our interconnect product offering for customers across the European communications market.  
And then in March, we completed the acquisition of Cabelcon from Corning Inc. Cabelcon, which also has sales of approximately $25 million, is a Denmark-based designer and manufacturer of high-technology connectors and interconnect assemblies, primarily for customers in the European broadband market. As we welcome these outstanding companies to the Amphenol family, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.  
Now turning to our trends across our served markets. I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create great value. We believe this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while continuing to expose us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. This diversification has become ever more valuable given the many market dynamics related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Now turning first to the military market. The military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And as we had expected coming into the quarter, sales grew by 3% from prior year and were essentially flat organically with growth in naval, unmanned aerial vehicles, communications and vehicle ground systems, offset by declines or flat performance in other applications. Sequentially, our sales were modestly down by about 3%. 
Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to grow in the low double digits from these first quarter levels as we benefit from the addition of MTS Sensors together with the increased demand for interconnect products. We're especially excited by the addition of the sensors products of MTS to our military product offering. Together with our already leading interconnect products as well as our broad exposure across virtually all defense programs, we look forward to supporting the continued adoption of next-generation electronics into a wide array of military hardware.  
The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. And not surprisingly, and as expected, sales were down significantly, declining by 47% from prior year as the commercial aircraft market continued to experience unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the ongoing pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry. Sequentially, our sales were a bit better than expected, moderating by just 3% from the fourth quarter.  
And looking into the second quarter, we do expect a sequential improvement in sales as we benefit from our recently completed acquisitions. Regardless of the ongoing challenging environment in commercial air, our team working in this market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those airplanes.  
The industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in industrial in the first quarter were better than expected, growing a very strong 33% in U.S. dollars and 33% organically. This was driven by robust growth in battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, instrumentation, factory automation, alternative energy and medical, really a broad performance across many of the segments. On a sequential basis, sales grew by a better-than-expected 6% versus the fourth quarter. 
Looking into the second quarter, we expect the industrial market to once again grow in the low teens versus the first quarter. And as we benefit from the addition of MTS Sensors, while continuing to gain momentum in many segments of the industrial market. The acquisition of MTS Sensors has expanded our range of sensors sold into the industrial market, adding position, vibration, force and shock sensors that are used in a wide array of industrial applications.  
Together with our existing sensor operations, we now have a diversified range of sensors supporting virtually all of the segments of the industrial market that we serve. I remain truly proud of our team working across the industrial market around the world. Our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering positions us strongly with customers who are accelerating their adoption of electronics, no matter the application. The automotive market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in this market were also much stronger than we expected, growing 52% in U.S. dollars and 44% organically, as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market.  
In particular, we saw very strong growth of our products that are used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles in the quarter. A great confirmation of our global team's long-term efforts at designing in high-voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these important next-generation platforms. Sequentially, our sales increased by 6% from the fourth quarter. 
Now as has been widely reported, there are a variety of supply chain challenges facing the automotive industry. Accordingly, as we look towards the second quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in sales as the global supply chain disruptions temporarily impact certain pockets of new vehicle production. I'm extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They have really demonstrated their agility and resiliency through these most turbulent times and thereby, have secured the company's position with our customers across the automotive market. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future.  
The mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased by a better-than-expected 51% from prior year, with strength across all product types, including particularly in wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales declined by 35%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter and is within the typical range of first quarter seasonality that we have seen traditionally in the mobile devices market.  
Looking at the second quarter, we anticipate a further high single-digit sequential sales decline, which is also not atypical for this market in the second quarter. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and uniquely agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2021 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long term. 
Now turning to the mobile networks market. This market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and sales did grow from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically, as strength from products sold to OEMs was offset in part by a moderation of our sales to network operators. We were encouraged, though, to realize a better-than-expected sequential growth of 19% in the mobile networks market in the quarter as mobile network operators increased their spending on next-generation networks.  
Looking to the second quarter, we do expect a modest increase in sales from these first quarter levels, helped by the addition of Euromicron, which expands our offering for mobile networks operators in Europe and positions us well to support future network upgrades. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our position in next-generation equipment and systems around the world. And as our customers ramp up the investment of these advanced networks, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both original equipment manufacturers as well as mobile network service providers.  
The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the quarter were stronger than expected, rising 25% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically from prior year, really on broad-based strength across networking, storage and server applications. While we had expect sales to decline coming out of the fourth quarter, we were pleased to realize actually a sequential growth of 6% as customers continue to increase their demand for our high-technology products, use service providers and in data centers around the world. Looking to the second quarter, we expect a further increase of sales in the mid-single digits from these levels as customer demand continues to accelerate.  
We remain very encouraged by the company's outstanding technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers around the world, no doubt about it, are continuing to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom with our unique, high-speed, power and other interconnect products. Finally, the broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by a very strong 16% from prior year as broadband spending levels remained elevated. 
On a sequential basis, sales grew slightly from the fourth quarter. We do expect a high-teens sequential sales increase in the second quarter as customers continue to upgrade the capacity of their networks to support the significant increase in demand for bandwidth and as we benefit from our recent acquisitions, including Cabelcon. The addition of Cabelcon expands our offering for broadband customers in the European market, which enables us to provide a more diversified range of products for their next-generation networks and the related upgrades.  
We look forward to continuing to offer this expanded product offering to broadband service operators around the world, all of whom are working to increase bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. 
Now turning to our outlook, and given the current still dynamic market environment as well as assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and constant exchange rates. For the second quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $2.415 billion to $2.475 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.55. This would represent strong sales growth of 22% to 25% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 33% to 38% compared to the second quarter of last year. And I would just note that the second quarter of last year, as you will recall, was already a strong recovery quarter for the company coming out of the first quarter.  
I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the ongoing challenges that are in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. The entire Amphenol organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. 
And most importantly, I'd like to just take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be happy to take whatever questions there may be."

If you look across the end markets, just given the really -- or the stronger-than-expected growth, did you see any inventory building across any of the end markets? And then kind of staying on that supply chain, as we look into Q2, the top line guidance seems a bit light relative to the Q1 orders and the 1.15 book-to-bill. I mean is there an implication here that deliveries may be pushed out to the right a little bit, just given all the supply chain disruptions we're seeing?"
24827,710567264,2261279,"Amphenol Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Amphenol Corporation","Executives","Yes. Well, thanks very much, Chris. I mean first, relative to supply chain and our robust results in the first quarter, I mean I would tell you that across the board, customers want our product because their end customers, by and large, also need the prod",573,"Yes. Well, thanks very much, Chris. I mean first, relative to supply chain and our robust results in the first quarter, I mean I would tell you that across the board, customers want our product because their end customers, by and large, also need the product. Whether that's delivering IT datacom connectors that go into web service providers to satisfy the demand for bandwidth that is happening, whether it's automotive customers scrambling to build as many cars as they can, given the low inventory -- low dealer inventories that are out there, we really saw customers taking product and converting that product into their end systems. 
And we don't -- obviously don't get full visibility into the warehouses of our customers, but we do get some visibility into the distribution channel. And there, we did not see any material increases in inventory or any noticeable inventory builds. I mean actually, to the contrary, our growth in distribution, our book-to-bill in distribution was not meaningfully higher than what we saw across the total company. 
Relative to the second quarter, look, we think there's a very strong guidance from several perspectives. First and foremost, there are these supply chain challenges. And I think some of these have been widely reported, in particular, in places like the automotive market, where I talked about that we do see the automotive market having a slight downtick in demand in the second quarter as certain customers have had to take factories offline or otherwise curtail production because of supply chain challenges. So there's no doubt that we see that. 
As well, when you look at, on a year-over-year basis, our second quarter guidance, as I mentioned just a few moments ago, this is a very strong guidance, 25% growth at the high end of guidance. And that's on top of a second quarter last year where we had grown already 7% sequentially from the first quarter. You'll also remember that in our mobile devices business, we had a very strong comeback last year in the second quarter. And so that 25% comparison, when seen in the context of last year, I think, is a very, very robust demand. 
In terms of the orders, yes, these are very strong orders that we received in the quarter. And could there be some customers who are maybe opening up the aperture of their order scheduling, ordering a little bit longer out? There could be some of that. I think we have some customers, there are many across the supply chain who are a little skittish because of some of the challenges that are so widely reported and that I'm sure all of you know even better than I do, and that can cause some customers to maybe order a little bit more in advance, not to build inventory per se, but to get it on the books. 
But look, all that being said, if you look at our orders on a year-over-year basis, they also grew at a similar rate to what our sales grew, about 27%, I think, was the order growth. And I think they're reflective of strong demand on our products from our customers, who we have consistently supported through all cycles of this crisis. And when you look at our performance across each of the individual markets, it's clear that customers are coming back to us because we were there for them when they needed us the most."

So I take everything with a grain of salt, in particular, with the political system that we have now in the U.S. But look, I think we have a lot of our businesses that do stand to play a role in upgrading the infrastructure of the U.S., especially because infrastructure is being defined, as I would think it should be, in a very broad sense. 
It's not just roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and airports, which would stimulate demand for a wide variety of products that we sell into heavy equipment and otherwise. But infrastructure means the domestic capacity to produce electronic components in certain cases. Infrastructure means bandwidth. Infrastructure means access to data, access to devices. And I think that all of these things ultimately today have a common thread, and that is that the adoption of electronics and, in turn, our ability to enable that adoption of electronics, plays a significant role in the upgrade of those various ""elements"" of infrastructure. 
And so whatever the -- ends up coming out of kind of the sausage factory at Washington, if you will, there's no question to me that electronics is going to play a significant role in helping this country to upgrade its infrastructure in the broadest sense. And I think we're very well positioned across our end markets to play some constructive role in that."

Look, I think the numbers here a little bit speak for themselves. When you look at our overall growth, growing 28% or 23% organically in the quarter, or when you look at some of the individual markets where we had significant growth in a number of our markets, clearly outpacing whatever the industry growth rate will be. And I'm not an expert in exactly what various industry growth rates are. But clearly, growing in industrial by 33% organically and automotive by 44% organically and mobile devices by 51% organically and IT datacom by 25%. Those are clearly ahead of the overall industry growth rates. 
And you're correct. I think there is a meaningful component of that growth, which is our ability to react quickly, despite a very challenging environment. It should not be understated. There still remains many challenges today in the world, both with COVID and with the supply chain. But our ability to react quickly in an entrepreneurial and agile fashion to satisfy the demand of customers when they need it has been, I think, through this whole cycle, an extraordinary advantage that we brought to bear. 
And as customers think for the long term about with whom do they want to partner, it's going to be very hard to forget who was there for you when the chips were down at the greatest moment. Who was there for you during the depths of the pandemic when bandwidth was at such a premium and factories were closing all over place because of shutdown orders and the spread of the virus, and who was there to react when you needed to help you support your end customers. And I think that is something that our customers reflect on, integrate into their buying behavior, incorporate into their decisions about who should be their partner going forward. 
And so does that mean that we have a high potential to continue to outpace the market? And we've outgrown the market for now 2 decades. And I think that this just reinforces for our customers why having Amphenol as your first phone call is a really important principle and a very helpful way to run your supply chain."

And our acquisition program, which has been so successful over so many years, has really been successful because we were able to find ways to accelerate the growth of those companies and find ways to improve their operating performance. And so I would say that the 3 acquisitions that we're talking about today, of course, MTS being far and away bigger than Euromicron or Cabelcon, they all share that great potential, both from a top line growth perspective, taking advantage of being part of Amphenol, taking advantage of being part of a global company with strong partnership, preferred supplier relationships with customers across all of our end markets, but also being part of a company that has access to low-cost manufacturing when appropriate, who has access to collaborative initiatives across the company from a technology or sourcing perspective that ultimately can help to drive better operating performance.

Yes, I mean, I just want to start by saying we are actually extremely proud of the ability to achieve these strong operating margins in the first quarter, I mean, 19.6% in this challenging environment while we still have COVID costs. And then on top of that, we've seen certainly increasingly challenging commodity and supply chain environment. I think it's really just a great achievement, and I really am happy with the performance of the general managers to be able to offset some of these costs that they're seeing. 
The reality is, is that we have seen increasing challenging environment as we come into the first quarter. To quantify that is a little bit difficult. But I think the way I would think about it is that if you -- as we kind of came into the first quarter from the fourth quarter, sequentially, we would expect a typical close to 30% kind of sequential downside conversion. So really, the gap between that is -- the vast majority of that, I think, is really the pressures from the commodity and supply chain environment. I mean there is some small component related to some of the acquisitions of Positronic as well as Euromicron that we closed earlier in the quarter. But the vast majority really would be that kind of cost environment that we're seeing some headwinds from. 
In terms of how long that will last, I mean there's certainly -- we're doing -- I think the team is again doing a good job of trying to offset some of that, I think, through taking some cost actions and over time, maybe also through passing on some of those increases to customers to the extent you can't do it within the factories. But I don't think this is necessarily something that we're going to be able to necessarily get through in the quarter. So that certainly is still included in kind of our second quarter guidance that we gave is expect to still have some of those headwinds we haven't guided to the rest of the year. So I guess I won't comment on that. 
But certainly, I think that this environment that we find ourselves in now, I'm very happy with kind of what we've been able to achieve in terms of offsetting a certain level of those costs. But I think that the reality is that the -- we're probably sitting here at least for another quarter here with some of those cost headwinds that we see today."

There are certain parts of this, which are pretty significant cost differences in commodities, for example. I mean, they're all very well reported. And the way that Amphenol operates is we have close to 125 general managers around the world, and each of them is really tuning their operation in light of the costs that are hitting them, in particular. 
So you take an example, a general manager in our cable business, which has a very high component of material cost, very significant in our cable segment, there's not a choice, but to go and work with customers and to make sure you take a leadership position in adjusting price to account for those commodity prices. And we would certainly expect that others in the industry would have that same dynamic. And that's just one example of how it goes. 
But the beauty is that these general managers have every tool available to them to adjust, whether it's from the price you sell to the customer, to every element of cost are all in the power of the general managers. And when you see a sudden increase in some of these things, it can take a short while to work through it.

The answer is no, we think that our approach, our culture, the unique entrepreneurial organizational structure that we have had in Amphenol for many decades is uniquely tailored to an environment like we've been in and to an environment like we're headed into. But the other answer is yes, every day, meaning we're making changes every day. We're not making those changes from here at headquarters. We're not deciding on a blanket approach like we're going to go out of one country and go into this country, or we're going to increase our inventory this much or we're going to change how we're sourcing things. But those general managers around the world are every day making course corrections. And some of them pretty significant course corrections in the moment to react to the environment that is around them. 
So when tariffs came in, you'll remember this already, it seems like so long ago that there was the thing called tariffs several years ago. But our team immediately reacted to that in every way possible from moving production to changing logistical flows, to doing lots of other things to passing on the price to customers when there was no other option. And that was a real-time, in the moment kind of transformation, but not at a corporate level, rather it was at the individual operating unit levels. 
And I think as we've gone through the pandemic, as we see the very robust demand coming out of this part of the cycle, we're making lots of changes every day to make sure that we remain the most competitive, that we are able to outperform the market at the highest degree possible and that we're able to deliver to the bottom line superior operating profitability and ultimately convert that to cash. And those are just day-to-day decisions that are made by our general managers, obviously, in some consultation with us. But ultimately, the proof, I think, is really in the pudding of that approach."

I think you're roughly accurate about the operating margins with MTS. Obviously, there will be some amortization, and we include amortization in our numbers, so that they can have a little bit of downward impact on the operating margins. But you're right, I mean every company who comes into Amphenol thinks about how are they going to achieve, ultimately, that growth in margins to get up to the Amphenol corporate average or above. 
Obviously, an average is just an average, and there are some above and some below. And I would tell you that the management team in the MTS Sensors business is an extraordinarily capable team of individuals. The gentleman who leads that business, who led the business inside of MTS, who, by the way, led the predecessor family-owned company that was acquired by MTS, I mean this is a just truly outstanding individual who also likes to see that his company is doing as well as his sister companies. And there's no doubt about it that there's a little bit of peer pressure inside of Amphenol when you come in and see the margins of your peers. And something tells me that that's an organization that does not want to be below the average. And how long is that going to take? That's always a question. But when there's is a will, there's a way. And I think this is a team that has an extraordinary will to make that happen. 
In terms of the markets with the MTS Sensors business, I talked already that they have strong position in industrial and military and then in commercial air and automotive, roughly in that order, I would say, in terms of magnitude. And they participate in just some of the most exciting applications within those. MTS makes products that are really at the cutting edge of the harsh environment, high-performance requirements of some of these systems. So when you're making like a turbine, and that turbine, be it a gas turbine or a windmill, and you want to know that, that thing is operating with good function and smoothly and that there's no issues inside the turbine. You're going to use a sensor from MTS, or a number of sensors, let me say, that are going to be in the most harsh of environments, hot, out in the middle of the ocean, you name it, that are going to ultimately tell you, is your system working or not and do you need to go maintain that. That's just one example of these extraordinary harsh environment vibration, force, pressure and position sensors that they sell. 
I had the good fortune to go around to several of the factories just in the last couple of weeks. And had been there, of course, before. But going now as the owner is a little bit different. And not only do you see products that are truly at the high leading edge of sensor technology, but these are sensor products where the harsh environment interconnect packaging of those sensors is almost of equal import to the good functioning of the product in the systems where they participate. 
And so we see just great opportunities in the industrial market, across many segments of the industrial market, in the military market, as I spoke earlier, where we have already a leading position in military interconnect. We're just really excited to now have a significant position also in sensors in the military market as well in automotive and in commercial air. And so we see great opportunities really across the markets of MTS and look forward to taking full advantage for many years to come."

Yes, I mean, it's a tough time in the commercial air market. There's no doubt about it. I mean it's hard to think of a market that was not -- that was more heavily impacted over the last 1.5 years than the commercial air market. It represents now just 2% of our sales. And we did guide it up sequentially in the quarter ahead. Although I would say that that's really the impact of the MTS Sensors acquisition. I don't know that I would necessarily say that I'm kind of calling a bottom, so to speak. But clearly, the rate is declining. The rate of decline on a sequential basis is getting smaller. It's down by just 3% sequentially in the quarter, which is, I guess, a green shoot of encouragement, if you will. 
But the commercial air market has a tough road ahead of it. And our team working in that market is doing everything they can to continue to diversify their business to make sure that the products that they sell, which have other applications, are being proliferated and we're re-devoting resources to designing in those products into other applications, where they can be very enabling technologies such that when the commercial air market does eventually come back, which it will, we're not going back to horses and buggies, we will be flying again one day. And I hope to be doing so very soon after I get my second shot tomorrow morning together with Craig. That market will come back. And when it comes back, our operations working in that market will be stronger than ever because they will have taken this opportunity to diversify themselves, diversify their product sets, leverage their resources in a broader fashion. And I think that's the way to deal with a crisis like this, and that's always been the Amphenol way."

Is it because some of these businesses are small enough that they're -- it's not a big quantity that they need?

And so at the end of the day, sourcing happens under the purview of those 125 general managers around the world. And sometimes it's good to be small and sometimes it's good to be big. And what we try to do is we present ourselves as whichever is most beneficial in the moment. So we oftentimes are a few general managers who buy a common material will work together and they may go together to a vendor. That's what gets us the results that we need. But in other cases, it's a very local decision where maybe a purchasing person says to a local sales rep, hey, just sneak me what I need here, no one's going to notice. And in between both of those, there's a whole spectrum of techniques, strategies, tactics that our supply chain team around the world will be taking. 
The most important principle, though, is this, if you have supply chain disconnected from the business, it's actually really hard to decide, ultimately, am I doing the right thing? How do I -- what if I need to redesign something? Well, if there's this monolithic engineering team and a monolithic sourcing team and the sourcing team says, we can't get this part, we need to redesign it, and it has to go sort of up and down the corporate chain to get that redesign resources to be allocated or to convince the engineer to do so, that can be a very laborious process. 
Whereas in our organization, the purchasing person is sitting in the door right next to the engineering person reporting to the general manager who's 2 doors down from her. And they can just get in the room together and say, look, we can't find this thing, let's redesign it right now, let's reallocate the resources, let's make it happen. And it's that kind of real-time, connected to the business approach. Whether it is dealing with shortages, whether it's dealing with logistical challenges, whether it's dealing with quality issues, whether it's dealing with new design, whatever, we've always found that, that approach can be very effective. But we try to be what will make us be the most successful, let's say that."

But what I would tell you is our team in all regions really performed very strongly here. And we saw great growth really across the board, across the regions. And we saw disproportionate growth from new programs that we're -- that we've long worked to design ourselves in on relative to EVs. But it wasn't exclusively EVs. We saw growth in lots of other new platforms as well. 
And I think our long-term share gains in the automotive market, and I referenced this earlier, is really a function of us focusing our efforts on next-generation technologies in car, next-generation systems, next-generation applications, everything from passenger comfort and connectivity, to safety, to engine management, emissions control and obviously, high voltage related to EVs and hybrid EVs. 
And I think all of those things are helping us to outperform the broader market in a quarter like we just had here in the first quarter, but also over a very long time period. We're really talking about the better part of the decade, where we have had a relatively consistent performance that is a decent amount, if not far in excess of the underlying unit production volumes that are out there. 
So there's not like 1 silver bullet to this. I think it's been a collective approach. It's been our acquisition program, where we've added new companies, both interconnect, antenna and sensor companies. And it's a lot of work on engineering of next-generation systems that go into these cars across all of the regions.

And I think we start to see kind of some early progress with that here in the first quarter. And to the extent that operators are expanding their investment, we would hope to benefit from that. It may not always be in a perfect quarter-to-quarter correlation. We don't have a position with absolutely every operator with the exact same degree of success.

There's a wide range of vehicles that are undergoing electrification right now from big trucks, and there's plenty of news media around that, to postal vehicles and trash trucks and buses and goods vehicles, delivery vans, you name it. And so all of that is what we classify really in our industrial business or industrial market as that battery heavy vehicle. 
And then when we talk about automotive, the hybrid EV, that's really passenger cars and the related products. In addition, we think about the charging infrastructure for electrification as really an infrastructure piece and that we think about in our industrial business as well. And that's all -- those are all components of areas where we've seen strong performance in -- certainly in the first quarter and over a number of years and look forward to that. Because I think if you confine your view of electrification just to passenger vehicles, you're missing a really exciting area of the electronics revolution, which is that electrification more broadly. 
By the way, I mean, we're working as well with the Department of Defense in certain countries on the electrification of military vehicles, which, I think, is going to be a long process. But over the long term, we see that as an area that can also be another benefit and another growth lever along this just real kind of, call it, a megatrend, if you will, of electrification across kind of all things that move."

The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $2,654,000,000 and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59 and $0.61, respectively. Sales were up 34% in U.S. dollars, 30% in local currencies and 22% organically compared to the second quarter of 2020. 
Sequentially, sales were up 12% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 7% organically. Orders for the quarter were a record $3,120,000,000, which was up 58% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up 14% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.18:1. Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. The interconnect segment, which comprised 96% of our sales, was up 34% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. 
Our Cable segment, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 27% in U.S. dollars and 24% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $476 million and $532 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2021. GAAP operating income includes $55 million of transactions, severance, restructuring and certain other noncash costs related to the MTS acquisition. And the company also incurred $34 million related to the extinguishment of outstanding MTS senior notes that in accordance with GAAP was recorded as an increase to goodwill in the second quarter and therefore had no impact on the second quarter earnings. 
Excluding these acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating margin was 20%, which increased by a strong 200 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year and increased by 40 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes and a lower cost impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of the challenging commodity and supply chain environment that we experienced in this year's quarter. 
The sequential increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by the normal conversion on the increased sales levels, partially offset by the impact of MTS Sensors business, which is currently operating below the company's average operating margin. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22% in the second quarter of 2021, which increased from 20% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 50 basis points sequentially. 
In the Cable segment, margins were 6.1%, which decreased from 9.4% in the second quarter of 2020 and 8.8% in the first quarter. These lower margins in the cable segment are directly related to the rapid increases in the prices of certain commodity and logistics costs, which we have not yet been able to offset with pricing actions. Given the dynamic market environment, we are very proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the current market challenges as a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture. 
The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.5%, which compared to 20.7% in the second quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, this effective tax rate was 24.5% in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.59, an increase of 40% compared to $0.42 in the prior year period. And adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.61, an increase of 53% compared to $0.40 in the second quarter of 2020. 
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Operating cash flow was $411 million in the second quarter or 109% of adjusted net income. And the capital spending, our free cash flow was $307 million or 81% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 71 and 60 days, respectively, all excluding the impact of acquisitions in the quarter and within our normal range. 
During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $167 million at an average price of approximately $67. At the end of the quarter, total debt was $5.2 billion and net debt was $4 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.3 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. 
Second quarter 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $597 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.6x. On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the sale of MTS Test and Simulation business, net leverage at June 30, 2021 would have been 1.3x. As previously discussed, due to the pending sale of the MTS Test and Simulation business, that business is being reported as a discontinued operation. And therefore, its expected results are excluded from our Q3 guidance. 
In addition, in conjunction with the divestiture of the Test and Simulation business, the company will incur certain additional cash tax related and other acquisition-related costs in the third quarter, which will not be included in income from continuing operations and therefore are not included in our guidance. 
I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some financial -- some commentary on current market trends."

And I hope that you, your family, friends and colleagues continue to stay safe and healthy and indeed are able to enjoy the summer so far. As Craig",2262,"Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the call today. And I hope that you, your family, friends and colleagues continue to stay safe and healthy and indeed are able to enjoy the summer so far. 
As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. I'll then get into a discussion of the trends and our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll make some commentary on our outlook for the third quarter and then, of course, we'll have time for questions at the end. Our results in the second quarter were substantially better than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Craig already mentioned, our sales grew a very strong 34% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currencies, reaching a new record of $2,654,000,000. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 22%, with growth driven in particular by the automotive, military, industrial and broadband markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. We're very pleased to have booked record orders in the quarter of $3,120,000,000 and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.18:1. 
Despite facing operational challenges in certain geographies related to the ongoing pandemic as well as continued increases in costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures, we were very pleased to deliver very strong adjusted operating margins of 20.0% in the quarter. This was a 200 basis point increase from last year's levels and a 40 basis point improvement sequentially. 
Adjusted diluted EPS grew a very significant 53% from prior year to another new record of $0.61. And just an outstanding reflection of our continued strong execution. And finally, the company generated operating and free cash flow of $411 million and $307 million, respectively, in the second quarter. I just can't emphasize enough how proud I am of our organization around the world. 
These results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we have continued to perform well amidst what is a very dynamic and challenging environment. Very pleased that in the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Unlimited Services. Unlimited based in Oconto, Wisconsin, but also with operations in Mexico and has annual sales of approximately $50 million. 
This is a great manufacturer of cable assemblies for the industrial market, primarily with a particular focus on heavy vehicles. The addition of Unlimited broadens our already strong position in value-add interconnect products that are integrated into a wide array of industrial applications. As we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, I remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. 
In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. 
Now turning to our served markets. I just would comment once again how pleased we are that the company's broad and balanced end market diversification continues to create real value for us. We believe that ultimately, this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while also giving us broad exposure to leading technologies and the innovations of those technologies wherever they may arise across the broad scope of the electronics industry. 
Now turning to the military market. The military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And as expected, sales grew a strong 45% from the COVID impacted prior year second quarter and were up 30% organically. And this was really driven by broad strength across virtually all segments of the military market. 
On a sequential basis, sales increased by 12%, also very strong. As we look into the third quarter, we remain -- we expect sales to remain at these current elevated levels. And we continue to be very excited by the strength of our position in the military market. And that position is really based upon our industry-leading breadth of high-technology interconnect and now sensor products, together with our support of essentially all major military programs. 
This gives us great confidence for our long-term performance in this important area. The commercial air market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter sales grew by 7% versus prior year, really with the benefit of the contributions of our recent acquisitions. On an organic basis, sales were down by about 14% as the commercial aircraft market continued to experience declines in demand for new aircraft production. 
Sequentially, however, our sales did increase by better-than-expected 19%. And that's really from the benefit of the MTS acquisition as well as some organic progress. As we look ahead, we expect a slight seasonal moderation in sales in the third quarter, which we would typically see in commercial air. And regardless of the ongoing difficult environment, our team working in this commercial aerospace market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems that are integrated into those planes. 
As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic, we look forward to jet manufacturers beginning to expand their production levels. The industrial market represented 27% of our sales in the quarter, and our performance in the second quarter in Industrial was really much stronger than expected with sales increasing by 54% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically. This growth was broad-based across most areas of the worldwide industrial market and was driven in particular by organic strength in the transportation, battery and heavy electric vehicle, marine and energy generation segments, together with the contributions from our acquisitions that have been completed over the past year. 
On a sequential basis, sales increased by a very strong 26% from the first quarter really with the benefit of acquisitions as well as strong organic performance. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at these elevated levels despite what would typically be a seasonally lower quarter. I can't say enough how proud I am of our team working in the industrial market. And we've had a long-term strategy to expand our high-technology, interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically as well as through complementary acquisitions. 
And that strategy has positioned us strongly with industrial customers around the world who are accelerating their adoption of electronics. The acquisition of Unlimited Services further bolsters our leading value-add capabilities in this important market, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. 
The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. And I can just say that sales were higher than our expectations, growing a very strong 134% in U.S. dollars and 117% organically as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market. In particular, we once again drove very strong growth of our products used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles this quarter, which confirms again for us our global team's long-term efforts at designing in high-voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these important next-generation platforms. 
Despite an increase in production disruptions among our automotive customers due to the widely reported global supply chain issues, we were able to achieve a small sequential increase in our sales, which was a bit better than we had expected coming into the quarter. No doubt about it, though, there continues to be a range of widely reported supply chain challenges that are arising within the automotive industry, and this is impacting overall demand from vehicle manufacturers around the world. 
Accordingly, as we look towards the third quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in our sales. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They continue to demonstrate a high degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from last year's reduced production levels while expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that the entire automotive industry is still facing. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future. 
Turning to the mobile devices market. That market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales to customers in the mobile devices market declined from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as declines in handsets and laptops more than offset growth in wearables. I would just remind you that our last year's second quarter did include a significant sequential recovery and really a catch-up from the COVID impacted first quarter of 2020, which made the comparison versus prior year, a little more challenging. 
Sequentially, our sales fell by 6% from the first quarter, which was modestly better than our expectations. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect an approximately 25% increase in sales from these second quarter levels as we benefit from the seasonally typical higher demand in the mobile device market as customers launch a range of new products. While mobile devices remains the most volatile of Amphenol's end markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in the second half of 2021 and beyond. 
Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long term in this exciting market. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were flat to prior year and down 4% organically.  
The sales to both OEMs and wireless service providers moderated. On a sequential basis, however, our sales increased by 5% compared to the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the second quarter. And as we look towards the third quarter, we expect a further increase in sales as Mobile Networks customers ramp up their investments in next-generation networks. 
Our team around the world continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts at expanding our position in such next-generation networks and the equipment that populates them around the world. And as customers ramp up these investments of such advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. 
The information technology and data communications market increased by 21% in the second quarter. Sales in the second quarter rose by 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically from the very significant levels in last year's second quarter. Our strength this quarter was driven, in particular, by robust sales to web service providers, which was partially offset by some weakness in sales to networking equipment OEMs. 
Sequentially, our sales grew a very strong 20% from the first quarter, which significantly outperformed our original expectations. Looking now into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these very high levels. We remain very encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. 
Our OEM and web service provider customers around the world continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team is singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom with industry-leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come. 
Turning finally to the broadband market. This market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased by 12% from prior year and were flat organically as we benefited from our recent acquisition of Cablecon. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 7% from the first quarter, which was a bit lower than we had anticipated coming into the quarter. 
For the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate from current levels as operators digest the really high levels of spending that they have exhibited over the recent quarters. And regardless of this more muted outlook, we continue to look forward to supporting our broadband service operator customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. 
Now turning to our outlook. And I would just note that given the current dynamic market environment, and of course, assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as constant exchange rates. In the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2,640,000,000 to $2,700,000,000. And adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.60 to $0.62. This would represent sales growth of 14% to 16% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 9% to 13% compared to the third quarter of last year. 
I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding entrepreneurial management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. I had to say that our entire organization remains committed to delivering long-term and sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. 
And most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to once again thank the entire global Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. 
And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be."

24827,714674067,2353044,"Amphenol Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Amphenol Corporation","Executives","Thank you very much, Wamsi. I mean we've talked about this in the past that we don't have necessarily perfect visibility into the inventory, in particular of our OEM and service provider customers.

I mean we've talked about this in the past that we don't have necessarily perfect visibility into the inventory, in particular of our OEM and service provider customers. But as far as the channel is concerned, we have not seen any real changes in the inventory levels. In fact, it appears that for the vast majority of our distributors, in particular, with respect to the industrial market, they want to ship it out as soon as we can get it to them. 
There's clearly a very significant end demand across really many segments of the industrial market. And I mentioned earlier that we saw growth across virtually every segment of the industrial market. And whether that was in marine applications, in industrial batteries and electrification of industrial vehicles and transportation, heavy equipment, factory automation. I mean we saw even growth in areas like oil and gas, where we haven't seen so much growth in the past. Instrumentation, where we've continued to see very robust performance over a long time period. 
So I wouldn't say that across the industrial market, we've seen necessarily any worrisome inventory trends. I think that more broadly across the whole company, again, maybe the only area where you hear talk of inventory issues acutely is that there's not a lot of inventory of cars on lots right now. And so I don't know what that means through the whole chain. 
But for sure, dealer inventories of vehicles are extremely low by any measure. And I think there's a lot of supply chain issues that are going on around the automotive industry that I'm sure others will ask about and many have spoken about and reported about. But by and large, we see inventory as relatively healthy."

And then beyond the operational challenges, I'd love to understand, does this create an opportunity for you over time to win new customers to have new share gain? And if so, where -- which segments are those opportunities bigger?"
24827,714674067,2353044,"Amphenol Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Amphenol Corporation","Executives","Yes. Well, thank you very much, Amit. Look, I mean, the current supply chain environment is certainly not for the faint of heart. And I think our agility as an organization that unique entrepreneurship of what we call Amphenolians around the world in many",517,"Yes. Well, thank you very much, Amit. Look, I mean, the current supply chain environment is certainly not for the faint of heart. And I think our agility as an organization that unique entrepreneurship of what we call Amphenolians around the world in many ways is an ideal approach to deal with a supply chain environment that is so broadly disrupted and where new things pop up every day. 
And so could we have shifted a little bit more in certain cases? I'm sure we probably could have. Did it cost us money in many cases, I'm sure it did. To put a number on that, it's not easy for us to do, but I can tell you that it's more than 0. And I think, for sure, the cost of the supply chain, whether that's freight and logistics, whether that's the cost of commodities, the availability of certain things. A lot of stuff went on over the course of this quarter. 
There was floods in Germany. There were challenges with various countries. There were some COVID-related things that were happening, in particular, in places like Southeast Asia. So our general managers, all 125 of them, each of them had to deal with a unique set of challenges, and they had to tailor make their approach to exactly what they were facing. It wasn't that we had to sort of process all of this in the sort of corporate AVAC machine and then issue a bunch of edict to say, here's what we should do. 
It was really dealt with on an individual case-by-case basis in the moment. And that kind of moment-by-moment management is a real premium in a time like this. And as it relates to your second question or the second part of your question, for sure, if we are satisfying the needs of our customers, better than our competitors are doing in a time when they need us the most. 
When they have robust demand from their customers, when they're facing a much broader array of supply chain challenges. Because fortunate for us, we don't buy a ton of semiconductors. We buy a little bit here and there. But we have a lot of customers who are facing really existential kind of shortages in certain semiconductors. 
And when we can help them, for example, they're redesigning a system to change a chip that they can't get supportive. They're redesigning that and all of a sudden, that redesign requires them to completely redesign an interconnect system our team does it. In one case, we did this in 5 days. A customer came to us said they had to totally change the design of their system. 
Otherwise, they wouldn't have a chip for a year. They redesigned it. Our team went completely redesigned the system 5 days later, sent them samples and they came to us with big orders thereafter. So those are the kind of situations that are popping up more and more. And I think long term, customers don't forget, if you were there for them when they need to do the most."

I wanted to ask a question kind of on raw material and input costs. And of course, we've seen them all kind of skyrocket. Does that mean your salespeople need to be more active or change terms? 
Or do you have like indexing into your contracts when raw materials go up a lot? I assume some of your contracts are very long term in nature. Or do you hedge it out with some financial instruments. I'm just kind of curious because it's pretty unprecedented that copper, steel, aluminum, resins and costs that have recently been moving a lot."

I mean there are certain dynamics which one could call unprecedented. And I think amidst that unprecedented inflationary environment on certain commodities, we were able to deliver exactly 20% operating -- adjusted operating margins here in the quarter, which I think is a testament to the hard work of our team around the world, each of whom is facing a different set of challenges. 
But no doubt about it, if you're a general manager in Amphenol, we don't tie their hands and say, you're only in charge of this or you're only in charge of that. They have every lever to pull in order to ultimately meet their obligations to reach their performance objectives. And so that means when all of your input prices have gone up, you're going to figure away out of that. 
And sometimes when they go up very quickly, that makes it hard and no doubt about it. We've seen relatively quick increases in a lot of different input costs, and again, not just commodities, but also the cost of freight and other logistics. And that sometimes there can be a little bit of a delay if that comes in so fast. But by and large, our interactions with customers, the sort of contracts or programs that we have with them, generally, they're not indexed. 
And as you know, we generally don't hedge either. And the reason we don't hedge is because then you're kind of detached from the reality of the moment when you want to have discussions with customers. And those discussions with customers for sure are ongoing because when you have such significant increases in the input costs, we're going to do everything in our power to offset those costs with our own management, redesigning the products changing suppliers, pitting our suppliers against each other, reducing overhead, reducing every aspect. 
But sometimes, there is only the option to pass that price, that cost increase on to your customer. We do that very thoughtfully. Every market is a little bit different, how that works. But our customers know that we don't do that lightly. We don't take that initiative lightly. But ultimately, you sometimes do have to pass the price on. And I can tell you our sales teams around the world together with our operating teams, they're working hand-in-hand to make sure that we've done everything possible before we go into a customer and ask for them to share in the pain of these increases. 
But when you have such severe and sudden increases, ultimately, then pricing does become very important. And I think our team is working that. It's hard work. There's no doubt about it. But I think our team is making really good progress in that front. 
And again, it's very market dependent. It's very region-dependent. But there's no one I would want more than a general manager who knows her business front to back to be the one who sits in front of a customer and decide is this now the right moment to ask that customer to share in the challenges that we are facing."

But I can just tell you, our early impressions of the company are very, very positive. I mean, we said, and I think I mentioned last quarter, the MTS, the sensors business is run by a team that we know well. And in particular, the person leading that organization is just a phenomenal, phenomenal leader who has an extraordinary organization underneath him. 
And the fact -- the way that they have embraced being part of Amphenol is just truly rewarding for all of us company. We've known them for a long time. This was not a new acquaintance that we made through this process, but rather we've known them all the way back to when they were part of a family-owned company that ultimately MTS acquired. 
Our customers have received this extremely well. We have become more important to customers across the markets, whether that be industrial, military, commercial air and automotive. I continue to be just amazed by the uniqueness and the depth of the technology that we acquired in this business, force vibration, sensors, pressure sensors, position, just a variety of products that really operate at the harshest of environments and with the highest of performance. 
In terms of being able to sell more complete solutions, I can tell you that there's already early activities, real collaborative activities ongoing across the company with people within our interconnect businesses working together, getting to know the MTS Sensors organization, creating the sort of fiber of the relationships that ultimately can lead long term to really collaborative success in the various markets that we serve. 
So all early returns for MTS, including their absolute performance, which is coming out a little bit better than we had thought in the quarter. All early returns are favorable. And I'll let Craig maybe comment specifically on the margin."

As you mentioned, I did -- I have mentioned in the past that their mid-teens profitability when we acquired them. As Adam mentioned, we're just really happy with the progress they've made in kind of all aspects, honestly, of the business. 
From a profitability perspective, we always say that profit ultimately is really just the byproduct of the value that you bring to kind of your customers. And there's no doubt that this company brings a lot of value to all their customers. And we believe that there is plenty of opportunity throughout the business to be able to increase that profitability in the business. 
I would tell you that in the -- even in the second quarter, I'd say we have seen green shoots, I guess, of progress in that area. The time it will take ultimately to get them to the company average or beyond is certainly time will be we told in the future here on that, and we're not necessarily going to try to estimate that at this time because every acquisition is different, and the tasks that need to happen, take different differentiating amount of time. 
But I would tell you that the second quarter here, the first quarter that we've had them as part of Amphenol, we've certainly seen some progress in that area and certainly areas of opportunity in the future. And we're -- I would say that we're even more optimistic and we were optimistic and early on that they will be able to ultimately get to that target that we have for them to be at the company average. And and hopefully beyond in the future."

I think you correctly termed that it is a very volatile market on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our year-over-year -- the year-over-year performance of the market was significantly impacted by the strength that we had a year ago in the second quarter, which was really a catch-up from the significant COVID impacts that we saw in the first quarter of 2020. 
This is not a market I like to get out ahead of my skis on in terms of several quarters out and giving a prognosis. But what I can say is that our position in the mobile market is an extremely strong position. We continue to have a unique ability to react quickly to customers when they need us the most. And that includes sometimes when our competitors aren't able to support the customers, in particular, when they're launching new products. 
Our guidance for the third quarter being up about 25% or so on a quarter-to-quarter basis is a strong outlook. And I think not inconsistent, if you look over a long time period, with the kind of second quarter to third quarter trajectory. What it will be in the quarters thereafter. Again, I'm not going to get ahead of my skis and giving a prognosis on mobile devices over the long term. 
But the content opportunity as you say, there's no reason to think that the content opportunity with these devices as they become more complicated as they have different feature sets as they support different types of communication standards in them. Those have usually been in the past, strong drivers of content in mobile devices. And we have no reason to believe that, that would change in the future."

Our team continues to do a phenomenal job in IT datacom, in particular, a phenomenal job enabling web service providers whose spending, and you can call them web service providers like ID, you can call them cloud providers, whatever. And the fact is these service providers who are making meaningful and very meaningful investments in high-speed data processing in order to enable the explosion of traffic that all of them are seeing. 
And our team has just done an amazing job of reacting to that increase in demand. And we did that over the course of last year when it was even more critical. And we talked about this several times last year that our growth in IT datacom over the course of 2020. I think, growing close to 50%, for example, sequentially in the second quarter and reacting to the literal explosion of data traffic resulting from all the video meetings and remote work and remote school and all of that. We made a lot of good friends in that market by stepping up and really enabling our customers when they needed us the most. 
At the same time, if anything, we've seen an acceleration in new product development as our customers look to really push the limits of the bandwidth of their systems. And that involves new interconnect solutions that ultimately can enable that high speed. It involves new power solutions that can help the efficiency. I mean there are so many dynamics that are going on across IT datacom, all of which converge on the need for higher-performance interconnect products. 
And whether that's web service providers and video over the Internet whether that's even like cryptocurrency and the processor power that's being used in support of the crypto market. I mean these are all things that are just driving extraordinary demand for high speed and high efficiency, high-speed interconnect and high-efficiency power interconnect. 
And I can just tell you our team working in both of those areas has done a bang-up job to react to this, to scale our capacity quickly in the face of really unexpected levels of demand. And this quarter was another example of that. We certainly did not expect a 20% sequential growth. I think we came into the quarter thinking kind of mid-single digits. And that requires you to perform on that. It requires you to have enough people in machines, automation, tooling and factory floor space and ready source of materials. And I think our team just did a great job of reacting in the moment here."

I mean, look, I don't know how it's going to look in the future. But for sure, over the course of the last year, and we shouldn't forget Q2 of last year was almost the nuclear winter for the automotive industry. But over the last year, our team working in industrial, working in automotive has clearly done an outstanding job of supporting customers when they needed us the most. 
And in certain cases, doing that because some competitors could not rise to the occasion. So I think that there has been, for us, some outperformance relative to the industry. I think as well, we clearly have seen an acceleration of the adoption of electronics across the automotive industry, across the many, many segments of the industrial market. 
This kind of electronification of everything, if you will. And it's not just EVs, and it's not just batteries for those EVs. And we're really seeing so many examples of traditionally mechanical fuel based, hydraulic converting to an electronic control electronic functionality. And each time that happens, that's a new inflection point whereby if we can step in with the right types of interconnect products, the right types of sensors, leading-edge products. If we can do that in a timely fashion, we can have it available for the customers when they need it when they're seeing also an increase in their end demand that positions us very well. 
And so I think all of the factors that you mentioned have all come together in a very positive fashion to ultimately lead to us having the growth that we realized this quarter as well as the positive outlook that we see in the third quarter. And I would hope also beyond. 
Now what does that mean for the long term? Typically, the adoption of electronics is a one-way ratchet. It's not that people adopt a new electronic system, and then one day go back to a mechanical system. That's not really how the evolution of electronics operates. And so I think long term, it gives me some encouragement to see that there has been an acceleration and that kind of step function adoption of electronics, you would hope would continue to create opportunities for the long term."

I mean, look, I think the organic growth was pretty special, David. So I don't blame you for asking another automotive question. Again, I always say you could teach the master class here on automotive. But yes, 117% organic growth, albeit to a quarter that was a pretty rough quarter a year ago, but still, it was really a very, very special performance. 
And our automotive team is very proud and justifiably proud of what they were able to achieve. And relative to the contribution of EV, I can tell you that if you can imagine it, the growth of EV was substantially higher than the growth that I just mentioned of that 117%. 
And without giving a specific amount of the total of our EV business, it's bigger than it used to be and it's meaningful. It's a meaningful business. It clearly is an area of success for the company. And it's one that we look forward to realizing the benefits from for many years to come. 
Relative to inventory, I would actually say that what we've seen more of in the automotive market than stockpiling of inventory is we've seen customers not wanting to take our product because they all of a sudden can't get the appropriate semiconductor to finish the vehicle. And so we've seen more what I would call push outs of deliveries as opposed to customers just throwing a bunch of stuff in their warehouses. 
Now could there be some buildup of component inventory in certain places. There could be, and we may not see it perfectly. But what we have seen, for sure -- and that went through the course of the quarter is customers saying, ""Well, we're going to have to shut down our factory for a couple of weeks, and thus, we don't need your stuff right now."" 
And we've had to react quickly to that. And that's actually meant that for us, we ended up with maybe a little bit more of our own finished goods, a little bit more of our own work in progress than we would have liked in the course of the quarter. And still with that, we were able to achieve that 117% organic growth. So I don't know that that's -- there's a big buildup. There could be pockets of it. 
But the more obvious thing that we saw over the quarter were these pushouts from customers who couldn't get matching components to make the car."

And I know even when we compare to global production, your geographic exposure probably helped you a little bit because the larger recovery in North America and Europe. 
I guess what I'm -- the other factor I'm wondering about is, is there a material content per vehicle difference between, let's call it, high-value vehicles like a full-size truck and a lower-value vehicle. Because that can obviously also help. And as we start thinking about next year, maybe some of the volume recovery is more in those lower volume vehicles."

I should say that you and David could probably co-teach the master class together. But look, one maybe thing I would mention, you alluded to regional in automotive. And actually, we saw really strong performance across all of the regions where we operate. 
And I would tell you actually that our business now regionally is more balanced than ever before is roughly equal size between Asia and Europe and just to tick lower in North America. So -- and that's quite a transformation. If you think about it over a decade when at one point, our business was kind of 2/3 in Europe and maybe 1/5 in North America and the rest in Asia. 
So we've made really great progress in Asia. And I would also say that in Asia, we've made great progress also in the electrification in EVs where our team has just done a fabulous job. Relative to your question, do luxury cars have more content for example, then a lower-end car, I think the answer to that is absolutely yes. That's always been the case. I think that will always be the case. 
But one of the differences that we have seen, and that's not just the difference of this year or last year, but maybe over the last kind of half a decade or so is we have seen that more and more automakers are equipping their lower-end cars with a greater degree of electronic functionality than they did in the past. The traditional approach for automakers was to just stuck their high-end cars with every possible feature to test out electronics in those cars to put the newest thing there first and then maybe it would trickle down to the low end, more fleet-type cars or maybe it wouldn't. 
But I tell you, you get any car of any size now, and it's going to have features in it that you never would have imagined before, even in the smallest kind of Fiat 500 or something like that, you're going to see just a real array of electronics functionality. 
So for sure, $100,000 car is always going to have more content than the $30,000 car. But I don't know that the intensity of electronics in that $100,000 is so many multiples more than it is on that maybe $30,000 car. And in the past, that would have been quite a different intensity of the electronic value in the car. So what does that mean for the long term? 
Are companies selling more high-value trucks and luxury cars today and maybe they'll sell more low-value cars in the future. I thought I don't have a good read on. But I think there's electronics opportunities across all of these types of cars."

So I'm not sure the numbers that you referred to. Relative to supply constraints, are they getting better, worse, staying the same? I don't know. I guess, it feels about the same. I wouldn't say that it feels that much worse. And there are a few things that maybe do feel a little bit worse, like freight, the cost of freight is not that great. So the price of a container from Asia to the U.S., and it's not that, that's a huge impact on us. But once in a while, you do that or your customer does that. And those have gotten quite a bit more expensive over the recent times.

In fact, our",483,"Well, I mean, the last part of your question, I'll answer first, which is I think we've pursued this business very aggressively over a long time period. We shouldn't forget that the whole concept of a high-voltage system in a car is not new. In fact, our teams have been working on development of specific automotive capable, high-voltage interconnect systems for, I don't know, the whole time I've been CEO, and I've been CEO for nearly 13 years now. 
So I think that's not a new development. I don't think EVs are a new thing, hybrids and run a new thing, but they're growing. And I think they're reaching -- I don't know if you want to call it an inflection point, someone mentioned that term earlier. But for sure, the adoption of these vehicles is accelerating on a global basis. 
Even if they still represent a relatively modest proportion of the overall vehicle market. I mean, the vast majority of cars sold today are still combustion engine cars. But to your point, the -- we have, I think, in EVs, a proposition maybe that we didn't have in traditional automotive which is that we've been making high-voltage connectors for a very, very long time. 
I mean if you think about the legacy of Amphenol over the nearly 9 decades that our company has been in business, we were early on a leader in the innovation and development of power interconnect that's used in military, aerospace, industrial applications. And that came with unique proprietary technologies, in particular, around the efficient and safe transmission of high-voltage power across an interconnect system that requires a very unique contact technology that we have developed over many, many years. 
And so early on, and when I say early on, this is a dozen years ago or more when we were really working early on in these hybrid electric vehicles, we were already repackaging our high-voltage interconnect technologies from the military and industrial into more of an automotive-type interconnect interface and otherwise. 
And so that gave us a very strong position. So it's not new to us to be making high-voltage products. And to the extent that there are more traditional incumbents who are pure automotive companies who may not have had that rich legacy of high-power, high-voltage interconnect we could on occasion, have an advantage. 
Now granted, they have an advantage with the breadth that they work in that market. So it's not that this is kind of a clear path to world domination in the EV market. I mean we have a lot of competition, and we respect them a great deal. But if anything, I think our outperformance in automotive over many years and in particular, over the recent years, there has been a not insignificant component of that, which has been us realizing the benefits of our long-term position in high-voltage products.

This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2021 conference call.Our second quarter 2021 results were released t",996,"Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2021 conference call.
Our second quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we'll take some questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. 
The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $2.654 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59 and $0.61, respectively. Sales were up 34% in U.S. dollars, 30% in local currencies and 22% organically compared to the second quarter of 2020. Sequentially, sales were up 12% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and 7% organically. 
Orders for the quarter were a record $3.120 billion, which was up 58% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up 14% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.18:1. 
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. The interconnect segment, which comprised 96% of our sales, was up 34% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. Our cable segment, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 27% in U.S. dollars and 24% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. 
GAAP and adjusted operating income were $476 million and $532 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2021. GAAP operating income includes $55 million of transactions, severance, restructuring and certain other noncash costs related to the MTS acquisition. And the company also incurred $34 million related to the extinguishment of outstanding MTS senior notes that in accordance with GAAP was recorded as an increase to goodwill in the second quarter and therefore had no impact on the second quarter earnings.  
Excluding these acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating margin was 20%, which increased by a strong 200 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year and increased by 40 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes and a lower cost impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of the challenging commodity and supply chain environment that we experienced in this year's quarter. 
The sequential increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by the normal conversion on the increased sales levels, partially offset by the impact of MTS Sensors business, which is currently operating below the company's average operating margin. 
From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22% in the second quarter of 2021, which increased from 20% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 50 basis points sequentially. In the cable segment, margins were 6.1%, which decreased from 9.4% in the second quarter of 2020 and 8.8% in the first quarter. These lower margins in the cable segment are directly related to the rapid increases in the prices of certain commodity and logistics costs, which we have not yet been able to offset with pricing actions.
Given the dynamic market environment, we are very proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the current market challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture.
The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.5%, which compared to 20.7% in the second quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, this effective tax rate was 24.5% in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.59, an increase of 40% compared to $0.42 in the prior year period. And adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.61, an increase of 53% compared to $0.40 in the second quarter of 2020.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Operating cash flow was $411 million in the second quarter or 109% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $307 million or 81% of adjusted net income. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 71 and 60 days, respectively, all excluding the impact of acquisitions in the quarter and within our normal range.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $167 million at an average price of approximately $67. At the end of the quarter, total debt was $5.2 billion and net debt was $4 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.3 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.
Second quarter 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $597 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.6x. On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the sale of MTS test and simulation business, net leverage at June 30, 2021 would have been 1.3x. As previously discussed, due to the pending sale of the MTS test and simulation business, that business is being reported as a discontinued operation. And therefore, its expected results are excluded from our Q3 guidance.
In addition, in conjunction with the divestiture of the test and simulation business, the company will incur certain additional cash tax-related and other acquisition-related costs in the third quarter, which will not be included in income from continuing operations and therefore are not included in our guidance.
I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some financial -- some commentary on current market trends."

And I hope that you, your family, friends and colleagues continue to stay safe and healthy and indeed are able to enjoy the summer so far.As Craig",2269,"Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the call today. And I hope that you, your family, friends and colleagues continue to stay safe and healthy and indeed are able to enjoy the summer so far.
As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. I'll then get into a discussion of the trends and our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll make some commentary on our outlook for the third quarter and then, of course, we'll have time for questions at the end. Our results in the second quarter were substantially better than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
Craig already mentioned, our sales grew a very strong 34% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currencies, reaching a new record of $2.654 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 22%, with growth driven in particular by the automotive, military, industrial and broadband markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. We're very pleased to have booked record orders in the quarter of $3.120 billion and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.18:1.
Despite facing operational challenges in certain geographies related to the ongoing pandemic as well as continued increases in costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures, we were very pleased to deliver very strong adjusted operating margins of 20.0% in the quarter. This was a 200 basis point increase from last year's levels and a 40 basis point improvement sequentially.
Adjusted diluted EPS grew a very significant 53% from prior year to another new record of $0.61. And just an outstanding reflection of our continued strong execution. And finally, the company generated operating and free cash flow of $411 million and $307 million, respectively, in the second quarter. 
I just can't emphasize enough how proud I am of our organization around the world. These results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we have continued to perform well amidst what is a very dynamic and challenging environment. 
Very pleased that in the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Unlimited Services. Unlimited is based in Oconto, Wisconsin, but also with operations in Mexico and has annual sales of approximately $50 million. This is a great manufacturer of cable assemblies for the industrial market, primarily with a particular focus on heavy vehicles. The addition of Unlimited broadens our already strong position in value-add interconnect products that are integrated into a wide array of industrial applications. 
As we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, I remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.
Now turning to our served markets. I just would comment once again how pleased we are that the company's broad and balanced end market diversification continues to create real value for us. We believe that ultimately, this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while also giving us broad exposure to leading technologies and the innovations of those technologies wherever they may arise across the broad scope of the electronics industry.
Now turning to the military market. The military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And as expected, sales grew a strong 45% from the COVID impacted prior year second quarter and were up 30% organically. And this was really driven by broad strength across virtually all segments of the military market. 
On a sequential basis, sales increased by 12%, also very strong. As we look into the third quarter, we remain -- we expect sales to remain at these current elevated levels. And we continue to be very excited by the strength of our position in the military market. And that position is really based upon our industry-leading breadth of high-technology interconnect and now sensor products, together with our support of essentially all major military programs. This gives us great confidence for our long-term performance in this important area. 
The commercial air market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by 7% versus prior year, really with the benefit of the contributions of our recent acquisitions. On an organic basis, sales were down by about 14% as the commercial aircraft market continued to experience declines in demand for new aircraft production. Sequentially, however, our sales did increase by better than expected 19%. And that's really from the benefit of the MTS acquisition as well as some organic progress. As we look ahead, we expect a slight seasonal moderation in sales in the third quarter, which we would typically see in commercial air. 
And regardless of the ongoing difficult environment, our team working in this commercial aerospace market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems that are integrated into those planes. As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic, we look forward to jet manufacturers beginning to expand their production levels. 
The industrial market represented 27% of our sales in the quarter, and our performance in the second quarter in industrial was really much stronger than expected with sales increasing by 54% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically. This growth was broad-based across most areas of the worldwide industrial market and was driven in particular by organic strength in the transportation, battery and heavy electric vehicle, marine and energy generation segments, together with the contributions from our acquisitions that have been completed over the past year. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a very strong 26% from the first quarter really with the benefit of acquisitions as well as strong organic performance. 
Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at these elevated levels despite what would typically be a seasonally lower quarter. I can't say enough how proud I am of our team working in the industrial market. And we've had a long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically as well as through complementary acquisitions. And that strategy has positioned us strongly with industrial customers around the world who are accelerating their adoption of electronics. The acquisition of Unlimited Services further bolsters our leading value-add capabilities in this important market, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come.
The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. And I can just say that sales were higher than our expectations, growing a very strong 134% in U.S. dollars and 117% organically as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market. In particular, we once again drove very strong growth of our products used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles this quarter, which confirms again for us our global team's long-term efforts at designing in high voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these important next-generation platforms.
Despite an increase in production disruptions among our automotive customers due to the widely reported global supply chain issues, we were able to achieve a small sequential increase in our sales, which was a bit better than we had expected coming into the quarter. No doubt about it, though, there continues to be a range of widely reported supply chain challenges that are arising within the automotive industry, and this is impacting overall demand from vehicle manufacturers around the world. Accordingly, as we look towards the third quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in our sales. 
I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They continue to demonstrate a high degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from last year's reduced production levels while expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that the entire automotive industry is still facing. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future. 
Turning to the mobile devices market. That market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales to customers in the mobile devices market declined from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as declines in handsets and laptops more-than-offset growth in wearables. I would just remind you that our last year's second quarter did include a significant sequential recovery and really a catch-up from the COVID impacted first quarter of 2020, which made the comparison versus prior year, a little more challenging. Sequentially, our sales fell by 6% from the first quarter, which was modestly better than our expectations. 
Looking to the third quarter, we now expect an approximately 25% increase in sales from these second quarter levels as we benefit from the seasonally typical higher demand in the mobile device market as customers launch a range of new products. While mobile devices remains the most volatile of Amphenol's end markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in the second half of 2021 and beyond.
Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long term in this exciting market. 
The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were flat to prior year and down 4% organically as sales to both OEMs and wireless service providers moderated. On a sequential basis, however, our sales increased by 5% compared to the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the second quarter. And as we look towards the third quarter, we expect a further increase in sales as Mobile Networks customers ramp up their investments in next-generation networks.
Our team around the world continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts at expanding our position in such next-generation networks and the equipment that populates them around the world. And as customers ramp up these investments of such advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers.
The information technology and data communications market increased by 21% in the second quarter. Sales in the second quarter rose by 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically from the very significant levels in last year's second quarter. Our strength this quarter was driven, in particular, by robust sales to web service providers, which was partially offset by some weakness in sales to networking equipment OEMs.
Sequentially, our sales grew a very strong 20% from the first quarter, which significantly outperformed our original expectations. Looking now into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these very high levels. We remain very encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market.
Our OEM and web service provider customers around the world continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team is singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom with industry-leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come. 
Turning finally to the broadband market. This market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased by 12% from prior year and were flat organically as we benefited from our recent acquisition of Cablecon. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 7% from the first quarter, which was a bit lower than we had anticipated coming into the quarter.
For the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate from current levels as operators digest the really high levels of spending that they have exhibited over the recent quarters. And regardless of this more muted outlook, we continue to look forward to supporting our broadband service operator customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses.
Now turning to our outlook. And I would just note that given the current dynamic market environment, and of course, assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as constant exchange rates, in the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.640 billion to $2.700 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.60 to $0.62. This would represent sales growth of 14% to 16% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 9% to 13% compared to the third quarter of last year.
I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding entrepreneurial management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. I had to say that our entire organization remains committed to delivering long term and sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to once again thank the entire global Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter.
And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be."

I mean we've talked about this in the past that we don't have necessarily perfect visibility into the inventory, in particular of our OEM and service provider customers. But as far as the channel is concerned, we have not seen any real changes in the inventory levels. In fact, it appears that for the vast majority of our distributors, in particular, with respect to the industrial market, they want to ship it out as soon as we can get it to them.
There's clearly a very significant end demand across really many segments of the industrial market. And I mentioned earlier that we saw growth across virtually every segment of the industrial market. And whether that was in marine applications, in industrial batteries and electrification of industrial vehicles and transportation, heavy equipment, factory automation. I mean we saw even growth in areas like oil and gas, where we haven't seen so much growth in the past. Instrumentation, where we've continued to see very robust performance over a long time period.
So I wouldn't say that across the industrial market, we've seen necessarily any worrisome inventory trends. I think that more broadly across the whole company, again, maybe the only area where you hear talk of inventory issues acutely is that there's not a lot of inventory of cars on lots right now. And so I don't know what that means through the whole chain. But for sure, dealer inventories of vehicles are extremely low by any measure. And I think there's a lot of supply chain issues that are going on around the automotive industry that I'm sure others will ask about and many have spoken about and reported about. But by and large, we see inventory as relatively healthy."

Look, I mean, the current supply chain environment is certainly not for the faint of heart. And I think our agility as an organization that unique entrepreneurship of what we call Amphenolians around the world in many ways is an ideal approach to deal with a supply chain environment that is so broadly disrupted and where new things pop up every day.
And so could we have shift a little bit more in certain cases? I'm sure we probably could have. Did it cost us money? In many cases, I'm sure it did. To put a number on that, it's not easy for us to do, but I can tell you that it's more than 0. And I think, for sure, the cost of the supply chain, whether that's freight and logistics, whether that's the cost of commodities, the availability of certain things, a lot of stuff went on over the course of this quarter. There was floods in Germany. There were challenges with various countries. There were some COVID-related things that were happening, in particular, in places like Southeast Asia. 
So our general managers, all 125 of them, each of them had to deal with a unique set of challenges, and they had to tailor make their approach to exactly what they were facing. It wasn't that we had to sort of process all of this in the sort of corporate wayback machine and then issue a bunch of edicts to say, here's what we should do. It was really dealt with on an individual case-by-case basis in the moment. And that kind of moment-by-moment management is a real premium in a time like this.
And as it relates to your second question or the second part of your question, for sure, if we are satisfying the needs of our customers, better than our competitors are doing in a time when they need us the most, when they have robust demand from their customers, when they're facing a much broader array of supply chain challenges because fortunate for us, we don't buy a ton of semiconductors, and we buy a little bit here and there. But we have a lot of customers who are facing really existential kind of shortages in certain semiconductors.
And when we can help them, for example, they're redesigning a system to change a chip that they can't get supportive, they're redesigning that and all of a sudden, that redesign requires them to completely redesign an interconnect system our team does it. In one case, we did this in 5 days. A customer came to us said they had to totally change the design of their system. Otherwise, they wouldn't have a chip for a year. They redesigned it. Our team went, completely redesigned the system 5 days later, sent them samples and they came to us with big orders thereafter.

I wanted to ask a question kind of on raw material and input costs. And of course, we've seen them all kind of skyrocket. Does that mean your salespeople need to be more active or change terms? Or do you have like indexing into your contracts when raw materials go up a lot? 
I assume some of your contracts are very long term in nature or do you hedge it out with some financial instruments? I'm just kind of curious because it's pretty unprecedented that copper, steel, aluminum, resins and caustic have recently been moving a lot."

I mean there are certain dynamics which one could call unprecedented. And I think amidst that unprecedented inflationary environment on certain commodities, we were able to deliver exactly 20% operating -- adjusted operating margins here in the quarter, which I think is a testament to the hard work of our team around the world, each of whom is facing a different set of challenges.
But no doubt about it, if you're a general manager in Amphenol, we don't tie their hands and say, you're only in charge of this or you're only in charge of that. They have every lever to pull in order to ultimately meet their obligations to reach their performance objectives. And so that means when all of your input prices have gone up, you're going to figure a way out of that. 
And sometimes when they go up very quickly, that makes it hard and no doubt about it. We've seen relatively quick increases in a lot of different input costs, and again, not just commodities, but also the cost of freight and other logistics. And that sometimes there can be a little bit of a delay if that comes in so fast. 
But by and large, our interactions with customers, the sort of contracts or programs that we have with them, generally, they're not indexed. And as you know, we generally don't hedge either. And the reason we don't hedge is because then you're kind of detached from the reality of the moment when you want to have discussions with customers. 
And those discussions with customers for sure are ongoing because when you have such significant increases in the input costs, we're going to do everything in our power to offset those costs with our own management, redesigning the products changing suppliers, pitting our suppliers against each other, reducing overhead, reducing every aspect.
But sometimes, there is only the option to pass that price, that cost increase on to your customer. We do that very thoughtfully. Every market is a little bit different, how that works. But our customers know that we don't do that lightly. We don't take that initiative lightly. But ultimately, you sometimes do have to pass the price on. And I can tell you our sales teams around the world together with our operating teams, they're working hand-in-hand to make sure that we've done everything possible before we go into a customer and ask for them to share in the pain of these increases.
But when you have such severe and sudden increases, ultimately, then pricing does become very important. And I think our team is working that. It's hard work. There's no doubt about it. But I think our team is making really good progress in that front. 
And again, it's very market dependent. It's very region-dependent. But there's no one I would want more than a general manager who knows her business front to back to be the one who sits in front of a customer and decide is this now the right moment to ask that customer to share in the challenges that we are facing."

And in particular, the person leading that organization is just a phenomenal, phenomenal leader who has an extraordinary organization underneath him. 
And the fact -- the way that they have embraced being part of Amphenol is just truly rewarding for all of us in the company. We've known them for a long time. This was not a new acquaintance that we made through this process, but rather we've known them all the way back to when they were part of a family-owned company that ultimately MTS acquired.
Our customers have received this extremely well. We have become more important to customers across the markets, whether that be industrial, military, commercial air and automotive. I continue to be just amazed by the uniqueness and the depth of the technology that we acquired in this business, force, vibration, sensors, pressure sensors, position, just a variety of products that really operate at the harshest of environments and with the highest of performance. 
In terms of being able to sell more complete solutions, I can tell you that there's already early activities, real collaborative activities ongoing across the company with people within our interconnect businesses working together, getting to know the MTS Sensors organization, creating the sort of fiber of the relationships that ultimately can lead long term to really collaborative success in the various markets that we serve. 
So all early returns for MTS, including their absolute performance, which is coming out a little bit better than we had thought in the quarter. All early returns are favorable. And I'll let Craig maybe comment specifically on the margin."

From a profitability perspective, we always say that profit ultimately is really just the byproduct of the value that you bring to kind of your customers. And there's no doubt that this company brings a lot of value to all their customers. And we believe that there is plenty of opportunity throughout the business to be able to increase that profitability in the business. 
I would tell you that in the -- even in the second quarter, I'd say we have seen green shoots, I guess, of progress in that area. The time it will take ultimately to get them to the company average or beyond is certainly time will be we told in the future here on that, and we're not necessarily going to try to estimate that at this time because every acquisition is different, and the tasks that need to happen take differentiating amount of time. 
But I would tell you that the second quarter here, the first quarter that we've had them as part of Amphenol, we've certainly seen some progress in that area and certainly areas of opportunity in the future.

This is not a market I like to get out ahead of my skis on in terms of several quarters out and giving a prognosis. But what I can say is that our position in the mobile market is an extremely strong position. We continue to have a unique ability to react quickly to customers when they need us the most. And that includes sometimes when our competitors aren't able to support the customers, in particular, when they're launching new products. 
Our guidance for the third quarter being up about 25% or so on a quarter-to-quarter basis is a strong outlook. And I think not inconsistent, if you look over a long time period, with the kind of second quarter to third quarter trajectory. What it will be in the quarters thereafter? Again, I'm not going to get ahead of my skis in giving a prognosis on mobile devices over the long term. 
But the content opportunity as you say, there's no reason to think that the content opportunity with these devices as they become more complicated as they have different feature sets as they support different types of communication standards in them, those have usually been in the past, strong drivers of content in mobile devices. And we have no reason to believe that, that would change in the future."

Our team continues to do a phenomenal job in IT datacom, in particular, a phenomenal job enabling web service providers who is spending, and you can call them web service providers like I do, you can call them cloud providers, whatever. And the fact is these service providers who are making meaningful and very meaningful investments in high-speed data processing in order to enable the explosion of traffic that all of them are seeing.
And our team has just done an amazing job of reacting to that increase in demand. And we did that over the course of last year when it was even more critical. And we talked about this several times last year that our growth in IT datacom over the course of 2020, I think, growing close to 50%, for example, sequentially in the second quarter and reacting to the literal explosion of data traffic resulting from all the video meetings and remote work and remote school and all of that. We made a lot of good friends in that market by stepping up and really enabling our customers when they needed us the most. 
At the same time, if anything, we've seen an acceleration in new product development as our customers look to really push the limits of the bandwidth of their systems. And that involves new interconnect solutions that ultimately can enable that high speed. It involves new power solutions that can help the efficiency. I mean there are so many dynamics that are going on across IT datacom, all of which converge on the need for higher-performance interconnect products. 
And whether that's web service providers and video over the Internet whether that's even like cryptocurrency and the processor power that's being used in support of the crypto market. I mean these are all things that are just driving extraordinary demand for high speed and high efficiency -- high-speed interconnect and high-efficiency power interconnect. 
And I can just tell you our team working in both of those areas has done a bang-up job to react to this, to scale our capacity quickly in the face of really unexpected levels of demand. And this quarter was another example of that. We certainly did not expect a 20% sequential growth. I think we came into the quarter thinking kind of mid-single digits. And that requires you to perform on that. It requires you to have enough people in machines and automation and tooling and factory floor space and ready source of materials. And I think our team just did a great job of reacting in the moment here."

But over the last year, our team working in industrial, working in automotive has clearly done an outstanding job of supporting customers when they needed us the most. 
And in certain cases, doing that because some competitors could not rise to the occasion. So I think that there has been, for us, some outperformance relative to the industry. I think as well, we clearly have seen an acceleration of the adoption of electronics across the automotive industry, across the many, many segments of the industrial market.
There is kind of electronification of everything, if you will. And it's not just EVs and it's not just batteries for those EVs. We were really seeing so many examples of traditionally mechanical fuel based, hydraulic converting to an electronic control, electronic functionality. And each time that happens, that's a new inflection point whereby if we can step in with the right types of interconnect products, the right types of sensors, leading-edge products. If we can do that in a timely fashion, we can have it available for the customers when they need it when they're seeing also an increase in their end demand that positions us very well. 
And so I think all of the factors that you mentioned have all come together in a very positive fashion to ultimately lead to us having the growth that we realized this quarter as well as the positive outlook that we see in the third quarter. And I would hope also beyond. 
Now what does that mean for the long term? Typically, the adoption of electronics is a one-way ratchet. It's not that people adopt a new electronic system, and then one day go back to a mechanical system. That's not really how the evolution of electronics operates. And so I think long term, it gives me some encouragement to see that there has been an acceleration and that kind of step function adoption of electronics, you would hope would continue to create opportunities for the long term."

Again, I always say you could teach the master class here on automotive. But yes, 117% organic growth, albeit to a quarter that was a pretty rough quarter a year ago, but still, it was really a very, very special performance. And our automotive team is very proud and justifiably proud of what they were able to achieve. 
And relative to the contribution of EV, I can tell you that if you can imagine it, the growth of EV was substantially higher than the growth that I just mentioned of that 117%. And without giving a specific amount of the total of our EV business, it's bigger than it used to be and it's meaningful. It's a meaningful business. It clearly is an area of success for the company. And it's one that we look forward to realizing the benefits from for many years to come. 
Relative to inventory, I would actually say that what we've seen more of in the automotive market than stockpiling of inventory is we've seen customers not wanting to take our product because they all of a sudden can't get the appropriate semiconductor to finish the vehicle. And so we've seen more what I would call push outs of deliveries as opposed to customers just throwing a bunch of stuff in their warehouses. 
Now could there be some buildup of component inventory in certain places. There could be, and we may not see it perfectly. But what we have seen, for sure -- and that went through the course of the quarter is customers saying, ""Well, we're going to have to shut down our factory for a couple of weeks, and thus, we don't need your stuff right now."" 
And we've had to react quickly to that. And that's actually meant that for us, we ended up with maybe a little bit more of our own finished goods, a little bit more of our own work in progress than we would have liked in the course of the quarter. And still with that, we were able to achieve that 117% organic growth. So I don't know that that's -- there's a big buildup. There could be pockets of it. But the more obvious thing that we saw over the quarter were these pushouts from customers who couldn't get matching components to make the car."

I guess what I'm -- the other factor I'm wondering about is, is there a material content per vehicle difference between, let's call it, high-value vehicles like a full-size truck and a lower-value vehicle? Because that can obviously also help. And as we start thinking about next year, maybe some of the volume recovery is more in those lower volume vehicles."

I should say that you and David could probably co-teach the master class together. But look, one maybe thing I would mention, you alluded to regional in automotive. And actually, we saw really strong performance across all of the regions where we operate. 
And I would tell you actually that our business now regionally is more balanced than ever before is roughly equal size between Asia and Europe and just a tick lower in North America. So -- and that's quite a transformation. If you think about it over a decade when at one point, our business was kind of 2/3 in Europe and maybe 1/5 in North America and the rest in Asia. So we've made really great progress in Asia. And I would also say that in Asia, we've made great progress also in the electrification in EVs where our team has just done a fabulous job. 
Relative to your question, do luxury cars have more content for example, then a lower-end car, I think the answer to that is absolutely, yes. That's always been the case. I think that will always be the case. But one of the differences that we have seen, and that's not just the difference of this year or last year, but maybe over the last kind of half a decade or so is we have seen that more and more automakers are equipping their lower-end cars with a greater degree of electronic functionality than they did in the past. 
The traditional approach for automakers was to just stuff their high-end cars with every possible feature, to test out electronics in those cars, to put the newest thing there first and then maybe it would trickle down to the low end, more fleet-type cars or maybe it wouldn't. 
But I tell you, you get any car of any size now, and it's going to have features in it that you never would have imagined before, even in the smallest kind of Fiat 500 or something like that, you're going to see just a real array of electronics functionality. 
So for sure, $100,000 car is always going to have more content than the $30,000 car. But I don't know that the intensity of electronics in that $100,000 is so many multiples more than it is on that maybe $30,000 car. And in the past, that would have been quite a different intensity of the electronic value in the car. So what does that mean for the long term? Are companies selling more high-value trucks and luxury cars today and maybe they'll sell more low-value cars in the future? I doubt I don't have a good read on. But I think there's electronics opportunities across all of these types of cars."

And then I think in conjunction with that, I think one thing that I wanted to understand is broadly across your businesses, if you just kind of feeling that the supply constraints are getting tougher? Or are they getting easier to navigate at this point?"

Well, first, I guess, maybe we have a little bit different numbers in automotive than what you mentioned. I think our automotive business at 20% of sales, it works out to more than $0.5 billion in the quarter. And with the guidance that I've given, it wouldn't be so dissimilar in the third quarter. So I'm not sure the numbers that you referred to. 
Relative to supply constraints, are they getting better, worse, staying the same? I don't know. I guess it feels about the same. I wouldn't say that it feels that much worse. And there are a few things that maybe do feel a little bit worse, like freight, the cost of freight is not that great. So the price of a container from Asia to the U.S., and it's not that, that's a huge impact on us. But once in a while, you do that or your customer does that. And those have gotten quite a bit more expensive over the recent times. 
Even just the availability of that. There's also been a few sort of funky things that have happened like there were some floods in Germany, which were really tragic, and we feel for the people of Germany that suffered through these just sudden catastrophic floods. And there's a -- Germany has a pretty decent size electronic supply chain of vendors and various things like that, and we've seen a disruption or 2 there. I talked about the COVID-related restrictions that are happening a little bit in Southeast Asia. So I don't know that I would say it's getting easier. That's for sure."

In a world where there are no true incumbent with respect to EV powertrains, how does that change the competitive landscape for Amphenol, both in terms of your view of the opportunity set and ultimately how aggressively you pursue that business?"

In fact, our",480,"Well, I mean, the last part of your question, I'll answer first, which is I think we've pursued this business very aggressively over a long time period. We shouldn't forget that the whole concept of a high-voltage system in a car is not new. In fact, our teams have been working on development of specific automotive capable, high-voltage interconnect systems for, I don't know, the whole time I've been CEO, and I've been CEO for nearly 13 years now. 
So I think that's not a new development. I don't think EVs are a new thing, hybrids are a new thing, but they're growing. And I think they're reaching -- I don't know if you want to call it an inflection point, someone mentioned that term earlier. But for sure, the adoption of these vehicles is accelerating on a global basis even if they still represent a relatively modest proportion of the overall vehicle market. 
I mean the vast majority of cars sold today are still combustion engine cars. But to your point, we have, I think, in EVs, a proposition maybe that we didn't have in traditional automotive which is that we've been making high-voltage connectors for a very, very long time. I mean if you think about the legacy of Amphenol over the nearly 9 decades that our company has been in business, we were early on a leader in the innovation and development of power interconnect that's used in military, aerospace, industrial applications. And that came with unique proprietary technologies, in particular, around the efficient and safe transmission of high-voltage power across an interconnect system that requires a very unique contact technology that we have developed over many, many years. 
And so early on, and when I say early on, this is a dozen years ago or more when we were really working early on in these hybrid electric vehicles, we were already repackaging our high-voltage interconnect technologies from the military and industrial into more of an automotive-type interconnect interface and otherwise. 
And so that gave us a very strong position. So it's not new to us to be making high-voltage products. And to the extent that there are more traditional incumbents who are pure automotive companies who may not have had that rich legacy of high-power, high-voltage interconnect we could on occasion, have an advantage. 
Now granted, they have an advantage with the breadth that they work in that market. So it's not that this is kind of a clear path to world domination in the EV market. I mean we have a lot of competition, and we respect them a great deal. But if anything, I think our outperformance in automotive over many years and in particular, over the recent years, there has been a not insignificant component of that, which has been us realizing the benefits of our long-term position in high-voltage products.

This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2021 conference call.Our third quarter 2021 results were released thi",953,"Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2021 conference call.
Our third quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we will take questions.
As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted.
The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2.818 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.67 and $0.65, respectively. Sales were up 21% in U.S. dollars, 20% in local currencies and 13% organically compared to the third quarter of 2020. Sequential sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars and local currencies and organically. Orders for the quarter were $3.16 billion, which was up 33% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and down 3% equally, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.07:1.
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. The interconnect segment, which comprised 96% of sales, was up 21% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Our Cable segment, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income was $571 million in the third quarter. Operating margin was 20.3%, which decreased by 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2020, but increased by 30 basis points sequentially when compared to the second quarter 2021 adjusted operating margin. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was primarily driven by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment in 2021, together with the slight margin dilution of recent acquisitions, including MTS, which are currently operating at a lower operating margin than the company average. The sequential increase in operating margin compared to the second quarter adjusted operating margin was driven by normal conversion on the increased sales levels. 
From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.4% in the third quarter of 2021, which was equal to the third quarter of 2020, an increase from 22% in the second quarter of 2021. In the Cable segment, margins were 3.8%, which decreased from 10.7% in the third quarter of 2020 and 6.1% in the second quarter of 2021. Our margins in the Cable segment continue to be particularly impacted by the ongoing incentive increase in commodity and logistics costs, which have not yet been offset by pricing actions. 
Given the dynamic economic environment, we are very proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage in its many challenges as a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.2%, which compared to 22.1% in the third quarter of 2020. 
On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in the third quarter of both 2021 and 2020. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.67, an increase of 20% compared to $0.56 in the prior year period and adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.65 and an increase of 18% compared to $0.55 in the third quarter of 2020. 
Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $328 million or 81% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $238 million or 59% of adjusted net income. Cash flow in the quarter was a bit lower than we would typically expect, primarily due to the higher than typical increase in inventory levels, driven by the continued challenging supply chain environment. 
From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 91, 70 and 61 days, respectively. While days sales and payable days were both within our normal range, inventory days at the quarter end were elevated for the reasons just mentioned as well as the impact of recent acquisitions, which have inventory days that are currently significantly above the company average. 
As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 38% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.20 from $0.145 per share, effective for payments beginning in January of 2022. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.3 million shares of companies of common stock for approximately $171 million at an average price of approximately $73. 
And at the end of the quarter, total debt was $5.2 billion, and net debt was $3.9 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.
Third quarter 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $686 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.6x. As previously discussed, due to the pending sale of the MTS Test and Simulation business, that business is being reported as a discontinued operation, and therefore, its expected results are excluded from our Q4 guidance.
In addition, the company will incur certain additional cash, tax and other acquisition-related costs upon the divestiture of the Test and Simulation business, which is not included in income from continuing operations.
I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends."

And I hope that all of you had an enjoyable and healthy summer and are staying dry here if you're in the Northeast today. 
As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements here in the third quarter. I will discuss the trends and our progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'll make some comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2021. And of course, we'll have time at the end for questions. 
As Craig went over, our results in the third quarter were substantially better than we had expected coming into the quarter. We exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales as well as in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our sales grew a very strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies, reaching a new record $2.818 billion.
On an organic basis, our sales increased by 13%, with broad-based growth across most of our served markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. Orders in the quarter were robust again, more than $3 billion, $3.016 billion, and this represented another strong book-to-bill of 1.07:1.
Now despite the many operational challenges that we've continued to face throughout the quarter, including continued cost increases related to commodities, supply chain and other logistics pressures, we were very pleased to deliver robust operating margins of 20.3% in the quarter. And as Craig detailed, that was a 30 basis point sequential improvement. 
Our EPS -- adjusted diluted EPS grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 18% to a new record $0.65, and that's just an excellent reflection once again, of our organization's continued strong execution. The company generated operating and free cash flow of $328 million and $238 million in third quarter. And we're very pleased that the Board of Directors just approved yesterday an increase in our dividend of 38% effective in January of next year.
Coming out of this quarter, I'm just extremely proud of our team around the world. These results, once again, reflect the discipline as well as the agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic and challenging environment.
Now turning to our trends and progress across our served markets. We're very pleased that the company's broad and balanced end market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol. Very importantly, our diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also at the same time, exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. And these are both important benefits, especially amidst such a dynamic market environment.
Turning first to the military market. This market represented 10% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales grew by 7% from prior year and declined by 4% organically, which was a little bit lower than our expectation heading into the quarter. On an organic basis, growth in ordinance, airframe and space-related products was more than offset by moderations of our sales and products that were used in vehicle, naval and communications applications. Sequentially, sales declined by about 3%. 
Looking into the fourth quarter, we now expect a slight sequential sales increase. And for the full year 2021, this would imply a mid-teens increase in sales from last year's levels. We continue to be excited by the strength of Amphenol's position in the military market. As defense customers around the world continue to adopt next-generation technologies at an increasing pace, our industry-leading breadth of high-technology, interconnect and sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major defense programs, and this gives us confidence for our long-term performance. 
The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were flat compared to prior year and declined by about 19% organically as the benefit of our recent acquisition was offset by continued declines in demand from aircraft manufacturers. As we expected coming into the quarter, our sales declined by about 3% sequentially. 
Looking into the fourth quarter, we're happy to now expect a mid-teens increase in sales compared to these levels. And for the full year 2021, this would imply a roughly 10% sales decline compared to last year, a clear reflection of the pandemic-related headwinds that have impacted the travel industry and thus, the commercial aircraft market during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Regardless of this challenging environment, so far, our team working in the commercial aerospace market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of airplane platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those aircraft. As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic impacted lows, we do look forward to benefiting as jet manufacturers expand their production and, in turn, expand their procurement of our components. 
The industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by a very strong 44% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically. This excellent growth was broad-based across most segments of the worldwide industrial market, including, in particular, the battery and heavy electric vehicle, factory automation, oil and gas, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, alternative energy and instrumentation segments, together with the contributions from our recent acquisitions.
On a sequential basis, sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels. But for the full year 2021, we expect sales to increase more than 40% from prior year, a very strong performance. 
I remain extremely proud of our global team working in the industrial market. Our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned the company to capitalize on the many revolutions that are occurring across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come.
The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. And despite the widely reported challenges across the automotive market, our sales actually came in higher than expectations in the quarter, growing a strong 31% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically. This strong performance reflected our automotive team's excellent execution in the face of numerous supply chain challenges as well as robust growth of our products used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. This is another clear confirmation of our global team's long-term efforts at designing in high voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these next-generation platforms.
On a sequential basis, sales were flat compared to the second quarter. The widely reported supply chain challenges in the auto industry continued to impact demand from vehicle manufacturers around the world. Accordingly, we do expect in the fourth quarter a high single-digit sequential moderation in sales. For the full year 2021, this implies sales will increase by more than 40% compared to last year, driven by our expanded position in next-generation electronics integrated into cars, including, in particular, those electric and hybrid drivetrains. 
I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has continued to demonstrate a high degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from last year's reduced sales levels while also expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that the entire automotive industry is facing. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future.
The mobile devices market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. And our sales in this market declined from prior year by 5%, as modest growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and laptops was more than offset by declines in wearables and tablets. Sequentially, sales increased by a stronger-than-expected 36%, driven by higher sales across virtually all product categories that we serve.
Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect the continued mid- to high single-digit increase in sales from these third quarter levels. And for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow modestly from 2020, which is, in fact, an impressive achievement given last year's robust demand.
I remain very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market. Their unique agility continues to enable the company to react quickly to changing demand in this most volatile of markets. With our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms, enabling a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, we're positioned well for the long term.
Turning to the mobile networks market. This market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased by 11% from prior year and 7% organically. And this sales growth was really driven by our sales to mobile service providers, which was offset by a small moderation of sales to OEMs. On a sequential basis, our sales increased just slightly, which was largely in line with our expectations coming into the quarter.
For the fourth quarter, we expect another slight sequential increase in sales as mobile networks customers continued to ramp up their investments in 5G and other next-generation networks. And for 2021, this would imply that our sales would grow by approximately 10%. 
Our team continues to work aggressively in the mobile networks market to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. As our customers ramp up their investments into these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers.
The information technology and datacom market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market rose from prior year by a very strong 28% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically. This was driven by increased demand from OEMs and in particular, increased demand from web service providers. Sequentially, our sales grew by a better-than-expected 10% from second quarter levels.
As we look into the fourth quarter, we do expect a slight decline from these elevated levels. And for the full year of 2021, we expect sales to increase in the low 20% range. We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our OEM and service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains highly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom with industry-leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position for many years to come.
And finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 5% from prior year and 10% organically as cable operator procurement moderated. On a sequential basis, sales decreased by a slightly better-than-expected 3%. For the fourth quarter, we now expect a further moderation in sales from these levels. And for the full year 2021, we anticipate that sales will grow in the mid-single digits.
Despite this more challenging environment in the broadband market, we continue to look forward to supporting our service provider customers around the world. all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and to businesses. 
Now turning to our outlook. There's no question that the current environment remains highly uncertain, with significant supply chain and inflationary challenges as well as the ongoing pandemic. Given this and assume constant exchange rates, for the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.69 billion to $2.75 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.61 to $0.63. This would represent year-over-year sales growth of 11% to 13% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 11%. 
Our fourth quarter guidance represents an expectation for full year sales of $10.54 billion to $10.6 billion, and full year adjusted diluted EPS of $2.39 to $2.41. This outlook represents full year sales and adjusted EPS growth of 23% and 28% to 29%, respectively. 
I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. In addition, our entire organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world.
Most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to once again thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions."

I think for the first 22 years of my so far 23-year career, I don't recall that the front page was plastered with things about the supply chain. And now it seems to be virtually every day that you read something about it.
And no question, throughout the quarter, there remains just a number of real significant challenges that are thought though -- and really thought through. I think when you see the results, in particular, growing sequentially by 6% in the quarter, which was above our expectations. Amidst what I would say, we're continued serious supply chain impediments, some of which even worsened throughout the quarter, whether that's availability of logistics and freight, the cost of raw materials, the availability of raw materials, even talk about things like labor shortages, which are there pockets of that around the world as well. And so no question that those are all dynamics that our team faced. And across that entrepreneurial Amphenol organization, our team just made it happen. 
Now in terms of inventory builds and orders moderating, I mean we still had strong orders in the quarter. There's no doubt about it. And even though our book-to-bill was a bit lower, one of them compared to the second quarter, most of the reason why our book-to-bill was lower because our sales grew into the level of the bookings. Orders were down by maybe 3% from the second quarter, but sales were up by 6%, thus the slightly lower but still robust book-to-bill. 
In terms of inventory, I mean you saw for sure that our inventory was up a little bit, and I think many have seen a little bit elevated inventory, which is not surprising given both our growth as a company -- very significant growth, but also the very significant supply chain impediments that are out there.
To the extent that our customers have more inventory, we don't always have perfect visibility into that. I will say what we do have visibility to, which is, in particular, in distribution, we haven't seen really abnormal levels of inventory amongst our distributors for our products. In fact, I think what we've seen is continued strong sell-through of the products into customers around the world.
And knowing that our distribution business is predominantly industrial and aerospace millero business, and we've seen continued really strong demand, in particular, across the industrial market. What -- in terms of the customers and their willingness to pull product, we talked about last quarter in the automotive market, for example, that we probably could have shipped more if customers wanted it. And I think we continue to see some instances, anecdotes, where customers because they don't have all the components that they need to make their finished product, be it a car or a truck or otherwise, they, in the end, don't take our product as opposed to necessarily building the inventory of our products, they just tell us not to ship it. So a lot going on. But I think at the end of the day, amidst all these challenges, the performance of the company has shown very brightly."

And I think when I look into the fourth quarter, we're coming from very elevated levels of demand. And we're not guiding to like a catastrophic reduction. We're talking about a modest sequential decline in the fourth quarter, which I think, given the overall environment, given the overall demand from our customers, and in particular, customers in web service, where we've seen just really strong growth in whether you call them cloud or web service providers, and we're seeing outstanding growth in that business over the last couple of years.
And once in a while, you could have a moderation. There could even be a little bit of seasonality that could come into that. So I don't think that this fourth quarter guide is at all a turnaround in that business. It would still, by the way, in the fourth quarter reflect very, very strong year-over-year growth in that IT datacom market. And in the end, I think, would be a very, very strong year for that market and for our team working in that market."

I think that if we think about our profitability, we're certainly very proud of our achievement in the quarter and certainly this year given the significant challenging cost environment. And certainly, that cost environment has been increasingly, I'd say, gotten worse over the course of the year. And I think that we have done a good job of neutralizing that worsening environment given the actions we've been able to take during the year. 
And one of those actions clearly is being able to pass on some of that cost to our to our customers to the degree that we can't offset it in other ways. And so certainly, the management team, I think, has done a really good job of that. Different markets are more challenging than other markets. And certainly, things like distribution is easier to pass on. Pricing and other markets are a little bit more difficult or channels are difficult to press on pricing. 
But I think overall, we've done a pretty good job. And most of the markets are passing on some of the pricing. I wouldn't make the exception, and new comment on cable. And certainly, that market is a different type of market from a competitive environment as well as the products are a little bit different, more -- they're certainly more cost sensitive and certainly more impacted by logistics costs, which we've seen a significant increase of 
And there's been quite a quick increase of those types of costs that absolutely have had an impact that we haven't necessarily been able to offset at this point, and the team is doing certainly a good job of working through that. And we do think over some period of time, they will be able to offset those cost pressures, but that's something that in that market, you can't really do overnight.
Other markets like automotive aren't so easy. But certainly, I think the team has done a good job of starting those conversations and there's other markets that are easier. So I think that we've done a good job. I think that we've been able to offset the majority, certainly, of the sequential increase that we've seen during the year of the cost environment. 
And we're not guiding into '22 at this point, but I do believe that the cost environment is not going to get any easier anytime soon. So the team certainly has been tasked with, and I think they're doing a good job of continuing those conversations with their customers in all of the markets, some of which are easier and some of which are harder in terms of being able to ultimately pass on those cost increases to our customers and be able to continue to leverage and increase our margins as we continue to grow."

Pricing is an art. It's not just you issue a price increase and off it goes. And the beauty of how we're organized is that we're not making those pricing decisions here at headquarters.
Rather, we have 125 general managers around the world. And those general managers are best suited to make the right decision around pricing because they know the strength of their own position. They know their competitive position. They know their technology position. And they also can go to a customer and say, ""Look, I have tried everything else and the only remaining thing I can do is raise the price to you."" And then it's a genuine, it's a reasonable discussion and it's one that's grounded in fact and basis as opposed to in corporate policy.
And I think that's why we've always been maybe a little bit more successful in moderating the impacts of these because our general managers have every tool available to them, all of the functions, all of the inputs are part of their responsibility and thus, they're able to go out and make it happen.
And just because the cost of materials is up, or the cost of logistics is up does not give absolution to an Amphenol general manager for their performance, not in our company. I mean no matter what the cycle is, we have absolute standards for performance and they have to hit that, and they'll figure it out. And if that means having those tough discussions with customers, then that's what they're going to do."

Look, there's a long story for us, which is that we've been growing our automotive business for more than a decade through a consistent strategy of growing both organically and through acquisitions into new electronics applications, new applications in the car. 
Throughout the course of that time, we expanded our product offering from simple connectors and cable assemblies to sensors and antennas, complex sensor assemblies and the like. And through it all, our strategy has not been to just take share out of incumbents, but rather to participate in the expansion of electronics in the automotive market. And that expansion of electronics has really accelerated throughout that time.
And as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, one area of expansion of electronics had been across the electrification of vehicles, both electric and hybrid vehicles, where we've leveraged our strong legacy and high-voltage capabilities to really be a strong participant in that area. And that's been a great growth driver for us for many quarters, and that included in the quarter that just completed.

Now everybody has their little connectors all over the car and things like that. And whether it be navigation systems, communication systems, safety systems, passenger comfort systems, we have seen.

Because we shouldn't forget like in the global automotive market, I don't know, hybrid and EVs. I'm not perfectly familiar with everyone of these numbers, but I think they still represent less than 10%. And that's if you include hybrids of all total vehicle volumes. But I would say all vehicles are adopting more electronics because the car companies have realized not only do their customers want these things, but actually they can make more money on these things. 
These type of features are things that people will actually pay more for, and thereby allow the car companies to make more profit from their products. And look, it's great news for anybody working in the automotive electronics market.

We've talked about commodities and cost environment impacting that segment more. And when you're in a more unprecedented environment where the costs have just increased so quickly and so significantly, and then you're in a market where it's not as easy to overnight increase prices even in an unprecedented cost environment due to the competitive dynamics and other factors within those -- within that market, that it just becomes an unfortunate situation that it does have a more significant impact in the short term here.
There's no doubt that the team is working hard on pricing actions, and we're confident that they will be successful over some period of time. Don't forget this is 4% of the company right now. It's relatively small. But for the businesses that are involved in dealing with this, this is impactful for them as it is for any other operation. So it's not meaningful, but it certainly has a lower impact on the overall company.
But there's no doubt as the management team is extremely focused on this, we are optimistic that over some -- not so long-term period of time and shorter term, we'll be able to get these margins back up. Whether or not expect quarter or the quarter after, I think will tell, but we are optimistic that it will -- we are at the lower end of the scale in terms of profitability in this market, and it will improve over these coming quarters."

But what we have said very consistently, and I would say it again this quarter, is that the growth in our EV business, whether that's in auto or also our industrial electrification business, have been significant drivers of our outperformance. So you can imagine that after a number of quarters of doing so, that business represents a lot more today than it did many quarters ago. And it's a meaningful piece of the business.

I mean you said that the industrial market is, for us, a very, very diversified range of segments. Everything from medical, to heavy vehicles, to oil and gas, things like marine, factory automation, the battery and heav",561,"Yes. Well, thanks very much, David. I mean you said that the industrial market is, for us, a very, very diversified range of segments. Everything from medical, to heavy vehicles, to oil and gas, things like marine, factory automation, the battery and heavy electric vehicles, alternative energy. I mean even in an area like building automation, where we've seen a lot of strong growth. I mean what was, I think, really unique here in the third quarter was virtually every one of those segments grew in the quarter. 
So you don't always see that. Usually, there's some sort of countercyclicality across one or another of those segments. And we saw really strong performance across all of them. And when I think about why the company has really done such an excellent job in industrial, I mean I'd point to a few factors. Number one is our strategy for many years has been to build out a range of products that make us more important to customers across the industrial world. 
And again, remembering that what ties those products together is that they are all harsh environment solutions. So whether they be discrete connectors, value-add interconnect assemblies, centers, antennas or the like, these are all products that have to be ruggedized. They have to be fit to an environment that maybe as an ultra clean environment in an operating theater, maybe an ultra dirty environment in an oil and gas drilling setup, or in an alternative energy on an offshore wind mill or something like that. So all of these have just really uniquely challenging environments around them.
And what we see in common across these customers and where a lot of our growth has come from, this is really the second factor, is that customers across the industrial market are adopting electronics at an increasing pace. So the same discussion that we had in the auto market just a few moments ago, we see that really broadly across the industrial market as customers adopt next-generation electronic systems and put those systems into tougher and tougher environments. 
I would also say that the industrial market is a very fragmented market from a competitive perspective. And so while for sure, we're taking advantage of new things in this market like we are in automotive, I think there's also the fact that we continue to gain position against competitors who either don't have the breadth of offering, don't have the geographical position to support customers on a global basis, don't have the diverse and resilient footprint that has been able to those customers during the pandemic or during all the other disruptions that have come along. And thereby, customers have come increasing to us to solve their problems, and we've not disappointed them, and that creates a positive feedback loop. 
So it's a market that I think we're very excited about. I think our team working in this market is just doing a great job. If you look into the fourth quarter, for sure, you can look at that fourth quarter kind of through the prism of saying, ""Well, we're guiding it to be down slightly."" But in fact, on a year-over-year basis, going to be an outstanding fourth quarter as well. So I think the team just continues to excel, and we're very excited about the industrial market for many years to come."

I mean the geopolitical tension that has been present for a number of years has certainly not gone away. And I, for one, would fully advocate that countries like the U.S. and China, the world's 2 largest economies, should, for sure, get along. There's lots and lots of reasons why we should. 
And by the way, personally, I'm very optimistic that long term, that is going to be the case. But as it relates to our position in any country, including China, I mean I would just remind everybody, we have a very unique operating strategy. We rely on local managers in every country that we operate. And we operate in more than 40 countries around the world. And in each of those places, we have local general managers who have the authority to run their business as they need to run it in that region to be most successful. 
So our general managers in China are able to tailor-make how they do business, obviously, within the confines of ethics and law and everything that it means to be a global company. But they're able to meet their customers on a level playing field with their local competitors. But in fact, it's not a level playing field because then they're able to bring the totality of Amphenol's capabilities to bear in support of those customers. And that's where the advantage is. 
We bring the best of both worlds of both being a local partner, but also a global company who has global resources, global breadth and global capabilities. 
And that's why we've been successful in India. That's why we've been successful in China. That's why we've been successful in France, in Germany, in the U.K. and of course, here in the U.S.. It's a very unique operating model that is -- that works really, really well in a world where everybody is getting along, but it also works really well in a world where people aren't necessarily getting along. 
In terms of how we deploy our capital, we're always careful about deploying capital in every country in the world. We're always going to incorporate all the sort of risks and opportunities into our calculus about what we're going to invest in and what we're not going to invest in. And ultimately, those investment ideas are all coming up from below, not sort of dictated from above. But for sure, we're going to apply appropriate scrutiny to invest in every place in the world using sort of the full picture of the environment into which we're investing."

This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2021 conference call.
Our third quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends and then we will take questions.
As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise noted.
The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2.818 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.67 and $0.65, respectively. Sales were up 21% in U.S. dollars, 20% in local currencies and 13% organically compared to the third quarter of 2020. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars and local currencies and organically. Orders for the quarter were $3.16 billion, which was up 33% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and down 3% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.07:1.
Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. The Interconnect segment, which comprised 96% of sales, was up 21% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Our Cable segment, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income was $571 million in the third quarter. Operating margin was 20.3%, which decreased by 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2020, but increased by 30 basis points sequentially when compared to the second quarter 2021 adjusted operating margin. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was primarily driven by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment in 2021, together with the slight margin dilution of recent acquisitions, including MTS, which are currently operating at a lower operating margin than the company average. The sequential increase in operating margin compared to the second quarter adjusted operating margin was driven by normal conversion on the increased sales levels.
From a segment standpoint, in the Interconnect segment, margins were 22.4% in the third quarter of 2021, which was equal to the third quarter of 2020, an increase from 22% in the second quarter of 2021. In the Cable segment, margins were 3.8%, which decreased from 10.7% in the third quarter of 2020 and 6.1% in the second quarter of 2021. Our margins in the Cable segment continue to be particularly impacted by the ongoing increase in commodity and logistics costs, which have not yet been offset by pricing actions.
Given the dynamic economic environment, we are very proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage in its many challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.2%, which compared to 22.1% in the third quarter of 2020.
On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in the third quarter of both 2021 and 2020. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.67, an increase of 20% compared to $0.56 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.65, an increase of 18% compared to $0.55 in the third quarter of 2020.
Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $328 million or 81% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $238 million or 59% of adjusted net income. Cash flow in the quarter was a bit lower than we would typically expect primarily due to the higher than typical increase in inventory levels driven by the continuous challenging supply chain environment.
From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 91, 70 and 61 days, respectively. While days sales and payable days were both within our normal range, inventory days at the quarter end were elevated for the reasons just mentioned as well as the impact of recent acquisitions, which have inventory days that are currently significantly above the company average.
As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 38% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.20 from $0.145 per share, effective for payments beginning in January of 2022. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.3 million shares of companies -- of common stock for approximately $171 million at an average price of approximately $73.
And at the end of the quarter, total debt was $5.2 billion, and net debt was $3.9 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities.
Third quarter 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $686 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.6x. As previously discussed, due to the pending sale of the MTS Test & Simulation business, that business is being reported as a discontinued operation and therefore, its expected results are excluded from our Q4 guidance. In addition, the company will incur certain additional cash, tax and other acquisition-related costs upon the divestiture of the Test & Simulation business, which is not included in income from continuing operations.
I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends."

And I hope that all of you had an enjoyable and healthy summer and are staying dry here if you're in the Northeast today.
As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements here in the third quarter. I will discuss the trends and our progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'll make some comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2021. And of course, we'll have time at the end for questions.
As Craig went over, our results in the third quarter were substantially better than we had expected coming into the quarter. We exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales as well as in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our sales grew a very strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies, reaching a new record, $2.818 billion.
On an organic basis, our sales increased by 13%, with broad-based growth across most of our served markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. Orders in the quarter were robust, again more than $3 billion, $3.016 billion, and this represented another strong book-to-bill of 1.07:1.
Now despite the many operational challenges that we have continued to face throughout the quarter, including continued cost increases related to commodities, supply chain and other logistics pressures, we were very pleased to deliver robust operating margins of 20.3% in the quarter. And as Craig detailed, that was a 30 basis point sequential improvement.
Our EPS -- adjusted diluted EPS grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 18% to a new record of $0.65, and that's just an excellent reflection once again of our organization's continued strong execution.
The company generated operating and free cash flow of $328 million and $238 million in the third quarter. And we're very pleased that the Board of Directors just approved yesterday an increase in our dividend of 38% effective in January of next year.
Coming out of this quarter, I'm just extremely proud of our team around the world. These results once again reflect the discipline as well as the agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic and challenging environment.
Now turning to our trends and progress across our served markets. We're very pleased that the company's broad and balanced end market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol. Very importantly, our diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also at the same time, exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. And these are both important benefits, especially amidst such a dynamic market environment.
Turning first to the military market. This market represented 10% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales grew by 7% from prior year and declined by 4% organically, which was a little bit lower than our expectation heading into the quarter. On an organic basis, growth in ordnance, airframe and space-related products was more than offset by moderations of our sales in products that were used in vehicle, naval and communications applications. Sequentially, sales declined by about 3%.
Looking into the fourth quarter, we now expect a slight sequential sales increase. And for the full year 2021, this would imply a mid-teens increase in sales from last year's levels. We continue to be excited by the strength of Amphenol's position in the military market. As defense customers around the world continue to adopt next-generation technologies at an increasing pace, our industry-leading breadth of high-technology Interconnect and Sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major defense programs. And this gives us confidence for our long-term performance.
The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were flat compared to prior year and declined by about 19% organically as the benefit of our recent acquisitions was offset by continued declines in demand from aircraft manufacturers. As we expected coming into the quarter, our sales declined by about 3% sequentially.
Looking into the fourth quarter, we're happy that -- to now expect a mid-teens increase in sales compared to these levels. And for the full year 2021, this would imply a roughly 10% sales decline compared to last year, a clear reflection of the pandemic-related headwinds that have impacted the travel industry and thus, the commercial aircraft market during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Regardless of this challenging environment so far, our team working in the commercial aerospace market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong Interconnect and Sensor technology position across a wide array of airplane platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those aircraft. As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic-impacted lows, we do look forward to benefiting as jet manufacturers expand their production and in turn, expand their procurement of our components.
The industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by a very strong 44% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically. This excellent growth was broad-based across most segments of the worldwide industrial market, including, in particular, the battery and heavy electric vehicle, factory automation, oil and gas, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, alternative energy and instrumentation segments, together with the contributions from our recent acquisitions.
On a sequential basis, sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels. But for the full year 2021, we expect sales to increase more than 40% from prior year, a very strong performance.
I remain extremely proud of our global team working in the industrial market. Our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology Interconnect antenna and Sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned the company to capitalize on the many revolutions that are occurring across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come.
The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. And despite the widely reported challenges across the automotive market, our sales actually came in higher than expectations in the quarter, growing a strong 31% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically. This strong performance reflected our automotive team's excellent execution in the face of numerous supply chain challenges as well as robust growth of our products used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. This was another clear confirmation of our global team's long-term efforts at designing in high-voltage and other Interconnect and Sensor products into these next-generation platforms.
On a sequential basis, sales were flat compared to the second quarter. The widely reported supply chain challenges in the auto industry continued to impact demand from vehicle manufacturers around the world. Accordingly, we do expect in the fourth quarter a high single-digit sequential moderation in sales. For the full year 2021, this implies sales will increase by more than 40% compared to last year driven by our expanded position in next-generation electronics integrated into cars, including, in particular, those electric and hybrid drivetrains.
I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has continued to demonstrate a high degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from last year's reduced sales levels while also expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that the entire automotive industry is facing. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future.
The mobile devices market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. And our sales in this market declined from prior year by 5% as modest growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and laptops was more than offset by declines in wearables and tablets. Sequentially, sales increased by a stronger-than-expected 36% driven by higher sales across virtually all product categories that we serve.
Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect the continued mid- to high single-digit increase in sales from these third quarter levels. And for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow modestly from 2020, which is, in fact, an impressive achievement given last year's robust demand.
I remain very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market. Their unique agility continues to enable the company to react quickly to changing demand in this most volatile of markets. With our leading array of antennas, Interconnect products and mechanisms, enabling a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, we're positioned well for the long term.
Turning to the mobile networks market. This market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased by 11% from prior year and 7% organically. And this sales growth was really driven by our sales to mobile service providers, which was offset by a small moderation of sales to OEMs. On a sequential basis, our sales increased just slightly, which was largely in line with our expectations coming into the quarter.
For the fourth quarter, we expect another slight sequential increase in sales as mobile networks customers continued to ramp up their investments in 5G and other next-generation networks. And for 2021, this would imply that our sales would grow by approximately 10%.
Our team continues to work aggressively in the mobile networks market to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. As our customers ramp up their investments into these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers.
The information technology and datacom market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market rose from prior year by a very strong 28% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically. And this was driven by increased demand from OEMs and in particular, increased demand from web service providers. Sequentially, our sales grew by a better-than-expected 10% from second quarter levels.
As we look into the fourth quarter, we do expect a slight decline from these elevated levels. And for the full year of 2021, we expect sales to increase in the low 20% range. We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our OEM and service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains highly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom with industry-leading high-speed power and fiber optic Interconnect products. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position for many years to come.
And finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 5% from prior year and 10% organically as cable operator procurement moderated. On a sequential basis, sales decreased by a slightly better-than-expected 3%. For the fourth quarter, we now expect a further moderation in sales from these levels. And for the full year 2021, we anticipate that sales will grow in the mid-single digits.
Despite this more challenging environment in the broadband market, we continue to look forward to supporting our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and to businesses.
Now turning to our outlook. There's no question that the current market environment remains highly uncertain, with significant supply chain and inflationary challenges as well as the ongoing pandemic. Given this and assuming constant exchange rates, for the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.690 billion to $2.750 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.61 to $0.63. This would represent year-over-year sales growth of 11% to 13% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 11%.
Our fourth quarter guidance represents an expectation for full year sales of $10.540 billion to $10.600 billion and full year adjusted diluted EPS of $2.39 to $2.41. This outlook represents full year sales and adjusted EPS growth of 23% and 28% to 29%, respectively.
I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. In addition, our entire organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world.
Most importantly, I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter.
And with that, operator, we would be very happy to take any questions."

You can't pick up the paper without reading about supply chains. I think for the first 22 years of my so far 23-year career, I don't recall that the front page was plastered with things about the supply chain. And now, it seems to be virtually every day that you read something about it.
And no question, throughout the quarter, there remains just a number of real significant challenges that our team thought through and really thought through. I think when you see the results, in particular growing sequentially by 6% in the quarter, which was above our expectations, amidst, what I would say, were continued serious supply chain impediments, some of which even worsened throughout the quarter, whether that's availability of logistics and freight, the cost of raw materials, the availability of raw materials, even talking about things like labor shortages, which are -- there are pockets of that around the world as well. And so no question that those are all dynamics that our team faced. And across that entrepreneurial Amphenol organization, our team just made it happen.
Now in terms of inventory builds and orders moderating, I mean, we still had strong orders in the quarter. There's no doubt about it. And even though our book-to-bill was a bit lower, 1.07 compared to the second quarter, most of the reason why our book-to-bill was lower because our sales grew into the level of the bookings. But orders were down by maybe 3% from the second quarter, but sales were up by 6%, thus the slightly lower but still robust book-to-bill.
In terms of inventory, I mean, you saw for sure that our inventory was up a little bit, and I think many have seen a little bit elevated inventory, which is not surprising given both our growth as a company, very significant growth, but also the very significant supply chain impediments that are out there.
To the extent that our customers have more inventory, we don't always have perfect visibility into that. I will say what we do have visibility into, which is, in particular, in distribution, we haven't seen really abnormal levels of inventory amongst our distributors for our products. In fact, I think what we've seen is continued strong sell-through of the products into customers around the world and knowing that our distribution business is predominantly industrial and aerospace, mil aero business, and we've seen continued really strong demand in particular across the industrial market.
What -- in terms of the customers and their willingness to pull product, we talked about last quarter, in the automotive market, for example, that we probably could have shipped more if customers wanted it. And I think we continue to see some instances, anecdotes, where customers, because they don't have all the components that they need to make their finished product, be it a car or a truck or otherwise, they, in the end, don't take our product. As opposed to necessarily building the inventory of our products, they just tell us not to ship it. So a lot going on, but I think at the end of the day, amidst all these challenges, the performance of the company has shone very brightly."

And I think, when I look into the fourth quarter, we're coming from very elevated levels of demand. And we're not guiding to like a catastrophic reduction. We're talking about a modest sequential decline in the fourth quarter, which I think given the overall environment, given the overall demand from our customers and in particular, customers in web service, where we've seen just really strong growth in whether you call them cloud or web service providers, and we've seen outstanding growth in that business over the last couple of years.
And once in a while, you could have a moderation. There could even be a little bit of seasonality that could come into that. So I don't think that this fourth quarter guide is at all a turnaround in that business. It would still, by the way, in the fourth quarter, reflect very, very strong year-over-year growth in that IT datacom market and in the end, I think, would be a very, very strong year for that market and for our team working in that market."

I think that if we think about our profitability, we're certainly very proud of our achievement in the quarter and certainly this year given the significant challenging cost environment. And certainly, that cost environment has been increasingly, I would say, gotten worse over the course of the year. And I think that we have done a good job of neutralizing that worsening environment given the actions we've been able to take during the year.
And one of those actions clearly is being able to pass on some of that cost to our customers, to the degree that we can't offset it in other ways. And so certainly, the management team, I think, has done a really good job of that. Different markets are more challenging than other markets. And certainly, things like distribution is easier to pass on. Pricing in other markets are a little bit more difficult, or channels are difficult to pass on pricing.
But I think, overall, we've done a pretty good job. And most of the markets are passing on some of the pricing. I wouldn't make the exception. And you comment on Cable, and certainly, that market is a different type of market from a competitive environment as well as the products are a little bit different, more -- they're certainly more cost-sensitive and certainly more impacted by logistics costs, which we've seen a significant increase of.
And there's been quite a quick increase of those types of costs that absolutely have had an impact that we haven't necessarily been able to offset at this point, and the team is doing certainly a good job of working through that. And we do think, over some period of time, they will be able to offset those cost pressures, but that's something that, in that market, you can't really do overnight.
Other markets, like automotive, aren't so easy. But certainly, I think the team has done a good job of starting those conversations, and there's other markets that are easier. So I think that we've done a good job. I think that we've been able to offset the majority, certainly, of the sequential increases that we've seen during the year of the cost environment.
And we're not guiding into '22 at this point, but I do believe that the cost environment is not going to get any easier anytime soon. So the team certainly has been tasked with, and I think they're doing a good job of continuing those conversations with their customers in all of the markets, some of which are easier and some of which are harder, in terms of being able to ultimately pass on those cost increases to our customers and be able to continue to leverage and increase our margins as we continue to grow."

Pricing is an art. It's not just you issue a price increase and off it goes. And the beauty of how we're organized is that we're not making those pricing decisions here at headquarters.
Rather, we have 125 general managers around the world. And those general managers are best suited to make the right decision around pricing because they know the strength of their own position. They know their competitive position. They know their technology position. And they also can go to a customer and say, ""Look, I have tried everything else and the only remaining thing I can do is raise the price to you."" And then it's a genuine, it's a reasonable discussion, and it's one that's grounded in fact and basis as opposed to in corporate policy.
And I think that's why we've always been maybe a little bit more successful in moderating the impacts of these because our general managers have every tool available to them. All of the functions, all of the inputs are part of their responsibility, and thus, they're able to go out and make it happen.
And just because the cost of materials is up, or the cost of logistics is up, does not give absolution to an Amphenol general manager for their performance, not in our company. I mean no matter what the cycle is, we have absolute standards for performance and they have to hit that. And they will figure it out.

Thanks very much, Nik. Look, this is a long story for us, which is that we've been growing our automotive business for more than a decade through a consistent strategy of growing both organically and through acquisitions, into new electronics applications, new applications in the car.
Throughout the course of that time, we expanded our product offering, from simple connectors and cable assemblies, to sensors and antennas, complex sensor assemblies and the like. And through it all, our strategy has not been to just take share out of incumbents, but rather to participate in the expansion of electronics in the automotive market. And that expansion of electronics has really accelerated throughout that time.
And as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, one area of expansion of electronics had been across the electrification of vehicles, both electric and hybrid vehicles, where we've leveraged our strong legacy and high-voltage capabilities to really be a strong participant in that area. And that's been a great growth driver for us for many quarters, and that included in the quarter that just completed.
Have we seen expedites in the automotive market? I would actually say we've seen, this quarter and last quarter, more of the opposite of expedites. We've seen that customers have pushed out demand because of supply shortages that they're seeing from other types of commodities.

A lot of the discussion around your business these days is around EVs and rightly so. But what I wanted to ask you about is knock-on effects that you're seeing on some other factors. Some of the industry have talked about the so-called Tesla [ hill, by either ] the fact that consumer expectations for tech in the vehicle are just simply much higher in an EV.
And I'm wondering as you look across your business and the outgrowth that you're seeing, both right now and over the last few years, how does this accelerated proliferation of technology inside the vehicle play to the company's strengths and positioning relative to electrification?"

And it's a question that I wouldn't even confine to EVs. I mean you point out that consumer expectations for technology in EVs, but I would just say consumer expectations for technology in vehicles, full stop, has expanded and has continued to accelerate over many years.
I mean I just look at my kids, when we get in a car, you've got like a spaghetti of cables that people want to plug in to various parts of the car. And then you now have car companies coming and putting in things like wireless charging and outlets in different places as opposed to me having one of these massive things that every kid has to plug their thing into a cigarette lighter.
Now everybody has their little connectors all over the car and things like that. And whether it be navigation systems, communication systems, safety systems, passenger comfort systems, we have seen, and I think we are living through, a revolution of electronics in vehicles. And that's all vehicles.
Because we shouldn't forget, like in the global automotive market, I don't know, hybrid and EVs, I'm not perfectly familiar with everyone of these numbers, but I think they still represent less than 10%. And that's if you include hybrids of all total vehicle volumes. But I would say all vehicles are adopting more electronics because the car companies have realized, not only that do their customers want these things, but actually, they can make more money on these things.
These type of features are things that people will actually pay more for and thereby allow the car companies to make more profit from their products. And look, it's great news for anybody working in the automotive electronics market. It's -- and for our company, we're -- again, our strategy has not been to go and take share out of others, but rather to work on the new things that are happening in the car. I think our company comes out of that very well-positioned."

Yes, there's no doubt that the profitability of the Cable segment is at the lowest level it's been in, certainly, in my memory. And I think -- but when we talk about it being unprecedented, I think we're also in an unprecedented environment from a cost perspective and especially as it relates to things that impact that segment, which are things like logistics and things like certain commodity costs, that have always had a more of a significant impact on that segment.
We've talked about commodities and cost environment impacting that segment more. And when you're in a more unprecedented environment, where the costs have just increased so quickly and so significantly, and then you're in a market where it's not as easy to, overnight, increase prices, even in an unprecedented cost environment due to the competitive dynamics and other factors within those -- within that market, that it just becomes an unfortunate situation that it does have a more significant impact in the short term here.
There's no doubt that the team is working hard on pricing actions, and we're confident that they will be successful over some period of time. Don't forget this is 4% of the company right now. It's relatively small. But for the businesses that are involved in dealing with this, this is impactful for them as it is for any other operation. So it's not that it's not meaningful, but it certainly has a lower impact on the overall company.
But there's no doubt as the management team is extremely focused on this, we are optimistic that over some -- not so long-term period of time, in a shorter term, we'll be able to get these margins back up. Whether or not it's next quarter or the quarter after, I think time will tell, but we are optimistic that it will -- we are at the lower end of the scale in terms of profitability in this market, and it will improve over these coming quarters."

So you can imagine that after a number of quarters of doing so, that business represents a lot more today than it did many quarters ago. And it's a meaningful piece of the business.

And I mean, you said it, the industrial market is, for us, a very, very diversified range of segments, everything from medical, to heavy vehicles, to oil and gas, things like marine, factory automation, the battery and",566,"Yes. Well, thanks very much, David. And I mean, you said it, the industrial market is, for us, a very, very diversified range of segments, everything from medical, to heavy vehicles, to oil and gas, things like marine, factory automation, the battery and heavy electric vehicles, alternative energy, I mean, even in an area like building automation, where we've seen a lot of strong growth. I mean what was, I think, really unique here in the third quarter was virtually every one of those segments grew in the quarter.
So you don't always see that. Usually, there's some sort of countercyclicality across one or another of those segments. And we saw really strong performance across all of them. And when I think about why the company has really done such an excellent job in industrial, I mean, I would point to a few factors. Number one is our strategy for many years has been to build out a range of products that make us more important to customers across the industrial world and again, remembering that what ties those products together is that they are all harsh environment solutions.
So whether they would be discrete connectors, value-add Interconnect assemblies, sensors, antennas or the like, these are all products that have to be ruggedized. They have to be fit to an environment that maybe is an ultra-clean environment in an operating theater or maybe an ultra-dirty environment in an oil and gas drilling setup or in an alternative energy on an offshore windmill or something like that. So all of these have just really unique -- uniquely challenging environments around them.
And what we see in common across these customers and where a lot of our growth has come from, this is really the second factor, is that customers across the industrial market are adopting electronics at an increasing pace. So the same discussion that we had in the auto market just a few moments ago, we see that really broadly across the industrial market as customers adopt next-generation electronic systems and put those systems into tougher and tougher environments.
I would also say that the industrial market is a very fragmented market from a competitive perspective. And so while for sure, we're taking advantage of new things in this market like we are in automotive, I think there's also the fact that we continue to gain position against competitors who either don't have the breadth of offering, don't have the geographical position to support customers on a global basis, don't have the diverse and resilient footprint that has been able to support those customers during the pandemic or during all the other disruptions that have come along, and thereby, customers have come increasingly to us to solve their problems. And we've not disappointed them, and that creates a positive feedback loop.
So it's a market that I think we're very excited about. I think our team working in this market is just doing a great job. If you look into the fourth quarter, for sure, you can look at that fourth quarter kind of through the prism of saying, ""Well, we're guiding it to be down slightly."" But in fact, on a year-over-year basis, it's going to be an outstanding fourth quarter as well. So I think the team just continues to excel, and we're very excited about the industrial market for many years to come."

I mean the geopolitical tension that has been present for a number of years has certainly not gone away. And I, for one, would fully advocate that countries like the U.S. and China, the world's 2 largest economies, should, for sure, get along. There's lots and lots of reasons why we should.
And by the way, personally, I'm very optimistic that, long-term, that is going to be the case. But as it relates to our position in any country, including China, I mean, I would just remind everybody, we have a very unique operating strategy. We rely on local managers in every country that we operate. And we operate in more than 40 countries around the world. And in each of those places, we have local general managers who have the authority to run their business as they need to run it in that region to be most successful.
And so our general managers in China are able to tailor-make how they do business, obviously within the confines of ethics and law and everything that it means to be a global company. But they're able to meet their customers on a level-playing field with their local competitors.
But in fact, it's not a level-playing field because then they're able to bring the totality of Amphenol's capabilities to bear in support of those customers. And that's where the advantage of it is. We bring the best of both worlds of both being a local partner, but also a global company who has global resources, global breadth and global capabilities.
And that's why we've been successful in India. That's why we've been successful in China. That's why we've been successful in France, in Germany, in the U.K. and of course, here in the U.S. It's a very unique operating model that is -- that works really, really well in a world where everybody is getting along, but it also works really well in a world where people aren't necessarily getting along.
In terms of how we deploy our capital, we're always careful about deploying capital in every country in the world. We're always going to incorporate all the sort of risks and opportunities into our calculus about what we're going to invest in and what we're not going to invest in. And ultimately, those investment ideas are all coming up from below, not sort of dictated from above. But for sure, we're going to apply appropriate scrutiny to investments in every place in the world, using sort of the full picture of the environment into which we're investing."
