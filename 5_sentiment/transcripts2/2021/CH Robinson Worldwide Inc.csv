On the call with me today is Bob Biesterfeld, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer. Bob and Mike will provide a summary of our 2020 fourth quarter results, and we will follow their comments with responses to the pre-submitted questions that we received after our earnings release yesterday. 
Before I turn it over to Bob, I want to update you on a couple of financial statement items that have been renamed. Beginning with our 2020 fourth quarter results, we have renamed the term, net revenue, to adjusted gross profit, with no change to the composition of what is included in the metric. We believe the term, adjusted gross profit, is a better descriptor, given that this non-GAAP metric includes the netting of significant expenses, such as the cost of purchase transportation and the cost of products sourced for resale. A GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is included in both our earnings release and our earnings presentation. 
We also renamed the term, operating margin, to adjusted operating margin, again, with no change to the composition of what is included in this metric. Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing income from operations by adjusted gross profit. Our earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and today's comments and can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com. 
I'd like to remind you that our remarks may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter was marked by solid performance across our broad service portfolio, continued progress on repricing our truckload business to reflect the changing market conditions and further advancements",1740,"Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter was marked by solid performance across our broad service portfolio, continued progress on repricing our truckload business to reflect the changing market conditions and further advancements in our technology and transformation efforts that are providing meaningful improvements to our business results. 
Our Global Forwarding business sustained their strong execution in the fourth quarter. In our Ocean Business, the contracting number of carriers, with meaningful size, continue to value working with a global freight forwarder with our scale and reputation. And ocean shippers are increasingly coming to Robinson to meet their capacity needs as other providers fail to do so. 
The air market continues to be impacted by reduced cargo capacity. Air charters have evolved into a sustainable piece of our procurement strategy, and we, again, augmented our capacity in Q4 with charter flights to support demand from both existing and new customers. As a result, our shipment sizes have increased and our air tonnage is up year-over-year, despite the number of air shipments decreasing. 
Shippers continue to rely on Robinson's global supply chain expertise and our data and scale advantages to ensure critical goods are moved as quickly and as inexpensively as possible. We've bolstered our global forwarding procurement teams by hiring talent around the globe to focus on getting the capacity and competitive pricing needed regionally in a very volatile market. This, combined with our balanced portfolio of contractual and spot business, enabled us to optimize our adjusted gross profit per transaction, resulting in a 40% year-to-year growth in our Q4 Global Forwarding adjusted gross profit. 
There are several drivers of our recent growth in Global Forwarding that should continue to contribute to our long-term growth. While we continue to grow in our historical transatlantic and transpacific lanes, we've also added new customers in areas such as Europe, Oceania, Latin America and South Asia. This geographical diversification is important in times of volatility across regional economies and trade policy uncertainty. 
Over the past 5 years, we've been building out our global leadership and commercial teams, bringing on new talent to strengthen our customer relationships and ensuring that we have the necessary training and development in place for that talent. We'll continue to build out our commercial and strategic sales teams across regions to support emerging vertical strategies and creating sustained high-value revenue streams. 
We've also created a more centralized global pricing framework that, combined with an increased use of data and analytics, is enabling us to deploy the right pricing strategies in a format that's more consistent and easily consumed by our customers. 
And lastly, our enterprise portfolio, that allows us to offer end-to-end solutions for our customers, is unique to the logistics industry. We believe these strategies and competitive advantages will enable us to create more value for our customers, win more business and sustain the market share gains that we've achieved. 
Turning now to our NAST business. The global pandemic has had an outsized impact on our small business partners in 2020. A nearly 12% decline in our customer count during 2020 was driven almost exclusively by small and emerging market customers. Likewise, a greater than 6% decline in our active carrier count in 2020 occurred solely in the small carrier category, and we believe that this is reflecting carriers exiting the marketplace. 
Against this backdrop, we were very pleased to add 4,100 new carriers to our network during the fourth quarter, which represented an 11.5% increase year-over-year. As we entered fourth quarter, the North American Surface Transportation market was experiencing substantial capacity tightness. This was evidenced by a routing guide depth in our managed services business that rose to 1.8 by the end of third quarter, which was a level that we haven't seen since mid-2018. This capacity tightness continued throughout the fourth quarter as well, with average routing guide depth remaining at 1.8 in each month of fourth quarter, and contractual routing guides continuing to operate with first tender acceptance levels that were well below normal. 
By reevaluating our contractual truckload portfolio throughout the quarter, we reduced our percentage of truckload volumes with negative margins. Our targeted and strategic approach included repricing some business to reflect the rising cost environment, exiting other business that did not show a clear path to acceptable profitability, and honoring contractual commitments while strengthening our long-term relationships to our customers. 
We captured more spot market opportunities in the fourth quarter, resulting in an approximate mix of 55% contractual and 45% transactional volume versus a 70-30 mix in the year-ago period. This shift is not atypical in a rising price and cost environment, and our efforts to automate how we tackle the spot market opportunities has had a positive impact as well. 
With double-digit growth in spot market shipments and very strong volume growth in our LTL business, NAST overall volume grew 8.5% year-over-year, excluding Prime Distribution volume. This outpaced industry volume growth in Q4 of approximately 4% as measured by the Cass Freight Index. And this represented our eighth consecutive quarter of market share gains in NAST. 
Due to continued tightness in capacity, the cost of purchase transportation continues to remain elevated. In the overall market, we observed third-party benchmarks indicating that fourth quarter spot market costs were up approximately 44% compared to Q4 of last year. Our average truckload linehaul cost per mile paid to contract carriers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 32.5% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And sequentially, our cost per mile increased 14% in Q4. 
Our average line haul rate billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharge, increased 29% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We made further progress in fourth quarter on repricing our contractual truckload business to reflect the rising cost environment. 
In the fourth quarter, average line haul rate per mile billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 15% sequentially. Consequently, our fourth quarter truckload adjusted gross profit per load improved approximately 20% sequentially and also improved sequentially in each month of the fourth quarter. 
Having said this, we also saw instances of shippers implementing shorter bids or mini bids and some shippers delaying their annual truckload bids. In cases where annual bids have been delayed, we've either implemented short-term bridge pricing that was amenable to both parties in exchange for extending the contract or we made decisions on how we manage acceptance of tendered volume. 
On last quarter's call, I commented that about 150 of our top 700-truckload accounts, that represent $1.3 billion in revenues, were scheduled to be repriced in the fourth quarter. However, about 1/3 of those shippers that planned RFPs representing over $300 million in revenues have delayed their pricing events until the first quarter of 2021. This resulted in us repricing approximately $1 billion of our business during fourth quarter. We now estimate that we'll reprice around 145 of our top 700-truckload accounts that represents approximately $1.6 billion of revenues in the first quarter. 
Because of the efforts of our C.H. Robinson team members around the world, we were able to deliver solid performance across our broad service portfolio, including year-over-year growth in adjusted gross profit in our managed services, our Robinson Fresh and our European Surface Transportation businesses. 
Our total company adjusted gross profit per business day improved sequentially in Q4 versus Q3 and grew year-over-year in each month of the quarter. Continued progress on our strategic technology initiatives and transformation efforts have resulted in meaningful productivity improvements within our business. A couple of these key metrics are displayed on Slide 4 in our earnings presentation. 
Excluding volume and headcount from our 2020 acquisition of Prime Distribution Services, our productivity metrics continue to show a significant year-over-year improvement, as indicated by the 2090 basis point favorable spread between the year-over-year change in NAST volume and the change in full-time equivalents in our NAST business. 
As we've said in the past, This NAST productivity index is an important metric and a key output of our technology investments and our transformation efforts. Another way to view our productivity is by looking at shipments per person per day. And in the second half of 2020, we improved this metric by 26% over the second half of 2019. 
Our tech investments also continued to drive improvements in automation and the number of users on our platforms. One example of this is a 30% increase in fully automated truckload bookings compared to the fourth quarter of last year. During the fourth quarter, we had 35,000 unique carriers utilize our Navisphere carrier web portal. These carriers executed over 10 million load searches during the quarter. And 70% of the time, these carriers were presented with an option to automatically book a load related to their lane search. 
We continue to engage with our carriers to build technology that meets their evolving needs. And to that end, we've enabled 85% of our single-stop non-hazmat dry van freight in the U.S. to be booked by carriers automatically without any human intervention. The percent of our North American truckload freight available for automated booking will continue to increase during the first quarter as we had temperature-controlled freight and other sub modes onto the platform. 
With engagement of nearly 200 customers since the launch of our Procure IQ tool in September, we're experiencing positive early returns. We're yielding more volume growth with customers that have taken advantage of Procure IQ's ability to provide them with tailored recommendations for optimal procurement and capacity strategies. 
And lastly, through our commercial connectivity efforts, we continue to add TMS and ERP connections to our platform, and we've enabled self-service access and direct digital connectivity to over 90,000 active customers, with access to our truckload, less than truckload and intermodal services. 
As a result of our ability to harness the benefits of our technology investments and our network transformation, we're on track to achieve our target of removing $100 million of long-term costs by the middle of 2021. And as we move into 2021, we continue to evaluate our global business operations to ensure that we're managing our business in the most efficient manner, investing in technology to unlock growth and efficiency and creating better outcomes for our customers and our carriers by utilizing our unmatched combination of experience, our global suite of services and our scale and information advantage. 
I'll now turn the call to Mike to review the specifics of our fourth quarter financial performance."

Total company adjusted gross",1050,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter total revenues increased by 19.9% compared to Q4 2019, driven primarily by higher pricing and higher volume across the majority of our transportation service lines. 
Total company adjusted gross profit increased 10.7% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to our Global Forwarding business delivering a $51 million increase in adjusted gross profit up 39.6% compared to Q4 of 2019. 
As Chuck stated, at the beginning of the call, we have renamed the term net revenue to adjusted gross profit with no change to the composition for what is included in that metric. Within Global Forwarding, in Q4, our ocean business had the largest increase in adjusted gross profit, up $39 million or 53% versus Q4 of 2019, driven by higher pricing and higher volume. 
On a monthly basis, compared to 2019, our total company adjusted gross profit per business day was up 8% in October, up 7% in November and up 17% in December. Q4 personnel expenses totaled $309.3 million, up 3.4% versus Q4 of 2019. Recall that Q4 last year included a reduction in incentive compensation that aligned with the softer results. 
Average headcount in Q4 decreased 4.8% compared to Q4 of 2019, including the Prime acquisition, which added 2 percentage points. Looking forward, we expect our 2021 personnel expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion based on our expectation of improved adjusted gross profit in 2021 and the higher incentive compensation aligned with those results. 
2021 personnel expense also includes the impact of our ongoing long-term and short-term cost savings efforts, including the reinstatement of the company match on retirement contributions in the U.S. and Canada as of January 1. 
Q4 G&A expenses of $124.5 million were down $18.6 million or 13% compared to Q4 of 2019, primarily due to continued reductions in travel expenses. We expect our 2021 total SG&A expenses will be approximately $0.5 billion, with travel expenses building in the back half of 2021 as the impact of the pandemic subsides. 2021 SG&A is expected to include $85 million to $90 million of depreciation and amortization, which is down from $102 million in 2020, primarily due to completing the amortization related to a prior acquisition. 
In 2020, we delivered approximately 2/3 of the $100 million per year of long-term or permanent cost savings. As we indicated on our Q3 earnings call, we expect to deliver the remainder of that $100 million in long-term savings by mid-2021. For 2021 and beyond, we will continue to deliver long-term cost savings, primarily through process redesign and automation across the enterprise. One example is the continued optimization of our real estate footprint across the network, as we expect flexible work arrangements to become more prominent post-pandemic. 
Total fourth quarter operating income was up 51.2% versus Q4 2019, and adjusted operating margin increased by 870 basis points, primarily due to the increase in adjusted gross profit and our cost reduction efforts. Fourth quarter interest and other expenses totaled $12 million, up $1.2 million compared to Q4 of 2019. Our Q4 weighted average interest rate was 4.2%, which was flat compared to the Q4 of 2019. Our other expenses in Q4 also included a $1.1 million gain from currency revaluation compared to a $0.9 million loss in Q4 of 2019. 
Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 24.1% compared to 21.4% in Q4 of 2019. The Q4 rate increase was primarily due to onetime items related to the tax provision in Mexico, which was favorable in the fourth quarter of 2019 and unfavorable in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be 20% to 22%, assuming no changes in the federal state or international tax laws. 
As a remainder, our first quarter typically has a lower effective tax rate due to tax benefits related to the delivery of our annual stock-based compensation in Q1. Net income totaled $147.8 million in the fourth quarter, and diluted earnings per share was $1.08, up 47.9% versus Q4 of 2019.
Turning to cash flow. Q4 cash from operations was approximately $162.1 million compared to $211.6 million in Q4 of 2019. The $49 million decrease in operational cash flow was driven by $112 million sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets compared to Q3. This 4.4% sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets coincided with a 7.7% sequential increase in total revenue, which was partially offset by a 3.1% sequential decrease in days sales outstanding. 
Q4 capital expenditures totaled $13.7 million, bringing our full year 2020 capital spending to $54 million. We expect our 2021 capital expenditures to be $55 million to $65 million. We continue to prioritize the highest returning technology initiatives on a risk-adjusted basis, and we remain committed to our $1 billion investment in technology from 2019 to 2023. 
We returned approximately $113 million of cash to shareholders in Q4, which consisted almost entirely of share repurchases. We resumed our opportunistic share repurchase program in Q4 after pausing in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. The $0.51 quarterly dividend that we declared in the fourth quarter was paid on January 4, 2021, rather than in December, which deferred the tax obligation for our shareholders. Over the long term, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchase program as important levers to enhance shareholder value. 
Now on to the balance sheet highlights. We finished Q4 with $244 million in cash and cash equivalents, down $204 million compared to Q4 of 2019. Over the long term, we intend to carry only the cash needed to fund operations. We also ended Q4 with $1.24 billion of liquidity, comprised of our cash balance and $1 billion of committed funding under our credit facility, which matures in October of 2023.
Given our liquidity position, we chose not to renew our $250 million accounts receivable securitization agreement that matured in December. Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.09 billion, down $142 million versus Q4 last year and included no variable rate debt and no borrowing on our credit facility. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q4 was 1.4x, which aligns with our intention to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. 
Thank you for listening this morning. I'll turn the call back over to Bob now for his final comments."

We're pleased with the growth in our Global Forwarding business, and we believe that we have a sustainable competitive advantage. The digitization of our business will continue, and we are enabling more and more of our volume to be transacted in a fully automated manner. 
As shippers and carriers continue to increase their adoption of these new platform capabilities, we expect to see continued productivity benefits as well as growth with both customers and carriers that prefer to operate in a truly frictionless environment. Due to several factors, including the shortages in the number of drivers and available carrier capacity, freight markets remain tight, and we anticipate that this will continue for much of 2021. 
We're committed to creating better outcomes for our customers and our carriers by delivering industry-leading technology that's built by and for our supply chain experts and by leveraging our global portfolio of services and our unmatched combination of experience, scale and information advantage to meet their ever-changing needs.

First, I would like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday. For today's Q&A session, I will frame up the question and then turn it over to Bob or Mike for a response. 
Our first question is for Bob from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc; Chris Wetherbee from Citi; Jack Atkins from Stephens; Tom Wadewitz from UBS; and Brandon Oglenski from Barclays, asked similar questions. 
How should we think about North American truckload volume growth? Is this a focus for Robinson? Or can productivity improvements offset more segment volumes driving increased profitability? What is the right environment for Robinson to increase North American truckload volumes?"
368470,700518424,2182044,"C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","C.H.

So for the year, our truckload volumes in NAST were basically flat. But our combined volumes, as I said earlier, between both truckload and LTL, outpaced the rate of growth in the Cass Freight Index in each of the past 8 quarters. 
As I've said publicly several times, 2 of our primary initiatives are focused on taking share across all of our services, certainly inclusive of truckload and improving our operating margins across the business. Growing profitable North American truckload volume remains a key focus for our team NAST, and we feel as confident ever that the strength in our value proposition across the spectrum of our customers that we serve from the largest, most complex shippers in the world to thousands of main street businesses. We've also got to be thoughtful about how these 2 goals around growing market share through volume growth and improving operating margin can sometimes beat odds. So with costs increasing in the third quarter at 16% versus last year and then increasing over 32% in fourth quarter, against some contracts that were priced towards the tail end of 2019 in a very different marketplace, we had to make some intentional decisions throughout the quarter on how we were going to manage through that environment and evaluate where those critical customers were where we needed to honor commitments and where we're going to seek some pricing relief based on the marketplace and potentially put some volume at risk. 
And in some cases, where we couldn't reach and mutually agreed to plans to move forward, we needed to exit some business if there wasn't a clear path to profitability. I would also say to keep in mind that we had about $300 million in business that we were expecting to reprice during the fourth quarter that was subsequently pushed out to the first quarter of this year. In the cases where we agreed the short-term committed pricing with those customers, the manner in which we calculate spot versus contract, actually identified these shipments as a spot for the quarter. So we experienced strong growth in the spot market this quarter, but it wasn't enough to offset some of the declines in our contract portfolio. 
In terms of the conversation about productivity, we continue to see a large profitability unlock there. As we said, the shipments per person per day were up 26% in the back half of the year, and our capabilities to drive frictionless and automated transactions continue to expand. And our cost to execute shipment in that arena is down significantly on a year-over-year basis. 
So regardless of where we are in the cycle, our focus continues to be on improving our shipments per person per day, and lowering our cost basis per transaction through improvements in our process and automation, while still seeking to gain share."

So maybe this quarter, given that the Super Bowl is right around the corner, I'll use a football analogy. 
When we initially talked about our $1 billion investment in tech, we time box that as 2019 through 2023. So if you just think about that, we're a couple of years into a 5-year plan. So maybe not quite at half time, but midway through the second quarter and push them towards the end zone. 
Over the past several quarters, we've announced several strategic partnerships with companies like Microsoft and Intel and most recently, SIS, with each of these partnerships, bringing new capabilities to life in our platform ecosystem. And we've delivered new products like Freightquote by C.H. Robinson and Procure IQ and have greatly extended the reach of our platform capabilities through our commercial connectivity initiatives that connect Navisphere into an industry-leading number of ERP and TMS systems. 
We've also established and launched our customer R&D incubator, which we call Robinson Labs. We have delivered capabilities enabling automated pricing for our customers across truckload and LTL as well as automated load booking for our customers and carriers and adoption continues to increase. 
Our Navisphere Vision product continues to grow and add users as we had additional industry-leading capabilities to that product that provides global visibility across all modes and all geographies to inventory in motion and at rest. 
In terms of our Navistar Carrier platform, we're meeting carriers how and where they want to do business. We're developing solutions to improve the business outcomes and the quality of life for owner/operators, and this is increasingly being executed through our web and mobile platforms. And this is a form that's clearly a priority investment for us. 
We do believe that we're providing the best possible opportunities for carriers based on the scale and our ability to optimize and provide personnel offerings for each carrier on our platform. On the backside of all these customer carrier-facing products and innovations, we also continue to invest in the scalability, the stability and the security of our systems as we transition more fully to the Azure cloud. 
So we're going to have several more announcements coming in the coming quarters that we're really excited about, but I also want to be clear on our strategy that we're not building necessarily a silver bullet or a big reveal in the background. This isn't going to be a big bang approach. We're taking an agile approach to all of this, and we're continuing to look at prioritizing those projects on the road map that we think have the highest return for our shareholders and the greatest value for our customers and carriers. 
We also have to realize, too, that most of these technology changes that we're launching are accompanied by changes to our operating model and the areas of focus for many of our people. So much of what we talked about as it relates to our digital transformation and the public forum surrounded NAST. But we also know that opportunities exist across our portfolio, and work is underway across the board in each of our business units. 
In the couple of data points that we shared in the deck in our prepared comments today around the NAST Productivity Index, the improvement in shipments per person per day and the fact that we had over 7 million load searches last quarter alone returning an opportunity for a carrier to automatically book a truckload are all proof points that the road map is moving ahead and delivering strong results. 
Part of what makes this a top question to answer is that while we time box that $1 billion investment from 2019 to 2023, we know that there's really no stop point for innovation.

I think it's important to note that our long-term operating margin targets, or adjusted operating margin targets as we're now calling them, have not changed. 
For the enterprise, while our long-term target for adjusted operating margin continues to be 30% or better, continued productivity improvements will be a tailwind to help us offset some of the expected headwinds that we talked about in 2021, like incentive compensation and the return of some of the short-term cost savings from 2020. 
For NAST, our long-term adjusted operating margin target continues to be 40%, with the ongoing expectation to grow volume faster than headcount. So shipments per person per day is a good way for you to see our productivity initiatives coming through in our results. 
For Global Forwarding, our long-term target continues to be 30%. While we delivered 32.5% in Q4, which exceeds our long-term target, we would suggest that mid-20s is a better way to think about it as the margin normalizes over the near term."

And so as that happens, we do anticipate that our adjusted gross profit per shipment could come down from some of the historical highs that we've experienced in different quarters in 2020. 
We've evidenced some of that normalization already when we look back at the peaks of air freight in the second quarter and how that's played out through the balance of this year. Again, it's critical to reinforce so that we believe that we've taken several structural steps in our forwarding business, including our global procurement strategy, the addition of more charters to our air freight mix, which is becoming a more and more important part of our offering there, and the use of more advanced pricing analytics in setting our pricing strategies that we believe are going to continue to improve results over our historical revenue in past quarters, regardless of those market conditions in both air and ocean. 
So our story in forwarding isn't really just a story of margin expansion. We've had great volume gains in both air and ocean in terms of air tonnage and TEUs on the water driven by that commercial activity that I just mentioned."

I'm going to try to answer this by putting this quarter into the context of what we've seen broadly over the past decade. So if we think about actual customer rate and carrier cost per mile, excluding fuel, they're not rate of chain, but actual customer rate from an actual carrier rate per mile, Q4 represents the highest average rates that we've seen on record over the past decade. 
Additionally, the year-over-year change in rates and the change in costs were the highest rate of change that we've seen in both metrics over the past decade as well. So if we look back a bit, the previous peak in terms of the rate of change in price and cost occurred back in the first quarter of 2018, around 24% and 25%, respectively. 
It wasn't until 2 quarters after that, where we, at C.H. Robinson, experienced the peak in terms of actual price and actual cost per mile on a rate per mile basis. So if we compare the average truckload price in fourth quarter of 2020 to the previous peak in customer pricing in Q3 of 2018, customer pricing has only increased by an absolute value of 7% over that time period, peak to peak. 
So when we make that same comparison on cost per mile, costs are up about 13%, again, making that peak to peak comparison. So in terms of the rate of change, I certainly don't expect costs or customer pricing to continue to increase at such a high rate that we experienced in the fourth quarter as we know contracts are going to continue to reprice, spot market demand will soften because of that and the cycle will play out as it largely normally does. 
But in terms of actual price and actual cost per mile, on the customer side, a 7% increase over the time horizon greater than a couple of years really isn't outside of the ordinary. And so we see pricing on the customer side likely kind of maintaining and potentially gravitating higher throughout the course of the year. 
In terms of cost per mile, as more freight moves out of the spot market into the contracts, we would expect to see some moderation in costs relative to what we saw in fourth quarter. So if we look within the fourth quarter, we did see this start to play out, and that trend is now carrying into January. 
So to go a little deeper. In October, the rate of change in price exceeded the rate of change in cost by about 400 basis points. In November, that came down about 300 basis points. And in December, that rate of change at cost and rate was basically moving at the same at equilibrium. And in January, we've seen this inflect with the change in customer pricing being around 100 basis points above the change in carrier cost. 
On a sequential basis, both cost per mile and customer rate per mile are moderating some in January when compared to December, but they're still up on a year-over-year basis. 
It's probably also worth noting that in the fourth quarter, with such a robust peak season, it isn't necessarily out of character for our cost to increase faster than price in that environment, given that we purchased transportation largely in the spot market, while more than half of our customer pricing is tied to contracts that typically extend out the year in length."

In the macro freight environment, though, there really hasn't been much indication of adding meaningful capacity outside of charters in the foreseeable future. 
And as we see additional lockdowns occurring in different countries, we're hearing more and more that it's becoming difficult to staff some of these flights, which could add a constraint as well. We're expecting that price will remain tight and demand will remain strong with the vaccine rollout and with all the supporting products, PPE, et cetera, along with continued low inventory levels.

As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect our 2021 personnel expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion, which is based on our expectation of improved adjusted gross profit in 2021 and the higher incentive compensation aligned with those results. 
Regarding the return of temporary cost savings from 2020, the most significant within personnel expense would be the return of the company match on retirement contributions for employees in the U.S. and Canada, which came back on January 1. 
You mentioned 2018. I do think 2018 provides a meaningful point of comparison for personnel expense expectations in 2021. As you recall, 2018 was a year of strong performance for Robinson, which led to higher incentive costs, including bonuses, equity and commissions. 
So given where we are in the freight cycle, it would be reasonable to think about 2021 in comparison to 2018. Specifically, if you look at total personnel cost per employee, in 2018, we were a little over $88,000 per employee. If you add 2% inflation per year to get from 2018 to 2021, it gives you a decent outlook relative to our expectations for 2021. That outlook, combined with the staffing expectations that I talked about earlier, gets you to our overall P&L expense expectations of $1.4 billion for 2021."

I'd start with saying that it's -- the 55-45 mix is really a blend of some intentional choices in managing the yield within our portfolio as well as just market-driven factors. Simply as more freight moves to the spot market as routing guides fall -- fail in the industry and repricing occurs with higher frequency, our mix tends to shift in that direction as well as you've seen through time. 
Our spot and contract mix over the past couple of quarters closely mirrors that of really third quarter of '17 through maybe the third quarter of '18, call it, the past peak cycle, where our mix range from 50-50 to 60-40, leaning more heavily to contract. 
And looking through the past several years, 50-50 was really the lowest percentage of contractual freight, and that happened in fourth quarter of '17. And then we kind of max out, if you will, around 70% contract in more balanced markets such as what we saw in the back half of 2019. 
As we start to implement the pricing changes that occurred during fourth quarter as well as the business that we intend to reprice in the first quarter, I would anticipate that, that mix starts to shift back closer to the 60% range, meaning heavier towards contract in the next couple of quarters. I think that's kind of the best way that I would think about it right now."

So to your point, there's definitely some volatility and some cyclicality that we need to control for in our largest service line of truckload.

Our investments in technology, our broad and global suite of services and our development of innovative new capabilities are going to continue to fuel that top line growth of our diversified business, which is we see as one way to combat that cyclicality. I feel better, I can say confidently, I feel better today than I have at any point in the past about the focus that we have on cost management within the organization. And we'll deliver on that $100 million cost reduction and half the time we originally planned to.

If you look at our LTL business and the growth that, that has taken on, that is a critical part of our overall business mix and the growth and returns have frankly been industry-leading. 
Our investments in diversifying and expanding into our global forwarding network, adding talent enhancing our capabilities has also helped to balance the overall portfolio. That's maybe never been more clear than it was in the fourth quarter with the outperformance of our forwarding group. And it continues to provide us a combined commercial value proposition that's resonating in the market. 
Across the rest of the portfolio, our managed services business continues to grow freight under management and provides a really unique solution blending both technology and supply chain expertise to some of the largest and most complex customers in the world, and that creates a really sticky relationship with a high rate of recurring revenue and creates a lot of connectivity between Robinson and the client over time. And the results in our Robinson Fresh business unit have stabilized and continued to improve over the course of the last couple of years, and they're providing strong returns.

As a result, we've got the opportunity to get involved in really exciting and challenging arenas within the supply chain that extend well beyond just the pickup and drop-off in the transportation of freight. 
Our investments through these years have taken us deeper into new modes and services, develop deep vertical expertise, expertise in geographies and industry segments with many unique characteristics and supply chain attributes that we can bring to bear for our customers. 
The SAS relationship is a great example of an opportunity to partner with another industry leader to extend our collective value of new, unique and exciting ways to shippers and receivers. We're obviously in the early stages of our work together, and the initial engagements are now underway. We believe that this work together with SAS has the potential to unlock values in many areas of our business and across our shared customer base. This collaboration is going to facilitate visibility to the entire inventory life cycle in a way that no other companies can do, from planning to cash settlement, and it's going to require the best of each of our company's technology and our expertise in order to ideate and innovate together to bring real value to our customers."

In Q4, accounts receivable plus contract assets increased sequentially by 4.4% over Q3, while total revenues increased 7.7%, driven by higher pricing and volume. The result in Q4 was a sequential improvement in days sales outstanding of 1.7 days compared to Q3 when using ending AR balances. 
That said, over the past 2 quarters, DSO has been running a couple of days higher than last year, and I'll talk about the ways we've been addressing that in a minute. 
Our bad debt expense was notably higher in 2020 compared to 2019, driven primarily by increased reserves as we monitor the impact of the pandemic on certain categories and customers. While our bad debt expense in 2020 was approximately $6 million higher than our prior 3-year average, we did see a reduction in bad debt expense of approximately $600,000 in Q4 compared to Q4 of 2019.
We continue to closely monitor our receivables by customer, by category and across a variety of key metrics. We utilize internal and external credit and risk data to enhance our credit and collections results, and we've tightened credit limits enhanced electronic invoicing and maintained greater focus on higher risk categories with additional safeguards, all of which led to sequential improvement in the Q4 results."

I mean, truly a great team with great leadership, and we're really proud of the work that, that team did this year. 
The Prime team exceeded their full year profitability expectations against some really challenging hurdles throughout the year, driven by costs associated with increased costs in labor, safety protocols that we've undertaken for our frontline workers and the rising cost of purchase transportation. 
In terms of synergies, part of what really attracted us to Prime at the time of acquisition was the opportunity to bring together their expertise and real consolidation and warehousing with the Robinson expertise in transportation and distribution. So we've got these several shared customers and the combination of the 2 companies' capabilities made for an even stronger value proposition for our customers and for the industries that we serve. 
As some retailers over the course of the last year have evolved and tightened their supply chain performance metrics, this has driven a lot of interest and demand from many new shippers that serve these retailers. achieving some of these new on-time and full or supply chain reliability requirements are really difficult without a partner like Robinson that has the capabilities to bring to life between Robinson and Prime, especially if you're not typically shipping in full truckload quantities. 
So we're seeing several other retailers now piloting programs with us with opportunities for large national rollouts, and we're seeing great opportunities to cross-sell forwarding and inland transportation services to many of Prime's legacy customers. 
From a cost perspective, there was some redundancy in several markets for both Robinson and Prime maintained warehouse facilities, and we're in the process today of bringing those together under shared facilities in order to capture some cost and efficiency synergies as we move to a common network. We also see opportunities moving forward to leverage that network to augment our large format home delivery network as well as providing other retail services."

It's no longer about selling just a product, it's really about providing the complex supply chain solutions that go with it. 
So we felt like this was really the right time to consolidate our brand story and allow us to take advantage of our 115-year history in the produce supply chain and really connect the dots between our services, our products and the consumer growing demand for healthy and high-quality fresh produce. 
In terms of start-up costs, we're rolling the brand out over the first half of 2021 to align with the primary growing seasons of the products that will market under the Robinson Fresh label in order to maximize the use of existing packaging disruption, et cetera. So there really won't be any material costs due to the brand launch.

Before I turn it over to Bob, I want to update you on a couple of financial statement items that have been renamed. Beginning with our 2020 fourth quarter results, we have renamed the term, net revenue, to adjusted gross profit, with no change to the composition of what is included in the metric. We believe the term, adjusted gross profit, is a better descriptor, given that this non-GAAP metric includes the netting of significant expenses, such as the cost of purchase transportation and the cost of products sourced for resale. A GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is included in both our earnings release and our earnings presentation.  
We also renamed the term, operating margin, to adjusted operating margin, again, with no change to the composition of what is included in this metric. Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing income from operations by adjusted gross profit. Our earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and today's comments and can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com.  
I'd like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter was marked by solid performance across our broad service portfolio, continued progress on repricing our truckload business to reflect the changing market conditions and further advancements",1742,"Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter was marked by solid performance across our broad service portfolio, continued progress on repricing our truckload business to reflect the changing market conditions and further advancements in our technology and transformation efforts that are providing meaningful improvements to our business results.  
Our Global Forwarding business sustained their strong execution in the fourth quarter. In our Ocean business, the contracting number of carriers, with meaningful size, continue to value working with a global freight forwarder with our scale and reputation. And ocean shippers are increasingly coming to Robinson to meet their capacity needs as other providers fail to do so.  
The air market continues to be impacted by reduced cargo capacity. Air charters have evolved into a sustainable piece of our procurement strategy, and we, again, augmented our capacity in Q4 with charter flights to support demand from both existing and new customers. As a result, our shipment sizes have increased and our air tonnage is up year-over-year despite the number of air shipments decreasing.  
Shippers continue to rely on Robinson's global supply chain expertise and our data and scale advantages to ensure critical goods are moved as quickly and as inexpensively as possible. We've bolstered our global forwarding procurement teams by hiring talent around the globe to focus on getting the capacity and competitive pricing needed regionally in a very volatile market. This, combined with our balanced portfolio of contractual and spot business, enabled us to optimize our adjusted gross profit per transaction, resulting in a 40% year-over-year growth in our Q4 Global Forwarding adjusted gross profit.  
There are several drivers of our recent growth in Global Forwarding that should continue to contribute to our long-term growth. While we continue to grow in our historical transatlantic and transpacific lanes, we've also added new customers in areas such as Europe, Oceania, Latin America and South Asia. This geographical diversification is important in times of volatility across regional economies and trade policy uncertainty.  
Over the past 5 years, we've been building out our global leadership and commercial teams, bringing on new talent to strengthen our customer relationships and ensuring that we have the necessary training and development in place for that talent. We'll continue to build out our commercial and strategic sales teams across regions to support emerging vertical strategies and creating sustained high-value revenue streams.  
We've also created a more centralized global pricing framework, that, combined with an increased use of data and analytics, is enabling us to deploy the right pricing strategies in a format that's more consistent and easily consumed by our customers.  
And lastly, our enterprise portfolio, that allows us to offer end-to-end solutions for our customers, is unique to the logistics industry. We believe these strategies and competitive advantages will enable us to create more value for our customers, win more business and sustain the market share gains that we've achieved.  
Turning now to our NAST business. The global pandemic has had an outsized impact on our small business partners in 2020. A nearly 12% decline in our customer count during 2020 was driven almost exclusively by small and emerging market customers. Likewise, a greater than 6% decline in our active carrier count in 2020 occurred solely in the small carrier category, and we believe that this is reflecting carriers exiting the marketplace.  
Against this backdrop, we were very pleased to add 4,100 new carriers to our network during the fourth quarter, which represented an 11.5% increase year-over-year. As we entered fourth quarter, the North American Surface Transportation market was experiencing substantial capacity tightness. This was evidenced by a routing guide depth in our Managed Services business that rose to 1.8 by the end of third quarter, which was a level that we haven't seen since mid-2018. This capacity tightness continued throughout the fourth quarter as well, with average routing guide depth remaining at 1.8 in each month of fourth quarter, and contractual routing guides continuing to operate with first tender acceptance levels that were well below normal.  
By reevaluating our contractual truckload portfolio throughout the quarter, we reduced our percentage of truckload volumes with negative margins. Our targeted and strategic approach included repricing some business to reflect the rising cost environment, exiting other business that did not show a clear path to acceptable profitability, and honoring contractual commitments while strengthening our long-term relationships to our customers.  
We captured more spot market opportunities in the fourth quarter, resulting in an approximate mix of 55% contractual and 45% transactional volume versus a 70-30 mix in the year-ago period. This shift is not atypical in a rising price and cost environment, and our efforts to automate how we tackle the spot market opportunities has had a positive impact as well.  
With double-digit growth in spot market shipments and very strong volume growth in our LTL business, NAST overall volume grew 8.5% year-over-year, excluding Prime Distribution volume. This outpaced industry volume growth in Q4 of approximately 4% as measured by the Cass Freight Index. And this represented our eighth consecutive quarter of market share gains in NAST.
Due to continued tightness in capacity, the cost of purchase transportation continues to remain elevated. In the overall market, we observed third-party benchmarks indicating that fourth quarter spot market costs were up approximately 44% compared to Q4 of last year. Our average truckload linehaul cost per mile paid to contract carriers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 32.5% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And sequentially, our cost per mile increased 14% in Q4.  
Our average line haul rate billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharge, increased 29% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We made further progress in fourth quarter on repricing our contractual truckload business to reflect the rising cost environment.  
In the fourth quarter, average line haul rate per mile billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 15% sequentially. Consequently, our fourth quarter truckload adjusted gross profit per load improved approximately 20% sequentially, and also improved sequentially in each month of the fourth quarter.  
Having said this, we also saw instances of shippers implementing shorter bids or mini bids and some shippers delaying their annual truckload bids. In cases where annual bids have been delayed, we've either implemented short-term bridge pricing that was amenable to both parties in exchange for extending the contract or we made decisions on how we manage acceptance of tendered volume.  
On last quarter's call, I commented that about 150 of our top 700 truckload accounts, that represent $1.3 billion in revenues, were scheduled to be repriced in the fourth quarter. However, about 1/3 of those shippers that planned RFPs representing over $300 million in revenues have delayed their pricing events until the first quarter of 2021. This resulted in us repricing approximately $1 billion of our business during fourth quarter. We now estimate that we'll reprice around 145 of our top 700 truckload accounts that represents approximately $1.6 billion of revenues in the first quarter.  
Because of the efforts of our C.H. Robinson team members around the world, we were able to deliver solid performance across our broad service portfolio, including year-over-year growth in adjusted gross profit in our Managed Services, our Robinson Fresh and our European Surface Transportation businesses.  
Our total company adjusted gross profit per business day improved sequentially in Q4 versus Q3 and grew year-over-year in each month of the quarter. Continued progress on our strategic technology initiatives and transformation efforts have resulted in meaningful productivity improvements within our business. A couple of these key metrics are displayed on Slide 4 in our earnings presentation.  
Excluding volume and headcount from our 2020 acquisition of Prime Distribution Services, our productivity metrics continue to show a significant year-over-year improvement, as indicated by the 2,090 basis point favorable spread between the year-over-year change in NAST volume and the change in full-time equivalents in our NAST business.  
As we've said in the past, This NAST productivity index is an important metric and a key output of our technology investments and our transformation efforts. Another way to view our productivity is by looking at shipments per person per day. And in the second half of 2020, we improved this metric by 26% over the second half of 2019.  
Our tech investments also continued to drive improvements in automation and the number of users on our platforms. One example of this is a 30% increase in fully automated truckload bookings compared to the fourth quarter of last year. During the fourth quarter, we had 35,000 unique carriers utilized our Navisphere Carrier web portal. These carriers executed over 10 million load searches during the quarter. And 70% of the time, these carriers were presented with an option to automatically book a load related to their lane search.  
We continue to engage with our carriers to build technology that meets their evolving needs. And to that end, we've enabled 85% of our single-stop non-hazmat dry van freight in the U.S. to be booked by carriers automatically without any human intervention. The percent of our North American truckload freight available for automated booking will continue to increase during the first quarter as we had temperature-controlled freight and other sub modes onto the platform.  
With engagement of nearly 200 customers since the launch of our Procure IQ tool in September, we're experiencing positive early returns. We're yielding more volume growth with customers that have taken advantage of Procure IQ's ability to provide them with tailored recommendations for optimal procurement and capacity strategies.  
And lastly, through our commercial connectivity efforts, we continued to add TMS and ERP connections to our platform, and we've enabled self-service access and direct digital connectivity to over 90,000 active customers, with access to our truckload, less than truckload and intermodal services.  
As a result of our ability to harness the benefits of our technology investments and our network transformation, we're on track to achieve our target of removing $100 million of long-term costs by the middle of 2021. And as we move into 2021, we continue to evaluate our global business operations to ensure that we're managing our business in the most efficient manner, investing in technology to unlock growth and efficiency and creating better outcomes for our customers and our carriers by utilizing our unmatched combination of experience, our global suite of services and our scale and information advantage.  
I'll now turn the call to Mike to review the specifics of our fourth quarter financial performance."

Total company adjusted gros",1050,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter total revenues increased by 19.9% compared to Q4 2019, driven primarily by higher pricing and higher volume across the majority of our transportation service lines.  
Total company adjusted gross profit increased 10.7% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to our Global Forwarding business delivering a $51 million increase in adjusted gross profit, up 39.6% compared to Q4 of 2019.  
As Chuck stated at the beginning of the call, we have renamed the term net revenue to adjusted gross profit with no change to the composition for what is included in that metric. Within Global Forwarding, in Q4, our Ocean business had the largest increase in adjusted gross profit, up $39 million or 53% versus Q4 of 2019, driven by higher pricing and higher volume.  
On a monthly basis, compared to 2019, our total company adjusted gross profit per business day was up 8% in October, up 7% in November and up 17% in December. Q4 personnel expenses totaled $309.3 million, up 3.4% versus Q4 of 2019. Recall that Q4 last year included a reduction in incentive compensation that aligned with the softer results. Average headcount in Q4 decreased 4.8% compared to Q4 of 2019, including the Prime acquisition, which added 2 percentage points. 
Looking forward, we expect our 2021 personnel expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion based on our expectation of improved adjusted gross profit in 2021 and the higher incentive compensation aligned with those results. 2021 personnel expense also includes the impact of our ongoing long-term and short-term cost savings efforts, including the reinstatement of the company match on retirement contributions in the U.S. and Canada as of January 1.  
Q4 SG&A expenses of $124.5 million were down $18.6 million or 13% compared to Q4 of 2019, primarily due to continued reductions in travel expenses. We expect our 2021 total SG&A expenses will be approximately $0.5 billion, with travel expenses building in the back half of 2021 as the impact of the pandemic subsides. 2021 SG&A is expected to include $85 million to $90 million of depreciation and amortization, which is down from $102 million in 2020, primarily due to completing the amortization related to a prior acquisition.  
In 2020, we delivered approximately 2/3 of the $100 million per year of long-term or permanent cost savings. As we indicated on our Q3 earnings call, we expect to deliver the remainder of that $100 million in long-term savings by mid-2021. For 2021 and beyond, we will continue to deliver long-term cost savings, primarily through process redesign and automation across the enterprise. One example is the continued optimization of our real estate footprint across the network, as we expect flexible work arrangements to become more prominent post-pandemic.  
Total fourth quarter operating income was up 51.2% versus Q4 2019, and adjusted operating margin increased by 870 basis points, primarily due to the increase in adjusted gross profit and our cost reduction efforts. Fourth quarter interest and other expenses totaled $12 million, up $1.2 million compared to Q4 of 2019. Our Q4 weighted average interest rate was 4.2%, which was flat compared to the Q4 of 2019. Our other expenses in Q4 also included a $1.1 million gain from currency revaluation compared to a $0.9 million loss in Q4 of 2019.  
Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 24.1% compared to 21.4% in Q4 of 2019. The Q4 rate increase was primarily due to onetime items related to the tax provision in Mexico, which was favorable in the fourth quarter of 2019 and unfavorable in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be 20% to 22%, assuming no changes in the federal state or international tax laws.  
As a reminder, our first quarter typically has a lower effective tax rate due to tax benefits related to the delivery of our annual stock-based compensation in Q1. Net income totaled $147.8 million in the fourth quarter, and diluted earnings per share was $1.08, up 47.9% versus Q4 of 2019. 
Turning to cash flow. Q4 cash from operations was approximately $162.1 million compared to $211.6 million in Q4 of 2019. The $49 million decrease in operational cash flow was driven by $112 million sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets compared to Q3. This 4.4% sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets coincided with a 7.7% sequential increase in total revenue, which was partially offset by a 3.1% sequential decrease in days sales outstanding.  
Q4 capital expenditures totaled $13.7 million, bringing our full year 2020 capital spending to $54 million. We expect our 2021 capital expenditures to be $55 million to $65 million. We continue to prioritize the highest returning technology initiatives on a risk-adjusted basis, and we remain committed to our $1 billion investment in technology from 2019 to 2023.  
We returned approximately $113 million of cash to shareholders in Q4, which consisted almost entirely of share repurchases. We resumed our opportunistic share repurchase program in Q4 after pausing in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. The $0.51 quarterly dividend that we declared in the fourth quarter was paid on January 4, 2021, rather than in December, which deferred the tax obligation for our shareholders. Over the long term, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchase program as important levers to enhance shareholder value.
Now on to the balance sheet highlights. We finished Q4 with $244 million in cash and cash equivalents, down $204 million compared to Q4 of 2019. Over the long term, we intend to carry only the cash needed to fund operations. We also ended Q4 with $1.24 billion of liquidity, comprised of our cash balance and $1 billion of committed funding under our credit facility, which matures in October of 2023. Given our liquidity position, we chose not to renew our $250 million accounts receivable securitization agreement that matured in December. 
Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.09 billion, down $142 million versus Q4 last year and included no variable rate debt and no borrowing on our credit facility. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q4 was 1.4x, which aligns with our intention to maintain an investment-grade credit rating.

We expect the trends in improving pricing within NAST to continue.  
We're pleased with the growth in our Global Forwarding business, and we believe that we have a sustainable competitive advantage. The digitization of our business will continue, and we are enabling more and more of our volume to be transacted in a fully automated manner.  
As shippers and carriers continue to increase their adoption of these new platform capabilities, we expect to see continued productivity benefits as well as growth with both customers and carriers that prefer to operate in a truly frictionless environment. Due to several factors, including the shortages in the number of drivers and available carrier capacity, freight markets remain tight, and we anticipate that this will continue for much of 2021.  
We're committed to creating better outcomes for our customers and our carriers by delivering industry-leading technology that's built by and for our supply chain experts and by leveraging our global portfolio of services and our unmatched combination of experience, scale and information advantage to meet their ever-changing needs.  
We're also firmly committed to the key interest of our investors, including profitable market share growth, investing in technology to unlock both growth and efficiency, while being a responsible corporate citizen and driving the transformation of C.H. Robinson so that we can continue to deliver industry-leading margins and enhanced shareholder value.  
I'm incredibly proud of the resiliency, the compassion and the dedication that the Robinson team members around the world have displayed during these unprecedented times, and I thank them for continuing to drive our company forward, despite the disruptions caused by COVID-19 and for helping our company to emerge stronger.

First, I would like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday.

Our first question is for Bob from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc. Chris Wetherbee from Citi; Jack Atkins from Stephens; Tom Wadewitz from UBS; and Brandon Oglenski from Barclays, asked similar questions.  
How should we think about North American truckload volume growth? Is this a focus for Robinson? Or can productivity improvements offset more segment volumes driving increased profitability? What is the right environment for Robinson to increase North American truckload volumes?"

So for the year, our truckload volumes in NAST were basically flat. But our combined volumes, as I said earlier, between both truckload and LTL, outpaced the rate of growth in the Cass Freight Index in each of the past 8 quarters.  
As I've said publicly several times, 2 of our primary initiatives are focused on taking share across all of our services, certainly inclusive of truckload and improving our operating margins across the business. And growing profitable North American truckload volume remains a key focus for our team in NAST, and we feel as confident ever that the strength in our value proposition across the spectrum of our customers that we serve from the largest, most complex shippers in the world to thousands of main street businesses. We've also got to be thoughtful about how these 2 goals around growing market share through volume growth and improving operating margin can sometimes beat odds. 
So with costs increasing in the third quarter at 16% versus last year and then increasing over 32% in fourth quarter, against some contracts that were priced towards the tail end of 2019 in a very different marketplace, we had to make some intentional decisions throughout the quarter on how we were going to manage through that environment and evaluate where those critical customers were we needed to honor commitments and where we're going to seek some pricing relief based on the marketplace and potentially put some volume at risk.  
And in some cases where we couldn't reach and mutually agreed to plans to move forward, we needed to exit some business if there wasn't a clear path to profitability. I would also say to keep in mind that we had about $300 million in business that we were expecting to reprice during the fourth quarter that was subsequently pushed out to the first quarter of this year. In the cases where we agreed the short-term committed pricing with those customers, the manner in which we calculate spot versus contract, actually identified these shipments as a spot for the quarter. So we experienced strong growth in the spot market this quarter, but it wasn't enough to offset some of the declines in our contract portfolio.  
In terms of the conversation about productivity, we continue to see a large profitability unlock there. As we said, the shipments per person per day were up 26% in the back half of the year, and our capabilities to drive frictionless and automated transactions continue to expand. And our cost to execute a shipment in that arena is down significantly on a year-over-year basis.  
So regardless of where we are in the cycle, our focus continues to be on improving our shipments per person per day, and lowering our cost basis per transaction through improvements in our process and automation, while still seeking to gain share."

So maybe this quarter, given that the Super Bowl is right around the corner, I'll use a football analogy.  
When we initially talked about our $1 billion investment in tech, we time box that as 2019 through 2023. So if you just think about that, we're a couple of years into a 5-year plan. So maybe not quite at half time, but midway through the second quarter and push them towards the end zone.  
Over the past several quarters, we've announced several strategic partnerships with companies like Microsoft and Intel and most recently, SAS, with each of these partnerships bringing new capabilities to life in our platform ecosystem. And we've delivered new products like Freightquote by C.H. Robinson and Procure IQ, and have greatly extended the reach of our platform capabilities through our commercial connectivity initiatives that connect Navisphere into an industry-leading number of ERP and TMS systems.  
We've also established and launched our customer R&D incubator, which we call Robinson Labs. We have delivered capabilities enabling automated pricing for our customers across truckload and LTL as well as automated load booking for our customers and carriers and adoption continues to increase.  
Our Navisphere Vision product continues to grow and add users as we had additional industry-leading capabilities to that product that provides global visibility across all modes and all geographies to inventory in motion and at rest.  
In terms of our Navisphere Carrier platform, we're meeting carriers how and where they want to do business. We're developing solutions to improve the business outcomes and the quality of life for owner/operators, and this is increasingly being executed through our web and mobile platforms. And this is a form that's clearly a priority investment for us.  
We do believe that we're providing the best possible opportunities for carriers based on the scale and our ability to optimize and provide personnel offerings for each carrier on our platform. And on the backside of all these customer carrier-facing products and innovations, we also continue to invest in the scalability, the stability and the security of our systems as we transition more fully to the Azure cloud.  
So we're going to have several more announcements coming in the coming quarters that we're really excited about, but I also want to be clear on our strategy that we're not building necessarily a silver bullet or a big reveal in the background. This isn't going to be a big bang approach. We're taking an agile approach to all of this, and we're continuing to look at prioritizing those projects on the road map that we think have the highest return for our shareholders and the greatest value for our customers and carriers.  
We also have to realize, too, that most of these technology changes that we're launching are accompanied by changes to our operating model and the areas of focus for many of our people. So much of what we talked about as it relates to our digital transformation and the public forum has surrounded NAST. But we also know that opportunities exist across our portfolio, and work is underway across the board in each of our business units.  
In the couple of data points that we shared in the deck in our prepared comments today around the NAST Productivity Index, the improvement in shipments per person per day and the fact that we had over 7 million load searches last quarter alone returning an opportunity for a carrier to automatically book a truckload are all proof points that the road map is moving ahead and delivering strong results.  
Part of what makes this a top question to answer is that while we time box that $1 billion investment from 2019 to 2023, we know that there's really no stop point for innovation. And so as part of our values of evolving constantly, we're going to continue to evolve. We're going to continue to innovate. And as soon as we finish out these 4 years, we'll be on to getting prepared for that next investment in that next horizon."

I think it's important to note that our long-term operating margin targets, or adjusted operating margin targets as we're now calling them, have not changed.  
For the enterprise, while our long-term target for adjusted operating margin continues to be 30% or better, continued productivity improvements will be a tailwind to help us offset some of the expected headwinds that we talked about in 2021, like incentive compensation and the return of some of the short-term cost savings from 2020.  
For NAST, our long-term adjusted operating margin target continues to be 40%, with the ongoing expectation to grow volume faster than headcount. So shipments per person per day is a good way for you to see our productivity initiatives coming through in our results.  
For Global Forwarding, our long-term target continues to be 30%. While we delivered 32.5% in Q4, which exceeds our long-term target, we would suggest that mid-20s is a better way to think about it as the margin normalizes over the near term."

And so as that happens, we do anticipate that our adjusted gross profit per shipment could come down from some of the historical highs that we've experienced in different quarters in 2020. 
We've evidenced some of that normalization already when we look back at the peaks of air freight in the second quarter and how that's played out through the balance of this year. Again, it's critical to reinforce so that we believe that we've taken several structural steps in our forwarding business, including our global procurement strategy, the addition of more charters to our air freight mix, which is becoming a more and more important part of our offering there, and the use of more advanced pricing analytics in setting our pricing strategies that we believe are going to continue to improve results over our historical revenue in past quarters, regardless of those market conditions in both air and ocean. 
So our story in forwarding isn't really just a story of margin expansion. We've had great volume gains in both air and ocean in terms of air tonnage and TEUs on the water driven by that commercial activity that I just mentioned."

I'm going to try to answer this by putting this quarter into the context of what we've seen broadly over the past decade.

I'm going to try to answer this by putting this quarter into the context of what we've seen broadly over the past decade. So if we think about actual customer rate and carrier cost per mile, excluding fuel, so not rate of chains, but actual customer rate per mile and actual carrier rate per mile, Q4 represents the highest average rates that we've seen on record over the past decade. 
Additionally, the year-over-year change in rates and the change in costs were the highest rate of change that we've seen in both metrics over the past decade as well. So if we look back a bit, the previous peak in terms of the rate of change in price and cost occurred back in the first quarter of 2018, around 24% and 25%, respectively. 
And it wasn't until 2 quarters after that, where we, at C.H. Robinson, experienced the peak in terms of actual price and actual cost per mile on a rate per mile basis. So if we compare the average truckload price in fourth quarter of 2020 to the previous peak in customer pricing in Q3 of 2018, customer pricing has only increased by an absolute value of 7% over that time period, peak to peak. 
So when we make that same comparison on cost per mile, costs are up about 13%, again, making that peak to peak comparison. So in terms of the rate of change, I certainly don't expect costs or customer pricing to continue to increase at such a high rate that we experienced in the fourth quarter as we know contracts are going to continue to reprice, spot market demand will soften because of that and the cycle will play out as it largely normally does. 
But in terms of actual price and actual cost per mile, on the customer side, a 7% increase over the time horizon greater than a couple of years really isn't outside of the ordinary. And so we see pricing on the customer side likely kind of maintaining and potentially gravitating higher throughout the course of the year. 
In terms of cost per mile, as more freight moves out of the spot market into the contracts, we would expect to see some moderation in costs relative to what we saw in fourth quarter. So if we look within the fourth quarter, we did see this start to play out, and that trend is now carrying into January. 
So to go a little deeper. In October, the rate of change in price exceeded the rate of change in cost by about 400 basis points. In November, that came down about 300 basis points. And in December, that rate of change at cost and rate was basically moving at the same -- at equilibrium. And in January, we've seen this inflect with the change in customer pricing being around 100 basis points above the change in carrier cost. 
On a sequential basis, both cost per mile and customer rate per mile are moderating some in January when compared to December, but they're still up on a year-over-year basis. 
It's probably also worth noting that in the fourth quarter, with such a robust peak season, it isn't necessarily out of character for our cost to increase faster than price in that environment, given that we purchased transportation largely in the spot market, while more than half of our customer pricing is tied to contracts that typically extend out a year in length."

And as we see additional lockdowns occurring in different countries, we're hearing more and more that it's becoming difficult to staff some of these flights, which could add a constraint as well. We're expecting that space will remain tight and demand will remain strong with the vaccine rollout and with all the supporting products, PPE, et cetera, along with continued low inventory levels.

As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect our 2021 personnel expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion, which is based on our expectation of improved adjusted gross profit in 2021 and the higher incentive compensation aligned with those results. 
Regarding the return of temporary cost savings from 2020, the most significant within personnel expense would be the return of the company match on retirement contributions for employees in the U.S. and Canada, which came back on January 1. 
You mentioned 2018. I do think 2018 provides a meaningful point of comparison for personnel expense expectations in 2021. As you recall, 2018 was a year of strong performance for Robinson, which led to higher incentive costs, including bonuses, equity and commissions. 
So given where we are in the freight cycle, it would be reasonable to think about 2021 in comparison to 2018. Specifically, if you look at total personnel cost per employee, in 2018, we were a little over $88,000 per employee. If you add 2% inflation per year to get from 2018 to 2021, it gives you a decent outlook relative to our expectations for 2021. That outlook, combined with the staffing expectations that I talked about earlier, gets you to our overall personnel expense expectations of $1.4 billion for 2021."

Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan; and Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley, asked similar questions. 
Was the decline in truckload contractual mix to 55% a strategic decision or more the result of capitalizing in the near term or record spot rates? Understanding that management is expecting a continuation of market tightness for much of the year, when would be a good time in the cycle to seek higher contractual mix exposure?"

I'd start with saying that it's -- the 55-45 mix is really a blend of some intentional choices in managing the yield within our portfolio as well as just market-driven factors. Simply, as more freight moves to the spot market, as routing guides fall -- fail in the industry and repricing occurs with higher frequency, our mix tends to shift in that direction as well as you've seen through time. 
Our spot and contract mix over the past couple of quarters closely mirrors that of really third quarter of '17 through maybe the third quarter of '18, call it, the past peak cycle, where our mix range from 50-50 to 60-40, leaning more heavily to contract. 
And looking through the past several years, 50-50 was really the lowest percentage of contractual freight, and that happened in fourth quarter of '17. And then we kind of max out, if you will, around 70% contract in more balanced markets such as what we saw in the back half of 2019. 
As we start to implement the pricing changes that occurred during fourth quarter as well as the business that we intend to reprice in the first quarter, I would anticipate that, that mix starts to shift back closer to the 60% range, meaning heavier towards contract in the next couple of quarters. I think that's kind of the best way that I would think about it right now."

So in just the past 2 years, we've experienced both our record high quarterly adjusted gross profit per load and our record low quarterly adjusted gross profit per load that we've seen over the past decade. 
So to your point, there's definitely some volatility and some cyclicality that we need to control for in our largest service line of truckload. And we're doing this through our efforts to lower our cost to serve, through the digitization and the automation of the business that we've talked about, working on appropriately balancing that portfolio between spot and contractual business, and by continuing to redesign and reorganize our network to maximize our commercial effectiveness in order to both take share and drive top line growth. 
Our investments in technology, our broad and global suite of services and our development of innovative new capabilities are going to continue to fuel that top line growth of our diversified business, which is we see as one way to combat that cyclicality. I feel better, I can say confidently, I feel better today than I have at any point in the past about the focus that we have on cost management within the organization. And we'll deliver on that $100 million cost reduction in half the time we originally planned to. And we're going to remain focused on finding additional opportunities to reduce our operating expenses as we move forward. 
In terms of diversification, clearly, this has been part of our strategy over the past several years. If you look at our LTL business and the growth that, that has taken on, that is a critical part of our overall business mix and the growth and returns have frankly been industry-leading. 
Our investments in diversifying and expanding into our global forwarding network, adding talent enhancing our capabilities has also helped to balance the overall portfolio. That's maybe never been more clear than it was in the fourth quarter with the outperformance of our forwarding group. And it continues to provide us a combined commercial value proposition that's resonating in the market. 
Across the rest of the portfolio, our managed services business continues to grow freight under management and provides a really unique solution blending both technology and supply chain expertise to some of the largest and most complex customers in the world, and that creates a really sticky relationship with a high rate of recurring revenue, and creates a lot of connectivity between Robinson and the client over time. And the results in our Robinson Fresh business unit have stabilized and continued to improve over the course of the last couple of years, and they're providing strong returns. And our Europe Surface Trans business continues to take share well ahead of the marketplace in Europe. 
So we feel like we've been on this path of diversification, Brian, for a while. Both, it makes sense from a commercial standpoint, helps us to sell a really unique value proposition in the market and it's helping us to kind of balance out the portfolio in terms of revenues and returns to our shareholders."

Our progress in connecting with TMS and ERPs has been on pace with our expectations. We've got long-standing relationships and connections with these companies and connecting our real-time pricing engines through modern APIs has been really successful and fast paced. And some of these connections are faster and smoother than others, as you might expect. 
To the question of how has it increased business activity. We are experiencing significant growth in our quoting activity and tendered volume through these digital connections to our pricing services and other functionality, like in-transit visibility and other operational and analytical insights. 
The obvious benefit of these connections is the availability for quoting and committing 24/7, 365. We're also able to respond to opportunities much faster in these forms than relying on older, more manual processes. So we've seen significant productivity uplift on our transactional business, and we do expect the share of our automated transactional business to continue to grow, which will yield positive productivity impacts. 
To your final question around the competitive landscape, it is quite active in all parts of our business, including the space. And I'd say that our win percentage and our adjusted gross profit per shipment in these automated pricing APIs are on par with our traditional transactional margins. But we're capturing those adjusted gross profit dollars with a lower per unit cost to serve."

That said, over the past 2 quarters, DSO has been running a couple of days higher than last year, and I'll talk about the ways we've been addressing that in a minute. 
Our bad debt expense was notably higher in 2020 compared to 2019, driven primarily by increased reserves as we monitor the impact of the pandemic on certain categories and customers. While our bad debt expense in 2020 was approximately $6 million higher than our prior 3-year average, we did see a reduction in bad debt expense of approximately $600,000 in Q4 compared to Q4 of 2019.
We continue to closely monitor our receivables by customer, by category and across a variety of key metrics. We utilize internal and external credit and risk data to enhance our credit and collections results, and we've tightened credit limits, enhanced electronic invoicing and maintained greater focus on higher risk categories with additional safeguards, all of which led to sequential improvement in the Q4 results."

I mean, truly a great team with great leadership, and we're really proud of the work that, that team did this year. 
The Prime team exceeded their full year profitability expectations against some really challenging hurdles throughout the year, driven by costs associated with increased costs in labor, safety protocols that we've undertaken for our frontline workers and the rising cost of purchase transportation. 
In terms of synergies, part of what really attracted us to Prime at the time of acquisition was the opportunity to bring together their expertise in retail consolidation and warehousing with the Robinson expertise in transportation and distribution. So we've got these several shared customers and the combination of the 2 companies' capabilities made for an even stronger value proposition for our customers and for the industries that we serve. 
As some retailers over the course of the last year have evolved and tightened their supply chain performance metrics, this has driven a lot of interest and demand from many new shippers that serve these retailers. Achieving some of these new on-time and full or supply chain reliability requirements are really difficult without a partner like Robinson that has the capabilities to bring to life between Robinson and Prime, especially if you're not typically shipping in full truckload quantities. 
So we're seeing several other retailers now piloting programs with us with opportunities for large national rollouts, and we're seeing great opportunities to cross-sell forwarding and inland transportation services to many of Prime's legacy customers. 
From a cost perspective, there was some redundancy in several markets for both Robinson and Prime maintained warehouse facilities, and we're in the process today of bringing those together under shared facilities in order to capture some cost and efficiency synergies as we move to a common network. We also see opportunities moving forward to leverage that network to augment our large format home delivery network as well as providing other retail services."

Before I turn it over to Bob, I want to update you on a couple of financial statement items that have been renamed. Beginning with our 2020 fourth quarter results, we have renamed the term, net revenue, to adjusted gross profit, with no change to the composition of what is included in the metric. We believe the term, adjusted gross profit, is a better descriptor, given that this non-GAAP metric includes the netting of significant expenses, such as the cost of purchase transportation and the cost of products sourced for resale. A GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is included in both our earnings release and our earnings presentation.  
We also renamed the term, operating margin, to adjusted operating margin, again, with no change to the composition of what is included in this metric. Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing income from operations by adjusted gross profit. Our earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and today's comments and can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com.

Our fourth quarter was marked by solid performance across our broad service portfolio, continued progress on repricing our truckload business to reflect the changing market conditions and further advancements in our technology and transformation efforts that are providing meaningful improvements to our business results.  
Our Global Forwarding business sustained their strong execution in the fourth quarter. In our Ocean business, the contracting number of carriers, with meaningful size, continue to value working with a global freight forwarder with our scale and reputation. And ocean shippers are increasingly coming to Robinson to meet their capacity needs as other providers fail to do so.  
The air market continues to be impacted by reduced cargo capacity. Air charters have evolved into a sustainable piece of our procurement strategy, and we, again, augmented our capacity in Q4 with charter flights to support demand from both existing and new customers. As a result, our shipment sizes have increased and our air tonnage is up year-over-year despite the number of air shipments decreasing.  
Shippers continue to rely on Robinson's global supply chain expertise and our data and scale advantages to ensure critical goods are moved as quickly and as inexpensively as possible. We've bolstered our global forwarding procurement teams by hiring talent around the globe to focus on getting the capacity and competitive pricing needed regionally in a very volatile market. This, combined with our balanced portfolio of contractual and spot business, enabled us to optimize our adjusted gross profit per transaction, resulting in a 40% year-over-year growth in our Q4 Global Forwarding adjusted gross profit.  
There are several drivers of our recent growth in Global Forwarding that should continue to contribute to our long-term growth. While we continue to grow in our historical transatlantic and transpacific lanes, we've also added new customers in areas such as Europe, Oceania, Latin America and South Asia. This geographical diversification is important in times of volatility across regional economies and trade policy uncertainty.  
Over the past 5 years, we've been building out our global leadership and commercial teams, bringing on new talent to strengthen our customer relationships and ensuring that we have the necessary training and development in place for that talent. We'll continue to build out our commercial and strategic sales teams across regions to support emerging vertical strategies and creating sustained high-value revenue streams.  
We've also created a more centralized global pricing framework, that, combined with an increased use of data and analytics, is enabling us to deploy the right pricing strategies in a format that's more consistent and easily consumed by our customers.  
And lastly, our enterprise portfolio, that allows us to offer end-to-end solutions for our customers, is unique to the logistics industry. We believe these strategies and competitive advantages will enable us to create more value for our customers, win more business and sustain the market share gains that we've achieved.  
Turning now to our NAST business. The global pandemic has had an outsized impact on our small business partners in 2020. A nearly 12% decline in our customer count during 2020 was driven almost exclusively by small and emerging market customers. Likewise, a greater than 6% decline in our active carrier count in 2020 occurred solely in the small carrier category, and we believe that this is reflecting carriers exiting the marketplace.  
Against this backdrop, we were very pleased to add 4,100 new carriers to our network during the fourth quarter, which represented an 11.5% increase year-over-year. As we entered fourth quarter, the North American Surface Transportation market was experiencing substantial capacity tightness. This was evidenced by a routing guide depth in our Managed Services business that rose to 1.8 by the end of third quarter, which was a level that we haven't seen since mid-2018. This capacity tightness continued throughout the fourth quarter as well, with average routing guide depth remaining at 1.8 in each month of fourth quarter, and contractual routing guides continuing to operate with first tender acceptance levels that were well below normal.  
By reevaluating our contractual truckload portfolio throughout the quarter, we reduced our percentage of truckload volumes with negative margins. Our targeted and strategic approach included repricing some business to reflect the rising cost environment, exiting other business that did not show a clear path to acceptable profitability, and honoring contractual commitments while strengthening our long-term relationships to our customers.  
We captured more spot market opportunities in the fourth quarter, resulting in an approximate mix of 55% contractual and 45% transactional volume versus a 70-30 mix in the year ago period. This shift is not atypical in a rising price and cost environment, and our efforts to automate how we tackle the spot market opportunities has had a positive impact as well.  
With double-digit growth in spot market shipments and very strong volume growth in our LTL business, NAST overall volume grew 8.5% year-over-year, excluding Prime Distribution volume. This outpaced industry volume growth in Q4 of approximately 4% as measured by the Cass Freight Index. And this represented our eighth consecutive quarter of market share gains in NAST.
Due to continued tightness in capacity, the cost of purchase transportation continues to remain elevated. In the overall market, we observed third-party benchmarks indicating that fourth quarter spot market costs were up approximately 44% compared to Q4 of last year. Our average truckload linehaul cost per mile paid to contract carriers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 32.5% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And sequentially, our cost per mile increased 14% in Q4.  
Our average line haul rate billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharge, increased 29% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We made further progress in fourth quarter on repricing our contractual truckload business to reflect the rising cost environment.  
In the fourth quarter, average line haul rate per mile billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 15% sequentially. Consequently, our fourth quarter truckload adjusted gross profit per load improved approximately 20% sequentially, and also improved sequentially in each month of the fourth quarter.  
Having said this, we also saw instances of shippers implementing shorter bids or mini bids and some shippers delaying their annual truckload bids. In cases where annual bids have been delayed, we've either implemented short-term bridge pricing that was amenable to both parties in exchange for extending the contract or we made decisions on how we manage acceptance of tendered volume.  
On last quarter's call, I commented that about 150 of our top 700 truckload accounts, that represent $1.3 billion in revenues, were scheduled to be repriced in the fourth quarter. However, about 1/3 of those shippers that planned RFPs representing over $300 million in revenues have delayed their pricing events until the first quarter of 2021. This resulted in us repricing approximately $1 billion of our business during fourth quarter. We now estimate that we'll reprice around 145 of our top 700 truckload accounts that represents approximately $1.6 billion of revenues in the first quarter.  
Because of the efforts of our C.H. Robinson team members around the world, we were able to deliver solid performance across our broad service portfolio, including year-over-year growth in adjusted gross profit in our Managed Services, our Robinson Fresh and our European Surface Transportation businesses.  
Our total company adjusted gross profit per business day improved sequentially in Q4 versus Q3 and grew year-over-year in each month of the quarter. Continued progress on our strategic technology initiatives and transformation efforts have resulted in meaningful productivity improvements within our business. A couple of these key metrics are displayed on Slide 4 in our earnings presentation.  
Excluding volume and head count from our 2020 acquisition of Prime Distribution Services, our productivity metrics continue to show a significant year-over-year improvement, as indicated by the 2,090 basis point favorable spread between the year-over-year change in NAST volume and the change in full-time equivalents in our NAST business.  
As we've said in the past, This NAST productivity index is an important metric and a key output of our technology investments and our transformation efforts. Another way to view our productivity is by looking at shipments per person per day. And in the second half of 2020, we improved this metric by 26% over the second half of 2019.  
Our tech investments also continued to drive improvements in automation and the number of users on our platforms. One example of this is a 30% increase in fully automated truckload bookings compared to the fourth quarter of last year. During the fourth quarter, we had 35,000 unique carriers utilized our Navisphere Carrier web portal. These carriers executed over 10 million load searches during the quarter. And 70% of the time, these carriers were presented with an option to automatically book a load related to their lane search.  
We continue to engage with our carriers to build technology that meets their evolving needs. And to that end, we've enabled 85% of our single-stop non-hazmat dry van freight in the U.S. to be booked by carriers automatically without any human intervention. The percent of our North American truckload freight available for automated booking will continue to increase during the first quarter as we had temperature-controlled freight and other sub modes onto the platform.  
With engagement of nearly 200 customers since the launch of our Procure IQ tool in September, we're experiencing positive early returns. We're yielding more volume growth with customers that have taken advantage of Procure IQ's ability to provide them with tailored recommendations for optimal procurement and capacity strategies.  
And lastly, through our commercial connectivity efforts, we continued to add TMS and ERP connections to our platform, and we've enabled self-service access and direct digital connectivity to over 90,000 active customers, with access to our truckload, less than truckload and intermodal services.  
As a result of our ability to harness the benefits of our technology investments and our network transformation, we're on track to achieve our target of removing $100 million of long-term costs by the middle of 2021. And as we move into 2021, we continue to evaluate our global business operations to ensure that we're managing our business in the most efficient manner, investing in technology to unlock growth and efficiency and creating better outcomes for our customers and our carriers by utilizing our unmatched combination of experience, our global suite of services and our scale and information advantage.  
I'll now turn the call to Mike to review the specifics of our fourth quarter financial performance."

Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter total revenues increased by 19.9% compared to Q4 2019, driven primarily by higher pricing and higher volume across the majority of our transportation service lines.  Total company adjusted gros",1051,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter total revenues increased by 19.9% compared to Q4 2019, driven primarily by higher pricing and higher volume across the majority of our transportation service lines.  
Total company adjusted gross profit increased 10.7% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to our Global Forwarding business delivering a $51 million increase in adjusted gross profit, up 39.6% compared to Q4 of 2019.  
As Chuck stated at the beginning of the call, we have renamed the term net revenue to adjusted gross profit with no change to the composition for what is included in that metric. Within Global Forwarding, in Q4, our Ocean business had the largest increase in adjusted gross profit, up $39 million or 53% versus Q4 of 2019, driven by higher pricing and higher volume.  
On a monthly basis, compared to 2019, our total company adjusted gross profit per business day was up 8% in October, up 7% in November and up 17% in December. Q4 personnel expenses totaled $309.3 million, up 3.4% versus Q4 of 2019. Recall that Q4 last year included a reduction in incentive compensation that aligned with the softer results. Average head count in Q4 decreased 4.8% compared to Q4 of 2019, including the Prime acquisition, which added 2 percentage points. 
Looking forward, we expect our 2021 personnel expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion based on our expectation of improved adjusted gross profit in 2021 and the higher incentive compensation aligned with those results. 2021 personnel expense also includes the impact of our ongoing long-term and short-term cost savings efforts, including the reinstatement of the company match on retirement contributions in the U.S. and Canada as of January 1.  
Q4 SG&A expenses of $124.5 million were down $18.6 million or 13% compared to Q4 of 2019, primarily due to continued reductions in travel expenses. We expect our 2021 total SG&A expenses will be approximately $0.5 billion, with travel expenses building in the back half of 2021 as the impact of the pandemic subsides. 2021 SG&A is expected to include $85 million to $90 million of depreciation and amortization, which is down from $102 million in 2020, primarily due to completing the amortization related to a prior acquisition.  
In 2020, we delivered approximately 2/3 of the $100 million per year of long-term or permanent cost savings. As we indicated on our Q3 earnings call, we expect to deliver the remainder of that $100 million in long-term savings by mid-2021. For 2021 and beyond, we will continue to deliver long-term cost savings, primarily through process redesign and automation across the enterprise. One example is the continued optimization of our real estate footprint across the network, as we expect flexible work arrangements to become more prominent post-pandemic.  
Total fourth quarter operating income was up 51.2% versus Q4 2019, and adjusted operating margin increased by 870 basis points, primarily due to the increase in adjusted gross profit and our cost reduction efforts. Fourth quarter interest and other expenses totaled $12 million, up $1.2 million compared to Q4 of 2019. Our Q4 weighted average interest rate was 4.2%, which was flat compared to the Q4 of 2019. Our other expenses in Q4 also included a $1.1 million gain from currency revaluation compared to a $0.9 million loss in Q4 of 2019.  
Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 24.1% compared to 21.4% in Q4 of 2019. The Q4 rate increase was primarily due to onetime items related to the tax provision in Mexico, which was favorable in the fourth quarter of 2019 and unfavorable in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be 20% to 22%, assuming no changes in the federal state or international tax laws.  
As a reminder, our first quarter typically has a lower effective tax rate due to tax benefits related to the delivery of our annual stock-based compensation in Q1. Net income totaled $147.8 million in the fourth quarter, and diluted earnings per share was $1.08, up 47.9% versus Q4 of 2019. 
Turning to cash flow. Q4 cash from operations was approximately $162.1 million compared to $211.6 million in Q4 of 2019. The $49 million decrease in operational cash flow was driven by $112 million sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets compared to Q3. This 4.4% sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets coincided with a 7.7% sequential increase in total revenue, which was partially offset by a 3.1% sequential decrease in days sales outstanding.  
Q4 capital expenditures totaled $13.7 million, bringing our full year 2020 capital spending to $54 million. We expect our 2021 capital expenditures to be $55 million to $65 million. We continue to prioritize the highest returning technology initiatives on a risk-adjusted basis, and we remain committed to our $1 billion investment in technology from 2019 to 2023.  
We returned approximately $113 million of cash to shareholders in Q4, which consisted almost entirely of share repurchases. We resumed our opportunistic share repurchase program in Q4 after pausing in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. The $0.51 quarterly dividend that we declared in the fourth quarter was paid on January 4, 2021, rather than in December, which deferred the tax obligation for our shareholders. Over the long term, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchase program as important levers to enhance shareholder value.
Now on to the balance sheet highlights. We finished Q4 with $244 million in cash and cash equivalents, down $204 million compared to Q4 of 2019. Over the long term, we intend to carry only the cash needed to fund operations. We also ended Q4 with $1.24 billion of liquidity, comprised of our cash balance and $1 billion of committed funding under our credit facility, which matures in October of 2023. Given our liquidity position, we chose not to renew our $250 million accounts receivable securitization agreement that matured in December. 
Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.09 billion, down $142 million versus Q4 last year and included no variable rate debt and no borrowing on our credit facility. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q4 was 1.4x, which aligns with our intention to maintain an investment-grade credit rating.  
Thank you for listening this morning. I'll turn the call back over to Bob now for his final comments."

We're pleased with the growth in our Global Forwarding business, and we believe that we have a sustainable competitive advantage. The digitization of our business will continue, and we are enabling more and more of our volume to be transacted in a fully automated manner.  
As shippers and carriers continue to increase their adoption of these new platform capabilities, we expect to see continued productivity benefits as well as growth with both customers and carriers that prefer to operate in a truly frictionless environment. Due to several factors, including the shortages in the number of drivers and available carrier capacity, freight markets remain tight, and we anticipate that this will continue for much of 2021.  
We're committed to creating better outcomes for our customers and our carriers by delivering industry-leading technology that's built by and for our supply chain experts and by leveraging our global portfolio of services and our unmatched combination of experience, scale and information advantage to meet their ever-changing needs.  
We're also firmly committed to the key interest of our investors, including profitable market share growth, investing in technology to unlock both growth and efficiency, while being a responsible corporate citizen and driving the transformation of C.H. Robinson so that we can continue to deliver industry-leading margins and enhanced shareholder value.

First, I would like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday. For today's Q&A session, I will frame up the question and then turn it over to Bob or Mike for a response.  
Our first question is for Bob from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc. Chris Wetherbee from Citi; Jack Atkins from Stephens; Tom Wadewitz from UBS; and Brandon Oglenski from Barclays, asked similar questions.  
How should we think about North American truckload volume growth? Is this a focus for Robinson? Or can productivity improvements offset more segment volumes driving increased profitability? What is the right environment for Robinson to increase North American truckload volumes?"
368470,700518424,2252506,"C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","C.H.

So for the year, our truckload volumes in NAST were basically flat. But our combined volumes, as I said earlier, between both truckload and LTL, outpaced the rate of growth in the Cass Freight Index in each of the past 8 quarters.  
As I've said publicly several times, 2 of our primary initiatives are focused on taking share across all of our services, certainly inclusive of truckload and improving our operating margins across the business. And growing profitable North American truckload volume remains a key focus for our team in NAST, and we feel as confident ever that the strength in our value proposition across the spectrum of our customers that we serve from the largest, most complex shippers in the world to thousands of main street businesses. We've also got to be thoughtful about how these 2 goals around growing market share through volume growth and improving operating margin can sometimes beat odds. 
So with costs increasing in the third quarter at 16% versus last year and then increasing over 32% in fourth quarter, against some contracts that were priced towards the tail end of 2019 in a very different marketplace, we had to make some intentional decisions throughout the quarter on how we were going to manage through that environment and evaluate where those critical customers were we needed to honor commitments and where we're going to seek some pricing relief based on the marketplace and potentially put some volume at risk.  
And in some cases where we couldn't reach and mutually agreed to plans to move forward, we needed to exit some business if there wasn't a clear path to profitability. I would also say to keep in mind that we had about $300 million in business that we were expecting to reprice during the fourth quarter that was subsequently pushed out to the first quarter of this year. In the cases where we agreed the short-term committed pricing with those customers, the manner in which we calculate spot versus contract, actually identified these shipments as a spot for the quarter. So we experienced strong growth in the spot market this quarter, but it wasn't enough to offset some of the declines in our contract portfolio.  
In terms of the conversation about productivity, we continue to see a large profitability unlock there. As we said, the shipments per person per day were up 26% in the back half of the year, and our capabilities to drive frictionless and automated transactions continue to expand. And our cost to execute a shipment in that arena is down significantly on a year-over-year basis.  
So regardless of where we are in the cycle, our focus continues to be on improving our shipments per person per day, and lowering our cost basis per transaction through improvements in our process and automation, while still seeking to gain share."

So maybe this quarter, given that the Super Bowl is right around the corner, I'll use a football analogy.  
When we initially talked about our $1 billion investment in tech, we time box that as 2019 through 2023. So if you just think about that, we're a couple of years into a 5-year plan. So maybe not quite at half time, but midway through the second quarter and push them towards the end zone.  
Over the past several quarters, we've announced several strategic partnerships with companies like Microsoft and Intel and most recently, SAS, with each of these partnerships bringing new capabilities to life in our platform ecosystem. And we've delivered new products like Freightquote by C.H. Robinson and Procure IQ, and have greatly extended the reach of our platform capabilities through our commercial connectivity initiatives that connect Navisphere into an industry-leading number of ERP and TMS systems.  
We've also established and launched our customer R&D incubator, which we call Robinson Labs. We have delivered capabilities enabling automated pricing for our customers across truckload and LTL as well as automated load booking for our customers and carriers and adoption continues to increase.  
Our Navisphere Vision product continues to grow and add users as we had additional industry-leading capabilities to that product that provides global visibility across all modes and all geographies to inventory in motion and at rest.  
In terms of our Navisphere Carrier platform, we're meeting carriers how and where they want to do business. We're developing solutions to improve the business outcomes and the quality of life for owner/operators, and this is increasingly being executed through our web and mobile platforms. And this is a form that's clearly a priority investment for us.  
We do believe that we're providing the best possible opportunities for carriers based on the scale and our ability to optimize and provide personnel offerings for each carrier on our platform. And on the backside of all these customer carrier-facing products and innovations, we also continue to invest in the scalability, the stability and the security of our systems as we transition more fully to the Azure cloud.  
So we're going to have several more announcements coming in the coming quarters that we're really excited about, but I also want to be clear on our strategy that we're not building necessarily a silver bullet or a big reveal in the background. This isn't going to be a big bang approach. We're taking an agile approach to all of this, and we're continuing to look at prioritizing those projects on the road map that we think have the highest return for our shareholders and the greatest value for our customers and carriers.  
We also have to realize, too, that most of these technology changes that we're launching are accompanied by changes to our operating model and the areas of focus for many of our people. So much of what we talked about as it relates to our digital transformation and the public forum has surrounded NAST. But we also know that opportunities exist across our portfolio, and work is underway across the board in each of our business units.  
In the couple of data points that we shared in the deck in our prepared comments today around the NAST Productivity Index, the improvement in shipments per person per day and the fact that we had over 7 million load searches last quarter alone returning an opportunity for a carrier to automatically book a truckload are all proof points that the road map is moving ahead and delivering strong results.  
Part of what makes this a top question to answer is that while we time box that $1 billion investment from 2019 to 2023, we know that there's really no stop point for innovation. And so as part of our values of evolving constantly, we're going to continue to evolve. We're going to continue to innovate. And as soon as we finish out these 4 years, we'll be on to getting prepared for that next investment in that next horizon."

I think it's important to note that our long-term operating margin targets, or adjusted operating margin targets as we're now calling them, have not changed.  
For the enterprise, while our long-term target for adjusted operating margin continues to be 30% or better, continued productivity improvements will be a tailwind to help us offset some of the expected headwinds that we talked about in 2021, like incentive compensation and the return of some of the short-term cost savings from 2020.  
For NAST, our long-term adjusted operating margin target continues to be 40%, with the ongoing expectation to grow volume faster than head count. So shipments per person per day is a good way for you to see our productivity initiatives coming through in our results.  
For Global Forwarding, our long-term target continues to be 30%. While we delivered 32.5% in Q4, which exceeds our long-term target, we would suggest that mid-20s is a better way to think about it as the margin normalizes over the near term."

After such a strong result in Global Forwarding in 2020, how should we think about your ability to hold on to the gains you have seen over the past 12 months in adjusted gross profit per load in your airfreight and ocean freight operations?"

And so as that happens, we do anticipate that our adjusted gross profit per shipment could come down from some of the historical highs that we've experienced in different quarters in 2020. 
We've evidenced some of that normalization already when we look back at the peaks of air freight in the second quarter and how that's played out through the balance of this year. Again, it's critical to reinforce so that we believe that we've taken several structural steps in our forwarding business, including our global procurement strategy, the addition of more charters to our air freight mix, which is becoming a more and more important part of our offering there, and the use of more advanced pricing analytics in setting our pricing strategies that we believe are going to continue to improve results over our historical revenue in past quarters, regardless of those market conditions in both air and ocean. 
So our story in forwarding isn't really just a story of margin expansion. We've had great volume gains in both air and ocean in terms of air tonnage and TEUs on the water driven by that commercial activity that I just mentioned."

I'm going to try to answer this by putting this quarter into the context of what we've seen broadly over the past decade.

I'm going to try to answer this by putting this quarter into the context of what we've seen broadly over the past decade. So if we think about actual customer rate and carrier cost per mile, excluding fuel, so not rate of chains, but actual customer rate per mile and actual carrier rate per mile, Q4 represents the highest average rates that we've seen on record over the past decade. 
Additionally, the year-over-year change in rates and the change in costs were the highest rate of change that we've seen in both metrics over the past decade as well. So if we look back a bit, the previous peak in terms of the rate of change in price and cost occurred back in the first quarter of 2018, around 24% and 25%, respectively. 
And it wasn't until 2 quarters after that, where we, at C.H. Robinson, experienced the peak in terms of actual price and actual cost per mile on a rate per mile basis. So if we compare the average truckload price in fourth quarter of 2020 to the previous peak in customer pricing in Q3 of 2018, customer pricing has only increased by an absolute value of 7% over that time period, peak to peak. 
So when we make that same comparison on cost per mile, costs are up about 13%, again, making that peak to peak comparison. So in terms of the rate of change, I certainly don't expect costs or customer pricing to continue to increase at such a high rate that we experienced in the fourth quarter as we know contracts are going to continue to reprice, spot market demand will soften because of that and the cycle will play out as it largely normally does. 
But in terms of actual price and actual cost per mile, on the customer side, a 7% increase over the time horizon greater than a couple of years really isn't outside of the ordinary. And so we see pricing on the customer side likely kind of maintaining and potentially gravitating higher throughout the course of the year. 
In terms of cost per mile, as more freight moves out of the spot market into the contracts, we would expect to see some moderation in costs relative to what we saw in fourth quarter. So if we look within the fourth quarter, we did see this start to play out, and that trend is now carrying into January. 
So to go a little deeper. In October, the rate of change in price exceeded the rate of change in cost by about 400 basis points. In November, that came down about 300 basis points. And in December, that rate of change at cost and rate was basically moving at the same -- at equilibrium. And in January, we've seen this inflect with the change in customer pricing being around 100 basis points above the change in carrier cost. 
On a sequential basis, both cost per mile and customer rate per mile are moderating some in January when compared to December, but they're still up on a year-over-year basis. 
It's probably also worth noting that in the fourth quarter, with such a robust peak season, it isn't necessarily out of character for our cost to increase faster than price in that environment, given that we purchased transportation largely in the spot market, while more than half of our customer pricing is tied to contracts that typically extend out a year in length."

In the macro freight environment, though, there really hasn't been much indication of adding meaningful capacity outside of charters in the foreseeable future. 
And as we see additional lockdowns occurring in different countries, we're hearing more and more that it's becoming difficult to staff some of these flights, which could add a constraint as well. We're expecting that space will remain tight and demand will remain strong with the vaccine rollout and with all the supporting products, PPE, et cetera, along with continued low inventory levels.

As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect our 2021 personnel expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion, which is based on our expectation of improved adjusted gross profit in 2021 and the higher incentive compensation aligned with those results. 
Regarding the return of temporary cost savings from 2020, the most significant within personnel expense would be the return of the company match on retirement contributions for employees in the U.S. and Canada, which came back on January 1. 
You mentioned 2018. I do think 2018 provides a meaningful point of comparison for personnel expense expectations in 2021. As you recall, 2018 was a year of strong performance for Robinson, which led to higher incentive costs, including bonuses, equity and commissions. 
So given where we are in the freight cycle, it would be reasonable to think about 2021 in comparison to 2018. Specifically, if you look at total personnel cost per employee, in 2018, we were a little over $88,000 per employee. If you add 2% inflation per year to get from 2018 to 2021, it gives you a decent outlook relative to our expectations for 2021. That outlook, combined with the staffing expectations that I talked about earlier, gets you to our overall personnel expense expectations of $1.4 billion for 2021."

I'd start with saying that it's -- the 55-45 mix is really a blend of some intentional choices in managing the yield within our portfolio as well as just market-driven factors. Simply, as more freight moves to the spot market, as routing guides fall -- fail in the industry and repricing occurs with higher frequency, our mix tends to shift in that direction as well as you've seen through time. 
Our spot and contract mix over the past couple of quarters closely mirrors that of really third quarter of '17 through maybe the third quarter of '18, call it, the past peak cycle, where our mix range from 50-50 to 60-40, leaning more heavily to contract. 
And looking through the past several years, 50-50 was really the lowest percentage of contractual freight, and that happened in fourth quarter of '17. And then we kind of max out, if you will, around 70% contract in more balanced markets such as what we saw in the back half of 2019. 
As we start to implement the pricing changes that occurred during fourth quarter as well as the business that we intend to reprice in the first quarter, I would anticipate that, that mix starts to shift back closer to the 60% range, meaning heavier towards contract in the next couple of quarters. I think that's kind of the best way that I would think about it right now."

So in just the past 2 years, we've experienced both our record high quarterly adjusted gross profit per load and our record low quarterly adjusted gross profit per load that we've seen over the past decade. 
So to your point, there's definitely some volatility and some cyclicality that we need to control for in our largest service line of truckload. And we're doing this through our efforts to lower our cost to serve, through the digitization and the automation of the business that we've talked about, working on appropriately balancing that portfolio between spot and contractual business, and by continuing to redesign and reorganize our network to maximize our commercial effectiveness in order to both take share and drive top line growth. 
Our investments in technology, our broad and global suite of services and our development of innovative new capabilities are going to continue to fuel that top line growth of our diversified business, which is we see as one way to combat that cyclicality. I feel better, I can say confidently, I feel better today than I have at any point in the past about the focus that we have on cost management within the organization. And we'll deliver on that $100 million cost reduction in half the time we originally planned to. And we're going to remain focused on finding additional opportunities to reduce our operating expenses as we move forward. 
In terms of diversification, clearly, this has been part of our strategy over the past several years. If you look at our LTL business and the growth that, that has taken on, that is a critical part of our overall business mix and the growth and returns have frankly been industry-leading. 
Our investments in diversifying and expanding into our global forwarding network, adding talent enhancing our capabilities has also helped to balance the overall portfolio. That's maybe never been more clear than it was in the fourth quarter with the outperformance of our forwarding group. And it continues to provide us a combined commercial value proposition that's resonating in the market. 
Across the rest of the portfolio, our managed services business continues to grow freight under management and provides a really unique solution blending both technology and supply chain expertise to some of the largest and most complex customers in the world, and that creates a really sticky relationship with a high rate of recurring revenue, and creates a lot of connectivity between Robinson and the client over time. And the results in our Robinson Fresh business unit have stabilized and continued to improve over the course of the last couple of years, and they're providing strong returns. And our Europe Surface Trans business continues to take share well ahead of the marketplace in Europe. 
So we feel like we've been on this path of diversification, Brian, for a while. Both, it makes sense from a commercial standpoint, helps us to sell a really unique value proposition in the market and it's helping us to kind of balance out the portfolio in terms of revenues and returns to our shareholders."

To the question of how has it increased business activity. We are experiencing significant growth in our quoting activity and tendered volume through these digital connections to our pricing services and other functionality, like in-transit visibility and other operational and analytical insights. 
The obvious benefit of these connections is the availability for quoting and committing 24/7, 365. We're also able to respond to opportunities much faster in these forms than relying on older, more manual processes.

To your final question around the competitive landscape, it is quite active in all parts of our business, including the space.

The Prime team exceeded their full year profitability expectations against some really challenging hurdles throughout the year, driven by costs associated with increased costs in labor, safety protocols that we've undertaken for our frontline workers and the rising cost of purchase transportation. 
In terms of synergies, part of what really attracted us to Prime at the time of acquisition was the opportunity to bring together their expertise in retail consolidation and warehousing with the Robinson expertise in transportation and distribution. So we've got these several shared customers and the combination of the 2 companies' capabilities made for an even stronger value proposition for our customers and for the industries that we serve. 
As some retailers over the course of the last year have evolved and tightened their supply chain performance metrics, this has driven a lot of interest and demand from many new shippers that serve these retailers. Achieving some of these new on-time and full or supply chain reliability requirements are really difficult without a partner like Robinson that has the capabilities to bring to life between Robinson and Prime, especially if you're not typically shipping in full truckload quantities. 
So we're seeing several other retailers now piloting programs with us with opportunities for large national rollouts, and we're seeing great opportunities to cross-sell forwarding and inland transportation services to many of Prime's legacy customers. 
From a cost perspective, there was some redundancy in several markets for both Robinson and Prime maintained warehouse facilities, and we're in the process today of bringing those together under shared facilities in order to capture some cost and efficiency synergies as we move to a common network. We also see opportunities moving forward to leverage that network to augment our large format home delivery network as well as providing other retail services."

It's no longer about selling just a product, it's really about providing the complex supply chain solutions that go with it. 
So we felt like this was really the right time to consolidate our brand story and allow us to take advantage of our 115-year history in the produce supply chain and really connect the dots between our services, our products and the consumer growing demand for healthy and high-quality fresh produce. 
In terms of start-up costs, we're rolling the brand out over the first half of 2021 to align with the primary growing seasons of the products that will market under the Robinson Fresh label in order to maximize the use of existing packaging disruption, et cetera. So there really won't be any material costs due to the brand launch. 
Initial feedback in terms of our retail and food customers has been really positive, both from the look and feel of the brand, the quality of the product and the packaging, but they're also supportive of the overall strategic rationale for making the change."

Before I turn it over to Bob, I want to update you on a couple of financial statement items that have been renamed. Beginning with our 2020 fourth quarter results, we have renamed the term, net revenue, to adjusted gross profit, with no change to the composition of what is included in the metric. We believe the term, adjusted gross profit, is a better descriptor, given that this non-GAAP metric includes the netting of significant expenses, such as the cost of purchase transportation and the cost of products sourced for resale. A GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation is included in both our earnings release and our earnings presentation.  
We also renamed the term, operating margin, to adjusted operating margin, again, with no change to the composition of what is included in this metric. Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing income from operations by adjusted gross profit. Our earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and today's comments and can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson.com.  
I'd like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone.

Our fourth quarter was marked by solid performance across our broad service portfolio, continued progress on repricing our truckload business to reflect the changing market conditions and further advancements in our technology and transformation efforts that are providing meaningful improvements to our business results.  
Our Global Forwarding business sustained their strong execution in the fourth quarter. In our Ocean business, the contracting number of carriers, with meaningful size, continue to value working with a global freight forwarder with our scale and reputation. And ocean shippers are increasingly coming to Robinson to meet their capacity needs as other providers fail to do so.  
The air market continues to be impacted by reduced cargo capacity. Air charters have evolved into a sustainable piece of our procurement strategy, and we, again, augmented our capacity in Q4 with charter flights to support demand from both existing and new customers. As a result, our shipment sizes have increased and our air tonnage is up year-over-year despite the number of air shipments decreasing.  
Shippers continue to rely on Robinson's global supply chain expertise and our data and scale advantages to ensure critical goods are moved as quickly and as inexpensively as possible. We've bolstered our global forwarding procurement teams by hiring talent around the globe to focus on getting the capacity and competitive pricing needed regionally in a very volatile market. This, combined with our balanced portfolio of contractual and spot business, enabled us to optimize our adjusted gross profit per transaction, resulting in a 40% year-over-year growth in our Q4 Global Forwarding adjusted gross profit.  
There are several drivers of our recent growth in Global Forwarding that should continue to contribute to our long-term growth. While we continue to grow in our historical transatlantic and transpacific lanes, we've also added new customers in areas such as Europe, Oceania, Latin America and South Asia. This geographical diversification is important in times of volatility across regional economies and trade policy uncertainty.  
Over the past 5 years, we've been building out our global leadership and commercial teams, bringing on new talent to strengthen our customer relationships and ensuring that we have the necessary training and development in place for that talent. We'll continue to build out our commercial and strategic sales teams across regions to support emerging vertical strategies and creating sustained high-value revenue streams.  
We've also created a more centralized global pricing framework, that, combined with an increased use of data and analytics, is enabling us to deploy the right pricing strategies in a format that's more consistent and easily consumed by our customers.  
And lastly, our enterprise portfolio, that allows us to offer end-to-end solutions for our customers, is unique to the logistics industry. We believe these strategies and competitive advantages will enable us to create more value for our customers, win more business and sustain the market share gains that we've achieved.  
Turning now to our NAST business. The global pandemic has had an outsized impact on our small business partners in 2020. A nearly 12% decline in our customer count during 2020 was driven almost exclusively by small and emerging market customers. Likewise, a greater than 6% decline in our active carrier count in 2020 occurred solely in the small carrier category, and we believe that this is reflecting carriers exiting the marketplace.  
Against this backdrop, we were very pleased to add 4,100 new carriers to our network during the fourth quarter, which represented an 11.5% increase year-over-year. As we entered fourth quarter, the North American Surface Transportation market was experiencing substantial capacity tightness. This was evidenced by a routing guide depth in our Managed Services business that rose to 1.8 by the end of third quarter, which was a level that we haven't seen since mid-2018. This capacity tightness continued throughout the fourth quarter as well, with average routing guide depth remaining at 1.8 in each month of fourth quarter, and contractual routing guides continuing to operate with first tender acceptance levels that were well below normal.  
By reevaluating our contractual truckload portfolio throughout the quarter, we reduced our percentage of truckload volumes with negative margins. Our targeted and strategic approach included repricing some business to reflect the rising cost environment, exiting other business that did not show a clear path to acceptable profitability, and honoring contractual commitments while strengthening our long-term relationships to our customers.  
We captured more spot market opportunities in the fourth quarter, resulting in an approximate mix of 55% contractual and 45% transactional volume versus a 70-30 mix in the year ago period. This shift is not atypical in a rising price and cost environment, and our efforts to automate how we tackle the spot market opportunities has had a positive impact as well.  
With double-digit growth in spot market shipments and very strong volume growth in our LTL business, NAST overall volume grew 8.5% year-over-year, excluding Prime Distribution volume. This outpaced industry volume growth in Q4 of approximately 4% as measured by the Cass Freight Index. And this represented our eighth consecutive quarter of market share gains in NAST.
Due to continued tightness in capacity, the cost of purchase transportation continues to remain elevated. In the overall market, we observed third-party benchmarks indicating that fourth quarter spot market costs were up approximately 44% compared to Q4 of last year. Our average truckload linehaul cost per mile paid to contract carriers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 32.5% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And sequentially, our cost per mile increased 14% in Q4.  
Our average line haul rate billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharge, increased 29% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We made further progress in fourth quarter on repricing our contractual truckload business to reflect the rising cost environment.  
In the fourth quarter, average line haul rate per mile billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 15% sequentially. Consequently, our fourth quarter truckload adjusted gross profit per load improved approximately 20% sequentially, and also improved sequentially in each month of the fourth quarter.  
Having said this, we also saw instances of shippers implementing shorter bids or mini bids and some shippers delaying their annual truckload bids. In cases where annual bids have been delayed, we've either implemented short-term bridge pricing that was amenable to both parties in exchange for extending the contract or we made decisions on how we manage acceptance of tendered volume.  
On last quarter's call, I commented that about 150 of our top 700 truckload accounts, that represent $1.3 billion in revenues, were scheduled to be repriced in the fourth quarter. However, about 1/3 of those shippers that planned RFPs representing over $300 million in revenues have delayed their pricing events until the first quarter of 2021. This resulted in us repricing approximately $1 billion of our business during fourth quarter. We now estimate that we'll reprice around 145 of our top 700 truckload accounts that represents approximately $1.6 billion of revenues in the first quarter.  
Because of the efforts of our C.H. Robinson team members around the world, we were able to deliver solid performance across our broad service portfolio, including year-over-year growth in adjusted gross profit in our Managed Services, our Robinson Fresh and our European Surface Transportation businesses.  
Our total company adjusted gross profit per business day improved sequentially in Q4 versus Q3 and grew year-over-year in each month of the quarter. Continued progress on our strategic technology initiatives and transformation efforts have resulted in meaningful productivity improvements within our business. A couple of these key metrics are displayed on Slide 4 in our earnings presentation.  
Excluding volume and head count from our 2020 acquisition of Prime Distribution Services, our productivity metrics continue to show a significant year-over-year improvement, as indicated by the 2,090 basis point favorable spread between the year-over-year change in NAST volume and the change in full-time equivalents in our NAST business.  
As we've said in the past, This NAST productivity index is an important metric and a key output of our technology investments and our transformation efforts. Another way to view our productivity is by looking at shipments per person per day. And in the second half of 2020, we improved this metric by 26% over the second half of 2019.  
Our tech investments also continued to drive improvements in automation and the number of users on our platforms. One example of this is a 30% increase in fully automated truckload bookings compared to the fourth quarter of last year. During the fourth quarter, we had 35,000 unique carriers utilized our Navisphere Carrier web portal. These carriers executed over 10 million load searches during the quarter. And 70% of the time, these carriers were presented with an option to automatically book a load related to their lane search.  
We continue to engage with our carriers to build technology that meets their evolving needs. And to that end, we've enabled 85% of our single-stop non-hazmat dry van freight in the U.S. to be booked by carriers automatically without any human intervention. The percent of our North American truckload freight available for automated booking will continue to increase during the first quarter as we had temperature-controlled freight and other sub modes onto the platform.  
With engagement of nearly 200 customers since the launch of our Procure IQ tool in September, we're experiencing positive early returns. We're yielding more volume growth with customers that have taken advantage of Procure IQ's ability to provide them with tailored recommendations for optimal procurement and capacity strategies.  
And lastly, through our commercial connectivity efforts, we continued to add TMS and ERP connections to our platform, and we've enabled self-service access and direct digital connectivity to over 90,000 active customers, with access to our truckload, less than truckload and intermodal services.  
As a result of our ability to harness the benefits of our technology investments and our network transformation, we're on track to achieve our target of removing $100 million of long-term costs by the middle of 2021. And as we move into 2021, we continue to evaluate our global business operations to ensure that we're managing our business in the most efficient manner, investing in technology to unlock growth and efficiency and creating better outcomes for our customers and our carriers by utilizing our unmatched combination of experience, our global suite of services and our scale and information advantage.  
I'll now turn the call to Mike to review the specifics of our fourth quarter financial performance."

Total company adjusted gros",1051,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter total revenues increased by 19.9% compared to Q4 2019, driven primarily by higher pricing and higher volume across the majority of our transportation service lines.  
Total company adjusted gross profit increased 10.7% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to our Global Forwarding business delivering a $51 million increase in adjusted gross profit, up 39.6% compared to Q4 of 2019.  
As Chuck stated at the beginning of the call, we have renamed the term net revenue to adjusted gross profit with no change to the composition for what is included in that metric. Within Global Forwarding, in Q4, our Ocean business had the largest increase in adjusted gross profit, up $39 million or 53% versus Q4 of 2019, driven by higher pricing and higher volume.  
On a monthly basis, compared to 2019, our total company adjusted gross profit per business day was up 8% in October, up 7% in November and up 17% in December. Q4 personnel expenses totaled $309.3 million, up 3.4% versus Q4 of 2019. Recall that Q4 last year included a reduction in incentive compensation that aligned with the softer results. Average head count in Q4 decreased 4.8% compared to Q4 of 2019, including the Prime acquisition, which added 2 percentage points. 
Looking forward, we expect our 2021 personnel expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion based on our expectation of improved adjusted gross profit in 2021 and the higher incentive compensation aligned with those results. 2021 personnel expense also includes the impact of our ongoing long-term and short-term cost savings efforts, including the reinstatement of the company match on retirement contributions in the U.S. and Canada as of January 1.  
Q4 SG&A expenses of $124.5 million were down $18.6 million or 13% compared to Q4 of 2019, primarily due to continued reductions in travel expenses. We expect our 2021 total SG&A expenses will be approximately $0.5 billion, with travel expenses building in the back half of 2021 as the impact of the pandemic subsides. 2021 SG&A is expected to include $85 million to $90 million of depreciation and amortization, which is down from $102 million in 2020, primarily due to completing the amortization related to a prior acquisition.  
In 2020, we delivered approximately 2/3 of the $100 million per year of long-term or permanent cost savings. As we indicated on our Q3 earnings call, we expect to deliver the remainder of that $100 million in long-term savings by mid-2021. For 2021 and beyond, we will continue to deliver long-term cost savings, primarily through process redesign and automation across the enterprise. One example is the continued optimization of our real estate footprint across the network, as we expect flexible work arrangements to become more prominent post-pandemic.  
Total fourth quarter operating income was up 51.2% versus Q4 2019, and adjusted operating margin increased by 870 basis points, primarily due to the increase in adjusted gross profit and our cost reduction efforts. Fourth quarter interest and other expenses totaled $12 million, up $1.2 million compared to Q4 of 2019. Our Q4 weighted average interest rate was 4.2%, which was flat compared to the Q4 of 2019. Our other expenses in Q4 also included a $1.1 million gain from currency revaluation compared to a $0.9 million loss in Q4 of 2019.  
Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 24.1% compared to 21.4% in Q4 of 2019. The Q4 rate increase was primarily due to onetime items related to the tax provision in Mexico, which was favorable in the fourth quarter of 2019 and unfavorable in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be 20% to 22%, assuming no changes in the federal state or international tax laws.  
As a reminder, our first quarter typically has a lower effective tax rate due to tax benefits related to the delivery of our annual stock-based compensation in Q1. Net income totaled $147.8 million in the fourth quarter, and diluted earnings per share was $1.08, up 47.9% versus Q4 of 2019. 
Turning to cash flow. Q4 cash from operations was approximately $162.1 million compared to $211.6 million in Q4 of 2019. The $49 million decrease in operational cash flow was driven by $112 million sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets compared to Q3. This 4.4% sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets coincided with a 7.7% sequential increase in total revenue, which was partially offset by a 3.1% sequential decrease in days sales outstanding.  
Q4 capital expenditures totaled $13.7 million, bringing our full year 2020 capital spending to $54 million. We expect our 2021 capital expenditures to be $55 million to $65 million. We continue to prioritize the highest returning technology initiatives on a risk-adjusted basis, and we remain committed to our $1 billion investment in technology from 2019 to 2023.  
We returned approximately $113 million of cash to shareholders in Q4, which consisted almost entirely of share repurchases. We resumed our opportunistic share repurchase program in Q4 after pausing in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. The $0.51 quarterly dividend that we declared in the fourth quarter was paid on January 4, 2021, rather than in December, which deferred the tax obligation for our shareholders. Over the long term, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchase program as important levers to enhance shareholder value.
Now on to the balance sheet highlights. We finished Q4 with $244 million in cash and cash equivalents, down $204 million compared to Q4 of 2019. Over the long term, we intend to carry only the cash needed to fund operations. We also ended Q4 with $1.24 billion of liquidity, comprised of our cash balance and $1 billion of committed funding under our credit facility, which matures in October of 2023. Given our liquidity position, we chose not to renew our $250 million accounts receivable securitization agreement that matured in December. 
Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.09 billion, down $142 million versus Q4 last year and included no variable rate debt and no borrowing on our credit facility. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q4 was 1.4x, which aligns with our intention to maintain an investment-grade credit rating.  
Thank you for listening this morning. I'll turn the call back over to Bob now for his final comments."

How should we think about North American truckload volume growth? Is this a focus for Robinson? Or can productivity improvements offset more segment volumes driving increased profitability? What is the right environment for Robinson to increase North American truckload volumes?"

So for the year, our truckload volumes in NAST were basically flat. But our combined volumes, as I said earlier, between both truckload and LTL, outpaced the rate of growth in the Cass Freight Index in each of the past 8 quarters.  
As I've said publicly several times, 2 of our primary initiatives are focused on taking share across all of our services, certainly inclusive of truckload and improving our operating margins across the business. And growing profitable North American truckload volume remains a key focus for our team in NAST, and we feel as confident ever that the strength in our value proposition across the spectrum of our customers that we serve from the largest, most complex shippers in the world to thousands of main street businesses. We've also got to be thoughtful about how these 2 goals around growing market share through volume growth and improving operating margin can sometimes beat odds. 
So with costs increasing in the third quarter at 16% versus last year and then increasing over 32% in fourth quarter, against some contracts that were priced towards the tail end of 2019 in a very different marketplace, we had to make some intentional decisions throughout the quarter on how we were going to manage through that environment and evaluate where those critical customers were we needed to honor commitments and where we're going to seek some pricing relief based on the marketplace and potentially put some volume at risk.  
And in some cases where we couldn't reach and mutually agreed to plans to move forward, we needed to exit some business if there wasn't a clear path to profitability. I would also say to keep in mind that we had about $300 million in business that we were expecting to reprice during the fourth quarter that was subsequently pushed out to the first quarter of this year. In the cases where we agreed the short-term committed pricing with those customers, the manner in which we calculate spot versus contract, actually identified these shipments as a spot for the quarter. So we experienced strong growth in the spot market this quarter, but it wasn't enough to offset some of the declines in our contract portfolio.  
In terms of the conversation about productivity, we continue to see a large profitability unlock there. As we said, the shipments per person per day were up 26% in the back half of the year, and our capabilities to drive frictionless and automated transactions continue to expand. And our cost to execute a shipment in that arena is down significantly on a year-over-year basis.  
So regardless of where we are in the cycle, our focus continues to be on improving our shipments per person per day, and lowering our cost basis per transaction through improvements in our process and automation, while still seeking to gain share."

So maybe this quarter, given that the Super Bowl is right around the corner, I'll use a football analogy.  
When we initially talked about our $1 billion investment in tech, we time box that as 2019 through 2023. So if you just think about that, we're a couple of years into a 5-year plan. So maybe not quite at half time, but midway through the second quarter and push them towards the end zone.  
Over the past several quarters, we've announced several strategic partnerships with companies like Microsoft and Intel and most recently, SAS, with each of these partnerships bringing new capabilities to life in our platform ecosystem. And we've delivered new products like Freightquote by C.H. Robinson and Procure IQ, and have greatly extended the reach of our platform capabilities through our commercial connectivity initiatives that connect Navisphere into an industry-leading number of ERP and TMS systems.  
We've also established and launched our customer R&D incubator, which we call Robinson Labs. We have delivered capabilities enabling automated pricing for our customers across truckload and LTL as well as automated load booking for our customers and carriers and adoption continues to increase.  
Our Navisphere Vision product continues to grow and add users as we had additional industry-leading capabilities to that product that provides global visibility across all modes and all geographies to inventory in motion and at rest.  
In terms of our Navisphere Carrier platform, we're meeting carriers how and where they want to do business. We're developing solutions to improve the business outcomes and the quality of life for owner/operators, and this is increasingly being executed through our web and mobile platforms. And this is a form that's clearly a priority investment for us.  
We do believe that we're providing the best possible opportunities for carriers based on the scale and our ability to optimize and provide personnel offerings for each carrier on our platform. And on the backside of all these customer carrier-facing products and innovations, we also continue to invest in the scalability, the stability and the security of our systems as we transition more fully to the Azure cloud.  
So we're going to have several more announcements coming in the coming quarters that we're really excited about, but I also want to be clear on our strategy that we're not building necessarily a silver bullet or a big reveal in the background. This isn't going to be a big bang approach. We're taking an agile approach to all of this, and we're continuing to look at prioritizing those projects on the road map that we think have the highest return for our shareholders and the greatest value for our customers and carriers.  
We also have to realize, too, that most of these technology changes that we're launching are accompanied by changes to our operating model and the areas of focus for many of our people. So much of what we talked about as it relates to our digital transformation and the public forum has surrounded NAST. But we also know that opportunities exist across our portfolio, and work is underway across the board in each of our business units.  
In the couple of data points that we shared in the deck in our prepared comments today around the NAST Productivity Index, the improvement in shipments per person per day and the fact that we had over 7 million load searches last quarter alone returning an opportunity for a carrier to automatically book a truckload are all proof points that the road map is moving ahead and delivering strong results.  
Part of what makes this a top question to answer is that while we time box that $1 billion investment from 2019 to 2023, we know that there's really no stop point for innovation. And so as part of our values of evolving constantly, we're going to continue to evolve. We're going to continue to innovate. And as soon as we finish out these 4 years, we'll be on to getting prepared for that next investment in that next horizon."

I think it's important to note that our long-term operating margin targets, or adjusted operating margin targets as we're now calling them, have not changed.  
For the enterprise, while our long-term target for adjusted operating margin continues to be 30% or better, continued productivity improvements will be a tailwind to help us offset some of the expected headwinds that we talked about in 2021, like incentive compensation and the return of some of the short-term cost savings from 2020.  
For NAST, our long-term adjusted operating margin target continues to be 40%, with the ongoing expectation to grow volume faster than head count. So shipments per person per day is a good way for you to see our productivity initiatives coming through in our results.  
For Global Forwarding, our long-term target continues to be 30%. While we delivered 32.5% in Q4, which exceeds our long-term target, we would suggest that mid-20s is a better way to think about it as the margin normalizes over the near term."

And we're just not seeing that manifest itself this year, which tells us that demand is there and things really aren't slowing down. 
Our bookings are really strong as we look out for the next several weeks to come. And as we engage with our clients, their forecasts are strong. And frankly, new customers are coming to us daily for space, and that list of new customers is longer today than it's ever been.

And so as that happens, we do anticipate that our adjusted gross profit per shipment could come down from some of the historical highs that we've experienced in different quarters in 2020. 
We've evidenced some of that normalization already when we look back at the peaks of air freight in the second quarter and how that's played out through the balance of this year. Again, it's critical to reinforce so that we believe that we've taken several structural steps in our forwarding business, including our global procurement strategy, the addition of more charters to our air freight mix, which is becoming a more and more important part of our offering there, and the use of more advanced pricing analytics in setting our pricing strategies that we believe are going to continue to improve results over our historical revenue in past quarters, regardless of those market conditions in both air and ocean. 
So our story in forwarding isn't really just a story of margin expansion. We've had great volume gains in both air and ocean in terms of air tonnage and TEUs on the water driven by that commercial activity that I just mentioned."

I'm going to try to answer this by putting this quarter into the context of what we've seen broadly over the past decade. So if we think about actual customer rate and carrier cost per mile, excluding fuel, so not rate of chains, but actual customer rate per mile and actual carrier rate per mile, Q4 represents the highest average rates that we've seen on record over the past decade. 
Additionally, the year-over-year change in rates and the change in costs were the highest rate of change that we've seen in both metrics over the past decade as well. So if we look back a bit, the previous peak in terms of the rate of change in price and cost occurred back in the first quarter of 2018, around 24% and 25%, respectively. 
And it wasn't until 2 quarters after that, where we, at C.H. Robinson, experienced the peak in terms of actual price and actual cost per mile on a rate per mile basis. So if we compare the average truckload price in fourth quarter of 2020 to the previous peak in customer pricing in Q3 of 2018, customer pricing has only increased by an absolute value of 7% over that time period, peak to peak. 
So when we make that same comparison on cost per mile, costs are up about 13%, again, making that peak to peak comparison. So in terms of the rate of change, I certainly don't expect costs or customer pricing to continue to increase at such a high rate that we experienced in the fourth quarter as we know contracts are going to continue to reprice, spot market demand will soften because of that and the cycle will play out as it largely normally does. 
But in terms of actual price and actual cost per mile, on the customer side, a 7% increase over the time horizon greater than a couple of years really isn't outside of the ordinary. And so we see pricing on the customer side likely kind of maintaining and potentially gravitating higher throughout the course of the year. 
In terms of cost per mile, as more freight moves out of the spot market into the contracts, we would expect to see some moderation in costs relative to what we saw in fourth quarter. So if we look within the fourth quarter, we did see this start to play out, and that trend is now carrying into January. 
So to go a little deeper. In October, the rate of change in price exceeded the rate of change in cost by about 400 basis points. In November, that came down about 300 basis points. And in December, that rate of change at cost and rate was basically moving at the same -- at equilibrium. And in January, we've seen this inflect with the change in customer pricing being around 100 basis points above the change in carrier cost. 
On a sequential basis, both cost per mile and customer rate per mile are moderating some in January when compared to December, but they're still up on a year-over-year basis. 
It's probably also worth noting that in the fourth quarter, with such a robust peak season, it isn't necessarily out of character for our cost to increase faster than price in that environment, given that we purchased transportation largely in the spot market, while more than half of our customer pricing is tied to contracts that typically extend out a year in length."

In the macro freight environment, though, there really hasn't been much indication of adding meaningful capacity outside of charters in the foreseeable future. 
And as we see additional lockdowns occurring in different countries, we're hearing more and more that it's becoming difficult to staff some of these flights, which could add a constraint as well. We're expecting that space will remain tight and demand will remain strong with the vaccine rollout and with all the supporting products, PPE, et cetera, along with continued low inventory levels.

As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect our 2021 personnel expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion, which is based on our expectation of improved adjusted gross profit in 2021 and the higher incentive compensation aligned with those results. 
Regarding the return of temporary cost savings from 2020, the most significant within personnel expense would be the return of the company match on retirement contributions for employees in the U.S. and Canada, which came back on January 1. 
You mentioned 2018. I do think 2018 provides a meaningful point of comparison for personnel expense expectations in 2021. As you recall, 2018 was a year of strong performance for Robinson, which led to higher incentive costs, including bonuses, equity and commissions. 
So given where we are in the freight cycle, it would be reasonable to think about 2021 in comparison to 2018. Specifically, if you look at total personnel cost per employee, in 2018, we were a little over $88,000 per employee. If you add 2% inflation per year to get from 2018 to 2021, it gives you a decent outlook relative to our expectations for 2021. That outlook, combined with the staffing expectations that I talked about earlier, gets you to our overall personnel expense expectations of $1.4 billion for 2021."

I'd start with saying that it's -- the 55-45 mix is really a blend of some intentional choices in managing the yield within our portfolio as well as just market-driven factors. Simply, as more freight moves to the spot market, as routing guides fall -- fail in the industry and repricing occurs with higher frequency, our mix tends to shift in that direction as well as you've seen through time. 
Our spot and contract mix over the past couple of quarters closely mirrors that of really third quarter of '17 through maybe the third quarter of '18, call it, the past peak cycle, where our mix range from 50-50 to 60-40, leaning more heavily to contract. 
And looking through the past several years, 50-50 was really the lowest percentage of contractual freight, and that happened in fourth quarter of '17. And then we kind of max out, if you will, around 70% contract in more balanced markets such as what we saw in the back half of 2019. 
As we start to implement the pricing changes that occurred during fourth quarter as well as the business that we intend to reprice in the first quarter, I would anticipate that, that mix starts to shift back closer to the 60% range, meaning heavier towards contract in the next couple of quarters. I think that's kind of the best way that I would think about it right now."

So to your point, there's definitely some volatility and some cyclicality that we need to control for in our largest service line of truckload. And we're doing this through our efforts to lower our cost to serve, through the digitization and the automation of the business that we've talked about, working on appropriately balancing that portfolio between spot and contractual business, and by continuing to redesign and reorganize our network to maximize our commercial effectiveness in order to both take share and drive top line growth. 
Our investments in technology, our broad and global suite of services and our development of innovative new capabilities are going to continue to fuel that top line growth of our diversified business, which is we see as one way to combat that cyclicality. I feel better, I can say confidently, I feel better today than I have at any point in the past about the focus that we have on cost management within the organization. And we'll deliver on that $100 million cost reduction in half the time we originally planned to. And we're going to remain focused on finding additional opportunities to reduce our operating expenses as we move forward. 
In terms of diversification, clearly, this has been part of our strategy over the past several years. If you look at our LTL business and the growth that, that has taken on, that is a critical part of our overall business mix and the growth and returns have frankly been industry-leading. 
Our investments in diversifying and expanding into our global forwarding network, adding talent enhancing our capabilities has also helped to balance the overall portfolio. That's maybe never been more clear than it was in the fourth quarter with the outperformance of our forwarding group. And it continues to provide us a combined commercial value proposition that's resonating in the market. 
Across the rest of the portfolio, our managed services business continues to grow freight under management and provides a really unique solution blending both technology and supply chain expertise to some of the largest and most complex customers in the world, and that creates a really sticky relationship with a high rate of recurring revenue, and creates a lot of connectivity between Robinson and the client over time. And the results in our Robinson Fresh business unit have stabilized and continued to improve over the course of the last couple of years, and they're providing strong returns. And our Europe Surface Trans business continues to take share well ahead of the marketplace in Europe. 
So we feel like we've been on this path of diversification, Brian, for a while. Both, it makes sense from a commercial standpoint, helps us to sell a really unique value proposition in the market and it's helping us to kind of balance out the portfolio in terms of revenues and returns to our shareholders."

Our progress in connecting with TMS and ERPs has been on pace with our expectations. We've got long-standing relationships and connections with these companies and connecting our real-time pricing engines through modern APIs has been really successful and fast paced. And some of these connections are faster and smoother than others, as you might expect. 
To the question of how has it increased business activity. We are experiencing significant growth in our quoting activity and tendered volume through these digital connections to our pricing services and other functionality, like in-transit visibility and other operational and analytical insights. 
The obvious benefit of these connections is the availability for quoting and committing 24/7, 365. We're also able to respond to opportunities much faster in these forms than relying on older, more manual processes. So we've seen significant productivity uplift on our transactional business, and we do expect the share of our automated transactional business to continue to grow, which will yield positive productivity impacts. 
To your final question around the competitive landscape, it is quite active in all parts of our business, including the space. And I'd say that our win percentage and our adjusted gross profit per shipment in these automated pricing APIs are on par with our traditional transactional margins. But we're capturing those adjusted gross profit dollars with a lower per unit cost to serve."

As a result, we've got the opportunity to get involved in really exciting and challenging arenas within the supply chain that extend well beyond just the pickup and drop-off in the transportation of freight. 
Our investments through these years have taken us deeper into new modes and services, develop deep vertical expertise, expertise in geographies and industry segments with many unique characteristics and supply chain attributes that we can bring to bear for our customers. 
The SAS relationship is a great example of an opportunity to partner with another industry leader to extend our collective value of new, unique and exciting ways to shippers and receivers. We're obviously in the early stages of our work together, and the initial engagements are now underway. 
We believe that this work together with SAS has the potential to unlock values in many areas of our business and across our shared customer base.

The result in Q4 was a sequential improvement in days sales outstanding of 1.7 days compared to Q3 when using ending AR balances. 
That said, over the past 2 quarters, DSO has been running a couple of days higher than last year, and I'll talk about the ways we've been addressing that in a minute. 
Our bad debt expense was notably higher in 2020 compared to 2019, driven primarily by increased reserves as we monitor the impact of the pandemic on certain categories and customers. While our bad debt expense in 2020 was approximately $6 million higher than our prior 3-year average, we did see a reduction in bad debt expense of approximately $600,000 in Q4 compared to Q4 of 2019.
We continue to closely monitor our receivables by customer, by category and across a variety of key metrics. We utilize internal and external credit and risk data to enhance our credit and collections results, and we've tightened credit limits, enhanced electronic invoicing and maintained greater focus on higher risk categories with additional safeguards, all of which led to sequential improvement in the Q4 results."

I mean, truly a great team with great leadership, and we're really proud of the work that, that team did this year. 
The Prime team exceeded their full year profitability expectations against some really challenging hurdles throughout the year, driven by costs associated with increased costs in labor, safety protocols that we've undertaken for our frontline workers and the rising cost of purchase transportation. 
In terms of synergies, part of what really attracted us to Prime at the time of acquisition was the opportunity to bring together their expertise in retail consolidation and warehousing with the Robinson expertise in transportation and distribution. So we've got these several shared customers and the combination of the 2 companies' capabilities made for an even stronger value proposition for our customers and for the industries that we serve. 
As some retailers over the course of the last year have evolved and tightened their supply chain performance metrics, this has driven a lot of interest and demand from many new shippers that serve these retailers. Achieving some of these new on-time and full or supply chain reliability requirements are really difficult without a partner like Robinson that has the capabilities to bring to life between Robinson and Prime, especially if you're not typically shipping in full truckload quantities. 
So we're seeing several other retailers now piloting programs with us with opportunities for large national rollouts, and we're seeing great opportunities to cross-sell forwarding and inland transportation services to many of Prime's legacy customers. 
From a cost perspective, there was some redundancy in several markets for both Robinson and Prime maintained warehouse facilities, and we're in the process today of bringing those together under shared facilities in order to capture some cost and efficiency synergies as we move to a common network. We also see opportunities moving forward to leverage that network to augment our large format home delivery network as well as providing other retail services."

In terms of start-up costs, we're rolling the brand out over the first half of 2021 to align with the primary growing seasons of the products that will market under the Robinson Fresh label in order to maximize the use of existing packaging disruption, et cetera.

We're proud of our first quarter results as global shipping markets remain disrupted, our team around the globe stayed focused on serving the needs of our customers and delivering innovative solutions to keep global supply chains moving. During the quarter, we delivered strong financial results while continuing to deliver against many of our initiatives related to growth, productivity and the advancement of our digital strategy. I'll highlight some of these areas of progress as I walk through my prepared comments surrounding our Q1 results.
In the first quarter of 2021, we generated 125% growth in earnings per share due to profit growth in our 2 largest business segments, North American Surface Transportation and Global Forwarding. Our NAST business generated double-digit growth in both adjusted gross profits, or AGP, and operating income in the quarter. NAST AGP per business day increased 15%, and operating income was up 39% compared to the first quarter of last year. These results were driven by a 23% improvement in AGP per truckload in our truckload business, coupled with continued strong market share gains in our less than truckload business, where volume per business day increased 17% year-over-year. Bolstering these results were continued benefits of our technology investments, which continue to unlock productivity gains and deliver customer value in new and exciting ways.
The macro environment in the first quarter continued to be one of tight capacity and increased pricing in the marketplace driven by several supply side constraints, including the ongoing challenges of driver availability, coupled with robust demand. The weather events in February demonstrated how quickly supply chains can get disrupted in this capacity-constrained environment.
For the quarter, our NAST truckload volume was down approximately 6.5% or 5% per business day compared to first quarter of last year. While our business in the spot market increased significantly, our volume in the contractual business declined as we continued to pursue profitable volume growth by reshaping our portfolio through repricing the book of business with new and existing customers.
It's our belief that given the current structural constraints around expansion of truckload supply, coupled with additional government stimulus, a back-half reopening of the economy and potential infrastructure spending, the market conditions that were existing today have the potential to remain out-of-balance for the next several quarters.
For first quarter, we saw routing guide depth of tender in our managed services business maintained between 1.7 and 1.8 which is consistent with fourth quarter of last year. As one of the world's largest logistics platform and the largest provider of truckload capacity in North America, we are uniquely positioned to help both customers and carriers navigate these market conditions.
One of the ways that we do this is by leveraging our scale and the size of our carrier network. In the first quarter, we welcomed 6,900 new carriers to our network, which represented a 72% increase year-over-year and represents the most carriers added in a quarter in our history. Coupled with these new carrier adds, we also saw record use and adoption of our carrier-facing digital products, Navisphere Carrier and Navisphere Driver, further advancing our digital initiatives.
Our average truckload linehaul cost per mile paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 33.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. Our average linehaul rate billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 33% year-over-year. And for the second quarter in a row, we saw a sequential change in price per mile that exceeded the change in cost per mile as we continue to reprice our contractual truckload business to reflect the current environment. Our first quarter rate per mile billed to customers increased 2% while our cost per mile to carriers increased 1% sequentially. We closed the quarter with an approximate mix of 55% contractual volume and 45% transactional volume versus the 65-35 mix in the year ago period and consistent with our mix in the fourth quarter of 2020.
NAST's less than truckload service continues to grow volume faster than the market with 17% year-over-year growth in volume per business day in Q1. Our value proposition that combines a full suite of LTL services, including common carrier, warehousing and retail consolidation, temperature control, parcel, home delivery and reverse logistics continues to resonate with customers across industries, and we continue to benefit from the tailwinds in some of the fastest-growing customer segments, including retail, e-commerce and manufacturing.
Within LTL, we're winning new business and growing our existing business with customers of all sizes, from small businesses that utilize our Freightquote by C.H. Robinson platform to large enterprise shippers that look to us as a strategic partner to manage and optimize their LTL freight networks. The March 2020 acquisition of Prime Distribution Services, coupled with our existing retail consolidation network, has made us the largest and most comprehensive provider of retail consolidation services in the industry.
In total, NAST's overall volume per day grew 7% year-over-year. This was slightly below industry volume growth during the quarter of approximately 7.5% as measured by the Cass Freight Index.
Turning the page to Global Forwarding. Our Global Forwarding business once again delivered excellent results in first quarter. We delivered 118% increase in total revenues within the forwarding segment, a 67% increase in adjusted gross profits and a 658% increase in operating income. The forwarding team at Robinson successfully worked with customers across the globe to navigate a difficult and a disruptive market, leading to increased award sizes from customers and thousands of new commercial relationships.
The airfreight market continues to be impacted by reduced cargo capacity, and we continue to position charter flight capacity to support demand from both existing and new customers. Our customers continue to value working with Robinson's local experts in offices around the world that can deliver a full suite of global logistics services and technology solutions. The resulting market share gains, combined with the strength of the market, produced a 27% increase in ocean volumes during the quarter and a 7% increase in air shipments.
Candidly, 3 to 5 years ago, we wouldn't have been able to deliver these types of results in our forwarding business, but we've made substantial structural and strategic changes and have increased our investments over that time. We've invested in technology, data and analytics as well as our global network and leadership team. And we bolstered our commercial and strategic sales teams in forwarding to strengthen our customer relationships and the support emerging vertical strategies while creating sustainable high-value revenue streams.
Additionally, we've expanded our geographical strength in areas such as Europe, Oceania and Latin America and South Asia, while we continue to grow our core transpacific and transatlantic business. Within forwarding, we've implemented a more centralized global pricing framework that combined with an increased use of data and analytics is enabling us to employ improved and agile pricing strategy leading to growth in market share.
We believe that these strategies and competitive advantages will enable us to create more value for customers and in turn, win more business and sustain the market share gains that we've achieved and will continue to add forward in contribute and drive parts of our long-term growth.
Because of the efforts of our C.H. Robinson team members around the world, our total company adjusted gross profit per business day improved by 11% sequentially in first quarter and 26% year-over-year.
Related to technology, we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives and transformation efforts. As I've stated in the past, the 3 primary areas of investment in technology are focused on creating value for customers, value for carriers and driving productivity improvement for our teams, which in turn drives improvements to both our top and our bottom line results.
Looking at the impacts of technology through the lens of customers and carriers, the number of daily and monthly average users across our customer- and carrier-facing platforms continues to grow. An area that we've invested heavily in is the ability to deliver real-time pricing for truckload shippers through digital channels that are most convenient for our customers to use. Enabling these digital connections improves efficiency for our customers, it improves our response time to request and improves our win rates. Today, more than 30% of our transactional business is being priced via our proprietary transactional pricing engine, which we call TPE. Today, we're delivering real-time pricing with capacity assurance from the largest network of truckload capacity.
Volume driven through our transactional pricing engine has more than doubled when compared to last year's first quarter. And the volume executed through digital connections via API and EDI has grown 4x over that same time. We continue to add customers at an accelerated pace with over 100 new customers connected via TMS and ERP connections in the first quarter of 2021 alone. The pipeline for adding both direct customer connectivity and TMS connections is robust, and we expect to achieve strong growth in our platform connections and tenders throughout 2021.
Our customers now have access to real-time pricing via our Navisphere customer web portal, direct through their TMS or ERP integrations as well as via Freightquote by C.H. Robinson. In total, we've enabled these dynamic pricing capabilities for over 85,000 customers across these points of connections. 
Small businesses continue to see the value in our Freightquote by C.H. Robinson platform as the number of customers utilizing this has grown 30% year-over-year and the adjusted gross profit generated through Freightquote is up 137%. We've had over 1 million unique visitors to the Freightquote platform just since the product launched. And we continue to be excited about the total addressable market of small businesses and our ability to serve them in a fully digital and frictionless manner. 
Earlier this quarter, I hope that you saw that we launched Emissions IQ, the first free self-serve tool for customers that will instantly allow a customer to view their carbon emissions across all modes of transportation globally. This product was created in our innovation incubator, Robinson Labs, and built in response to the growing priority around sustainability. Emissions IQ includes partial truckload emissions methodology that was created in collaboration with MIT's Center for Transportation and Logistics and the U.S. EPA. This collaboration focused on developing a standardized way to measure the emissions of LTL for the first time.
By putting useful technology and data at our customers' fingertips, we're not only increasing the transparency the emissions in our industry but we're servicing the best strategies for customers to make meaningful carbon reductions.
On the carrier side, we continue to deliver new capabilities and benefits to our carriers through our web and mobile versions of Navisphere Carrier and Navisphere Driver. During the quarter, we saw significant increases in the occurrence of fully automated bookings in our NAST truckload business via the web and the app. Approximately 90% of our North American truckload freight is now available to be booked via web or app in a fully digital and frictionless manner. The number of carriers that had adopted this capability was up 50% sequentially from fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year.
And finally, as it relates to productivity, we've highlighted a couple of key metrics for NAST on Page 4 of our earnings presentation. We continue to show year-over-year improvement in productivity, as indicated by the 1,270-point favorable spread in our NAST productivity impact. which represents the difference between the year-over-year change in NAST volume and the change in full-time equivalents in NAST.
Another key metric that we review is shipments per person per day, and this metric is up 13% in first quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Both charts show very clearly the relationship between the timing of our increased technology investments and the impact to these key business metrics.
We are encouraged with the progress that we're making on our technology journey and the impacts that these investments are delivering for our customers, for our carriers and the impact to our overall results. I'll now turn the call to Mike to review the specifics of our first quarter financial performance."

Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we delivered solid financial results during the quarter due to strong profit growth in NAST and Global Forwarding despite lower truckload volume in NAST, where we work to improve AGP per load by",1193,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we delivered solid financial results during the quarter due to strong profit growth in NAST and Global Forwarding despite lower truckload volume in NAST, where we work to improve AGP per load by addressing unprofitable loads in the tight freight market.
Our total company AGP per business day was up 26% compared to Q1 of 2020, driven by performance from our ocean and truckload service teams. As a reminder, our first quarter had 1 less business day compared to Q1 of last year.
On a sequential basis, all of our business segments and service lines delivered increased AGP per business day compared to Q4. Our truckload service line delivered the largest absolute increase on a sequential basis with a 6% increase in AGP per load and a 4% increase in truckload volume per business day. This sequential volume growth was achieved despite the negative impact of winter storm year in the U.S., which we estimate had a net decline of 0.5 day of truckload volume and a full day of LTL volume.
On a monthly basis compared to 2020, our total company AGP per business day was up 34% in January, up 17% in February and up 26% in March. Q1 personnel expenses were $360.8 million, up 9.3% versus Q1 of 2020, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs that are aligned with our expected 2021 results.
Q1 average head count declined 2.9% compared to Q1 last year, including the Prime acquisition, which added 1 percentage point. The Q1 growth in our business with reduced headcount shows how our technology and process improvement investments are delivering efficiency to our business model. We continue to expect our full year 2021 personnel expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion including the higher incentive compensation, the impact of our ongoing long-term cost savings efforts and the reinstatement of our company match on retirement contributions in the U.S. and Canada, which started on January 1.
Q1 SG&A expenses of $118.2 million were down 7.9% compared to Q1 of 2020, driven by reduced travel and improved credit losses. We continue to forecast 2021 total SG&A expenses to be approximately $0.5 billion, including the expectation that travel expenses will build in the back half of 2021 and as the impact of the pandemic subsides. 2021 SG&A is expected to include approximately $85 million to $90 million of depreciation and amortization, which is down from $102 million in 2020, primarily due to the completion of amortization related to a prior acquisition. 
Regarding our long-term cost reduction efforts, through Q1, a we delivered approximately 90% of the $100 million per year of long-term or permanent cost savings. We expect to deliver the remaining $10 million of long-term savings by the end of Q2. In the back half of 2021 and beyond, we will continue our long-term cost savings efforts, primarily through process redesign and automation across the enterprise.
Our first quarter adjusted operating margin was 31.8%, an increase of 1,250 basis points compared to Q1 last year, primarily due to the increase in adjusted gross profit and success of our cost savings efforts. The Q1 adjusted operating margin delivered on our 30% long-term enterprise margin expectation.
Our first quarter effective tax rate was 18.3%, up from 17.1% in Q1 last year, due primarily to the higher income this quarter. Recall that our first quarter typically has a lower effective tax rate due to the tax benefits related to the delivery of our annual stock-based compensation in the quarter. We continue to expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be 20% to 22%, assuming no 2021 impact from changes to U.S., state or international tax laws.
Q1 net income was $173.3 million, up 122% compared to Q1 last year. And as Bob highlighted, diluted earnings per share finished at $1.28, up 125% versus Q1 last year.
Turning to cash flow. Q1 cash used by operations was approximately $56.7 million compared to $58.5 million provided by operations in Q1 of 2020. The $115 million decrease in operational cash flow versus Q1 last year was driven by a $468 million sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets compared to Q4, which was partially offset by a $216 million increase in total accounts payable and the $95 million year-over-year increase in net income.
The 17.7% sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets was driven primarily by a sequential increase in total revenue that was more concentrated in the last 2 months of Q1 compared to Q4 as well as the mix shift associated with higher total revenue growth in Global Forwarding, where our DSO runs almost double that of our NAST business. It's important to note that we are not seeing a deterioration in the quality of our receivables. Q1 results included sequential and year-over-year improvements in credit losses and percent of accounts receivable that are past due. Over the long term, we expect working capital to grow at a slower rate than our adjusted gross profit.
Q1 capital expenditures totaled $13.5 million compared to the $14.7 million in Q1 last year. We continue to expect our 2021 capital expenditures to be $55 million to $65 million. We are seeing solid results from our investments, and we'll continue to prioritize the highest returning technology initiatives on a risk-adjusted basis. We remain committed to our $1 billion investment in technology from 2019 to 2023.
We returned approximately $221 million of cash to shareholders in Q1 through a combination of $151 million of share repurchases and 70 million of dividends. That level of cash returned to shareholders represents a 45% increase versus Q1 last year when we paused our share repurchase late in the quarter to assess the impact of the pandemic.
During Q1 this year, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at an average price of $92.84 per share. At the end of Q1, we had approximately 6.4 million shares of capacity remaining on our 15 million share repurchase authorization from May of 2018. We continue to be committed to disciplined capital stewardship, maintaining an investment-grade credit rating and returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.
Now on to highlights from the balance sheet. We finished Q1 with $218 million of cash and cash equivalents, down $77 million compared to Q1 of 2020. Over the long term, we intend to carry only the cash needed to fund operations and efficiently repatriate excess cash from foreign entities. We ended Q1 with $968 million of liquidity comprised of $750 million of committed funding under our credit facility, which matures in October of 2023 and our Q1 cash balance. Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.34 billion, up $250 million versus Q1 last year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q1 was 1.3x.
I'll close by saying that I have great confidence in our team and their ability to build on the solid results from Q1 by continuing to execute our plans that generate sustainable long-term growth in our total shareholder returns. Thank you for listening this afternoon, and I'll turn the call back over to Bob now for his final comments."

So as I said in my opening comments, we're proud of the results that we delivered in the first quarter. We delivered record revenues, adjusted gross profits, net income and EPS relative to all past first quarters. We grew adjusted gross profit in the quarter by 24%, while operating expenses increased by less than 5. on. This demonstrated the strength in the earnings power of our non-asset-based business model.
Looking forward, we'll stay the course with our strategy of pursuing market share gains that align with our profitability expectations, and we'll continue to invest back into the business in order to drive innovation and improve service to our customers and to our carriers.
Within our NAST business, based on what we know today, we expect tight market conditions to continue through the balance of the year. But regardless of how cyclical market conditions change and evolve, we'll stay focused on driving growth and expanding our business with customers across our global suite of modes and services.
We're very pleased with the results from Global Forwarding, where we've built sustainable competitive advantages due to the structural changes that we've made over the last few years. Across the board as one of the world's largest aggregators of this highly fragmented and diverse carrier base on multiple continents, we're committed to creating better outcomes for our customers and carriers by delivering industry-leading technology that's built by and for supply chain experts.
As shippers and carriers continue to increase their adoption of our new digital capabilities, we expect to see continued productivity benefits and to grow market share across our service lines as we create value for customers in new ways. As an organization, we're committed to continuous improvement, driving further efficiencies into the model and leveraging our unmatched combination of experience, scale, technology and information advantage to create better outcomes and to unlock growth. We're also firmly committed to being a responsible corporate citizen, and we're proud of the tools that we can now offer to advance sustainability across the logistics industry.
Over the past year, all of our lives have been challenged in unforeseen ways, and the priority to build more flexible and adaptable supply chains is a top priority for shippers and receivers globally. We're uniquely positioned as an organization to offer solutions and to innovate by leveraging our non-asset-based business model, our global suite of services and the most capable team of supply chain experts in the world. The team at Robinson is excited by the opportunities in front of us, and committed to providing solutions to the most difficult challenges facing our industry.
Lastly, I'd like to thank the team at Robinson around the world for continuing to drive our company forward and to help us emerge stronger. This concludes our prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn it back to Donna for the live Q&A portion of the call."

I mean the productivity gains are there and they're real, we can see them in the slides that you're presenting. Is it a head count issue? Do you need more folks to be able to attack the volume?
I guess one of the biggest pushbacks I get from investors is they're just struggling to understand why such a strong transactional market isn't translating into more robust volume growth for C.H. Robinson. Can you help explain what's sort of limiting that for you guys over the last several quarters?"

The volume per day was down about 5%. I guess a relatively -- frankly, a really difficult comp. Q1 of '20 was our third highest truckload volume on record. But let's peel it back a level because if you look at just the spot market business, we had robust growth in the spot market, double-digit growth in that space. But the shift between contractual and spot is an important one that we peel back. And so I want to talk a little bit about the efforts that we took to reprice our contractual business in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter and frankly, ongoing into the second quarter.
I'll start with pricing. And if we look back to where we were in the back half of 2020, we had negative files at a record level, right? Some 15% of our loads were resulting in a negative outcome. And that cost us somewhere north of $100 million in the back half of last year and negative adjusted gross profit. So we had to stare that down, first and foremost, and target a yield an adjusted gross profit for our contractual business, that was more sustainable.
The second piece of that is that as we thought about where the markets were going to unfold in 2021, we had to take a position. We had to take a position because by nature, we sell long largely and buy short. And as I stated in some of my prepared comments, we believe that there's some sustainability to the market that we're in right now. Given the driver shortage, given some of the delays on the order to build and delivery cycle on Class 8s, given the continued inventory restocking, given the upcoming produce season, et cetera. And so what we saw through our bidding activities in Q4 and into Q1 and the contractual was we took that position believing that to be correct. And that impacted us somewhat negatively in terms of our awards on a year-over-year basis with some of those customers. So we improved our adjusted gross profit per shipment in Q1, as I think I said in the earlier remarks, about 23%. Certainly significantly off the trough of Q3 of last year. And we're back into a more normal range of that adjusted gross profit per load.
What we've seen as the quarter has progressed, Jack, is that the market seems to be coming back a bit to our thesis. And so it now does appear, at least based on where we sit today, that this market does have some legs on it. We're seeing opportunities come back to us either through the spot market or kind of this gap between what is spot and contractual where we're able to provide dynamic pricing. And additionally, seeing contractual opportunities come back to us with a more favorable AGP profile that's sustainable for us to help those customers through the course of the next year.
I mean I was involved in a lot of customer conversations, and the point is that we wanted to put pricing in front of our customers that we could stand behind that were good for us and good for the customer without transferring the risk at the level that we did in 2020 because that number of negative files and those negative outcomes just simply wasn't sustainable."

If I think about kind of the -- I'm not going to call peak to peak, but let's go back to Q1 of '18 compared to Q1 of '21. And in aggregate, what we've seen over that time period for us is customer pricing's up about 12%, carrier cost is up about 15%, right? So let's call it, on average, 5% here on the cost side, 4% a year on the customer side. So while that's a bit higher than the trailing 5- or 10-year run rate on change in rate and cost, it doesn't necessarily feel to us, Tom, that that's necessarily like a bubble in terms of where the pricing is.
If you go back to our results in '18, where our adjusted gross profit per load is today is probably much more reflective of the back half of '17, and you did see that build through that cycle as we saw pricing of -- the cost of purchase transportation start to drop in the back half of '18 and the first half of '19. I'm nervous about trying to draw too many parallels between '18 and today because it does feel like there are some things today that are structurally very different than what was happening in '18. It felt like in 2017 and '18, there were a lot of that was built on buying the news around electronic logging devices and the potential disruption in the marketplace and how that was going to have some artificial constraints around capacity. And today, this does feel much more driven by supply chain dislocation, driven by inventory restocking, driven by a real sustained pressure on hiring and maintaining drivers. And so I'm not in a position where I feel comfortable kind of calling the ball on how long the cycle is going to go or in what direction. But those would be maybe the parallels I'd draw between the 2 periods."

Our primary focus has been on profitable market share gains, right? And again, evaluating that portfolio getting the adjusted gross profit back into a normal range. Through the quarter here, in Q1, we saw positive volume growth in January. And then as we implemented some of these newer bids, that started to turn negative in February and March, which landed us at that 5% down per business day.
But like I said earlier, we do expect to be able to drive volume growth throughout the balance of this year at much more appropriate adjusted gross profit per shipment, which we think is the right decision to make for our customers because it allows us to be more sustainable for them where and when they need us. And we also think it's the right decision for our shareholders.

We still think that holds together as we look at our forecast through the balance of the year. And that's obviously an enterprise number.
Yes. And maybe just one other point that I'd make. We've talked a lot about flat head count, but I really want to go back again to the thesis that it's about growing volume ahead of head count. We're not afraid to add head count. We're not holding back on I think head count. It's just a matter of making that commitment that we believe that we can deliver volume growth in excess of whatever that head count add is."

I mean everything that we see today in our model is that spot market pricing is still elevated relative to contractual pricing. And in my experience, spot always tends to lead contract. And so that would tell me that there's potentially still some room to run on the upside on the contractual pricing. So to me, peak is maybe defined when that spot starts falling beneath the contract. But anyway, that's kind of my opinion on where we're at there and realizing I'm not a very good prognosticator at where these markets go.
In terms of the fully automated or fully digital, it's a difficult question to answer, and I'm not trying to be elusive just because there is no universal definition of what a fully automated shipment looks like. And I could give you statistics on the customer side that say everything on the customer side is fully automated, and out of carrier side, things are fully automated, and those 2 lines may not cross perfectly. We've made significant increases if I just talk about the carrier side and the fully digital bookings. I think the run rate was at 50% more carriers participate in kind of the auto booking functionality in Navisphere Driver and Navisphere Carrier this quarter than we did last quarter.
Every week, it seems as though we're taking -- we're making a step change in terms of the amount of our business that is moving in a fully digital manner. If I were to put an estimate against it, I'd say we're still probably sub-20% of our total truckload volume that's moving in a fully automated manner with our carriers. And that could be the automated booking, auto tenders, there's multiple ways in which we automate that with carriers, but that would be my estimate of where we sit today."

I think one of the things that we saw in February, Ken, was the impact of the Winter Storm Uri and how dislocating that was for the marketplace. I think as we look through the second quarter and we think about the CBSA road check and the impacts of that on carrier costs, as we think about Mother's Day rush, as we think about the produce season and how that unwraps, I think we'll all learn a lot about the fragility or the stability of this market as some of these things roll in, and we'll see how able the capacity network is to respond to those in kind.

So the -- related to the storm in February, I think what that really did was it took a period of time that was normally kind of a cooling off period in the market, and it just drove it right out of town, right? And it eliminate that time when rates typically come back a bit in the spot. It didn't cause us to call force majeure with any contracts. It certainly influenced some of the conversations on the other side of that, if there was wide gaps between when pricing was submitted, say, in late fourth quarter, early first quarter and wasn't being implemented until later in the quarter, it brought to life some conversations there about where we saw the market going and that certainly influenced some of our thoughts on where we saw the market going. 
The impact of the business, though, we believe we lost about a day of revenue in LTL and about 0.5 day of revenue in truckload, net-net. Once we figured out 1 day of LTL, 0.5 day of truckload, net-net, once we kind of figured out the pull forward and the lost shipping. So that's kind of what I comment about that.
In terms of the thesis that the market is shifting more towards asset-based players, we've certainly not seen that in any way. I mean there -- the demand for our services has been robust. I can't think of many instances where we've been excluded from a large bid. It's quite the opposite of that, I would say."

Our customers come to us to execute really difficult, challenging things for them in their supply chain where nobody else can or is either willing or able to do those things.

So there's a value to that. And I don't think the terminal value of that is 5% margins 5 years from now. I think that the value that we create is very unique, and we'll continue to make that more digital. But digital is just part of the story, right?

As global shipping markets remain disrupted, our team around the globe stayed focused on serving the needs of our customers and delivering innovative solutions to ke",2024,"Thank you, Chuck, and good afternoon, everyone. We're proud of our first quarter results. As global shipping markets remain disrupted, our team around the globe stayed focused on serving the needs of our customers and delivering innovative solutions to keep global supply chains moving. During the quarter, we delivered strong financial results while continuing to deliver against many of our initiatives related to growth, productivity and the advancement of our digital strategy. I'll highlight some of these areas of progress as I walk through my prepared comments surrounding our Q1 results.
In the first quarter of 2021, we generated 125% growth in earnings per share due to profit growth in our 2 largest business segments, North American Surface Transportation and Global Forwarding. Our NAST business generated double-digit growth in both adjusted gross profits, or AGP, and operating income in the quarter. NAST AGP per business day increased 15%, and operating income was up 39% compared to the first quarter of last year. 
These results were driven by a 23% improvement in AGP per truckload in our truckload business, coupled with continued strong market share gains in our less than truckload business, where volume per business day increased 17% year-over-year. Bolstering these results were continued benefits of our technology investments, which continue to unlock productivity gains and deliver customer value in new and exciting ways.
The macro environment in the first quarter continued to be one of tight capacity and increased pricing in the marketplace driven by several supply side constraints, including the ongoing challenges of driver availability, coupled with robust demand. The weather events in February demonstrated how quickly supply chains can get disrupted in this capacity-constrained environment.
For the quarter, our NAST truckload volume was down approximately 6.5% or 5% per business day compared to first quarter of last year. While our business in the spot market increased significantly, our volume in the contractual business declined as we continued to pursue profitable volume growth by reshaping our portfolio through repricing the book of business with new and existing customers.
It's our belief that given the current structural constraints around expansion of truckload supply, coupled with additional government stimulus, a back-half reopening of the economy and potential infrastructure spending, the market conditions that were existing today have the potential to remain out of balance for the next several quarters.
For first quarter, we saw routing guide depth of tender in our managed services business maintained between 1.7 and 1.8, which is consistent with fourth quarter of last year. As one of the world's largest logistics platform and the largest provider of truckload capacity in North America, we are uniquely positioned to help both customers and carriers navigate these market conditions.
One of the ways that we do this is by leveraging our scale and the size of our carrier network. In the first quarter, we welcomed 6,900 new carriers to our network, which represented a 72% increase year-over-year and represents the most carriers added in a quarter in our history. Coupled with these new carrier adds, we also saw record use and adoption of our carrier-facing digital products, Navisphere Carrier and Navisphere Driver, further advancing our digital initiatives.
Our average truckload linehaul cost per mile paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 33.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. Our average linehaul rate billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 33% year-over-year. And for the second quarter in a row, we saw a sequential change in price per mile that exceeded the change in cost per mile as we continue to reprice our contractual truckload business to reflect the current environment. 
Our first quarter rate per mile billed to customers increased 2%, while our cost per mile to carriers increased 1% sequentially. We closed the quarter with an approximate mix of 55% contractual volume and 45% transactional volume versus the 65-35 mix in the year ago period and consistent with our mix in the fourth quarter of 2020.
NAST's less than truckload service continues to grow volume faster than the market with 17% year-over-year growth in volume per business day in Q1. Our value proposition that combines a full suite of LTL services, including common carrier, warehousing and retail consolidation, temperature control, parcel, home delivery and reverse logistics, continues to resonate with customers across industries. And we continue to benefit from the tailwinds in some of the fastest-growing customer segments, including retail, e-commerce and manufacturing.
Within LTL, we're winning new business and growing our existing business with customers of all sizes, from small businesses that utilize our Freightquote by C.H. Robinson platform to large enterprise shippers that look to us as a strategic partner to manage and optimize their LTL freight networks. The March 2020 acquisition of Prime Distribution Services, coupled with our existing retail consolidation network, has made us the largest and most comprehensive provider of retail consolidation services in the industry.
In total, NAST's overall volume per day grew 7% year-over-year. This was slightly below industry volume growth during the quarter of approximately 7.5% as measured by the Cass Freight Index.
Turning the page to Global Forwarding. Our Global Forwarding business once again delivered excellent results in first quarter. We delivered 118% increase in total revenues within the forwarding segment, a 67% increase in adjusted gross profits and a 658% increase in operating income. The forwarding team at Robinson successfully worked with customers across the globe to navigate a difficult and a disruptive market, leading to increased award sizes from customers and thousands of new commercial relationships.
The airfreight market continues to be impacted by reduced cargo capacity, and we continue to position charter flight capacity to support demand from both existing and new customers. Our customers continue to value working with Robinson's local experts in offices around the world that can deliver a full suite of global logistics services and technology solutions. The resulting market share gains, combined with the strength of the market, produced a 27% increase in ocean volumes during the quarter and a 7% increase in air shipments.
Candidly, 3 to 5 years ago, we wouldn't have been able to deliver these types of results in our forwarding business, but we've made substantial structural and strategic changes and have increased our investments over that time. We've invested in technology, data and analytics as well as our global network and leadership team. And we bolstered our commercial and strategic sales teams in forwarding to strengthen our customer relationships and to support emerging vertical strategies while creating sustainable high-value revenue streams.
Additionally, we've expanded our geographical strength in areas such as Europe, Oceania and Latin America and South Asia, while we continue to grow our core trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic business. Within forwarding, we've implemented a more centralized global pricing framework that, combined with an increased use of data and analytics, is enabling us to employ improved and agile pricing strategy leading to growth in market share. 
We believe that these strategies and competitive advantages will enable us to create more value for customers and in turn, win more business and sustain the market share gains that we've achieved and will continue to have forwarding contribute and drive parts of our long-term growth.
Because of the efforts of our C.H. Robinson team members around the world, our total company adjusted gross profit per business day improved by 11% sequentially in first quarter and 26% year-over-year.
Related to technology, we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives and transformation efforts. As I've stated in the past, the 3 primary areas of investment in technology are focused on creating value for customers, value for carriers and driving productivity improvement for our teams, which in turn drives improvements to both our top and our bottom line results.
Looking at the impacts of technology through the lens of customers and carriers. The number of daily and monthly average users across our customer- and carrier-facing platforms continues to grow. An area that we've invested heavily in is the ability to deliver real-time pricing for truckload shippers through digital channels that are most convenient for our customers to use. Enabling these digital connections improves efficiency for our customers. It improves our response time to request and improves our win rates. Today, more than 30% of our transactional business is being priced via our proprietary Transactional Pricing Engine, which we call TPE. Today, we're delivering real-time pricing with capacity assurance from the largest network of truckload capacity.
Volume driven through our Transactional Pricing Engine has more than doubled when compared to last year's first quarter. And the volume executed through digital connections via API and EDI has grown 4x over that same time. We continue to add customers at an accelerated pace with over 100 new customers connected via TMS and ERP connections in the first quarter of 2021 alone. The pipeline for adding both direct customer connectivity and TMS connections is robust, and we expect to achieve strong growth in our platform connections and tenders throughout 2021.
Our customers now have access to real-time pricing via our Navisphere customer web portal, direct through their TMS or ERP integrations as well as via Freightquote by C.H. Robinson. In total, we've enabled these dynamic pricing capabilities for over 85,000 customers across these points of connections.
Small businesses continue to see the value in our Freightquote by C.H. Robinson platform as the number of customers utilizing this has grown 30% year-over-year and the adjusted gross profit generated through Freightquote is up 137%. We've had over 1 million unique visitors to the Freightquote platform just since the product launched. And we continue to be excited about the total addressable market of small businesses and our ability to serve them in a fully digital and frictionless manner.
Earlier this quarter, I hope that you saw that we launched Emissions IQ, the first free self-serve tool for customers that will instantly allow a customer to view their carbon emissions across all modes of transportation globally. This product was created in our innovation incubator, Robinson Labs, and built in response to the growing priority around sustainability. Emissions IQ includes partial truckload emissions methodology that was created in collaboration with MIT's Center for Transportation and Logistics and the U.S. EPA. This collaboration focused on developing a standardized way to measure the emissions of LTL for the first time. By putting useful technology and data at our customers' fingertips, we're not only increasing the transparency of the emissions in our industry but we're servicing the best strategies for customers to make meaningful carbon reductions.
On the carrier side, we continue to deliver new capabilities and benefits to our carriers through our web and mobile versions of Navisphere Carrier and Navisphere Driver. During the quarter, we saw significant increases in the occurrence of fully automated bookings in our NAST truckload business via the web and the app. Approximately 90% of our North American truckload freight is now available to be booked via web or app in a fully digital and frictionless manner. The number of carriers that had adopted this capability was up 50% sequentially from fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year.
And finally, as it relates to productivity, we've highlighted a couple of key metrics for NAST on Page 4 of our earnings presentation. We continue to show year-over-year improvement in productivity, as indicated by the 1,270 point favorable spread in our NAST productivity index, which represents the difference between the year-over-year change in NAST volume and the change in full-time equivalents in NAST.
Another key metric that we review is shipments per person per day, and this metric is up 13% in first quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Both charts show very clearly the relationship between the timing of our increased technology investments and the impact to these key business metrics.
We are encouraged with the progress that we're making on our technology journey and the impacts that these investments are delivering for our customers, for our carriers and the impact to our overall results.
I'll now turn the call to Mike to review the specifics of our first quarter financial performance."

As Bob mentioned, we delivered solid financial results during the quarter due to strong profit growth in NAST and Global Forwarding despite lower truckload volume in NAST, where we work to improve AGP per load by",1191,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we delivered solid financial results during the quarter due to strong profit growth in NAST and Global Forwarding despite lower truckload volume in NAST, where we work to improve AGP per load by addressing unprofitable loads in the tight freight market.
Our total company AGP per business day was up 26% compared to Q1 of 2020, driven by performance from our ocean and truckload service teams. As a reminder, our first quarter had 1 less business day compared to Q1 of last year.
On a sequential basis, all of our business segments and service lines delivered increased AGP per business day compared to Q4. Our truckload service line delivered the largest absolute increase on a sequential basis with a 6% increase in AGP per load and a 4% increase in truckload volume per business day. This sequential volume growth was achieved despite the negative impact of Winter Storm Uri in the U.S., which we estimate had a net decline of 0.5 day of truckload volume and a full day of LTL volume. On a monthly basis compared to 2020, our total company AGP per business day was up 34% in January, up 17% in February and up 26% in March. 
Q1 personnel expenses were $360.8 million, up 9.3% versus Q1 of 2020, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs that are aligned with our expected 2021 results. Q1 average head count declined 2.9% compared to Q1 last year, including the Prime acquisition, which added 1 percentage point. The Q1 growth in our business with reduced head count shows how our technology and process improvement investments are delivering efficiency to our business model. We continue to expect our full year 2021 personnel expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion, including the higher incentive compensation, the impact of our ongoing long-term cost savings efforts and the reinstatement of our company match on retirement contributions in the U.S. and Canada, which started on January 1.
Q1 SG&A expenses of $118.2 million were down 7.9% compared to Q1 of 2020, driven by reduced travel and improved credit losses. We continue to forecast 2021 total SG&A expenses to be approximately $0.5 billion, including the expectation that travel expenses will build in the back half of 2021 as the impact of the pandemic subsides. 2021 SG&A is expected to include approximately $85 million to $90 million of depreciation and amortization, which is down from $102 million in 2020, primarily due to the completion of amortization related to a prior acquisition.
Regarding our long-term cost reduction efforts, through Q1, we delivered approximately 90% of the $100 million per year of long-term or permanent cost savings. We expect to deliver the remaining $10 million of long-term savings by the end of Q2. In the back half of 2021 and beyond, we will continue our long-term cost savings efforts, primarily through process redesign and automation across the enterprise.
Our first quarter adjusted operating margin was 31.8%, an increase of 1,250 basis points compared to Q1 last year, primarily due to the increase in adjusted gross profit and success of our cost savings efforts. The Q1 adjusted operating margin delivered on our 30% long-term enterprise margin expectation.
Our first quarter effective tax rate was 18.3%, up from 17.1% in Q1 last year, due primarily to the higher income this quarter. Recall that our first quarter typically has a lower effective tax rate due to the tax benefits related to the delivery of our annual stock-based compensation in the quarter. We continue to expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be 20% to 22%, assuming no 2021 impact from changes to U.S., state or international tax laws.
Q1 net income was $173.3 million, up 122% compared to Q1 last year. And as Bob highlighted, diluted earnings per share finished at $1.28, up 125% versus Q1 last year.
Turning to cash flow. Q1 cash used by operations was approximately $56.7 million compared to $58.5 million provided by operations in Q1 of 2020. The $115 million decrease in operational cash flow versus Q1 last year was driven by a $468 million sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets compared to Q4, which was partially offset by a $216 million increase in total accounts payable and the $95 million year-over-year increase in net income. The 17.7% sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets was driven primarily by a sequential increase in total revenue that was more concentrated in the last 2 months of Q1 compared to Q4 as well as the mix shift associated with higher total revenue growth in Global Forwarding, where our DSO runs almost double that of our NAST business. 
It's important to note that we are not seeing a deterioration in the quality of our receivables. Q1 results included sequential and year-over-year improvements in credit losses and percent of accounts receivable that are past due. Over the long term, we expect working capital to grow at a slower rate than our adjusted gross profit.
Q1 capital expenditures totaled $13.5 million compared to $14.7 million in Q1 last year. We continue to expect our 2021 capital expenditures to be $55 million to $65 million. We are seeing solid results from our investments, and we'll continue to prioritize the highest returning technology initiatives on a risk-adjusted basis. We remain committed to our $1 billion investment in technology from 2019 to 2023.
We returned approximately $221 million of cash to shareholders in Q1 through a combination of $151 million of share repurchases and $70 million of dividends. That level of cash returned to shareholders represents a 45% increase versus Q1 last year when we paused our share repurchase late in the quarter to assess the impact of the pandemic.
During Q1 this year, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at an average price of $92.84 per share. At the end of Q1, we had approximately 6.4 million shares of capacity remaining on our 15 million share repurchase authorization from May of 2018. We continue to be committed to disciplined capital stewardship, maintaining an investment-grade credit rating and returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.
Now on to highlights from the balance sheet. We finished Q1 with $218 million of cash and cash equivalents, down $77 million compared to Q1 of 2020. Over the long term, we intend to carry only the cash needed to fund operations and efficiently repatriate excess cash from foreign entities. We ended Q1 with $968 million of liquidity comprised of $750 million of committed funding under our credit facility, which matures in October of 2023, and our Q1 cash balance. Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.34 billion, up $250 million versus Q1 last year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q1 was 1.3x.
I'll close by saying that I have great confidence in our team and their ability to build on the solid results from Q1 by continuing to execute our plans that generate sustainable long-term growth in our total shareholder returns. 
Thank you for listening this afternoon, and I'll turn the call back over to Bob now for his final comments."

So as I said in my opening comments, we're proud of the results that we delivered in the first quarter. We delivered record revenues, adjusted gross profits, net income and EPS relative to all past first quarters. We grew adjusted gross profit in the quarter by 24%, while operating expenses increased by less than 5%. This demonstrated the strength and the earnings power of our non-asset-based business model.
Looking forward, we'll stay the course with our strategy of pursuing market share gains that align with our profitability expectations, and we'll continue to invest back into the business in order to drive innovation and improve service to our customers and to our carriers.
Within our NAST business, based on what we know today, we expect tight market conditions to continue through the balance of the year. But regardless of how cyclical market conditions change and evolve, we'll stay focused on driving growth and expanding our business with customers across our global suite of modes and services.
We're very pleased with the results from Global Forwarding, where we've built sustainable competitive advantages through the structural changes that we've made over the last few years. Across the board, as one of the world's largest aggregators of this highly fragmented and diverse carrier base on multiple continents, we're committed to creating better outcomes for our customers and carriers by delivering industry-leading technology that's built by and for supply chain experts.
As shippers and carriers continue to increase their adoption of our new digital capabilities, we expect to see continued productivity benefits and to grow market share across our service lines as we create value for customers in new ways. As an organization, we're committed to continuous improvement, driving further efficiencies into the model and leveraging our unmatched combination of experience, scale, technology and information advantage to create better outcomes and to unlock growth. We're also firmly committed to being a responsible corporate citizen, and we're proud of the tools that we can now offer to advance sustainability across the logistics industry.
Over the past year, all of our lives have been challenged in unforeseen ways, and the priority to build more flexible and adaptable supply chains is a top priority for shippers and receivers globally. We're uniquely positioned as an organization to offer solutions and to innovate by leveraging our non-asset-based business model, our global suite of services and the most capable team of supply chain experts in the world. The team at Robinson is excited by the opportunities in front of us and committed to providing solutions to the most difficult challenges facing our industry.
Lastly, I'd like to thank the team at Robinson around the world for continuing to drive our company forward and to help us emerge stronger. 
This concludes our prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn it back to Donna for the live Q&A portion of the call."

I mean the productivity gains are there and they're real. We can see them in the slides that you're presenting. Is it a head count issue? Do you need more folks to be able to attack the volume? 
I guess one of the biggest pushbacks I get from investors is they're just struggling to understand why such a strong transactional market isn't translating into more robust volume growth for C.H. Robinson. Can you help explain what's sort of limiting that for you guys over the last several quarters?"

The volume per day was down about 5%. I guess a relatively -- frankly, a really difficult comp. Q1 of '20 was our third highest truckload volume on record. But let's peel it back a level because if you look at just the spot market business, we had robust growth in the spot market, double-digit growth in that space. But the shift between contractual and spot is an important one that we peel back. And so I want to talk a little bit about the efforts that we took to reprice our contractual business in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter and frankly, ongoing into the second quarter.
I'll start with pricing. And if we look back to where we were in the back half of 2020, we had negative files at a record level, right? Some 15% of our loads were resulting in a negative outcome. And that cost us somewhere north of $100 million in the back half of last year and negative adjusted gross profit. So we had to stare that down, first and foremost, and target a yield and an adjusted gross profit for our contractual business that was more sustainable.
The second piece of that is that as we thought about where the markets were going to unfold in 2021, we had to take a position. We had to take a position because by nature, we sell long largely and buy short. And as I stated in some of my prepared comments, we believe that there's some sustainability to the market that we're in right now, given the driver shortage, given some of the delays on the order to build and the delivery cycle on Class 8s, given the continued inventory restocking, given the upcoming produce season, et cetera. 
And so what we saw through our bidding activities in Q4 and into Q1 in the contractual was we took that position believing that to be correct. And that impacted us somewhat negatively in terms of our awards on a year-over-year basis with some of those customers. So we improved our adjusted gross profit per shipment in Q1, as I think I said in the earlier remarks, about 23%, certainly significantly off the trough of Q3 of last year. And we're back into a more normal range of that adjusted gross profit per load.
What we've seen as the quarter has progressed, Jack, is that the market seems to be coming back a bit to our thesis. And so it now does appear, at least based on where we sit today, that this market does have some legs on it. We're seeing opportunities come back to us either through the spot market or kind of this gap between what is spot and contractual, where we're able to provide dynamic pricing, and additionally, seeing contractual opportunities come back to us with a more favorable AGP profile that's sustainable for us to help those customers through the course of the next year.
I mean I was involved in a lot of customer conversations, and the point is that we wanted to put pricing in front of our customers that we could stand behind, that were good for us and good for the customer, without transferring the risk at the level that we did in 2020 because that number of negative files and those negative outcomes just simply wasn't sustainable."

If I think about kind of the -- I'm not going to call it peak to peak, but let's go back to Q1 of '18 compared to Q1 of '21. And in aggregate, what we've seen over that time period for us is customer pricing's up about 12%, carrier cost is up about 15%, right? So let's call it, on average, 5% here on the cost side and 4% a year on the customer side. So while that's a bit higher than the trailing 5- or 10-year run rate on change in rate and cost, it doesn't necessarily feel to us, Tom, that that's necessarily like a bubble in terms of where the pricing is.
If you go back to our results in '18, where our adjusted gross profit per load is today is probably much more reflective of the back half of '17. And you did see that build through that cycle as we saw pricing of -- the cost of purchased transportation start to drop in the back half of '18 and the first half of '19. I'm nervous about trying to draw too many parallels between '18 and today because it does feel like there are some things today that are structurally very different than what was happening in '18. 
It felt like in 2017 and '18, there were -- a lot of that was built on buying the news around electronic logging devices and the potential disruption in the marketplace and how that was going to have some artificial constraints around capacity. And today, this does feel much more driven by supply chain dislocation, driven by inventory restocking, driven by a real sustained pressure on hiring and maintaining drivers. And so I'm not in a position where I feel comfortable kind of calling the ball on how long the cycle is going to go or in what direction.

Clearly, the market has been a tailwind for us on a lot of these parts of forwarding. But I do really want to hammer home the fact that Mike Short and his forwarding leadership team has just done amazing work over the course of the last few years around process standardization, about leveraging technology, around the centralization of pricing, strengthening the relationships with the steamship lines and the airlines that we really do think that we've unlocked something pretty special here ahead of where we probably thought that we could."

Our primary focus has been on profitable market share gains, right, and again, evaluating that portfolio getting the adjusted gross profit back into a normal range. Through the quarter here, in Q1, we saw positive volume growth in January. And then as we implemented some of these newer bids, that started to turn negative in February and March, which landed us at that 5% down per business day.
But like I said earlier, we do expect to be able to drive volume growth throughout the balance of this year at much more appropriate adjusted gross profit per shipment, which we think is the right decision to make for our customers because it allows us to be more sustainable for them where and when they need us. And we also think it's the right decision for our shareholders. Eliminating -- taking swings at that $100 million of negative files that occurred in the second half of last year, we think, is in the best interest of everybody because it's just not sustainable."

I mean everything that we see today in our model is that spot market pricing is still elevated relative to contractual pricing. And in my experience, spot always tends to lead contract. And so that would tell me that there's potentially still some room to run on the upside on the contractual pricing. So to me, peak is maybe defined when that spot starts falling beneath the contract. But anyway, that's kind of my opinion on where we're at there and realizing I'm not a very good prognosticator at where these markets go.
In terms of the fully automated or fully digital, it's a difficult question to answer, and I'm not trying to be elusive just because there is no universal definition of what a fully automated shipment looks like. And I could give you statistics on the customer side that say everything on the customer side is fully automated, and then out of carrier side, things are fully automated, and those 2 lines may not cross perfectly. We've made significant increases if I just talk about the carrier side and the fully digital bookings. I think the run rate was 50% more carriers participate in kind of the auto booking functionality in Navisphere Driver and Navisphere Carrier this quarter than we did last quarter.
Every week, it seems as though we're taking -- we're making a step change in terms of the amount of our business that is moving in a fully digital manner. If I were to put an estimate against it, I'd say we're still probably sub-20% of our total truckload volume that's moving in a fully automated manner with our carriers. And that could be the automated booking, auto tenders. There's multiple ways in which we automate that with carriers, but that would be my estimate of where we sit today."

I think one of the things that we saw in February, Ken, was the impact of the Winter Storm Uri and how dislocating that was for the marketplace. I think as we look through the second quarter and we think about the CBSA road check and the impacts of that on carrier costs, as we think about Mother's Day rush, as we think about the produce season and how that unwraps, I think we'll all learn a lot about the fragility or the stability of this market as some of these things roll in, and we'll see how able the capacity network is to respond to those in kind.

So the -- related to the storm in February, I think what that really did was it took a period of time that was normally kind of a cooling off period in the market and it just drove it right out of town, right? And it eliminated that time when rates typically come back a bit in the spot. It didn't cause us to call force majeure with any contracts. It certainly influenced some of the conversations on the other side of that. If there was wide gaps between when pricing was submitted, say, in late fourth quarter, early first quarter and wasn't being implemented until later in the quarter, it brought to life some conversations there about where we saw the market going, and that certainly influenced some of our thoughts on where we saw the market going. 
The impact of the business, though, we believe we lost about a day of revenue in LTL and about 0.5 day of revenue in truckload, net-net. Once we figured out 1 day of LTL, 0.5 day of truckload, net-net, once we kind of figured out the pull forward and the lost shipping. So that's kind of what I'd comment about that.
In terms of the thesis that the market is shifting more towards asset-based players, we've certainly not seen that in any way. I mean there -- the demand for our services has been robust. I can't think of many instances where we've been excluded from a large bid. It's quite the opposite of that, I would say."

Our customers come to us to execute really difficult, challenging things for them in their supply chain where nobody else can or is either willing or able to do those things.

I think that the value that we create is very unique, and we'll continue to make that more digital. But digital is just part of the story, right?

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During the second quarter, we delivered record financial results by staying focused on serving the needs of our customers and keeping their global supply chains moving in a capacity-constrained environment. We're pleased that we returned to truckload volume growth. We delivered record volume in less than truckload, ocean and air, and we believe that our tech plus strategy that combines industry-leading technology with great logistics experts and great processes is the right strategy. As part of our global suite of services, our largest services delivered both year-over-year and sequential growth in total volumes, revenue and adjusted gross profit or AGP, which resulted in quarterly highs for Robinson in total volumes revenues, AEP and operating income. 
Excluding the fourth quarter of 2012, when we sold our T-Chek business, our earnings per share was also a record high. I'll talk about how we achieve these results as I walk through my prepared comments on our second quarter results. In our largest service of NAS truckload, we grew our adjusted gross profit by $34 million or 14% year-over-year. This came through a 6% increase in volume and a 7% increase in adjusted gross profit per load. This included an increase in spot market volume of nearly 30% year-over-year, due in part to an 85% increase in quotes and a 160% increase in volume that was driven through our proprietary real-time dynamic pricing engine. 4% of our spot or transactional business was priced via integrations with our dynamic pricing engine in the second quarter, delivering real-time pricing with capacity assurance from the largest network of truckload capacity in North America. 
While our business in the spot market increased significantly, our volume in the contractual business declined approximately 10% during the quarter as we continue to reshape our portfolio and pursue profitable volume growth. This included a balance of 2 things: First, honoring our contractual commitments with strategic customers, which is still resulting in a higher-than-normal percentage of loads with negative adjusted gross profit margins due to ongoing increases in the cost of purchased transportation. And second, managing acceptance rates in order to limit negative loads and to manage our business for profitability. We closed the quarter with an approximate mix of 55% contractual volume and 45% transactional volume versus a 65-35 mix in the year ago period, and this was consistent with our mix in the first quarter of this year. Our average truck haul line haul cost per mile paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 47.5% compared to the second quarter of last year. Our average line haul rates billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 42% year-over-year. This resulted in the highest cost and price per mile on record and a 12% year-over-year increase in our NAST truckload adjusted gross profit per mile. This combined with a 4.5% decrease in average length of haul resulted in a 7% increase in adjusted gross profit per truckload. We continue to reprice our contractual business in the second quarter, including some underperforming contractual positions. The bid process continues to be a dynamic one. and 40% of our awarded contracts in the second quarter were for terms between 3 and 6 months. Having said this, greater than 2/3 of our bid volume awarded to us in second quarter was still on 12-month contracts. 
During the quarter, we saw routing guide depth of tender in our managed services business declined slightly from in March to 1.6% in June. However, the average in second quarter 1.7% was unchanged from the market conditions in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we welcomed an additional 6,900 carriers to our network, which represented an 88% increase over the carriers added in the second quarter of last year. Leveraging the scale and the information advantage that comes from the size of our carrier network is just 1 of the ways that we help customers navigate this capacity-constrained marketplace.
Given the current structural constraints around the expansion of truckload supply, coupled with the continued reopening of the economy as well as other factors, we do expect the current market conditions will persist through 2021. And as I said last quarter, we expect to grow our truckload volume during the remaining quarters of this year. In our second largest service line of Ocean Forwarding, we grew our adjusted gross profit by $72 million or 92% year-over-year. This came through a 29% increase in shipments and a 49% increase in adjusted gross profit per shipment. Strong demand continues to outpace supply with container and equipment shortages and other market disruptions continuing to constrain capacity. Our team has done a great job of strengthening our carrier relationships and procuring incremental capacity to better serve our customers. The Forwarding team continues to add new commercial relationships with strategic multinational customers that are leading to increased award sizes, while also ensuring our existing customers have access to the capacity that they need to meet their needs. 
Our customers and our results are benefiting from the investments we've made in digitization, data and analytics as well as our global network that is supporting our expanded geographical and vertical expertise. We believe that these strategies and competitive advantages will enable us to create more value for customers and, in turn, win more business and sustain the market share gains that we've achieved. There continues to be a robust pipeline of new business from both new and existing customers. And as we move towards the peak holiday shipping season and into next year, we do expect that ocean demand will remain strong into early 2022. 
As part of our growth strategy, NAST's less than truckload or LTL business, which is our third largest service, continued its strong momentum by growing adjusted gross profit by $23 million or 22% year-over-year. This came through a 23% increase in volume and a slight decline in adjusted gross profit per order. We're seeing balanced growth across our LTL modes and across customer segments. Through our strategic focus on the LTL market, we built a $3 billion LTL business through a blend of organic growth, digital investments and strategic acquisitions such as Freightquote and Prime distribution, which has made us the largest and most comprehensive provider of retail consolidation services in the industry. This portfolio expansion has capitalized on e-commerce growth and combined a full suite of LTL technology and services, including common carrier, warehousing and retail consolidation, temperature control, parcel, home delivery and reverse logistics. Our value proposition, which includes highly automated systems that are easily scaled for high-volume growth continues to resonate with shippers of all sizes and across industry verticals. This includes small businesses that utilize our Freightquote by C.H. Robinson platform, as well as large enterprise shippers that look to us as a strategic partner to manage and optimize their LTL freight networks. 
In total, NAST's overall second quarter volume grew approximately 16% year-over-year compared to a 30% increase in industry volume as measured by the Cass Freight Index.  Due to a large pandemic-related decline in the index in second quarter of last year that we did not experience at the same level. While our growth for the quarter did not exceed the industry benchmark over a 1-year time frame, we've outperformed the index for the three, 4- and 5-year time frames. 
Finally, our fourth largest service. International Airfreight delivered strong results again behind a 43% increase in metric tons shipped. Adjusted gross profit was up 1% over second quarter of last year when we delivered 104% adjusted gross profit growth. Demand has been incredibly strong, partially driven by conversions of some ocean freight to air and a recovery of demand in Europe. Air freight capacity has continued to be strained and we continue to position charter flight capacity to support demand from both new and existing customers. Our Global Forwarding customers that utilize our air, ocean and customs and project logistics services continue to value working with and relying on Robinson's local experts in offices around the world that can deliver a full suite of global logistics services and customized solutions. We've built sustainable competitive advantages in our Global Forwarding business that will continue to deliver solid returns for our shareholders and benefits for our customers in the quarters and the years ahead. Because of the efforts of our Robinson team members across the globe and our advanced technology, our total company adjusted gross profit per business day improved by 5% sequentially in second quarter, 22% year-over-year and 8% over the prepandemic quarter of second quarter of 2019. 
Bolstering our results were continued benefits of our digital investments, which continue to unlock productivity gains and deliver customer value in new and exciting ways. Our 3 primary areas of investment in digitization are focused on creating value for customers, value for carriers and driving productivity improvement for our teams, which in turn drives improvements to both our top and bottom line results. 
Looking at the impacts of digitization through the lens of the customer and carrier adoption, the number of daily and monthly average users across our customer and carrier-facing platforms continues to grow. With 27% year-over-year growth in daily average users of our customer platforms as just 1 example. 
As I mentioned earlier, the amount of customer quotes and volume that is being delivered through our real-time dynamic pricing tools has grown significantly, enabling these digital connections improves efficiency for our customers, improves our response time for quote requests and improves our win rates. We also continue to add digital connections with our customers at an accelerated pace during the quarter. with over 100 new customers connected via TMS and ERP connections in the second quarter of 2021. Our customers now have access to real-time pricing via our Navisphere customer web portal, direct through their TMS or ERP integrations as well as via Freightquote by C.H. Robinson. In total, we've enabled these dynamic pricing capabilities for over 87,000 customers across these points of connection. 
On the carrier side, we continue to deliver new capabilities and benefits to our carriers through our web and mobile versions of Navisphere Carrier and Navisphere Driver. During the quarter, we had over 290,000 fully automated bookings in our NAST truckload business. And finally, as it relates to productivity, we've again highlighted a couple of key metrics for NAST on Page 5 of our earnings presentation. We continue to show year-over-year improvement in productivity, as indicated by the 1,670 points favorable spread in our mass productivity index, which represents the difference between our year-over-year change in NAST volume and the change in full-time equivalents in NAST. 
Another key metric that we review is shipments per person per day, and this metric was up 17% in second quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Both of these charts show very clearly the relationship between the timing of our increased digital investments and the impact to these key operational metrics. We're encouraged with the progress that we're making in our digital and technology journey and the impact that these investments are delivering for our customers, for our carriers and the impacts to our overall results. 
Leading the industry with the most powerful supply chain technology and data platform has been a top strategic priority for Robinson and part of our competitive advantage in the marketplace. We've increased our investments and strengthened our technology and innovation capabilities with our customers' needs and experience in mind. We constantly listen to the voice of our customers and are focused on continually enhancing our customer and carrier experience. We've got bold ambitions to continue to evolve as a platform company, giving our employees, customers and carriers, the products and the information needed to succeed. Our customers rely on us to be an extension of their team, able to provide a global suite of services, create market-leading solutions that work and drive smarter solutions through our information advantage. 
As we continue to create differentiated value for the nearly 200,000 carriers and customers of Robinson, I'm excited to have Arun Rajan join our executive team as Chief Product Officer at September 1, reporting directly to me. Arun will lead our global product strategy and his organization will sit at the intersection of our business strategy and technology platforms to provide a consistent, industry-leading customer experience and to drive our global digital capabilities across our suite of products. Arun is a seasoned and inspiring leader who brings nearly 3 decades of product and technology experience developing and deploying products that enrich the customer experience and create value at industry-leading companies such as Whole Foods, Zappos and Travelocity. Arun's deep product and leadership experience will be invaluable as we drive the next generation of innovation for our industry while creating sustainable long-term value for our customers, our carriers and our shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call to Mike to review the specifics of our second quarter financial performance."

As Bob mentioned, we delivered solid quarterly financial results across a variety of top line and bottom line metrics in Q2 and driven by a strong performance in a favorable market as we continue to leverage our technology plus strategy. In Q2, we established quarterly total company records in volume, total revenue, adjusted gross profit and operating income. Our total company AGP was up 22% compared to Q2 of 2020, driven by strong performance from ocean, truckload, LTL and air. On a sequential basis, each of our business segments delivered AGP growth compared to Q1. On a monthly basis compared to 2020, our total company AGP per business day was up 21% in April, up 12% in May and up 35% in June. With the cost per mile and price per mile in our truckload business reaching all-time highs in Q2, our AGP margin percentage declined. This is simply a function of a larger denominator in the AGP margin equation. To illustrate that, let me share some facts about our Q2 AGP per mile versus our AGP margin percentage. 
Our Q2 truckload AGP per mile was approximately 3% higher than our 10-year average, while our AGP margin percentage was more than 350 basis points below our 10-year average. As truckload pricing is predominantly determined by dollars per load as opposed to percentage markup, having an all-time high price results in a compressed margin percentage. 
We continue to be focused on growing our overall AGP dollars by optimizing volume growth and AGP per shipment across our service offerings. With our customer focus and digital investments continuing to drive growth and efficiency into our model, we have solid strategies to generate sustainable long-term growth. 
Turning now to expenses. Q2 personnel expenses were $362.9 million, up 20.8% compared to Q2 of last year due to higher incentive compensation costs and the impact of short-term pandemic-related cost reductions in Q2 last year. Our Q2 average headcount increased 0.7% compared to Q2 of last year, our average full-time equivalents were up 3.1%. Headcount was added primarily to deliver on our long-term growth expectations, particularly in our Global Forwarding business. In addition, the June 3 acquisition of Combodex Holdings BV in our European Surface Transportation business added approximately 100 new employees to Robinson. Given our increase in headcount and higher incentive compensation associated with our 2021 profit expectations, we now expect our 2021 personnel expenses to be $1.42 billion to $1.48 billion, which is up from our prior guidance of $1.4 billion. 
Q2 SG&A expenses of $125.7 million were up 0.4% compared to Q2 of 2020. We continue to expect 2021 total SG&A expenses to be approximately $0.5 billion, which includes travel expenses building in the back half of the year. 2021 SG&A is expected to include approximately $90 million to $95 million of depreciation and amortization. This is up from our prior guidance of $85 million to $90 million, but down from the $102 million in 2020, primarily due to the completion of amortization related to a prior acquisition. 
Second quarter interest and other expense totaled $13.5 million, up approximately $3.3 million versus Q2 last year due to the impact of currency revaluation. Q2 results included a $1.9 million loss due to unfavorable currency valuation compared to a $1.8 million gain on FX in Q2 last year. I'm pleased to report that we've completed the work that delivers the $100 million per year of long-term cost savings that we committed to 1.5 years ago. Our annualized run rate savings surpassed $100 million in Q1 of this year. Going forward, we will continue our efforts to drive efficiency into our business model, primarily through process redesign and automation across the enterprise. 
Our Q2 income from operations was an all-time quarterly high at $260.6 million, and our adjusted operating margin of 34.8% in was up 410 basis points compared to Q2 last year. Q2 net income was $193.8 million, up 34.6% compared to Q2 last year, and diluted earnings per share finished at $1.44, which was up 35.8% year-over-year. 
Turning to cash flow. Our Q2 cash flow from operations was approximately $149 million, a decrease of $298 million compared to Q2 last year driven primarily by the outsized improvement in working capital in Q2 last year. Sequentially, Q2 operating working capital increased by $81.8 million or 5.6% versus Q1 compared to a sequential increase of 6.7% in AGP. Over the long term, we expect our working capital to continue to grow at a rate slower than our AGP. 
Capital expenditures were $16.3 million in Q2, up from $10.3 million in Q2 last year, primarily driven by increased investments in hardware and software. Year-to-date through Q2, our capital expenditures were $30 million, and we continued to expect 2021 capital expenditures to finish in the range of $55 million to $65 million. We returned approximately $205 million of cash to shareholders in Q2 through a combination of $135 million of share repurchases and $70 million of dividends. That level of cash returned to shareholders represents a 199% increase versus Q2 last year when we were not repurchasing shares out of an abundance of caution due to the pandemic. 
During Q2 this year, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares at an average price of $97.47 per share. And at the end of Q2, we had approximately 5 million shares of remaining capacity on our 15 million share repurchase authorization from May of 2018. 
Our cash balance at the end of Q2 was $173 million, down $189 million compared to Q2 of 2020. We intend to carry only the cash needed to fund operations and to efficiently repatriate excess cash from foreign entities. We ended Q2 with $902 million of liquidity comprised of $729 million of committed funding under our credit facility, which matures in October of 2023, and our Q2 cash balance. Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.37 billion, up $274 million versus Q2 last year, driven primarily by share repurchases and increased working capital. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q2 was 1.2x, down sequentially from 1.3x at the end of Q1. From an M&A standpoint, the deal flow in the market remains robust, and we expect to see more industry consolidation through the end of 2021. 
While we don't comment on specific companies or transactions, we do see the potential for Robinson to play a role. We continue to be focused on value creation with our capital allocation and remain disciplined in that regard. We continue to prioritize companies that can expand our geographic presence, particularly in Global Forwarding, at or improve our service offerings, offer compelling cross-selling opportunities, help us build scale to leverage our flywheel or to enhance our digitization efforts to deliver growth, quality of service or efficiencies. A strong fit with the Robinson culture is also important in our M&A efforts. 
Overall, we're making excellent progress against our strategic initiatives to drive growth and efficiency into our model. That said, we have tremendous opportunities for growth and efficiency ahead of us as we still represent just a small percentage of the overall addressable market in global logistics landscape. From a capital allocation standpoint, we continue to be committed to disciplined capital stewardship maintaining an investment-grade credit rating and generating sustainable long-term growth to our shareholders. 
Thank you for listening this afternoon, and I'll turn the call back over to Bob now for his final comments."

As we think about the market as we see it right now, we continue to see the spot market pulling the contractual market up in truckload. I mean, obviously, these numbers on a year-on-year basis and the 40% range are clearly outsized because of the depression that we had in the freight markets in the second quarter of last year. But we do expect to continue to see pricing increasing through the balance of the year. Sequentially, we're continuing to see continued pressure there. To your point, we do manage the business really to net revenue dollars on a per truckload basis. We're staying really focused right now, Jordan, on growing our overall AGP or net revenue dollars by really optimizing that balance between volume growth and AGP per shipment. We've been working hard to avoid contracts that can contribute more loads with negative margins. And I think as I said in the last quarter's call, we entered the bid cycle late in 2020 and early into facing sustained AGP per truckload that was well below the range of acceptable profitability for us. And so we really had to take a couple of steps in addressing negative files, avoiding those contracts that post instituted a lot of risk around negatives and then focusing on that balance between both spot and contractual. So we had a belief early in this year about where we thought the contract truckload market was going to move. And at this point, we appear that, that view was fairly accurate that did cause us to miss some opportunities early in the year. But those are really coming back to us now, either in shorter-term contractual agreements or more true spot market."

And I'm just curious if you could maybe talk about when you think we're going to start seeing sort of that acceleration in productivity that's going to drive the clear market share gains that the market can sort of view to really get a gauge on the level of top line growth and incremental profitability that can come from all these investments. I guess we're just trying to get a feel for when we're going to hit the tipping point and really see those market share gains accelerate if that question makes sense."

And obviously, technology spend and investment in digitization has been ongoing for us. As I look at the operational results and the financial results, I believe that we're seeing some of those things today. We're certainly creating value in new ways for both customers and carriers, some of the NAST productivity information that we provide in the deck certainly speaks to the productivity uplift that we've gotten within that, whether it be shipments per person per day or that NPI, the NAST productivity index. I believe that we've spent the last several quarters really building capabilities in different digital capabilities and different digital products. And today, we're really pushing for broad adoption of that. I mean I've talked in my prepared comments around the ability to leverage our proprietary pricing engine that's driven by algorithms and models against our customers. I mean today, virtually almost every single customer of Robinsons can now access that pricing engine, either through the web portal, whether through freight quote or direct to their TMS or ERP the fully automated bookings, the digital freight matching that's occurring on the carrier side, well over 290,000 fully automated truckload bookings. That's not only a big productivity lift for us, but it's also a new way for us to attract and engage with carriers in a different way that may prefer that method of booking. So again, I go back to we're not at the finish line of either introducing new capabilities or getting those out into the wild, but I do think we're starting to see some really early stage results and impacts into the business. Just in the spot market alone with roughly 30% volume growth that we had this quarter. A lot of that was driven through those digital pricing engines and connections. So I think we're in a good place, Jack. Again, as I said in the prepared remarks, adding Arun Rajan, a really strong product leader with a lot of experience a true digital native platform companies. I look at that as a really strategic move for us to help accelerate and to help us be even better there."

What I would tell you, and again, I'm going to flip, Ravi, back to adjusted gross for actual just net revenue or AGP dollars per load. And I would tell you, in the second quarter, our net revenue per load is basically right at the midpoint of our 5- and 10-year trailing averages, right? Now clearly, back half of '18, front half of '19, we saw outsized margins when costs started to drop against our contract business. We've got a whole bunch of customers that are at those 8% to 10% margins today, and they're highly profitable relationships for us because they're highly digitized, highly connected, highly automated on both the front end with the customer and the back end of the carrier. So I really think that, that 8% to 10% margin range that you talk about is so dependent upon mix, right? Because if I can have a highly efficient customer relationship that's integrated via API on the customer side and integrated with carriers in the back backside, you can run that business profitably all day long at mid-single digit, high single-digit margins. But if you've got a lot of labor, a lot of work that needs to go into carrier procurement, a lot of issues with shipping and receiving, that's not 8% to 10% business in my imagination. I think there's so many variables that go into that, it's not going to be. Now clearly, we're taking steps to digitize both in the front end and the back end, front end with the customer, back end with the carrier that drive greater efficiency and allow us to think differently about that. But ultimately, as we think about our operating expenses and our cost to serve we are sitting here running a whole bunch of what-if scenarios of what if it's 8, what if it's 10, what it stays at 15, but we want to ensure that we've got the right operating model that we can survive and thrive regardless of what happens because a lot of that is outside of our control as witnessed this quarter just by the rapid run-up in cost and sales."

That was technically 2, Tom, but we'll just -- we'll dock you on next quarter, but we'll take them both because there question. On the contract side, on the truckload piece, clearly, we're working to shape that portfolio today, right? And that we shape that portfolio based on how we go to market, how we respond pricing to those bids. As I said in my prepared comments, I think it's 40% of our awards during the quarter were for the shorter term, 3 and 6 -months agreements. We're doing a lot of things with customers today where we're not in a spot or contract per se, but kind of in that in-between space where we're keeping that customer out of the spot, it's slightly beneficial to us. It derisks things for the customer. It derisks things for us as well. So we're getting pretty creative around pricing because to your point, the volatility that has existed in the market from '17 to today is unprecedented, certainly. But moving to a true 50-50, I think disadvantages us because really 85% of truckload freight in a typical market is moving under contract terms. And so we really want access to that. We think that we're really good at serving customers in that contractual arrangement we can look and feel like a large asset and aggregate all of the independent owner operators under a single technology umbrella and bring to life the capacity there that most customers wouldn't -- they're not built to access on their own. So I don't know that we'll ever get to 50-50 on a sustained level, but we do consistently work to shape the kind of the makeup of the contract versus spot. 
On the forwarding side, I think it was at this point last year that everyone was kind of saying there's no way that Robinson is going to comp 104% growth in airfreight in the future. This must be transitory. And we just did. And so we don't see anything fundamentally changing in the air and ocean markets between now and Chinese New Year at a minimum. I would just really reinforce is there's so much work that Mike Short and his leadership team in forwarding have done over the course of the last couple of years. We've challenged our own internal beliefs of how we can scale that business of what the returns can be in that business. And with modest, I would call modest headcount increases in the business over the course of the last couple of years, we've increased volumes significantly and certainly increased the revenue significantly. So there's been a lot of commercial activity that's occurred. We've added a lot of new logos to that business. We're a better forwarder today, I believe, than we were 2 years ago based on the scale that we've created. And that market does just continue to be so dislocated that shippers that were typically BCOs that weren't working with NBOs are now bringing NBOs into the mix to manage through that. So I'm not a prognosticator of exactly what the size of that business is 24 months from now or 36 months from now. But I really believe that there's a lot of sustainability of the results that we're delivering and forwarding both on because of the cycle and also the work that's been done there and the investments around technology and investments in talent on a global basis."

And between 2017 and today, there have just been too many instances where 30 days after implementation, routing guides are failing, acceptance levels are low or the inverse of that, like happened in '18 and to '19, you end up disadvantaged as a shipper and you're paying rates well over the market. And so I do think that there's going to continue to be an adjustment and a derisking on both sides because it's -- with the volatility that's been there, it's unrealistic for a shipper to think that they're going to hand over a 12-month contract at a price when you've got this much volatility and transfer that risk. And likewise, a carrier is simply not going to take that amount of risk on when the markets are moving as quickly as they are. So I do think that we're finding different ways to approach pricing and to get pretty creative to find solutions that are winning in the market for large blocks of freight that are helping to ship -- helping shippers to deal with the volatility."

I guess, though, I want to understand sort of the ability for the direction to change in the back half of the year. So we've been sort of stuck between 12% and 13%, understandably so. But as you start to see the potential for rates level off potentially in the back half of the year, the sort of shorter-term [porch] to pricing, the better contract versus spot mix, it would seem that you'd be able to see some sequential improvement in margins. I want to make sure I'm understanding the comments you made before. Were you saying that you don't expect necessarily to see that until you see rates down on a year-over-year basis? Or -- Or is there some other factors that kind of play into your thoughts around NAST margins in the back half of the year?"

I made comments that we've been in this process of repricing. We've been focused on taking negative loads out. I will tell you, we are still at an elevated level around negative loads in our contract business. On a quarterly basis, if you look at 2012 to today, we normally average, I don't know, $20 million roughly of negative files on a quarterly basis. We're at about $60 million this quarter. So there is a $40 million delta between what normal looks like in second quarter of this year, just in our contractual business. And so that is the opportunity that we continue to pursue. You start taking that over the course of the year and start to get some big numbers pretty quickly. So we continue to work on that opportunity to pursue the way to improve the profitability in that contractual business. That, I would tell you is probably the biggest difference. If you can take that down to operating margin, you can take that down to net revenue margin, but that's probably the biggest difference between the front end of '18 and today, is just the existence of the spot market margins are roughly the same, but the contractual margins are far lower right now than they were then just because of the existence of those negative loads. So we got to keep chipping away at that."

I mean on a net revenue per business day, the numbers are pretty similar. The growth rates are probably a little bit higher in July than they were in June, just given the comparisons -- So let's talk about the operating margin. As I was thinking we might get this question, I was trying to think about -- we often get the question of how does it compare to previous times in the cycle. And so just as a point of comparison, second quarter of 2018 and second quarter of this year. And if you go back in time, at that time, for the second quarter of '18, NAST was at like 41%, Forwarding was at 20.7%, and overall, we were at 3.6 million Today, NAST is at 34.6%, Forwarding at 45.3% and we're at 34.8%. So our operating margin as an enterprise today is actually better today than it was in what I would consider kind of a similar time in the cycle. In terms of where we can go, I still believe that upper 30s and 40 is an opportunity for NAST. We're certainly engineering our cost structure to be able to get there. And the biggest factor there is net revenue dollars per truckload, right? That's what is going to be the biggest mover of that. But we're certainly doing a lot of things in the cost structure to try to get back to close to operating margins in NAST. We said for a long time that our goal is to move the forwarding business to 30% operating margins. And now all of a sudden, we've shown ourselves that we can do in right? And so I'd say we'll still guide towards that 30% range for Forwarding, but the sustainability of our current margins, we'll continue to look at and could reserve the right to revisit the kind of the guidance, if you will, for that boarding business. But if we can keep the enterprise in that mid-30s range, we think that, that is consistent with past quarters and certainly very feasible for us."

Our focus on the contractual business, as I said earlier, I think the 85% of the freight that moves in the contracts is a market that we want to be in. We want to participate in that through cycles. Why is it that we're still having a high degree of negative loads in that business. look, we forecasted where we thought this year was going to go, but we didn't expect 42% increase, 47% increase in carrier costs of higher in the second quarter. And so we've got to deliver results for multiple stakeholders, our shareholders, certainly but our customers are what ultimately create the value for our shareholders. And so I'm a firm believer that we need to do our best to manage our commitments to those relationships through cycles because it pays dividends in the long term. When I look at our top 500 customers that make up close to 50% of our revenue and see the retention rates that we have with those customers of 99% to 100% in any given year, I think that's a testament as to why we take the positions we do with those customers because we try to take the long-term view."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During the second quarter, we delivered record financial results by staying focused on serving the needs of our customers and keeping their global supply chains moving in a capacity-constrained environment. We're pleased that we returned to truckload volume growth. We delivered record volume in less than truckload, ocean and air, and we believe that our tech plus strategy that combines industry-leading technology with great logistics experts and great processes is the right strategy. As part of our global suite of services, our largest services delivered both year-over-year and sequential growth in total volumes, revenue and adjusted gross profit or AGP, which resulted in quarterly highs for Robinson in total volumes, revenues, AGP and operating income. 
Excluding the fourth quarter of 2012, when we sold our T-Chek business, our earnings per share was also a record high. I'll talk about how we achieve these results as I walk through my prepared comments on our second quarter results. In our largest service of NAST truckload, we grew our adjusted gross profit by $34 million or 14% year-over-year. This came through a 6% increase in volume and a 7% increase in adjusted gross profit per load. This included an increase in spot market volume of nearly 30% year-over-year, due in part to an 85% increase in quotes and a 160% increase in volume that was driven through our proprietary real-time dynamic pricing engine. 40% of our spot or transactional business was priced via integrations with our dynamic pricing engine in the second quarter, delivering real-time pricing with capacity assurance from the largest network of truckload capacity in North America. 
While our business in the spot market increased significantly, our volume in the contractual business declined approximately 10% during the quarter as we continue to reshape our portfolio and pursue profitable volume growth. This included a balance of 2 things: First, honoring our contractual commitments with strategic customers, which is still resulting in a higher-than-normal percentage of loads with negative adjusted gross profit margins due to ongoing increases in the cost of purchased transportation.  And second, managing acceptance rates in order to limit negative loads and to manage our business for profitability. We closed the quarter with an approximate mix of 55% contractual volume and 45% transactional volume versus a 65-35 mix in the year ago period, and this was consistent with our mix in the first quarter of this year. Our average truck haul line haul cost per mile paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 47.5% compared to the second quarter of last year. Our average line haul rates billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 42% year-over-year. This resulted in the highest cost and price per mile on record and a 12% year-over-year increase in our NAST truckload adjusted gross profit per mile. This combined with a 4.5% decrease in average length of haul resulted in a 7% increase in adjusted gross profit per truckload. We continue to reprice our contractual business in the second quarter, including some underperforming contractual positions. The bid process continues to be a dynamic one. And 40% of our awarded contracts in the second quarter were for terms between 3 and 6 months. Having said this, greater than 2/3 of our bid volume awarded to us in second quarter was still on 12-month contracts. 
During the quarter, we saw routing guide depth of tender in our managed services business declined slightly from 1.8% in March to 1.6% in June. However, the average in second quarter 1.7% was unchanged from the market conditions in the first quarter. In the second quarter, we welcomed an additional 6,900 carriers to our network, which represented an 88% increase over the carriers added in the second quarter of last year. Leveraging the scale and the information advantage that comes from the size of our carrier network is just one of the ways that we help customers navigate this capacity-constrained marketplace.
Given the current structural constraints around the expansion of truckload supply, coupled with the continued reopening of the economy as well as other factors, we do expect the current market conditions will persist through 2021. And as I said last quarter, we expect to grow our truckload volume during the remaining quarters of this year. In our second largest service line of ocean forwarding, we grew our adjusted gross profit by $72 million or 92% year-over-year. This came through a 29% increase in shipments and a 49% increase in adjusted gross profit per shipment. Strong demand continues to outpace supply with container and equipment shortages and other market disruptions continuing to constrain capacity. Our team has done a great job of strengthening our carrier relationships and procuring incremental capacity to better serve our customers. The forwarding team continues to add new commercial relationships with strategic multinational customers that are leading to increased award sizes, while also ensuring our existing customers have access to the capacity that they need to meet their needs. 
Our customers and our results are benefiting from the investments we've made in digitization, data and analytics as well as our global network that is supporting our expanded geographical and vertical expertise. We believe that these strategies and competitive advantages will enable us to create more value for customers and, in turn, win more business and sustain the market share gains that we've achieved. There continues to be a robust pipeline of new business from both new and existing customers. And as we move towards the peak holiday shipping season and into next year, we do expect that ocean demand will remain strong into early 2022. 
As part of our growth strategy, NAST's less than truckload, or LTL business, which is our third largest service, continued its strong momentum by growing adjusted gross profit by $23 million or 22% year-over-year. This came through a 23% increase in volume and a slight decline in adjusted gross profit per order. We're seeing balanced growth across our LTL modes and across customer segments. Through our strategic focus on the LTL market, we built a $3 billion LTL business through a blend of organic growth, digital investments and strategic acquisitions such as Freightquote and Prime Distribution, which has made us the largest and most comprehensive provider of retail consolidation services in the industry. This portfolio expansion has capitalized on e-commerce growth and combined a full suite of LTL technology and services, including common carrier, warehousing and retail consolidation, temperature control, parcel, home delivery and reverse logistics. Our value proposition, which includes highly automated systems that are easily scaled for high-volume growth continues to resonate with shippers of all sizes and across industry verticals. This includes small businesses that utilize our Freightquote by C.H. Robinson platform, as well as large enterprise shippers that look to us as a strategic partner to manage and optimize their LTL freight networks. 
In total, NAST overall second quarter volume grew approximately 16% year-over-year compared to a 30% increase in industry volume as measured by the Cass Freight Index, due to a large pandemic-related decline in the index in second quarter of last year that we did not experience at the same level. While our growth for the quarter did not exceed the industry benchmark over a 1-year time frame, we've outperformed the index for the 2, 3, 4 and 5-year time frames. 
Finally, our fourth largest service. International Airfreight delivered strong results again behind a 43% increase in metric tons shipped. Adjusted gross profit was up 1% over second quarter of last year when we delivered 104% adjusted gross profit growth. Demand has been incredibly strong, partially driven by conversions of some ocean freight to air and a recovery of demand in Europe. Air freight capacity has continued to be strained and we continue to position charter flight capacity to support demand from both new and existing customers. Our Global Forwarding customers that utilize our air, ocean and customs and project logistics services continue to value working with and relying on Robinson's local experts in offices around the world that can deliver a full suite of global logistics services and customized solutions. We've built sustainable competitive advantages in our Global Forwarding business that will continue to deliver solid returns for our shareholders and benefits for our customers in the quarters and the years ahead. Because of the efforts of our Robinson team members across the globe and our advanced technology, our total company adjusted gross profit per business day improved by 5% sequentially in second quarter, 22% year-over-year and 8% over the prepandemic quarter of second quarter of 2019. 
Bolstering our results were continued benefits of our digital investments, which continue to unlock productivity gains and deliver customer value in new and exciting ways. Our 3 primary areas of investment in digitization are focused on creating value for customers, value for carriers and driving productivity improvement for our teams, which in turn drives improvements to both our top and bottom line results. 
Looking at the impacts of digitization through the lens of the customer and carrier adoption, the number of daily and monthly average users across our customer and carrier-facing platforms continues to grow. With 27% year-over-year growth in daily average users of our customer platforms as just one example. 
As I mentioned earlier, the amount of customer quotes and volume that is being delivered through our real-time dynamic pricing tools has grown significantly, enabling these digital connections improves efficiency for our customers, improves our response time for quote requests and improves our win rates. We also continue to add digital connections with our customers at an accelerated pace during the quarter, with over 100 new customers connected via TMS and ERP connections in the second quarter of 2021. Our customers now have access to real-time pricing via our Navisphere customer web portal, direct through their TMS or ERP integrations as well as via Freightquote by C.H. Robinson. In total, we've enabled these dynamic pricing capabilities for over 87,000 customers across these points of connection. 
On the carrier side, we continue to deliver new capabilities and benefits to our carriers through our web and mobile versions of Navisphere Carrier and Navisphere Driver. During the quarter, we had over 290,000 fully automated bookings in our NAST truckload business. And finally, as it relates to productivity, we've again highlighted a couple of key metrics for NAST on Page 5 of our earnings presentation. We continue to show year-over-year improvement in productivity, as indicated by the 1,670 point favorable spread in our NAST productivity index, which represents the difference between our year-over-year change in NAST volume and the change in full-time equivalents in NAST. 
Another key metric that we review is shipments per person per day, and this metric was up 17% in second quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Both of these charts show very clearly the relationship between the timing of our increased digital investments and the impact to these key operational metrics. We're encouraged with the progress that we're making in our digital and technology journey and the impact that these investments are delivering for our customers, for our carriers and the impacts to our overall results. 
Leading the industry with the most powerful supply chain technology and data platform has been a top strategic priority for Robinson and part of our competitive advantage in the marketplace. We've increased our investments and strengthened our technology and innovation capabilities with our customers' needs and experience in mind. We constantly listen to the voice of our customers and are focused on continually enhancing our customer and carrier experience. We've got bold ambitions to continue to evolve as a platform company, giving our employees, customers and carriers, the products and the information needed to succeed. Our customers rely on us to be an extension of their team, able to provide a global suite of services, create market-leading solutions that work and drive smarter solutions through our information advantage. 
As we continue to create differentiated value for the nearly 200,000 carriers and customers of Robinson, I'm excited to have Arun Rajan join our executive team as Chief Product Officer at September 1, reporting directly to me. Arun will lead our global product strategy and his organization will sit at the intersection of our business strategy and technology platforms to provide a consistent, industry-leading customer experience and to drive our global digital capabilities across our suite of products. Arun is a seasoned and inspiring leader who brings nearly 3 decades of product and technology experience developing and deploying products that enrich the customer experience and create value at industry-leading companies such as Whole Foods, Zappos and Travelocity. Arun's deep product and leadership experience will be invaluable as we drive the next generation of innovation for our industry while creating sustainable long-term value for our customers, our carriers and our shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call to Mike to review the specifics of our second quarter financial performance."

As Bob mentioned, we delivered solid quarterly financial results across a variety of top line and bottom line metrics in Q2, driven by a strong performance in a favorable market as we continue to leverage our tec",1240,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we delivered solid quarterly financial results across a variety of top line and bottom line metrics in Q2, driven by a strong performance in a favorable market as we continue to leverage our technology plus strategy. In Q2, we established quarterly total company records in volume, total revenue, adjusted gross profit and operating income. Our total company AGP was up 22% compared to Q2 of 2020, driven by strong performance from ocean, truckload, LTL and air. On a sequential basis, each of our business segments delivered AGP growth compared to Q1. On a monthly basis compared to 2020, our total company AGP per business day was up 21% in April, up 12% in May and up 35% in June. With the cost per mile and price per mile in our truckload business reaching all-time highs in Q2, our AGP margin percentage declined. This is simply a function of a larger denominator in the AGP margin equation. To illustrate that, let me share some facts about our Q2 AGP per mile versus our AGP margin percentage. 
Our Q2 truckload AGP per mile was approximately 3% higher than our 10-year average, while our AGP margin percentage was more than 350 basis points below our 10-year average. As truckload pricing is predominantly determined by dollars per load as opposed to percentage markup, having an all-time high price results in a compressed margin percentage. 
We continue to be focused on growing our overall AGP dollars by optimizing volume growth and AGP per shipment across our service offerings. With our customer focus and digital investments continuing to drive growth and efficiency into our model, we have solid strategies to generate sustainable long-term growth. 
Turning now to expenses. Q2 personnel expenses were $362.9 million, up 20.8% compared to Q2 of last year due to higher incentive compensation costs and the impact of short-term pandemic-related cost reductions in Q2 last year. Our Q2 average headcount increased 0.7% compared to Q2 of last year, and our average full-time equivalents were up 3.1%. Headcount was added primarily to deliver on our long-term growth expectations, particularly in our Global Forwarding business. In addition, the June 3 acquisition of Combinex Holdings B.V. in our European Surface Transportation business added approximately 100 new employees to Robinson. Given our increase in headcount and higher incentive compensation associated with our 2021 profit expectations, we now expect our 2021 personnel expenses to be $1.42 billion to $1.48 billion, which is up from our prior guidance of $1.4 billion. 
Q2 SG&A expenses of $125.7 million were up 0.4% compared to Q2 of 2020. We continue to expect 2021 total SG&A expenses to be approximately $0.5 billion, which includes travel expenses building in the back half of the year. 2021 SG&A is expected to include approximately $90 million to $95 million of depreciation and amortization. This is up from our prior guidance of $85 million to $90 million, but down from the $102 million in 2020, primarily due to the completion of amortization related to a prior acquisition. 
Second quarter interest and other expense totaled $13.5 million, up approximately $3.3 million versus Q2 last year due to the impact of currency revaluation. Q2 results included a $1.9 million loss due to unfavorable currency valuation compared to a $1.8 million gain on FX in Q2 last year. I'm pleased to report that we've completed the work that delivers the $100 million per year of long-term cost savings that we committed to 1.5 years ago. Our annualized run rate savings surpassed $100 million in Q1 of this year. Going forward, we will continue our efforts to drive efficiency into our business model, primarily through process redesign and automation across the enterprise. 
Our Q2 income from operations was an all-time quarterly high at $260.6 million, and our adjusted operating margin of 34.8% was up 410 basis points compared to Q2 last year. Q2 net income was $193.8 million, up 34.6% compared to Q2 last year, and diluted earnings per share finished at $1.44, which was up 35.8% year-over-year. 
Turning to cash flow. Our Q2 cash flow from operations was approximately $149 million, a decrease of $298 million compared to Q2 last year driven primarily by the outsized improvement in working capital in Q2 last year. Sequentially, Q2 operating working capital increased by $81.8 million or 5.6% versus Q1 compared to a sequential increase of 6.7% in AGP. Over the long term, we expect our working capital to continue to grow at a rate slower than our AGP. 
Capital expenditures were $16.3 million in Q2, up from $10.3 million in Q2 last year, primarily driven by increased investments in hardware and software. Year-to-date through Q2, our capital expenditures were $30 million, and we continued to expect 2021 capital expenditures to finish in the range of $55 million to $65 million. We returned approximately $205 million of cash to shareholders in Q2 through a combination of $135 million of share repurchases and $70 million of dividends. That level of cash returned to shareholders represents a 199% increase versus Q2 last year when we were not repurchasing shares out of an abundance of caution due to the pandemic. 
During Q2 this year, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares at an average price of $97.47 per share. And at the end of Q2, we had approximately 5 million shares of remaining capacity on our 15 million share repurchase authorization from May of 2018. 
Our cash balance at the end of Q2 was $173 million, down $189 million compared to Q2 of 2020. We intend to carry only the cash needed to fund operations and to efficiently repatriate excess cash from foreign entities. We ended Q2 with $902 million of liquidity comprised of $729 million of committed funding under our credit facility, which matures in October of 2023 and our Q2 cash balance. Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.37 billion, up $274 million versus Q2 last year, driven primarily by share repurchases and increased working capital. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q2 was 1.2x, down sequentially from 1.3x at the end of Q1. From an M&A standpoint, the deal flow in the market remains robust, and we expect to see more industry consolidation through the end of 2021. 
While we don't comment on specific companies or transactions, we do see the potential for Robinson to play a role. We continue to be focused on value creation with our capital allocation and remain disciplined in that regard. We continue to prioritize companies that can expand our geographic presence, particularly in Global Forwarding, at or improve our service offerings, offer compelling cross-selling opportunities, help us build scale to leverage our flywheel or to enhance our digitization efforts to deliver growth, quality of service or efficiencies. A strong fit with the Robinson culture is also important in our M&A efforts. 
Overall, we're making excellent progress against our strategic initiatives to drive growth and efficiency into our model. That said, we have tremendous opportunities for growth and efficiency ahead of us as we still represent just a small percentage of the overall addressable market in global logistics landscape. From a capital allocation standpoint, we continue to be committed to disciplined capital stewardship, maintaining an investment-grade credit rating and generating sustainable long-term growth to our shareholders. 
Thank you for listening this afternoon, and I'll turn the call back over to Bob now for his final comments."

As we think about the market as we see it right now, we continue to see the spot market pulling the contractual market up in truckload. I mean, obviously, these numbers on a year-on-year basis in the 40% range are clearly outsized because of the depression that we had in the freight markets in the second quarter of last year. But we do expect to continue to see pricing increasing through the balance of the year. Sequentially, we're continuing to see continued pressure there. To your point, we do manage the business really to net revenue dollars on a per truckload basis. We're staying really focused right now, Jordan, on growing our overall AGP or net revenue dollars by really optimizing that balance between volume growth and AGP per shipment. We've been working hard to avoid contracts that can contribute more loads with negative margins. And I think as I said in the last quarter's call, we entered the bid cycle late in 2020 and early into '21, facing sustained AGP per truckload that was well below the range of acceptable profitability for us. And so we really had to take a couple of steps in addressing negative files, avoiding those contracts that instituted a lot of risk around negatives and then focusing on that balance between both spot and contractual. So we had a belief early in this year about where we thought the contract truckload market was going to move. And at this point, we appear that, that view was fairly accurate that did cause us to miss some opportunities early in the year. But those are really coming back to us now, either in shorter-term contractual agreements or more true spot market."

And I know it goes back further than that, but specifically over the last several years, it certainly feels like we're at a tipping point here. And I'm just curious if you could maybe talk about when you think we're going to start seeing sort of that acceleration in productivity that's going to drive the clear market share gains that the market can sort of view to really get a gauge on the level of top line growth and incremental profitability that can come from all these investments. I guess we're just trying to get a feel for when we're going to hit the tipping point and really see those market share gains accelerate if that question makes sense."

And obviously, technology spend and investment in digitization has been ongoing for us. As I look at the operational results and the financial results, I believe that we're seeing some of those things today. We're certainly creating value in new ways for both customers and carriers, some of the NAST productivity information that we provide in the deck certainly speaks to the productivity uplift that we've gotten within that, whether it be shipments per person per day or that NPI, the NAST productivity index. I believe that we've spent the last several quarters really building capabilities and different digital capabilities and different digital products. And today, we're really pushing for broad adoption of that. I mean I've talked in my prepared comments around the ability to leverage our proprietary pricing engine that's driven by algorithms and models against our customers. I mean today, virtually almost every single customer of Robinson's can now access that pricing engine, either through the web portal, whether through freight quote or direct to their TMS or ERP, the fully automated bookings, the digital freight matching that's occurring on the carrier side, well over 290,000 fully automated truckload bookings. That's not only a big productivity lift for us, but it's also a new way for us to attract and engage with carriers in a different way that may prefer that method of booking. So again, I go back to we're not at the finish line of either introducing new capabilities or getting those out into the wild, but I do think we're starting to see some really early stage results and impacts into the business. Just in the spot market alone with roughly 30% volume growth that we had this quarter. A lot of that was driven through those digital pricing engines and connections. So I think we're in a good place, Jack. Again, as I said in the prepared remarks, adding Arun Rajan, a really strong product leader with a lot of experience, a true digital native platform companies. I look at that as a really strategic move for us to help accelerate and to help us be even better there."

What I would tell you, and again, I'm going to flip, Ravi, back to adjusted gross for actual just net revenue or AGP dollars per load. And I would tell you, in the second quarter, our net revenue per load is basically right at the midpoint of our 5- and 10-year trailing averages, right? Now clearly, back half of '18, front half of '19, we saw outsized margins when costs started to drop against our contract business. We've got a whole bunch of customers that are at those 8% to 10% margins today, and they're highly profitable relationships for us because they're highly digitized, highly connected, highly automated on both the front end with the customer and the back end with the carrier. So I really think that, that 8% to 10% margin range that you talk about is so dependent upon mix, right? Because if I can have a highly efficient customer relationship that's integrated via API on the customer side and integrated with carriers in the backside, you can run that business profitably all day long at mid-single digit, high single-digit margins. But if you've got a lot of labor, a lot of work that needs to go into carrier procurement, a lot of issues with shipping and receiving, that's not 8% to 10% business in my imagination. I think there's so many variables that go into that, it's not going to be. Now clearly, we're taking steps to digitize both in the front end and the back end, front end with the customer, back end with the carrier that drive greater efficiency and allow us to think differently about that. But ultimately, what as we think about our operating expenses and our cost to serve, we are sitting here running a whole bunch of what-if scenarios of what if it's 8%, what if it's 10%, what if it stays at 15%, but we want to ensure that we've got the right operating model that we can survive and thrive regardless of what happens because a lot of that is outside of our control as witnessed this quarter just by the rapid run-up in cost and sales."

Or just wanted to offer that as a question, given it seems the market's changed. And then I guess if you'll allow me a second one in terms of what 2 for 1. But in the forwarding, I don't think you get a lot of credit for the strong results in forwarding because I think people don't believe that it's going to persist.

On the contract side, on the truckload piece, clearly, we're working to shape that portfolio today, right? And that -- we shape that portfolio based on how we go to market, how we respond pricing to those bids. As I said in my prepared comments, I think it's 40% of our awards during the quarter were for the shorter term, 3 and 6 -months agreements. We're doing a lot of things with customers today where we're not in a spot or contract per se, but kind of in that in-between space where we're keeping that customer out of the spot, it's slightly beneficial to us. It derisks things for the customer. It derisks things for us as well. So we're getting pretty creative around pricing because to your point, the volatility that has existed in the market from '17 to today is unprecedented certainly. But moving to a true 50-50, I think disadvantages us because really 85% of truckload freight in a typical market is moving under contract terms. And so we really want access to that. We think that we're really good at serving customers in that contractual arrangement we can look and feel like a large asset and aggregate all of the independent owner operators under a single technology umbrella and bring to life the capacity there that most customers wouldn't -- they're not built to access on their own. So I don't know that we'll ever get to 50-50 on a sustained level, but we do consistently work to shape the kind of the makeup of the contract versus spot. 
On the forwarding side, I think it was at this point last year that everyone was kind of saying there's no way that Robinson is going to comp 104% growth in airfreight in the future. This must be transitory. And we just did. And so we don't see anything fundamentally changing in the air and ocean markets between now and Chinese New Year at a minimum. What I would just really reinforce is there's so much work that Mike Short and his leadership team in forwarding have done over the course of the last couple of years. We've challenged our own internal beliefs of how we can scale that business of what the returns can be in that business. And with modest, I would call modest headcount increases in the business over the course of the last couple of years, we've increased volumes significantly and certainly increased the revenue significantly. So there's been a lot of commercial activity that's occurred. We've added a lot of new logos to that business. We're a better forwarder today, I believe, than we were 2 years ago based on the scale that we've created. And that market does just continue to be so dislocated that shippers that were typically BCOs that weren't working with NBOs are now bringing NVOs into the mix to manage through that. So I'm not a prognosticator of exactly what the size of that business is 24 months from now or 36 months from now. But I really believe that there's a lot of sustainability of the results that we're delivering and forwarding both on -- because of the cycle and also the work that's been done there and the investments around technology and investments in talent on a global basis."

And between 2017 and today, there have just been too many instances where 30 days after implementation, routing guides are failing, acceptance levels are low or the inverse of that, like happened in '18 and to '19, you end up disadvantaged as a shipper and you're paying rates well over the market. And so I do think that there's going to continue to be an adjustment and a derisking on both sides because it's -- with the volatility that's been there, it's unrealistic for a shipper to think that they're going to hand over a 12-month contract at a price when you've got this much volatility and transfer that risk. And likewise, a carrier is simply not going to take that amount of risk on when the markets are moving as quickly as they are. So I do think that we're finding different ways to approach pricing and to get pretty creative to find solutions that are winning in the market for large blocks of freight that are helping to ship -- helping shippers to deal with the volatility."

But as you start to see the potential for rates level off potentially in the back half of the year, the sort of shorter-term purchase to pricing, the better contract versus spot mix, it would seem that you'd be able to see some sequential improvement in margins. I want to make sure I'm understanding the comments you made before where you were saying that you don't expect necessarily to see that until you see rates down on a year-over-year basis?

I made comments that we've been in this process of repricing. We've been focused on taking negative loads out. I will tell you, we are still at an elevated level around negative loads in our contract business. On a quarterly basis, if you look 2012 to today, we normally average, I don't know, $20 million roughly of negative files on a quarterly basis. We're at about $60 million this quarter. So there is a $40 million delta between what normal looks like in second quarter of this year, just in our contractual business. And so that is the opportunity that we continue to pursue. You start taking that over the course of the year and start to get some big numbers pretty quickly. So we continue to work on that opportunity to pursue the way to improve the profitability in that contractual business. That, I would tell you is probably the biggest difference. If you can take that down to operating margin, you can take that down to net revenue margin, but that's probably the biggest difference between the front end of '18 and today, is just the existence of the spot market margins are roughly the same, but the contractual margins are far lower right now than they were then just because of the existence of those negative loads.

And in the context of that, when I talk about products, I'm really talking about customer and carrier-facing technology, right, the extension of the Navisphere platform and how that intersects with our customers and our carriers. Arun has got extremely deep product knowledge and his leadership experience is going to be invaluable for us as we drive really that next generation of innovation here at Robinson and throughout the industry. The Chief Product Officer position is one that I've been considering for quite some time and have been looking for the right talent to add to our team. But it was really critical that I found the right person because I really see this as a fairly transformational step for our organization. And Arun and me getting to know him over the course of this process, I really found to be quite a transformational leader. He's got this long history of developing and deploying products that really enrich customer experience and create value at industry-leading digital-first platform companies. So in his role here at Robinson, he will lead all of our global product development and innovation across the entire Navisphere platform and how that intersects with again, our customers and carriers. 
In terms of it being a signal to adjacencies or looking at M&A in other areas, I certainly wouldn't read through it in that respect. So it's really about creating the product organization and organizing ourselves effectively around those products as we were in the market."

I mean on a net revenue per business day, the numbers are pretty similar. The growth rates are probably a little bit higher in July than they were in June, just given the comparisons. So let's talk about the operating margin. As I was thinking we might get this question, I was trying to think about. We often get the question of how does it compare to previous times in the cycle. And so just as a point of comparison, second quarter of 2018 and second quarter of this year. And if you go back in time, at that time, for the second quarter of '18, NAST was at like 41%, Forwarding was at 20.7%, and overall, we were at 32.6%. Today, NAST is at 34.6%, forwarding at 45.3% and we're at 34.8%. So our operating margin as an enterprise today is actually better today than it was in what I would consider kind of a similar time in the cycle. In terms of where we can go, I still believe that upper 30s and 40 is an opportunity for NAST. We're certainly engineering our cost structure to be able to get there. And the biggest factor there is net revenue dollars per truckload, right? That's what moves -- that's what is going to be the biggest mover of that. But we're certainly doing a lot of things in the cost structure to try to get back to close to 40% operating margins in NAST. We said for a long time that our goal is to move the forwarding business to 30% operating margins. And now all of a sudden, we've shown ourselves that we can do 45%, right? And so I'd say we'll still guide towards that 30% range for forwarding, but the sustainability of our current margins, we'll continue to look at and could reserve the right to revisit the kind of the guidance, if you will, for that forwarding business. But if we can keep the enterprise in that mid-30s range, we think that, that is consistent with past quarters and certainly very feasible for us."

This is probably a similar question to what some of the others have been getting to, but if I could just maybe be a little blunt about it.

But market volatility is theoretically a good thing for brokers over the cycle. And if I look back over the previous cycle, it just doesn't seem like we've really seen that. So you've got a market that's really tight. The cycle is probably longer than a normal one. You're providing a ton of value to your customer.

And in the spot market, grew our truckload volume by over 30%, which is really in line with what I've seen a lot of other companies that are more focused on the spot market, brokerage have delivered very similar results. Our focus on the contractual business, as I said earlier, I think the 85% of the freight that moves in the contracts is a market that we want to be in. We want to participate in that through cycles. Why is it that we're still having a high degree of negative loads in that business. look, we forecasted where we thought this year was going to go, but we didn't expect 42% increase, 47% increase in carrier costs of higher in the second quarter. And so we've got to deliver results for multiple stakeholders, our shareholders, certainly but our customers are what ultimately create the value for our shareholders. And so I'm a firm believer that we need to do our best to manage our commitments to those relationships through cycles because it pays dividends in the long term. When I look at our top 500 customers that make up close to 50% of our revenue and see the retention rates that we have with those customers of 99% to 100% in any given year, I think that's a testament as to why we take the positions we do with those customers because we try to take the long-term view."

So the blend between technology plus having a global suite of services, our ability to go into a customer and offer them a leading global forwarding product, a leading surface transportation product. The -- what is -- I believe our LTL business would be equivalent to the fifth or sixth largest asset-based LTL carrier, and we don't own a truck or a warehouse. I mean that's a $3 billion business.

The third quarter was another quarter of progress and strong execution, resulting in record quarterly financial results. The trajectory of our business is heading in the right direction as we continue to leverage our tech plus strategy to help customers navigate through an extremely challenging and capacity-constrained environment, which we expect to continue. Demand for our global suite of services and for the benefit of our powerful technology platform continues to be strong and the digitization efforts continue to take hold and be ingrained in an increasing percentage of our business.
In our North American truckload business, we've made steady progress in a sustained tight capacity environment. Through the continued repricing of our contractual portfolio and higher volumes of spot business, our adjusted gross profit or AGP per truckload returned to our 5-year average. And our AGP per mile in Q3 exceeded both our 5-year and 10-year averages. We accomplished this while growing our truckload volume 4.5% year-over-year and 3.5% on a sequential basis.
Within the quarter, we saw an acceleration of truckload volume per business day in each month of the quarter, with 7% year-over-year growth in September, and that growth trend has continued into October. For the quarter, NAST truckload drew AGP by $83 million or 36% year-over-year through a 4.5% increase in volume and a 30% increase in AGP per load. This included a 14% increase in spot market volume year-over-year due in part to an 85% increase in volume that was driven through our proprietary dynamic pricing engine, which is now on pace to generate $1 billion in spot truckload freight for the year. Nearly half of our spot or transactional business was priced via integration with our dynamic pricing engine in the third quarter, delivering real-time pricing capacity assurance from the largest network of truckload capacity in North America.
We closed the quarter with an approximate mix of 60% contractual volume and 40% transactional volume, which is consistent with our mix in the year ago period. Our average truckload linehaul cost per mile paid to our carriers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 26% compared to the third quarter of last year. Our average line haul rate billed to our customers, again, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 27% year-over-year. This resulted in the highest cost and price per mile on record. And a 33% year-over-year increase in our NAST truckload adjusted gross profit per mile. This, combined with a 2% decrease in the average length of haul resulted in a 30% increase in AGP per truckload.
During the quarter, we saw routing guide depth of tender in our managed services business increased slightly from 1.6 in June to 1.7 in September, indicating a slight deterioration of shipper routing guide performance during the quarter. Given the current structural constraints around expansion of truckload supply, coupled with the continued strong demand as we head into the holiday season, we expect capacity to remain tight, and we expect to perform well in that environment with over half of our contractual truckload business stated to reprice in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next.
During the third quarter, we continued our effort to expand our carrier network, and we launched an effort to recognize truck drivers for their extraordinary efforts, and we had incredible engagement. This led to a new record of 9,500 new carrier sign-ups and increased utilization of our carrier technology and apps. Our NAST LTL business grew adjusted gross profits by $14 million or 12% year-over-year. This was delivered through a 1% increase in volume and a 10.5% increase in adjusted gross profit per order. This increase in volume was on top of a 13.5% volume growth in the comparable quarter last year. Overall demand in the LTL market remains strong, driven by growth in e-commerce, resulting in capacity remaining at a premium. Our value proposition in LTL continues to resonate with shippers of all sizes across multiple industry verticals.
Turning now to our Global Forwarding business. The third quarter was our sixth consecutive quarter of strong year-over-year growth in total revenues, AGP and operating income. Based on low inventory to sales ratios and the robust pipeline of business from new and existing customers, we believe the strength in this business will continue into 2022.
In our ocean forwarding business, we grew our adjusted gross profit by $126 million or 142% year-over-year. This came through a 12% increase in shipments and a 116% increase in adjusted gross profit per shipment. Demand continues to be stronger than what the overall industry can meet with limited vessel and container capacity. And although some ports are working to implement expanded operating hours, other market constraints such as the shortage of truck drivers, drainage capacity and inland warehouse space continue to be bottlenecks, and port congestion is likely to continue into 2022.
Our forwarding team has done a great job of strengthening our carrier relationships and procuring incremental capacity to best serve our customers as well as working with shippers to better plan their shipping needs and to consider ultimate modes or ports.
Finally, our international air freight business delivered adjusted gross profit growth of $26 million or 76% year-over-year. This was driven by a 51% increase in metric tons shipped and a 17% increase in adjusted gross profit per metric ton. Demand for air freight remains incredibly strong, partially driven by continued conversions of some ocean freight to air. Air freight capacities continue to be strained and we continue to position charter flight capacity to support demand from both new and existing customers.
The forwarding team is continuing to add new commercial relationships with strategic multinational customers that are leading to increased award sizes while also ensuring that our existing customers have access to the capacity that they need to meet their needs. Our customers and our results are benefiting from the investments that we've made in digitization, data and analytics as well as our global network that's supporting our expanded geographical and vertical presence. We believe that these strategies and competitive advantages of C.H. Robinson will enable us to create more value for customers and in turn, win more business, sustain the market share gains that we've achieved and deliver solid returns for our shareholders.
Our digital investments continue to deliver customer value and unlock growth in new and exciting ways. The latest example of this is our introduction of market rate IX during the quarter. This brings pricing transparency to shippers by allowing them to compare their rates to the market averages and then using the information advantage of C.H. Robinson break down their rates to see potential savings opportunities. When we bring these Robinson Labs innovations to the market, we see increased engagement with our customers, higher win rates with those customers that are truly realizing the value from these new products. As I mentioned earlier, the amount of volume that's being delivered through our real-time dynamic pricing tools has grown significantly. Enabling these digital connections improves efficiencies for our customers, improves our response time for quote requests and improves our win rates.
We also continue to add digital connections with our customers at an accelerated pace with 100 new customers connected via TMS and ERP connections in the third quarter of 2021. The number of daily and monthly average users across our customer and carrier-facing platforms also continues to grow. With 24% year-over-year growth in daily average users of our carrier platforms as we continue to deliver new capabilities and benefits to our carriers through both the web and mobile versions of Navisphere Carrier and Driver. During the quarter, we had over 340,000 fully automated bookings in our NAST truckload business, which was an increase of nearly 80% year-over-year.
And finally, as it relates to productivity, we've again highlighted a couple of key metrics for NAST in our earnings presentation. During the third quarter, we invested in hiring and building our bench to support growth. On a year-to-date basis, we continue to show year-over-year improvement productivity, as indicated by the 880-point favorable spread in our NAST productivity index, which represents the difference between the year-over-year change in NAST volume and the change in NAST headcount.
Shipments per person per day is another metric that clearly shows the relationship between the timing of our increased digital investments and the impact to NAST productivity with an over 25% increase in productivity since the beginning of the increased investment period. We are encouraged with the progress that we're making on our digital investments and the impacts that these investments are delivering to our customers, for our carriers and the impact to our overall results. Across our global suite of services, we believe that our tech plus strategy that combines our tailored market-leading technology solutions with our global network of logistics experts and an information advantage created from our scale and our data is the right strategy and one that is aligned to the needs of our shippers and partners as we help them to navigate these highly disrupted markets and deliver for their customers.
I'll now turn the call to Mike to review the specifics of our third quarter financial performance."

Total company AGP also improved by 13% sequentially and 33% over the prepandemic quarter of Q3 2019.
On a monthly basis compared to 2020, our total company AGP per business day improved in each sequential month of the quarter and was up 51% in July, up 39% in August and up 40% in September. For the fifth consecutive quarter, prices and costs rose across our North American truckload business with cost per mile and price per mile each reaching new highs in each month of Q3 due to the persisting supply-demand imbalance. Our NAST team navigated through this environment by continuing to grow spot volume, which was up approximately 14% year-over-year in Q3, marking the fifth quarter of double-digit spot market volume growth.
Within our contractual freight business, where Q3 volume was flat, we continue to selectively reprice the portfolio to reflect the ever-increasing cost of purchased transportation in this market. As Bob mentioned, our Q3 truckload AGP per mile is now above both our 5-year and 10-year averages. AGP per mile and AGP per load are key metrics in our truckload business rather than an AGP margin percentage, which naturally rises or falls with the changing market cycle pricing. For those following AGP margin percentage, if or when the market loosens within the current cycle, with the greater than 2/3 of our truckload volume on 12-month contracts, we would expect to see AGP margin percent expansion as we typically have in the past.
We continue to focus on overall AGP dollar growth by optimizing volume and AGP per shipment across our service offerings. With enhanced customer focus and digital investments, we expect to drive long-term growth and efficiency into our model.
Now turning to expenses. Q3 personnel expenses were $399.9 million up 32% compared to Q3 of last year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs and the impact of short-term pandemic-related cost reductions in Q3 of last year. Our Q3 average headcount increased 7.1% compared to Q3 last year. Despite the tight labor market, we successfully hired the talent we need to support our growth expectations, particularly in Global Forwarding and NAST.
Given the increase in incentive compensation resulting from our profit expectations for 2021 and the additional headcount, we now expect 2021 personnel expenses to be in the $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion range, which is up from our prior expectations of $1.42 billion to $1.48 billion.
Q3 SG&A expenses of $133.5 million were up 13% compared to Q3 of 2020, primarily due to the impact of short-term pandemic-related cost reductions in Q3 of last year. We continue to expect 2021 total SG&A expenses to be approximately $0.5 billion, including approximately $90 million to $95 million of depreciation and amortization.
Our Q3 income from operations was a quarterly record at $310.8 million, up 85% versus Q3 last year, and our adjusted operating margin of 36.8% was up 820 basis points compared to last year and up 510 basis points from the prepandemic quarter of Q3 2019.
Third quarter interest and other expense totaled $16.7 million, up approximately $9.2 million versus Q3 last year due primarily to the impact of currency revaluation. Q3 results included a $3.8 million loss on currency revaluation compared to a $3.3 million gain in Q3 last year. Interest expense was also up $1.2 million due to the higher average debt balance.
Our Q3 tax rate came in at 16.0%, our second lowest tax rate on record, which was only eclipsed by the 15.1% rate from Q3 last year. This year's Q3 rate was lower than our expectations, primarily due to the favorable mix of foreign earnings and U.S. tax incentives. We are now expecting our 2021 full year effective tax rate to be 18% to 19% compared to our prior estimate of 20% to 22%.
Q3 net income was $247.1 million, up 81% compared to Q3 last year and diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record at $1.85, up 85% versus Q3 last year.
Turning to cash flow. Q3 cash flow used by operations was approximately $74 million compared to $169 million used in Q3 last year. Sequentially, cash flow from operations declined by $223 million, driven primarily by a $679 million sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets and partially offset by a $267 million increase in total accounts payable and the $247 million in net income. In Q3, accounts receivable and contract assets were up 19.6% sequentially, while total revenue was up 13.2%. The resulting 3.9 day increase in days sales outstanding, or DSO, was driven primarily by the mix shift associated with higher revenue growth in Global Forwarding where our DSO runs approximately double that of our NAST business.
While our accounts receivable balance has grown, we are not seeing quality issues as our percentage past due and credit losses have both improved compared to our 3-year averages. Over the long term, we expect AGP growth to outpace working capital growth. Capital expenditures were $22.7 million in Q3, up from $15.2 million in Q3 last year. We now expect our technology-driven 2021 capital expenditures to be $70 million to $80 million, up from our previous expectation of $55 million to $65 million.
We returned approximately $237 million of cash to shareholders in Q3 through a combination of $168 million of share repurchases and $69 million of dividends. That level of cash returned to shareholders represents a 230% increase versus Q3 last year when we were not repurchasing shares out of an abundance of caution due to the pandemic. During Q3 this year, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares at an average price of $90.58. At the end of Q3, we had approximately 3.2 million shares of capacity remaining on our 15 million share repurchase authorization from May of 2018.
Our cash balance at the end of Q3 was $203 million, down $41 million compared to Q3 of 2020, and we continue to work down our cash balance through efficient repatriation of excess cash from foreign entities with the end goal of carrying only the cash we need to fund operations. We ended Q3 with $571 million of liquidity comprised of $368 million of committed funding under our credit facility, which matures in October of 23 and our Q3 cash balance. Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.73 billion, up $633 million versus Q3 last year, driven primarily by increased working capital and share repurchases.
Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q3 was 1.39x, up sequentially from 1.25x at the end of Q2. From a capital allocation standpoint, we continue to be committed to disciplined capital stewardship maintaining an investment-grade credit rating and generating sustainable long-term growth in our total shareholder returns.
Overall, our NAST team made progress towards our truckload volume growth expectations. As you saw in Q3, the percentage increase in price per mile was higher than the percent increase in cost per mile for the first time in 9 quarters. While there is no telling where the market is headed, inflections like we saw in Q3 have historically led to periods with our highest AGP margins. The Global Forwarding team continued to generate significant earnings while building on a solid foundation for future growth. The expanded global team with upgraded tech and more uniform operations across the globe, is now onboarding its strongest pipeline of new customers.
Thank you for listening this afternoon. And I'll turn the call back over to Bob now for his final comments."

I'll take a couple of minutes here and wrap up our prepared comments before we turn it back to the operator for our live Q&A.

I'll take a couple of minutes here and wrap up our prepared comments before we turn it back to the operator for our live Q&A. I believe that our results once again this quarter continue to demonstrate that our model is working and that our strategy is sound. There's no question that we're in a time of unprecedented supply chain disruption across the globe that reaches virtually every mode of transportation. I believe that Robinson continues to be uniquely positioned to help customers not only navigate this environment, but to succeed in this environment.
None of us know exactly when the cycle is going to begin to turn or how long it will last. But with everything that we see today, we believe that this cycle will, in fact, extend due to the global constraints around adding capacity and labor while demand remains strong. I certainly don't believe that having 70 ships anchored in Los Angeles is by any stretch the new normal, but I also don't see us reverting to a market resembling 2019 anytime soon.
As referenced on Slide 3 of our earnings deck, one of the pillars of our tech plus strategy is our people. Our customers continue to tell us that our team around the globe are the people that they rely on. As I've said before, I believe that the people at Robinson is the most capable team of supply chain experts in the world. And I'm incredibly proud of how this team has continued to help thousands of customers navigate this environment while also delivering record financial results for our shareholders.
These past couple of years have been stressful times to work in the supply chain. In many parts of the world, we continue to work in a primarily remote environment. We're certainly hopeful to start getting more people back in the office into a hybrid model as soon as we begin to see the Delta variant begin to fade. Solving for the complexities of today's supply chain issues is not a 9 to 5 job it's 24/7/365. And I want to again recognize and thank our people for the great work that they're doing.
In a time where labor participation rates are low and companies across the globe are challenged to have team members, we were able to grow the size of our team to support our customers and to fuel our future growth. People are choosing to join Robinson today because of the strength of our global brand and the opportunities that we offer for both personal and professional growth.
As I close out my prepared remarks, I'd like to reference Slide 6 in our earnings deck. For those of you that have been following us for a while, you know that a decade ago or so, we were primarily known as a North American truckload brokerage company. In 2012, we had a belief that strategically it would be important for our future to have a more balanced portfolio of services. We believe at that time that supply chains will continue to become more global. And then if we had a strong Global Forwarding business to complement our industry-leading North American Surface Transportation business, we can really hold a unique position in the marketplace and bring a more comprehensive solution to life for our customers, which would in turn drive growth by connecting supply chains across the globe.
We also believe that if we execute that effectively, we can create a business with operating margins in line with other industry-leading forwarders that could help us to offset some of the cyclicality in our core truckload brokers business, and we could deliver more consistent results to our shareholders. At that time, prior to the acquisition of Phoenix International, Forwarding represented around $150 million of adjusted gross profit. And I guess at the time, we called it net revenue and that was less than 10% of our enterprise net revenue and contributed very little to operating income. Since that time, we've made a string of strategic acquisitions in the forwarding space, and we've delivered strong organic growth and execution while creating a single global operating model supported by our Navisphere technology platform. Today, we're the #1 NVOCC in the Transpacific Eastbound trade lane and a Top 5 NVOCC in the entire global ocean freight industry, while we've also driven strong growth in both air and customs.
Our successful execution of this strategy, along with favorable tailwinds in the marketplace has allowed us to deliver on a trailing 12-month basis over $944 million in Global Forwarding AGP and $422 million in operating income. Global Forwarding now represents 37% of our total company AGP for the past quarter, while we delivered 97% growth in AGP and an operating margin of over 53%.
And looking at the left side of that slide, we have 0 in on mask a little bit. We stated that we'll continue to pursue profitable market share growth within this business, which we achieved again this quarter. Volumes increased both year-over-year and sequentially. Within NAST, we've spoken extensively about our investments in technology as we transition to more of a digitally-led company. And you can see here the multiple proof points to our advances in technology and the evolution of our business process are driving successful outcomes.
Our NAST business is healthy today, and the pace of evolution to our business model continues to accelerate. In today's environment of global supply chain disruption, customers are looking for solutions that span the globe and cross all modes. An ocean freight solution alone doesn't solve for the problem that customers are facing, neither as a stand-alone truckload or an LTL solution. And we continue to be uniquely positioned to serve customers during this time of disruption and beyond to orchestrate end-to-end supply chain success for these customers. So just as we believed in 2012, we continue to believe today. Our ability to deliver a global suite of services fueled by great people supported by industry-leading technology and information advantage that's unmatched due to the scale on the $26 billion in freight under management that we have matters. And I'm confident that it's going to continue to drive our growth in the future.
Going forward, we're going to continue to leverage the strength of this diversified non-asset-based business model that delivers strong returns on investment -- invested capital. We'll stay the course with our strategy of pursuing market share gains that align with our profitability expectations and we'll continue to invest back into the business to drive innovation, improve service to our customers and carriers and to drive growth across all of our global suite of modes and services.
So this concludes our prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the live Q&A portion of the call."

Thanks for the question, Tom. I guess I'd maybe reiterate my closing comments there, and we tend to look at the sum of the parts here, and we feel pretty good about the fact that we just delivered enterprise operating margins that are the highest that we've delivered since the third quarter of 2016.
Specific to NAST, there's really 2 things at play there. The first is, is the increased investment in technology and the investments that goes with that, whether it's expensed or capitalized, comes prior to some of the benefits that we've gained for a couple of years into this journey of increased investments. And we haven't fully harnessed the impacts of the business from those because we're continuing to drive adoption, both internally and with our carrier partners. We talked a lot about connectivity and connectivity is really to me, the thing that eliminates the friction from these transactions and allows us to drive greater efficiency. When I think about our transactional pricing engine being up to the level it is some 85% year-over-year. That's a great example of us taking friction out and driving better outcomes.
The second area that is weighing on the operating margins today is still the higher level of negative loads in our truckload business. While we improved that on a year-over-year basis by about 390 basis points or about $12 million, it was pretty consistent from Q2 into Q3. And so not that you can just net out one variable. But if you netted out those negative loads and they look more like historical averages, you would see operating margins that look very similar to what we've experienced in the past in NAST."

We talked about a 25% increase in shipments per person per day. I think that's an important proof point of the productivity that we're gaining. The automated bookings is something that we've talked about consistently, arguably. And I would venture to guess the number of automated bookings that we have there, $340,000 in a quarter likely exceeds any of the ""digital upstarts"" in terms of their total load volume for a quarter. And so I do think that we are making progress here. The biggest weight and the biggest drag on operating margins relative to past quarters has been those 2 factors of the increased technology investment and the negative lows on truckload. And there are 2 things that we anticipate gaining better value from that technology as time goes on as well as narrowing the scope of those negative loads as markets continue to settle. We'll reprice about half of our contractual truckload base in Q4 and Q1 of this year. And I really see the market going in a couple of different directions.
I take scenario A, we maintain at this kind of current status of tight markets at elevated prices. And if that's the case, then we'll reprice accordingly, and we should eliminate some of those negative loads and settled in at a certain net revenue or AGP per shipment. The other side of that is that potentially the market starts to cool down and you see margin expansion in that model. I don't anticipate that we're going to continue to see year-on-year increases at the same rate that we have over the past couple of quarters in terms of cost of purchase transportation."

But we certainly show one that we've got the capability of delivering operating margins well in excess of that. I won't try to forecast how, where or when the cycle on the forwarding side ends, but there's been a lot of conversation here as of late around ports and keeping some select ports open 24/7. That is one node within the overall supply chain, but it is not -- while it's an important one. I think we have certainly domestically with labor participation and truck driver shortage, warehouse. That labor issue permeates throughout the entire supply chain in order to get to more normalized levels there. So again, I won't try to prognosticate when and how this ends.

We've delivered the change there based on, yes, the opportunities that we've taken in the spot market and also the selective repricing activities that we've done within our contractual portfolio. We've continued to take the long gain on our contractual strategic customers, right? And so there are customers, I can tell you within the portfolio today that in the third quarter, we lost maybe on 20% of their loads or 25% of their loads, but they're really important customers for us that have been with us for 20 years that we know that we have an opportunity to reprice the business with them in the fourth quarter. And so some might say we should have been really aggressive in the third quarter to go in and whack those losses in order to drive those losses out in the short term, but we believe that, that would have a very negative implication for us in the fourth quarter and moving forward for the next 4 quarters. And so we continue to take the long gain with those customers. And so I do expect to see this type of trend continuing and the difference in the year-over-year change in rate and cost. And if we can get this a more stable tight market, I think we have that opportunity."

And I guess I think adjusted gross profit per load was at a high level. I think it was above your longer-term averages. But when you look at sort of an operating income on a per load basis, how does that compare? I just want to get a sense of what you're actually getting that leverage dropping to the bottom line?

So on our NAST business, we have increased heads slightly in that business. And that's really -- as we've looked at procuring capacity and making sure that we're taking bottlenecks out of the system, we've taken up heads to get ourselves aligned with where we feel like long-term growth is there. So that's a little bit of the increase. But we're also seeing increases because of personnel expense. And that is on the back of incentive for the most part. And that's where our folks are paid an incentive on enterprise results. We're seeing a pretty significant increase overall. If you take that question to the enterprise level, we showed you the personnel expense of $97 million. Over half of that was incentive. An inside incentive is equity, it's commissions and bonus. And then probably also should note, true to NAST and to the enterprise, another 1/4 of that increase year-over-year in personnel expense is a result of short-term savings that we had a year ago. And so obviously, we didn't expect those to continue. And so getting back to a more normalized level, that's a little over 1/4 of that increase and then head count makes up the difference there on the personnel side.
So we think we're in a better position now going forward. But as we roll into next year, those outsized incentive payments will be a tailwind for us as we get back to targets."

There are opportunities to potentially enhance technology or drive growth or think differently about how we transform ourselves through acquisition. So the great thing about being C.H.

So I appreciate the comments that these are good customers, but once they sharing some of the disruption in the cost that you're seeing here. So maybe you can just address that one more time for me. And then if you want to weave in some comments on how you think this is going to -- I think the cycle is going to change these relationships going forward, maybe more shorter contracts, more visibility on pricing indices that you kind of mentioned already, but it sounds like despite all this, you're still looking at 2/3 of your booked annual. So I appreciate any thoughts there."

So let's talk about the -- we'll start with the negative files. And here's how I think about this. I think our managed services business makes -- is a great proxy for us kind of what happens in the contractual marketplace. Where are we've got $6 bill",619,"Yes. So let's talk about the -- we'll start with the negative files. And here's how I think about this. I think our managed services business makes -- is a great proxy for us kind of what happens in the contractual marketplace. Where are we've got $6 billion or $7 billion in free or management today in that managed services business is just a great proxy for the contractual marketplace.
If I go back to fourth quarter of last year and call it, October, September of last year, all the way through today, we've been in this extended tight trucking environment. And presumably, there's been all sorts of bids, mini bids, repricing, reshuffling of routing guides and not just with Robinson or other brokers, but all the asset guys and everybody that's involved in the domestic surface transportation trucking business has had some sort of movement in their pricing and in their commitments and all of those things in contracts. There has been virtually no improvement in routing guide depth of tender over that 15 months. It's been 1.7, 1.6, 1.7. So I think our kind of consistent negative files is somewhat analogous to that in the fact that the market just continues to reset. We seem to be -- we've been on. It is flattening out. But we've been on this consistent year-over-year increase in cost. And we -- part of our model, good or bad, is that we typically -- we sell long and we buy short. And so when we consistently see that upward pressure on cost of buyer, we're going to have a higher occurrence of negative file.
Now clearly, this is the highest it's been and we expect that we'll draw it down. But I think that's a bit of where we are. I would be very disappointed if after the fourth quarter or into the first quarter of next year once we start repricing, if we're still having this conversation about negative files being at the same level. I expect that they will come down both sequentially and year-over-year.
In terms of some of the contract terms, yes, I think 2/3 of our business is still on 12-month terms, which is kind of is what it is. But 1/3 of our contractual business being on something other than 12-month terms is new to us. And I think it's relatively new to the industry. And so pricing transparency continues to be an important thing that we focus on. So whether it be the market rate IQ product that we launched during the quarter to give shippers visibility to how they're performing compared to industry benchmarks, but also visibility to some of their behaviors and how their behaviors are impacting the rates that they pay is probably as an important exercise for us to be consultative and help them to realize their behaviors and how they can be more effective, right, because rate per mile, you're not going to be able to negotiate it down per se very easily today. Our dynamic pricing engine that we've talked a lot about is another way for us to provide real-time pricing to customers that keep them out of the kind of the dog eat dog spot market. And we provide kind of an intermediate step between that guaranteed committed contractual business and not allowing them to fall all the way through their routing guide.
So we're spending a lot of time on trying to deliver innovative pricing solutions that are good for us and good for the customers, but that annual contract still has held up to be the main mechanism for us to price contractual freight and the main mechanism in which customers are requesting it."

Robinson Worldwide, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chuck, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The third quarter was another quarter of progress and strong execution, resulting in record quarterly financial results. The trajectory of our business is heading in the r",1538,"Thank you, Chuck, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The third quarter was another quarter of progress and strong execution, resulting in record quarterly financial results. The trajectory of our business is heading in the right direction as we continue to leverage our tech plus strategy to help customers navigate through an extremely challenging and capacity-constrained environment, which we expect to continue. Demand for our global suite of services and for the benefit of our powerful technology platform continues to be strong, and the digitization efforts continue to take hold and be ingrained in an increasing percentage of our business.
In our North American truckload business, we've made steady progress in a sustained tight capacity environment. Through the continued repricing of our contractual portfolio and higher volumes of spot business, our adjusted gross profit or AGP per truckload returned to our 5-year average. And our AGP per mile in Q3 exceeded both our 5-year and 10-year averages. We accomplished this while growing our truckload volume 4.5% year-over-year and 3.5% on a sequential basis.
Within the quarter, we saw an acceleration of truckload volume per business day in each month of the quarter, with 7% year-over-year growth in September, and that growth trend has continued into October. For the quarter, NAST truckload grew AGP by $83 million or 36% year-over-year through a 4.5% increase in volume and a 30% increase in AGP per load. This included a 14% increase in spot market volume year-over-year due in part to an 85% increase in volume that was driven through our proprietary dynamic pricing engine, which is now on pace to generate $1 billion in spot truckload freight for the year. Nearly half of our spot or transactional business was priced via integration with our dynamic pricing engine in the third quarter, delivering real-time pricing capacity assurance from the largest network of truckload capacity in North America.
We closed the quarter with an approximate mix of 60% contractual volume and 40% transactional volume, which is consistent with our mix in the year ago period. Our average truckload line-haul cost per mile paid to our carriers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 26% compared to the third quarter of last year. Our average line-haul rate billed to our customers, again, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 27% year-over-year. This resulted in the highest cost and price per mile on record, and a 33% year-over-year increase in our NAST truckload adjusted gross profit per mile. This, combined with a 2% decrease in the average length of haul, resulted in a 30% increase in AGP per truckload.
During the quarter, we saw routing guide depth of tender in our Managed Services business increase slightly from 1.6 in June to 1.7 in September, indicating a slight deterioration of shipper routing guide performance during the quarter. Given the current structural constraints around expansion of truckload supply, coupled with the continued strong demand as we head into the holiday season, we expect capacity to remain tight, and we expect to perform well in that environment with over half of our contractual truckload business stated to reprice in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next.
During the third quarter, we continued our effort to expand our carrier network, and we launched an effort to recognize truck drivers for their extraordinary efforts, and we had incredible engagement. This led to a new record of 9,500 new carrier sign-ups and increased utilization of our carrier technology and apps. Our NAST LTL business grew adjusted gross profits by $14 million or 12% year-over-year. This was delivered through a 1% increase in volume and a 10.5% increase in adjusted gross profit per order. This increase in volume was on top of a 13.5% volume growth in the comparable quarter last year. Overall demand in the LTL market remains strong, driven by growth in e-commerce, resulting in capacity remaining at a premium. Our value proposition in LTL continues to resonate with shippers of all sizes across multiple industry verticals.
Turning now to our Global Forwarding business. The third quarter was our sixth consecutive quarter of strong year-over-year growth in total revenues, AGP and operating income. Based on low inventory to sales ratios and the robust pipeline of business from new and existing customers, we believe the strength in this business will continue into 2022.
In our ocean forwarding business, we grew our adjusted gross profit by $126 million or 142% year-over-year. This came through a 12% increase in shipments and a 116% increase in adjusted gross profit per shipment. Demand continues to be stronger than what the overall industry can meet with limited vessel and container capacity. And although some ports are working to implement expanded operating hours, other market constraints such as the shortage of truck drivers, drainage capacity and inland warehouse space continue to be bottlenecks, and port congestion is likely to continue into 2022.
Our forwarding team has done a great job of strengthening our carrier relationships and procuring incremental capacity to best serve our customers as well as working with shippers to better plan their shipping needs and to consider ultimate modes or ports.
Finally, our international air freight business delivered adjusted gross profit growth of $26 million or 76% year-over-year. This was driven by a 51% increase in metric tons shipped and a 17% increase in adjusted gross profit per metric ton. Demand for air freight remains incredibly strong, partially driven by continued conversions of some ocean freight to air. Air freight capacities continue to be strained and we continue to position charter flight capacity to support demand from both new and existing customers.
The forwarding team is continuing to add new commercial relationships with strategic multinational customers that are leading to increased award sizes while also ensuring that our existing customers have access to the capacity that they need to meet their needs. Our customers and our results are benefiting from the investments that we've made in digitization, data and analytics as well as our global network that's supporting our expanded geographical and vertical presence. We believe that these strategies and competitive advantages of C.H. Robinson will enable us to create more value for customers and in turn, win more business, sustain the market share gains that we've achieved and deliver solid returns for our shareholders.
Our digital investments continue to deliver customer value and unlock growth in new and exciting ways. The latest example of this is our introduction of Market Rate IQ during the quarter. This brings pricing transparency to shippers by allowing them to compare their rates to the market averages and then using the information advantage of C.H. Robinson break down their rates to see potential savings opportunities. When we bring these Robinson Labs innovations to the market, we see increased engagement with our customers, higher win rates with those customers that are truly realizing the value from these new products. As I mentioned earlier, the amount of volume that's being delivered through our real-time dynamic pricing tools has grown significantly. Enabling these digital connections improves efficiencies for our customers, improves our response time for quote requests and improves our win rates.
We also continue to add digital connections with our customers at an accelerated pace with 100 new customers connected via TMS and ERP connections in the third quarter of 2021. The number of daily and monthly average users across our customer and carrier-facing platforms also continues to grow. With 24% year-over-year growth in daily average users of our carrier platforms as we continue to deliver new capabilities and benefits to our carriers through both the web and mobile versions of Navisphere Carrier and Driver. During the quarter, we had over 340,000 fully automated bookings in our NAST truckload business, which was an increase of nearly 80% year-over-year.
And finally, as it relates to productivity, we've again highlighted a couple of key metrics for NAST in our earnings presentation. During the third quarter, we invested in hiring and building our bench to support growth. On a year-to-date basis, we continue to show year-over-year improvement productivity, as indicated by the 880-point favorable spread in our NAST productivity index, which represents the difference between the year-over-year change in NAST volume and the change in NAST headcount. Shipments per person per day is another metric that clearly shows the relationship between the timing of our increased digital investments and the impact to NAST productivity with an over 25% increase in productivity since the beginning of the increased investment period.
We are encouraged with the progress that we're making on our digital investments and the impacts that these investments are delivering to our customers, for our carriers and the impact to our overall results. Across our global suite of services, we believe that our tech plus strategy that combines our tailored market-leading technology solutions with our global network of logistics experts and an information advantage created from our scale and our data is the right strategy and one that is aligned to the needs of our shippers and partners as we help them to navigate these highly disrupted markets and deliver for their customers.
I'll now turn the call to Mike to review the specifics of our third quarter financial performance."

As Bob mentioned, we delivered another quarter of record financial results in Q3, driven by strong performance in a favorable market as we continue to execute on our tech plus strategy.Our total company revenue",1318,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we delivered another quarter of record financial results in Q3, driven by strong performance in a favorable market as we continue to execute on our tech plus strategy.
Our total company revenue increased 48% over Q3 last year, and our adjusted gross profit, or AGP, was up 43%. Increased AGP was driven by both volume and AGP per shipment across ocean, air, truckload and LTL. Total company AGP also improved by 13% sequentially and 33% over the pre-pandemic quarter of Q3 2019.
On a monthly basis compared to 2020, our total company AGP per business day improved in each sequential month of the quarter and was up 51% in July, up 39% in August and up 40% in September. For the fifth consecutive quarter, prices and costs rose across our North American truckload business with cost per mile and price per mile each reaching new highs in each month of Q3 due to the persisting supply-demand imbalance. Our NAST team navigated through this environment by continuing to grow spot volume, which was up approximately 14% year-over-year in Q3, marking the fifth quarter of double-digit spot market volume growth.
Within our contractual freight business, where Q3 volume was flat, we continued to selectively reprice the portfolio to reflect the ever-increasing cost of purchased transportation in this market. As Bob mentioned, our Q3 truckload AGP per mile is now above both our 5-year and 10-year averages. AGP per mile and AGP per load are key metrics in our truckload business rather than an AGP margin percentage, which naturally rises or falls with the changing market cycle pricing. For those following AGP margin percentage, if or when the market loosens within the current cycle, with the greater than 2/3 of our truckload volume on 12-month contracts, we would expect to see AGP margin percent expansion as we typically have in the past.
We continue to focus on overall AGP dollar growth by optimizing volume and AGP per shipment across our service offerings. With enhanced customer focus and digital investments, we expect to drive long-term growth and efficiency into our model.
Now turning to expenses. Q3 personnel expenses were $399.9 million, up 32% compared to Q3 of last year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs and the impact of short-term pandemic-related cost reductions in Q3 of last year. Our Q3 average headcount increased 7.1% compared to Q3 last year. Despite the tight labor market, we successfully hired the talent we need to support our growth expectations, particularly in Global Forwarding and NAST.
Given the increase in incentive compensation resulting from our profit expectations for 2021 and the additional headcount, we now expect 2021 personnel expenses to be in the $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion range, which is up from our prior expectations of $1.42 billion to $1.48 billion.
Q3 SG&A expenses of $133.5 million were up 13% compared to Q3 of 2020, primarily due to the impact of short-term pandemic-related cost reductions in Q3 of last year. We continue to expect 2021 total SG&A expenses to be approximately $0.5 billion, including approximately $90 million to $95 million of depreciation and amortization.
Our Q3 income from operations was a quarterly record at $310.8 million, up 85% versus Q3 last year, and our adjusted operating margin of 36.8% was up 820 basis points compared to last year and up 510 basis points from the pre-pandemic quarter of Q3 2019.
Third quarter interest and other expense totaled $16.7 million, up approximately $9.2 million versus Q3 last year due primarily to the impact of currency revaluation. Q3 results included a $3.8 million loss on currency revaluation compared to a $3.3 million gain in Q3 last year. Interest expense was also up $1.2 million due to the higher average debt balance.
Our Q3 tax rate came in at 16.0%, our second lowest tax rate on record, which was only eclipsed by the 15.1% rate from Q3 last year. This year's Q3 rate was lower than our expectations, primarily due to the favorable mix of foreign earnings and U.S. tax incentives. We are now expecting our 2021 full year effective tax rate to be 18% to 19% compared to our prior estimate of 20% to 22%.
Q3 net income was $247.1 million, up 81% compared to Q3 last year, and diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record at $1.85, up 85% versus Q3 last year.
Turning to cash flow. Q3 cash flow used by operations was approximately $74 million compared to $169 million used in Q3 last year. Sequentially, cash flow from operations declined by $223 million, driven primarily by a $679 million sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets, and partially offset by a $267 million increase in total accounts payable and the $247 million in net income. In Q3, accounts receivable and contract assets were up 19.6% sequentially, while total revenue was up 13.2%. The resulting 3.9 day increase in days sales outstanding, or DSO, was driven primarily by the mix shift associated with higher revenue growth in Global Forwarding where our DSO runs approximately double that of our NAST business.
While our accounts receivable balance has grown, we are not seeing quality issues as our percentage past due and credit losses have both improved compared to our 3-year averages. Over the long term, we expect AGP growth to outpace working capital growth. Capital expenditures were $22.7 million in Q3, up from $15.2 million in Q3 last year. We now expect our technology-driven 2021 capital expenditures to be $70 million to $80 million, up from our previous expectation of $55 million to $65 million.
We returned approximately $237 million of cash to shareholders in Q3 through a combination of $168 million of share repurchases and $69 million of dividends. That level of cash returned to shareholders represents a 230% increase versus Q3 last year when we were not repurchasing shares out of an abundance of caution due to the pandemic. During Q3 this year, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares at an average price of $90.58. At the end of Q3, we had approximately 3.2 million shares of capacity remaining on our 15 million share repurchase authorization from May of 2018.
Our cash balance at the end of Q3 was $203 million, down $41 million compared to Q3 of 2020, and we continue to work down our cash balance through efficient repatriation of excess cash from foreign entities with the end goal of carrying only the cash we need to fund operations. We ended Q3 with $571 million of liquidity comprised of $368 million of committed funding under our credit facility, which matures in October of '23, and our Q3 cash balance. Our debt balance at quarter end was $1.73 billion, up $633 million versus Q3 last year, driven primarily by increased working capital and share repurchases.
Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q3 was 1.39x, up sequentially from 1.25x at the end of Q2. From a capital allocation standpoint, we continue to be committed to disciplined capital stewardship, maintaining an investment-grade credit rating and generating sustainable long-term growth in our total shareholder returns.
Overall, our NAST team made progress towards our truckload volume growth expectations. As you saw in Q3, the percentage increase in price per mile was higher than the percent increase in cost per mile for the first time in 9 quarters. While there is no telling where the market is headed, inflections like we saw in Q3 have historically led to periods with our highest AGP margins.
The Global Forwarding team continued to generate significant earnings while building on a solid foundation for future growth. The expanded global team, with upgraded tech and more uniform operations across the globe, is now onboarding its strongest pipeline of new customers.
Thank you for listening this afternoon. And I'll turn the call back over to Bob now for his final comments."

I'll take a couple of minutes here and wrap up our prepared comments before we turn it back to the operator for our live Q&A.I believe that our results once again this quarter continue to demonstrate that our model is working and that our",1139,"Thanks, Mike. I'll take a couple of minutes here and wrap up our prepared comments before we turn it back to the operator for our live Q&A.
I believe that our results once again this quarter continue to demonstrate that our model is working and that our strategy is sound. There's no question that we're in a time of unprecedented supply chain disruption across the globe that reaches virtually every mode of transportation. I believe that Robinson continues to be uniquely positioned to help customers not only navigate this environment, but to succeed in this environment.
None of us know exactly when this cycle is going to begin to turn or how long it will last. But with everything that we see today, we believe that this cycle will, in fact, extend due to the global constraints around adding capacity and labor while demand remains strong. I certainly don't believe that having 70 ships anchored in Los Angeles is by any stretch the new normal, but I also don't see us reverting to a market resembling 2019 anytime soon.
As referenced on Slide 3 of our earnings deck, one of the pillars of our tech plus strategy is our people. Our customers continue to tell us that our team around the globe are the people that they rely on. As I said before, I believe that the people at Robinson is the most capable team of supply chain experts in the world. And I'm incredibly proud of how this team has continued to help thousands of customers navigate this environment while also delivering record financial results for our shareholders.
These past couple of years have been stressful times to work in a supply chain. In many parts of the world, we continue to work in a primarily remote environment. We're certainly hopeful to start getting more people back in the office into a hybrid model as soon as we begin to see the Delta variant begin to fade. Solving for the complexities of today's supply chain issues is not a 9 to 5 job, it's 24/7/365. And I want to again recognize and thank our people for the great work that they're doing.
In a time where labor participation rates are low and companies across the globe are challenged to have team members, we were able to grow the size of our team to support our customers and to fuel our future growth. People are choosing to join Robinson today because of the strength of our global brand and the opportunities that we offer for both personal and professional growth.
As I close out my prepared remarks, I'd like to reference Slide 6 in our earnings deck. For those of you that have been following us for a while, you know that a decade ago or so, we were primarily known as a North American truckload brokerage company. In 2012, we had a belief that, strategically, it would be important for our future to have a more balanced portfolio of services. We believe at that time that supply chains will continue to become more global, and that if we have a strong Global Forwarding business to complement our industry-leading North American Surface Transportation business, we can really hold a unique position in the marketplace and bring a more comprehensive solution to life for our customers, which would in turn drive growth by connecting supply chains across the globe.
We also believe that if we execute in that effectively, we can create a business with operating margins in line with other industry-leading forwarders that could help us to offset some of the cyclicality in our core truckload brokerage business, and we could deliver more consistent results to our shareholders. At that time, prior to the acquisition of Phoenix International, Forwarding represented around $150 million of adjusted gross profit. And I guess at that time, we called it net revenue, and that was less than 10% of our enterprise net revenue and contributed very little to operating income.
Since that time, we've made a string of strategic acquisitions in the forwarding space, and we've delivered strong organic growth and execution while creating a single global operating model supported by our Navisphere technology platform. Today, we're the #1 NVOCC in the trans-Pacific eastbound trade lane and a Top 5 NVOCC in the entire global ocean freight industry, while we've also driven strong growth in both air and customs.
Our successful execution of this strategy, along with favorable tailwinds in the marketplace, has allowed us to deliver on a trailing 12-month basis over $944 million in Global Forwarding AGP and $422 million in operating income. Global Forwarding now represents 37% of our total company AGP for the past quarter, while we delivered 97% growth in AGP and an operating margin of over 53%.
In looking at the left side of that slide, we can zero in on NAST a little bit. We stated that we'll continue to pursue profitable market share growth within this business, which we achieved again this quarter. Volumes increased both year-over-year and sequentially. Within NAST, we've spoken extensively about our investments in technology as we transition to more of a digitally-led company. And you can see here the multiple proof points to our advances in technology and the evolution of our business process are driving successful outcomes.
Our NAST business is healthy today, and the pace of evolution to our business model continues to accelerate. In today's environment of global supply chain disruption, customers are looking for solutions that span the globe and cross all modes. An ocean freight solution alone doesn't solve for the problem that customers are facing, neither does a stand-alone truckload or an LTL solution. And we continue to be uniquely positioned to serve customers during this time of disruption and beyond to orchestrate end-to-end supply chain success for these customers. So just as we believed in 2012, we continue to believe today. Our ability to deliver a global suite of services fueled by great people supported by industry-leading technology and information advantage that's unmatched due to the scale on the $26 billion of freight under management that we have matters. And I'm confident that it's going to continue to drive our growth in the future.
Going forward, we're going to continue to leverage the strength of this diversified non-asset-based business model that delivers strong returns on investment -- invested capital. We'll stay the course with our strategy of pursuing market share gains that align with our profitability expectations, and we'll continue to invest back into the business to drive innovation, improve service to our customers and carriers and to drive growth across all of our global suite of modes and services.
So this concludes our prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the live Q&A portion of the call."

Thanks for the question, Tom. I guess I'd maybe reiterate my closing comments there, and we tend to look at the sum of the parts here, and we feel pretty good about the fact that we just delivered enterprise operating margins that are the highest that we've delivered since the third quarter of 2016.
Specific to NAST, there's really 2 things at play there. The first is the increased investment in technology and the investments that goes with that, whether it's expensed or capitalized, comes prior to some of the benefits that we've gained for a couple of years into this journey of increased investments. And we haven't fully harnessed the impacts of the business from those because we're continuing to drive adoption, both internally and with our carrier partners. We talked a lot about connectivity, and connectivity is really to me, the thing that eliminates the friction from these transactions and allows us to drive greater efficiency. When I think about our transactional pricing engine being up to the level it is some 85% year-over-year, that's a great example of us taking friction out and driving better outcomes.
The second area that is weighing on the operating margins today is still the higher level of negative loads in our truckload business. While we improved that on a year-over-year basis by about 390 basis points or about $12 million, it was pretty consistent from Q2 into Q3. And so not that you can just net out one variable. But if you netted out those negative loads and they looked more like historical averages, you would see operating margins that look very similar to what we've experienced in the past in NAST."

I mean when I saw an 880 basis point spread between head count and volume growth, that's a real accelerant. We talked about a 25% increase in shipments per person per day, I think that's an important proof point of the productivity that we're gaining. The automated bookings is something that we've talked about consistently, arguably. And I would venture to guess the number of automated bookings that we have there, 340,000 in a quarter likely exceeds any of the ""digital upstarts"" in terms of their total load volume for a quarter.
And so I do think that we are making progress here. The biggest weight and the biggest drag on operating margins relative to past quarters has been those 2 factors of the increased technology investment and the negative lows on truckload. And there are a few things that we anticipate gaining better value from that technology as time goes on as well as narrowing the scope of those negative loads as markets continue to settle. We'll reprice about half of our contractual truckload base in Q4 and Q1 of this year.
And I really see the market going in a couple of different directions. Take scenario A, we maintain at this kind of current status of tight markets at elevated prices. And if that's the case, then we'll reprice accordingly, and we should eliminate some of those negative loads and settled down at a certain net revenue or AGP per shipment. The other side of that is that, potentially, the market starts to cool down and you see margin expansion in that model. I don't anticipate that we're going to continue to see year-on-year increases at the same rate that we have over the past couple of quarters in terms of cost of purchase transportation."

There's questions, of course, on sustainability. So I'm just sort of curious if you could talk to your thoughts on whether it be operating margin in that segment. The tightness in the supply chain tightness, how long that could potentially linger and drive these outsized gains?
And then maybe more importantly, once the frenzy does die down, do you feel between market share and gaining new customers, are you at a new platform level so that even if things do die down, we're not dropping back to sort of earlier pre-COVID type of levels in terms of base level profitability?"

I don't see us going back to the base level of profitability that we demonstrated pre-COVID pre-pandemic, call it the 2018/'19 levels. I think we've done a lot. The team in forwarding has done a lot to engineer their cost structure in such a way that we can deliver improved operating margins over time. We've cited the target of 30% operating margins in that business. We haven't updated our guidance around that point. But we've certainly shown that we've got the capability of delivering operating margins well in excess of that.
I won't try to forecast how, where or when the cycle on the forwarding side ends, but there's been a lot of conversation here as of late around ports and keeping some select ports open 24/7. That is one node within the overall supply chain, but it is not -- while it's an important one, doing that alone isn't going to solve for this. And so I think we have a -- certainly domestically, but potentially globally, a real challenge with labor participation truck driver shortage, warehouse labor shortage, port labor shortage, rail yard labor shortage.
I mean the labor issue permeates throughout the supply chain, and it's really driving fluidity out, which causes many of these backups. And so I don't know what the magic bullet is, so to speak, that solves for that, Jordan, but I do believe because labor sits at the center of this in virtually every single node that it's going to be slow to develop. You look at inventory to sales ratios. And clearly, there's a lot of demand pent up behind that in order to get to more normalized levels there. So again, I won't try to prognosticate when and how this ends, but I do believe that it's going to extend for quite some time."

And so we're not experiencing the week-to-week volatility of these increases and decrease. We do seem to have found things kind of flattening out at a much higher level.
We've delivered the change there based on, yes, the opportunities that we've taken in the spot market and also the selective repricing activities that we've done within our contractual portfolio. We've continued to take the long game on our contractual strategic customers, right? And so there are customers I can tell you within the portfolio today that in the third quarter, we lost maybe 20% of their loads or 25% of their loads, but they're really important customers for us, that have been with us for 20 years, that we know that we have an opportunity to reprice the business with them in the fourth quarter.
And so some might say we should have been really aggressive in the third quarter to go in and whack those losses in order to drive those losses out in the short term, but we believe that, that would have a very negative implication for us in the fourth quarter and moving forward for the next 4 quarters. And so we continue to take the long game with those customers. And so I do expect to see this type of trend continuing and the difference in the year-over-year change in rate and cost.

And that's really -- as we've looked at procuring capacity and making sure that we're taking bottlenecks out of the system, we've taken up heads to get ourselves aligned with where we feel like long-term growth is there. So that's a little bit of the increase. But we're also seeing increases because of personnel expense. And that is on the back of incentive for the most part. And that's where our folks are paid an incentive on enterprise results. We're seeing a pretty significant increase overall.
And if you take that question to the enterprise level, we showed you the personnel expense up $97 million. Over half of that was incentive. An inside incentive is equity, it's commissions and bonus. And then probably also should note, true to NAST and to the enterprise, another 1/4 of that increase year-over-year in personnel expense is a result of short-term savings that we had a year ago. And so obviously, we didn't expect those to continue. And so getting back to a more normalized level, that's a little over 1/4 of that increase, and then head count makes up the difference there on the personnel side.
So we think we're in a better position now going forward. But as we roll into next year, those outsized incentive payments will be a tailwind for us as we get back to targets."

We really like the business that we've built in forwarding through organic and inorganic growth. And so if we've got the opportunity to continue to expand our geographic presence in that business to add additional capabilities, add density to specific trade lanes, any way that we can build scale, we're committed to looking at those opportunities.
In terms of some of the other strategic alternatives that you mentioned, I'm not in a position today to comment on some of those. But really, our goal today has been about growing that business versus any of the other alternatives that you brought up."

I'd go back to kind of the same, I guess, guidelines that I shared with the previous question, which is, one, it's got to be a strategic fit culturally and fit nicely within Robinson. There are opportunities to potentially enhance technology or drive growth or think differently about how we transform ourselves through acquisition. So the great thing about being C.H. Robinson is we do get a look at virtually everything that's in the market, at least at a cursory level, and we can determine what level of interest that we want to display in those assets.
But I think strategically, our acquisition strategy is not going to be driven by what's readily available in the market. It will be driven by the strategic needs of our business, and we will go out and seek those opportunities inorganically if we choose for that to be the right path, and we'll control that process."

And so I wish I had a whole bunch of revenue results that I can share with you, but since it's within the quarter, I wouldn't share even if I could. 
But I think the really neat thing about this partnership is SPS Commerce is a leader in their space. I mean they've got over 95,000 customers that are on their platform, that they're connecting directly into the retail ecosystem and managing the flow of information. It's such a natural marriage or a natural partnership given our strength in retail and food and beverage and having such deep knowledge of that space.
So our ability to be the LTL provider and help the customers, the shipper customers of SPS Commerce access that LTL marketplace in a fully automated way, I think, is a real win for the customers of SPS, it's an incremental opportunity for us and it helps them to strengthen their product portfolio and allows us to tap into an entire group of customers in a new and exciting way. And we continue to look at alliances and partnerships across the supply chain landscape for opportunities such as those, which is just another example of us extending the ecosystem and pursuing some of these digital initiatives to drive growth.
In terms of positioning for the peak season, it feels as though we've been in the peak season here for a number of months, maybe quarters, quite frankly. And so our job is to be really agile, to work with our customers, to help them navigate the unknowns, to be mode agnostic, to help them move, whether it be moving ports, moving modes, collaborating with other shipper customers to drive greater utilization. We just -- we work really, really closely with our shipper customers to help them be successful in this environment in a number of different ways. But as I said, it's 24/7/365 and our team around the globe is doing their best to help navigate this."

As we saw issues in Asia related to COVID, what you started to see was their plants shutting down, ports shutting down, ports being not called on for a period of time because the ships would go to another port. And so it just further exacerbated the delays that were occurring in the global freight cycle. So I can't put -- I can't quantify a number in terms of impact to earnings or impact to volume.

So let's talk about the -- we'll start with the negative files. And here's how I think about this. I think our Managed Services business makes -- is a great proxy for just kind of what happens in the contractual marketplace. Whether we've got $6 billion or $7 billion in freight under management today in that Managed Services business is just a great proxy for the contractual marketplace.
If I go back to fourth quarter of last year and call it, October, September of last year, all the way through today, we've been in this extended tight trucking environment. And presumably, there's been all sorts of bids, mini bids, repricing, reshuffling of routing guides, and not just with Robinson or other brokers, but all the asset guys and everybody that's involved in the domestic surface transportation trucking business, has had some sort of movement in their pricing and in their commitments and all of those things in contracts.
There has been virtually no improvement in routing guide depth of tender over that 15 months. It's been 1.7, 1.6, 1.7. So I think our kind of consistent negative files is somewhat analogous to that in the fact that the market just continues to reset. We seem to be -- we've been on -- it is flattening out. But we've been on this consistent year-over-year increase in cost. And we -- part of our model, good or bad, is that we -- typically, we sell long and we buy short. And so when we consistently see that upward pressure on cost of buyer, we're going to have a higher occurrence of negative file.
Now clearly, this is the highest it's been and we expect that we'll draw it down. But I think that's a bit of where we are. I would be very disappointed if after the fourth quarter or into the first quarter of next year once we start repricing, if we're still having this conversation about negative files being at the same level. I expect that they will come down both sequentially and year-over-year.
In terms of some of the contract terms, yes, I think 2/3 of our business is still on 12-month terms, which is kind of is what it is. But 1/3 of our contractual business being on something other than 12-month terms is new to us. And I think it's relatively new to the industry. And so pricing transparency continues to be an important thing that we focus on. So whether it be the Market Rate IQ product that we launched during the quarter to give shippers visibility to how they're performing compared to industry benchmarks, but also visibility to some of their behaviors and how their behaviors are impacting the rates that they pay is probably as an important exercise for us to be consultative and help them to realize their behaviors and how they can be more effective, right, because rate per mile, you're not going to be able to negotiate it down per se very easily today.
Our dynamic pricing engine that we've talked a lot about is another way for us to provide real-time pricing to customers that keep them out of the kind of the dog-eat-dog spot market. And we provide kind of an intermediate step between that guaranteed committed contractual business and not allowing them to fall all the way through their routing guide. So we're spending a lot of time on trying to deliver innovative pricing solutions that are good for us and good for the customers, but that annual contract still has held up to be the main mechanism for us to price contractual freight, and the main mechanism in which customers are requesting it."
