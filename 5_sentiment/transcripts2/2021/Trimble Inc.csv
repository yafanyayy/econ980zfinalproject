Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. In addition, please note that we will be comparing against the 2019 that had a 14th",907,"Hello, everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. In addition, please note that we will be comparing against the 2019 that had a 14th week in the fourth quarter. 
Let's start on Slide 2 with the 3 key messages we want to convey today. First, the customer ROI of our technology and the strength of our financial model enabled us to outperform our own expectations in the fourth quarter. Our customer value proposition is rooted in productivity, quality, safety, visibility and sustainability. We are pleased to announce that annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 9% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, while quarterly revenue grew 0.4% year-over-year to $830 million. Expanding gross margins and execution on costs led to adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.1%, and we finished the year delivering a record $672 million of operating cash flow. 
Second, executing the Connect & Scale 2025 strategy remains our focus. We are working to connect stakeholders across industry life cycles and to transform customer workflows while simultaneously making ourselves easier to do business with. As leaders of the business, we take our responsibility seriously to be effective allocators of capital. To this end, we will continue to invest disproportionately in our cloud and autonomy capabilities as well as in go-to-market efforts to support and enable our long-term growth opportunities. 
Third, our long-term market conviction remains strong. We believe the secular trends of digitization provide long-term tailwinds, and we maintain our result to exit this crisis on a stronger competitive footing than we entered it. 
As we come into 2021, we are both cautious and humble to recognize market uncertainty and volatility while also confident that we are on the right track. Comparisons against 2020, especially on a quarterly basis, will be difficult, if not irrelevant. We will reinstate guidance at an annual level, and David will walk you through the details. 
In addition, we anticipate hosting an Investor Day in the second half of the year to update stakeholders on our long-term strategy and business model. As I reflect back on our May 2018 Investor Day and put that into context of our fiscal year 2020, while revenue is clearly set back with the pandemic, we are ahead in most all other aspects. At the Investor Day, we targeted adjusted 2021 EBITDA at 23% to 24% of revenue. We closed 2020 at 25.3% EBITDA. We targeted 2021 software services and recurring revenue mix at 55% of total revenue. We closed 2020 at 58% of total revenue. We targeted the ratio of 2021 operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income at approximately 1.1x. We closed 2020 at 1.2x operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income. In July 2018, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood above 3x, and we said we would delever below 2.5x. Today, we stand at 1.6x. We see these as important proof points that we are on the right strategic path, that we can uniquely connect the physical and digital worlds to deliver value to our customers and that our asset-light business model works. 
Turning to my commentary on the fourth quarter. We beat our own expectations in Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial and Resources and Utilities. We hit our expectations in Transportation. Broadly speaking, we have seen signs of an emerging construction-led recovery. We are experiencing favorable market conditions in agriculture. We see innovation and go-to-market execution driving positive outcomes. And at the end of the year, we benefited from government stimulus measures, along with customers catching up on work. David will walk us through additional segment details. 
Turning to Slide 3. This shows connect and scale delivering customer ROI in transportation and agriculture. In Transportation, our Trimble dispatch adviser solutions bring capabilities across our portfolio together to get the right load on the right truck with the right driver, thereby improving planning, reducing empty miles and improving utilization. 
In agriculture, [ Salacia Agro ] is a large farm enterprise in Bulgaria that has adopted Trimble's connected farm ecosystem across 100 of their machines. This offering consists of our [ GFX 750 ] connected display and autopilot steering, along with our auto sync data exchange functionality. The connected offering improves planning, process automation and cost optimization. 
I will close my commentary on Slide 4 with an ESG update, a topic of increasing importance to all our stakeholders. As a purpose-driven company, our mission of industry transformation and our leadership culture provides a compelling ESG backdrop. In the area of environmental sustainability, I'll highlight that the primary positive impact of Trimble on greenhouse gas emission reductions and other environmental measures happens through customer application of our technology. For example, eliminating reworking construction, reducing fuel and water usage in all our end markets, and minimizing use of herbicides and pesticides in agriculture. We are also committed to developing science-based targets to further our positive impact. 
In the area of people and social responsibility, I'll highlight that we ranked in the top 10% of companies for diversity in the comparably survey. I'm also very proud of the work of the Trimble Foundation where we contributed a record amount of money to put to work for our philanthropic efforts. Finally, in the area of corporate governance, our ratings with third-party firms like MSCI are strong, and we are committed to continuous improvement in our sustainability program. 
David, over to you."

Fourth quarter total revenue was $830 million on a non-GAAP basis, up 0.4% year-over-year. To break that down, currency translation added 1%, and acquisitions, net of divestitures, were essentially neutral. Organic growth, excluding the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2019, was approximately 2%. ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, grew to $1.30 billion in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year and was up 7% on an organic basis. Organic ARR growth, excluding the transportation segment, was up 15%. Adjusted EBITDA, which includes income from our joint ventures and equity investments, was $217 million, with a margin of 26.1%, reflecting both strong gross margins and continuing low operating costs. Our non-GAAP tax rate was [ 16% ], down 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Net income was up [ 16% ], and non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.61, up 15% year-over-year. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $188 million, up 54% year-on-year, while cash flow from operations for the full year was $672 million, up 15% versus 2019. Free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures, was $177 million for the quarter, up 64% year-over-year, and $615 million for the year, up 19% versus 2019. Note that on a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was approximately 1.2x non-GAAP net income. Our strong cash flow results reflect the combination of higher profit and improved working capital efficiency. With the strong cash flow in the quarter, we continued to delever. At year-end, our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 1.6x. 
Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with flexibility to consider a range of capital allocation options. We expect to continue to delever and pursue modest share buybacks while having dry powder deployable for attractive acquisition opportunities. 
Turning to Page 6. I'd like to highlight one of the key drivers of our cash flow in the quarter, working capital. Our working capital efficiency has improved over the last 5 years. We ended the year with just over 0 net working capital. This progress was driven by a number of factors, including the growth in deferred revenue from our recurring revenue businesses, reduced sales outstanding of accounts receivable and lower inventory levels. 
Turning now to Slide 7. I'll review in a bit more detail our fourth quarter revenue trends. As I mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 9% in the quarter. Our nonrecurring revenue streams also grew driven by a strong rebound in hardware sales in geospatial, civil construction and agriculture. 
From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were down 8% driven by declines in our transportation business. Revenues in North America from businesses other than transportation grew 2%. Europe revenues were up 9%, reflecting catch up on project activity slowed earlier in 2020 and fiscal stimulus measures. Asia Pacific was the best performer in the quarter, up [ 13% ], driven by strong performance in Japan. The rest of world, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 10% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector. 
Now turning to Slide 8. I'll review briefly our full year results. Revenue for the full year 2020 contracted 4% overall and 5% organically. Gross margins for the year expanded 140 basis points, and EBITDA grew 7% on a year-over-year basis. EBITDA margins expanded 240 basis points to 25.3%. Operating income grew 7% year-over-year, and operating income margins expanded 220 basis points to 22.8%. Net income was up 12%, and earnings per share were $2.23, up 12% year-over-year. 
Next, on Slide 9, we highlight a number of key metrics, which collectively give a good picture of the state of our business. I'll highlight a few metrics, which neither Rob nor I have already mentioned. In this year of strong margins, we spent over 15% of our revenue in research and development, reflecting our continued investment in areas of strategic importance during the downturn. We ended the year with a backlog of $1.3 billion, up 11% from year ago levels. Our deferred revenue at the end of the year was $614 million, up 13% from the end of 2019. The health of our backlog and deferred revenue point to improved visibility for revenue growth heading into 2021. 
Turning now to Slide 10. Let's go through the fourth quarter revenue details at the reporting segment levels. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 1% on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of last year's extra week, organic revenue for the segment would have been up approximately 4%. Revenue growth was double-digit in both our SketchUp and civil hardware businesses. Segment margins were up 90 basis points due to higher-margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 14% on an organic basis driven principally by strong performance in our core surveying and mapping business. Revenue was up in all regions, aided by successful new products, stimulus-driven activity and healthy project tender levels as projects, which were delayed earlier in 2020, came back online. Margins were up over 9 percentage points due to a combination of higher-margin revenue mix, lower levels of discounting and strong cost control. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 10% on an organic basis driven principally by our precision agriculture business. Revenue growth was strongest outside the U.S. with higher commodity prices, stimulus programs, favorable weather and a strong reception to our new products, all contributing to growth in the quarter. Solid performance by our Cityworks business, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of last year, also contributed to segment revenue in the quarter. Margins expanded by over 5 percentage points driven by operating cost control. Transportation revenue was down 22% on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the 14th week in the fourth quarter of 2019, organic revenues were down by about 19%. Operating margins were down over 8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Our fourth quarter financial performance in transportation reflects many of the same factors we have discussed in prior quarters. 
Customer attrition in our mobility business since late 2019 accounts for the majority of the adverse development in segment revenue, ARR and margins. On that front, there is some good news as our product performance has improved and customer churn has declined sequentially in each of the last 3 quarters. Note that the ongoing subscription transition in our transportation enterprise software business depressed revenue trends in the quarter, and the [ Cubics ] acquisition had an expected dilutive impact on segment margins. 
While we have more work ahead of us to improve the performance of this business, we continue to believe in the power of our connected transportation strategy and project the steps that the team is taking now will yield improved performance later in 2021. 
Turning now to Page 11. I'd like to share with you our outlook for this year. Our planning efforts have settled on a 2021 financial outlook based on a number of key assumptions. First, we assume that public health initiatives are successful in enabling a broad reopening of constrained sectors of the economy by midyear 2021. Second, our plan is rooted in the assumption that the economy grows through the year with 2021 GDP at least recovering to 2019 levels. Third, our projections exclude the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures. 
Our most important key performance indicator will continue to be ARR. We expect organic ARR growth to end 2021 in the high single-digit range, with sequential improvement as the quarters progress. ARR growth in 2021 will be driven by the combination of organic growth of our existing recurring offerings, ongoing transitions from perpetual software products and the gradual turnaround of our transportation business. 
We project organic revenue growth in 2021 in the mid-single-digit range, with an additional 1 to 2 points of exchange rates remain near where they are today. That translates to a revenue range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Note that our revenue growth in 2021 will be negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points from our subscription model transitions. We anticipate that EBITDA and operating margins in 2021 will be higher than 2019 but lower than 2020. Overall, our gross margins this year are projected to remain stable in 2020 levels, but a number of factors are likely to cause EBITDA margins to come down somewhat when compared to the historically high levels of 2020. 
First, the return to a more normalized level of incentive compensation, and in the second half of this year, higher travel costs will naturally cause operating costs to grow at a rate faster than revenue. Second, we are incrementally allocating more capital in both CapEx and operating expense to the areas of focus in our Connect & Scale strategy, namely digital transformation, cloud infrastructure and autonomy. Third, our margins will be negatively impacted by the accelerating subscription model conversions of 150 basis points. 
I'll note that we project income from equity method investments to be approximately $35 million to $40 million and net interest expense to be about [ $65 ] million to $70 million, with decreasing levels as the year progresses. We project our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of [ 16% ] to 17%, and that our shares outstanding will be approximately $254 million. Incorporating all of these factors, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 for the full year. 
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to project that operating cash flow and free cash flow will exceed net income as the favorable cash characteristics of our business will continue. Nevertheless, cash flow will likely be flat or decline modestly from 2020 levels as we saw extraordinary improvement in working capital in late 2020. 
A few words on the segment dynamics in this outlook. Generally, we expect that each of our segments will mirror the trends I've just described, although I'll highlight a few factors specific to the individual segments. In Buildings and Infrastructure, our hardware offerings were most adversely impacted by COVID in the second quarter of 2020. So we expect growth in the second quarter of 2021 to be very strong. Our Geospatial and Resources and Utilities businesses have a lot of momentum now, and we anticipate that momentum to generate strong growth through the first half of the year with more moderate growth thereafter. In Transportation, we don't expect to see meaningful revenue growth or margin improvement until late in 2021. 
We don't intend to provide quarterly guidance at this point, but I'll offer a few comments on factors that will influence our revenue and margin performance as the year progresses. Year-on-year growth in each quarter will obviously be impacted by COVID-driven swings we've seen in 2020. We expect to grow in all 4 quarters, with the strongest growth rate in the second quarter when we lap the worst period of the COVID crisis. We expect that operating and EBITDA margins will be relatively constant across the quarters. 
Rob, back to you for closing comments."

So let's start in B&I, if we run through the outlook and what we're hearing from some of the different constituents in -- throughout the chain. I'd start with saying that the outlook is pretty good. There are a few exceptions, but the outlook is pretty good. If we look at the type of work, Infrastructure and Residential backlogs are improving. EPC is down, so that's going to relate to oil and gas multi-sector, which picks up commercial work, that looks flat to down. And not surprisingly, retail is down, and elements such as data centers and logistics centers are up. 
When we look at the public sector, the outlook is generally better than it was a quarter as the financing is in a stronger position. In January, the Dodge Index was at its highest level since the pandemic started. Now they did warn the recovery may be uneven in the coming months, which sounds about right. And at an OEM level, I would say the signals are mixed. So it's stronger in heavy equipment, less so in the automotive space. So in aggregate, that outlook is a net positive. 
On the ARR front, and B&I, really, a very solid quarter. Really, the team's executed at an outstanding level in the quarter and for the year.

So I'll be cautious to be overly dogmatic about the 20% so long as we're continuing to get the bookings and to grow the business and to get the -- grow the business and get that trajectory. So the first order of business is to be able to show that demonstrable trajectory, which we said we would -- we feel like we'll be able to do towards the latter part of the year, second half of the year. And as we've got that trajectory, I think that's going to give all of us the confidence in what we're doing. And we'll look at measures such as lifetime value divided by the customer acquisition cost because that's a very indicative measure of how the business progresses. 
And then from the broader, I'd say, strategic lens of it, and we'll continue to look at -- be open to looking at assets or partnerships that help us further and accelerate the strategy."

It tends to be -- I would associate that to an industrial -- a straight industrial context and the fundamental nature of the markets and the markets that we're serving as that they're large, global, underserved and underpenetrated by technology. So our correlation hasn't historically been very tight to cycles. So I would really see the Trimble story is a secular story with a cyclical undertone. So the cycle obviously has an impact, but it's secular, first, cyclical, undertone. 
From an expectation of -- I think you asked about recovering churn or recovering business in the transportation market, yes, we're very optimistic around that. That's -- I mean, that's table stakes, frankly. When we look at the pieces we have across the technology landscape in transportation, and we think we're in a favored position. We've got over 90% of the top 100 trucking companies use our technology. We've got over 1 million powered assets that are managed in the Trimble network. I look at the set of capabilities we have. We do telematics, video, ERP, maintenance, mapping, routing, navigation, analytics, visibility. So we have a strong set of capabilities, I believe, bring scale to the market. And when we look at Connect & Scale applied in the transportation context, that's where I think we've become really unique is if we can sell outcome, look at the bundled offerings, and not only bundled offerings, but where we can provide unique value by stitching together our products. And that's actually why we put that slide as an example of Trimble dispatch adviser because into the slide is because that's an example where we're pulling capabilities across our tech stack into a uniquely -- into a unique Trimble offering.

But I really think when you look at our employee engagement, it's in a very strong place. We look at the retention of our people. We're doing well there. We look at -- I talked to -- used an example in the prepared remarks around how we've ranked in diversity and inclusion score. So we see the culture in a strong place. 
And then from a share gain aspect, how all of this relates to, let's say, share gains in our competitive position, it's -- I have to admit, it's notoriously difficult to be very specific on share gains in our markets. It's just really not a lot of good data. So you can't -- you really can't find like the singular report that's going to tell you all of this. So certainly, we're looking at our results compared to competitive results. We see how -- we look at our win loss ratios and the businesses that we have, and they indicate to us that we're maintaining or gaining share across the business."

Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. In addition, please note that we will be comparing against the 2019 that had a 14th",903,"Hello, everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. In addition, please note that we will be comparing against the 2019 that had a 14th week in the fourth quarter.  
Let's start on Slide 2 with the 3 key messages we want to convey today. First, the customer ROI of our technology and the strength of our financial model enabled us to outperform our own expectations in the fourth quarter. Our customer value proposition is rooted in productivity, quality, safety, visibility and sustainability. We are pleased to announce that annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 9% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, while quarterly revenue grew 0.4% year-over-year to $830 million. Expanding gross margins and execution on costs led to adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.1%, and we finished the year delivering a record $672 million of operating cash flow.  
Second, executing the Connect & Scale 2025 strategy remains our focus. We are working to connect stakeholders across industry life cycles and to transform customer workflows while simultaneously making ourselves easier to do business with. As leaders of the business, we take our responsibility seriously to be effective allocators of capital. To this end, we will continue to invest disproportionately in our cloud and autonomy capabilities as well as in go-to-market efforts to support and enable our long-term growth opportunities.  
Third, our long-term market conviction remains strong. We believe the secular trends of digitization provide long-term tailwinds, and we maintain our result to exit this crisis on a stronger competitive footing than we entered it.  
As we come into 2021, we are both cautious and humble to recognize market uncertainty and volatility while also confident that we are on the right track. Comparisons against 2020, especially on a quarterly basis, will be difficult, if not irrelevant. We will reinstate guidance at an annual level, and David will walk you through the details.  
In addition, we anticipate hosting an Investor Day in the second half of the year to update stakeholders on our long-term strategy and business model. As I reflect back on our May 2018 Investor Day and put that into context of our fiscal year 2020, while revenue is clearly set back with the pandemic, we are ahead in most all other aspects. 
At the Investor Day, we targeted adjusted 2021 EBITDA at 23% to 24% of revenue. We closed 2020 at 25.3% EBITDA. We targeted 2021 software services and recurring revenue mix at 55% of total revenue. We closed 2020 at 58% of total revenue. We targeted the ratio of 2021 operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income at approximately 1.1x. We closed 2020 at 1.2x operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income. In July 2018, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood above 3x and we said we would delever below 2.5x. Today, we stand at 1.6x. We see these as important proof points that we are on the right strategic path that we can uniquely connect the physical and digital worlds to deliver value to our customers and that our asset-light business model works.  
Turning to my commentary on the fourth quarter. We beat our own expectations in Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities. We hit our expectations in Transportation. Broadly speaking, we have seen signs of an emerging construction-led recovery. We are experiencing favorable market conditions in agriculture. We see our innovation and go-to-market execution driving positive outcomes. And at the end of the year, we benefited from government stimulus measures, along with customers catching up on work. David will walk us through additional segment details.  
Turning to Slide 3. This shows Connect & Scale delivering customer ROI in transportation and agriculture. In transportation, our Trimble Dispatch Advisor solutions bring capabilities across our portfolio together to get the right load on the right truck with the right driver, thereby improving planning, reducing empty miles and improving utilization. In agriculture, Zlatiya Agro is a large farm enterprise in Bulgaria that has adopted Trimble's connected farm ecosystem across 100 of their machines. This offering consists of our GFX-750 connected display and autopilot steering, along with our auto-sync data exchange functionality. The connected offering improves planning, process automation and cost optimization.  
I will close my commentary on Slide 4 with an ESG update, a topic of increasing importance to all our stakeholders. As a purpose-driven company, our mission of industry transformation and our leadership culture provides a compelling ESG backdrop. In the area of environmental sustainability, I'll highlight that the primary positive impact of Trimble on greenhouse gas emission reductions and other environmental measures happens through customer application of our technology. For example, eliminating rework in construction, reducing fuel and water usage in all our end markets, and minimizing use of herbicides and pesticides in agriculture. We are also committed to developing science-based targets to further our positive impact.  
In the area of people and social responsibility, I'll highlight that we ranked in the top 10% of companies for diversity in the Comparably survey. I'm also very proud of the work of the Trimble Foundation, where we contributed a record amount of money to put to work for our philanthropic efforts. Finally, in the area of corporate governance, our ratings with third-party firms like MSCI are strong, and we are committed to continuous improvement in our sustainability program.  
David, over to you."

Fourth quarter total revenue was $830 million on a non-GAAP basis, up 0.4% year-over-year. To break that down, currency translation added 1%, and acquisitions, net of divestitures, were essentially neutral. Organic growth, excluding the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2019, was approximately 2%. ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, grew to $1.30 billion in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year and was up 7% on an organic basis. Organic ARR growth, excluding the Transportation segment, was up 15%. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which includes income from our joint ventures and equity investments, was $217 million, with a margin of 26.1%, reflecting both strong gross margins and continuing low operating costs. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 16%, down 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Net income was up 16%, and non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.61, up 15% year-over-year. 
Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $188 million, up 54% year-on-year, while cash flow from operations for the full year was $672 million, up 15% versus 2019. Free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures, was $177 million for the quarter, up 64% year-over-year, and $615 million for the year, up 19% versus 2019. Note that on a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was approximately 1.2x non-GAAP net income. Our strong cash flow results reflect the combination of higher profit and improved working capital efficiency. With the strong cash flow in the quarter, we continued to delever. At year-end, our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 1.6x.  
Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with flexibility to consider a range of capital allocation options. We expect to continue to delever and pursue modest share buybacks while having dry powder deployable for attractive acquisition opportunities.  
Turning to Page 6. I'd like to highlight one of the key drivers of our cash flow in the quarter, working capital. Our working capital efficiency has improved over the last 5 years. We ended the year with just over 0 net working capital. This progress was driven by a number of factors, including the growth in deferred revenue from our recurring revenue businesses, reduced sales outstanding of accounts receivable, and lower inventory levels.  
Turning now to Slide 7. I'll review in a bit more detail our fourth quarter revenue trends. As I mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 9% in the quarter. Our nonrecurring revenue streams also grew, driven by a strong rebound in hardware sales in geospatial, civil construction and agriculture. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were down 8%, driven by declines in our Transportation business. Revenues in North America from businesses other than Transportation grew 2%. Europe revenues were up 9%, reflecting catch-up on project activity slowed earlier in 2020 and fiscal stimulus measures. Asia Pacific was the best performer in the quarter, up 13%, driven by strong performance in Japan. The rest of world, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 10% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector.  
Now turning to Slide 8. I'll review briefly our full year results. Revenue for the full year 2020 contracted 4% overall and 5% organically. Gross margins for the year expanded 140 basis points, and EBITDA grew 7% on a year-over-year basis. EBITDA margins expanded 240 basis points to 25.3%. Operating income grew 7% year-over-year, and operating income margins expanded 220 basis points to 22.8%. Net income was up 12%, and earnings per share were $2.23, up 12% year-over-year.  
Next, on Slide 9, we highlight a number of key metrics, which collectively give a good picture of the state of our business. I'll highlight a few metrics which neither Rob nor I have already mentioned. In this year of strong margins, we spent over 15% of our revenue in research and development, reflecting our continued investment in areas of strategic importance during the downturn. We ended the year with a backlog of $1.3 billion, up 11% from year ago levels. Our deferred revenue at the end of the year was $614 million, up 13% from the end of 2019. The health of our backlog and deferred revenue point to improved visibility for revenue growth heading into 2021.  
Turning now to Slide 10. Let's go through the fourth quarter revenue details at the reporting segment levels. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 1% on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of last year's extra week, organic revenue for the segment would have been up approximately 4%. Revenue growth was double-digit in both our SketchUp and civil hardware businesses. Segment margins were up 90 basis points due to higher margin revenue mix and cost control. 
Geospatial revenue was up 14% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core surveying and mapping business. Revenue was up in all regions, aided by successful new products, stimulus-driven activity and healthy project tender levels as projects, which were delayed earlier in 2020, came back online. Margins were up over 9 percentage points due to a combination of higher-margin revenue mix, lower levels of discounting and strong cost control. 
Resources and Utilities revenue was up 10% on an organic basis, driven principally by our precision agriculture business. Revenue growth was strongest outside the U.S. with higher commodity prices, stimulus programs, favorable weather and a strong reception to our new products, all contributing to growth in the quarter. Solid performance by our Cityworks business, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of last year, also contributed to segment revenue in the quarter. Margins expanded by over 5 percentage points, driven by operating cost control. 
Transportation revenue was down 22% on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the 14th week in the fourth quarter of 2019, organic revenues were down by about 19%. Operating margins were down over 8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Our fourth quarter financial performance in Transportation reflects many of the same factors we have discussed in prior quarters.  
Customer attrition in our mobility business since late 2019 accounts for the majority of the adverse development in segment revenue, ARR and margins. On that front, there is some good news as our product performance has improved and customer churn has declined sequentially in each of the last 3 quarters. Note that the ongoing subscription transition in our transportation enterprise software business depressed revenue trends in the quarter, and the Kuebix acquisition had an expected dilutive impact on segment margins. While we have more work ahead of us to improve the performance of this business, we continue to believe in the power of our connected transportation strategy and project the steps that the team is taking now will yield improved performance later in 2021.  
Turning now to Page 11. I'd like to share with you our outlook for this year. Our planning efforts have settled on a 2021 financial outlook based on a number of key assumptions. First, we assume that public health initiatives are successful in enabling a broad reopening of constrained sectors of the economy by midyear 2021. Second, our plan is rooted in the assumption that the economy grows through the year with 2021 GDP at least recovering to 2019 levels. Third, our projections exclude the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures. 
Our most important key performance indicator will continue to be ARR. We expect organic ARR growth to end 2021 in the high single-digit range, with sequential improvement as the quarters progress. ARR growth in 2021 will be driven by the combination of organic growth of our existing recurring offerings, ongoing transitions from perpetual software products and the gradual turnaround of our Transportation business. We project organic revenue growth in 2021 in the mid-single-digit range, with an additional 1 to 2 points if exchange rates remain near where they are today. That translates to a revenue range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Note that our revenue growth in 2021 will be negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points from our subscription model transitions. 
We anticipate that EBITDA and operating margins in 2021 will be higher than 2019 but lower than 2020. Overall, our gross margins this year are projected to remain stable at 2020 levels, but a number of factors are likely to cause EBITDA margins to come down somewhat when compared to the historically high levels of 2020. First, the return to a more normalized level of incentive compensation and, in the second half of this year, higher travel costs will naturally cause operating costs to grow at a rate faster than revenue. Second, we are incrementally allocating more capital in both CapEx and operating expense to the areas of focus in our Connect & Scale strategy, namely digital transformation, cloud infrastructure and autonomy. Third, our margins will be negatively impacted by the accelerating subscription model conversions of 150 basis points.  
I'll note that we project income from equity method investments to be approximately $35 million to $40 million and net interest expense to be about $65 million to $70 million with decreasing levels as the year progresses. We project our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 17%, and that our shares outstanding will be approximately 254 million. Incorporating all of these factors, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 for the full year.  
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to project that operating cash flow and free cash flow will exceed net income as the favorable cash characteristics of our business will continue. Nevertheless, cash flow will likely be flat or decline modestly from 2020 levels as we saw extraordinary improvement in working capital in late 2020. 
A few words on the segment dynamics in this outlook. Generally, we expect that each of our segments will mirror the trends I've just described, although I'll highlight a few factors specific to the individual segments. In Buildings and Infrastructure, our hardware offerings were most adversely impacted by COVID in the second quarter of 2020. So we expect growth in the second quarter of 2021 to be very strong. Our Geospatial and Resources and Utilities businesses have a lot of momentum now, and we anticipate that momentum to generate strong growth through the first half of the year with more moderate growth thereafter. In Transportation, we don't expect to see meaningful revenue growth or margin improvement until late in 2021.  
We don't intend to provide quarterly guidance at this point, but I'll offer a few comments on factors that will influence our revenue and margin performance as the year progresses. Year-on-year growth in each quarter will obviously be impacted by COVID-driven swings we've seen in 2020. We expect to grow in all 4 quarters, with the strongest growth rate in the second quarter when we lap the worst period of the COVID crisis. We expect that operating and EBITDA margins will be relatively constant across the quarters.  
Rob, back to you for closing comments."

So just from an organic view of our product portfolio, we are bullish on the opportunities in agriculture to connect what we're doing together to create additional ROI for our customers. What we'll build on top of that is our autonomy strategy, and we see autonomy as a series of increasing levels of automation over the coming quarters and years to move us really more into that autonomous future. So we believe we can do a lot of this organically. From an acquisition perspective, we're certainly open if there's acquisitions that could help us accelerate our development and our efforts in any of those areas."

And when we do that 80-20 comparison, that's at a TCV, or total contract value, levels, right? So we can do it on an apple-to-apple basis. 
In terms of measuring the progress of the business and how we measure and look at the proof points in the business, well, certainly, you hit on the first one right away, which is the ratio of the bookings because that's what we're -- the strategy -- the end game from a financial model perspective is to build a recurring offering.

So let's start in B&I if we run through the outlook and what we're hearing from some of the different constituents in -- throughout the chain. I'd start with saying that the outlook is pretty good. There are a few exceptions, but the outlook is pretty good. 
If we look at the type of work, infrastructure and residential backlogs are improving. EPC is down. So that's going to relate to oil and gas. Multi-sector, which picks up commercial work, that looks flat to down. And not surprisingly, retail is down, and elements such as data centers and logistics centers are up. When we look at the public sector, the outlook is generally better than it was a quarter as the financing is in a stronger position. In January, the Dodge Index was at its highest level since the pandemic started. Now they did warn the recovery may be uneven in the coming months, which sounds about right. And at an OEM level, I would say the signals are mixed. So it's stronger in heavy equipment, less so in the automotive space. So in aggregate, that outlook is a net positive. 
On the ARR front in B&I, really, it's a very solid quarter. Really, the team's executed at an outstanding level in the quarter and for the year. Our net retention businesses, such as e-Builder and Viewpoint, they're well over 100%. we had mid-teens ARR growth in Viewpoint and e-Builder, so continued strong performance from those businesses and those operators.

So from the 20% level, it's absolutely the target that we have. It's to get this segment back up to the company level of profitability. 
In terms of how we measure that, given how much of the business is recurring, we'll also look at it from a customer lifetime value perspective. So I'll be cautious to be overly dogmatic about the 20% so long as we're continuing to get the bookings and to grow the business and to get the -- grow the business and get that trajectory. So the first order of business is to be able to show that demonstrable trajectory, which we said we would -- we feel like we'll be able to do towards the latter part of the year, second half of the year. And as we've got that trajectory, I think that's going to give all of us the confidence in what we're doing. And we'll look at measures such as lifetime value divided by the customer acquisition cost because that's a very indicative measure of how the business progresses. 
And then from the broader, I'd say, strategic lens of it, we'll continue to look at -- be open to looking at assets or partnerships that help us further and accelerate the strategy."

In North America specifically and looking at residential, we see that as a near to midterm catalyst. And then I would have an anticipation of normalization there.

It tends to be -- I would associate that to an industrial -- a straight industrial context and the fundamental nature of the markets and the markets that we're serving. It's that they're large, global, underserved and underpenetrated by technology. So our correlation hasn't historically been very tight to cycles. So I would really see the Trimble story as a secular story with a cyclical undertone. So the cycle obviously has an impact but it's secular first, cyclical undertone. 
From an expectation of -- I think you asked about recovering churn or recovering business in the transportation market. Yes, we're very optimistic around that. That's -- I mean that's table stakes, frankly, when we look at the pieces we have across the technology landscape in Transportation, and we think we're in a favored position. We've got over 90% of the top 100 trucking companies use our technology. We've got over 1 million powered assets that are managed in the Trimble network. I look at the set of capabilities we have. We do telematics, video, ERP, maintenance, mapping, routing, navigation, analytics, visibility. 
So we have a strong set of capabilities. I believe we bring scale to the market. And when we look at Connect & Scale applied in the Transportation context, that's where I think we've become really unique because if we can sell, they'll come -- they'll look at the bundled offerings and then -- not only bundled offerings but where we can provide unique value by stitching together our products. And that's actually why we put that slide as an example of Trimble Dispatch Advisor because -- into the slide.

It's primarily our own teams, but we will use third parties to do intrusion detection for an example -- or it's best practice. So we follow best practices, what you want to do with external firms. Of course, we use a lot of external technology but, right, you pay for that on an OpEx basis. It's not capitalized. 
The last thing I would say around the area of cyber is as many threats as it provides, we also see it as an opportunity to distinguish ourselves. And the scope, the scale, the breadth of Trimble, we see as an advantage here because this is something customers are increasingly having to look at. And our ability to manage at scale and at this level of sophistication outstrips the ability of a smaller company to keep up and actually draw parallel to things like GDPR. And these are expensive endeavors, and our scale helps in that aspect of it."

Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. In addition, please note that we will be comparing against the 2019 that had a 14th",903,"Hello, everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. In addition, please note that we will be comparing against the 2019 that had a 14th week in the fourth quarter.  
Let's start on Slide 2 with the 3 key messages we want to convey today. First, the customer ROI of our technology and the strength of our financial model enabled us to outperform our own expectations in the fourth quarter. Our customer value proposition is rooted in productivity, quality, safety, visibility and sustainability. We are pleased to announce that annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 9% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, while quarterly revenue grew 0.4% year-over-year to $830 million. Expanding gross margins and execution on costs led to adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.1%, and we finished the year delivering a record $672 million of operating cash flow.  
Second, executing the Connect & Scale 2025 strategy remains our focus. We are working to connect stakeholders across industry life cycles and to transform customer workflows while simultaneously making ourselves easier to do business with. As leaders of the business, we take our responsibility seriously to be effective allocators of capital. To this end, we will continue to invest disproportionately in our cloud and autonomy capabilities as well as in go-to-market efforts to support and enable our long-term growth opportunities.  
Third, our long-term market conviction remains strong. We believe the secular trends of digitization provide long-term tailwinds, and we maintain our result to exit this crisis on a stronger competitive footing than we entered it.  
As we come into 2021, we are both cautious and humble to recognize market uncertainty and volatility while also confident that we are on the right track. Comparisons against 2020, especially on a quarterly basis, will be difficult, if not irrelevant. We will reinstate guidance at an annual level, and David will walk you through the details.  
In addition, we anticipate hosting an Investor Day in the second half of the year to update stakeholders on our long-term strategy and business model. As I reflect back on our May 2018 Investor Day and put that into context of our fiscal year 2020, while revenue is clearly set back with the pandemic, we are ahead in most all other aspects. 
At the Investor Day, we targeted adjusted 2021 EBITDA at 23% to 24% of revenue. We closed 2020 at 25.3% EBITDA. We targeted 2021 software services and recurring revenue mix at 55% of total revenue. We closed 2020 at 58% of total revenue. We targeted the ratio of 2021 operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income at approximately 1.1x. We closed 2020 at 1.2x operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income. In July 2018, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood above 3x and we said we would delever below 2.5x. Today, we stand at 1.6x. We see these as important proof points that we are on the right strategic path that we can uniquely connect the physical and digital worlds to deliver value to our customers and that our asset-light business model works.  
Turning to my commentary on the fourth quarter. We beat our own expectations in Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities. We hit our expectations in Transportation. Broadly speaking, we have seen signs of an emerging construction-led recovery. We are experiencing favorable market conditions in agriculture. We see our innovation and go-to-market execution driving positive outcomes. And at the end of the year, we benefited from government stimulus measures, along with customers catching up on work. David will walk us through additional segment details.  
Turning to Slide 3. This shows Connect & Scale delivering customer ROI in transportation and agriculture. In transportation, our Trimble Dispatch Advisor solutions bring capabilities across our portfolio together to get the right load on the right truck with the right driver, thereby improving planning, reducing empty miles and improving utilization. In agriculture, Zlatiya Agro is a large farm enterprise in Bulgaria that has adopted Trimble's connected farm ecosystem across 100 of their machines. This offering consists of our GFX-750 connected display and autopilot steering, along with our auto-sync data exchange functionality. The connected offering improves planning, process automation and cost optimization.  
I will close my commentary on Slide 4 with an ESG update, a topic of increasing importance to all our stakeholders. As a purpose-driven company, our mission of industry transformation and our leadership culture provides a compelling ESG backdrop. In the area of environmental sustainability, I'll highlight that the primary positive impact of Trimble on greenhouse gas emission reductions and other environmental measures happens through customer application of our technology. For example, eliminating rework in construction, reducing fuel and water usage in all our end markets, and minimizing use of herbicides and pesticides in agriculture. We are also committed to developing science-based targets to further our positive impact.  
In the area of people and social responsibility, I'll highlight that we ranked in the top 10% of companies for diversity in the Comparably survey. I'm also very proud of the work of the Trimble Foundation, where we contributed a record amount of money to put to work for our philanthropic efforts. Finally, in the area of corporate governance, our ratings with third-party firms like MSCI are strong, and we are committed to continuous improvement in our sustainability program.  
David, over to you."

Fourth quarter total revenue was $830 million on a non-GAAP basis, up 0.4% year-over-year. To break that down, currency translation added 1%, and acquisitions, net of divestitures, were essentially neutral. Organic growth, excluding the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2019, was approximately 2%. ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, grew to $1.30 billion in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year and was up 7% on an organic basis. Organic ARR growth, excluding the Transportation segment, was up 15%. 
Adjusted EBITDA, which includes income from our joint ventures and equity investments, was $217 million, with a margin of 26.1%, reflecting both strong gross margins and continuing low operating costs. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 16%, down 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Net income was up 16%, and non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.61, up 15% year-over-year. 
Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $188 million, up 54% year-on-year, while cash flow from operations for the full year was $672 million, up 15% versus 2019. Free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures, was $177 million for the quarter, up 64% year-over-year, and $615 million for the year, up 19% versus 2019. Note that on a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was approximately 1.2x non-GAAP net income. Our strong cash flow results reflect the combination of higher profit and improved working capital efficiency. With the strong cash flow in the quarter, we continued to delever. At year-end, our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 1.6x.  
Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with flexibility to consider a range of capital allocation options. We expect to continue to delever and pursue modest share buybacks while having dry powder deployable for attractive acquisition opportunities.  
Turning to Page 6. I'd like to highlight one of the key drivers of our cash flow in the quarter, working capital. Our working capital efficiency has improved over the last 5 years. We ended the year with just over 0 net working capital. This progress was driven by a number of factors, including the growth in deferred revenue from our recurring revenue businesses, reduced sales outstanding of accounts receivable, and lower inventory levels.  
Turning now to Slide 7. I'll review in a bit more detail our fourth quarter revenue trends. As I mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 9% in the quarter. Our nonrecurring revenue streams also grew, driven by a strong rebound in hardware sales in geospatial, civil construction and agriculture. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were down 8%, driven by declines in our Transportation business. Revenues in North America from businesses other than Transportation grew 2%. Europe revenues were up 9%, reflecting catch-up on project activity slowed earlier in 2020 and fiscal stimulus measures. Asia Pacific was the best performer in the quarter, up 13%, driven by strong performance in Japan. The rest of world, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 10% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector.  
Now turning to Slide 8. I'll review briefly our full year results. Revenue for the full year 2020 contracted 4% overall and 5% organically. Gross margins for the year expanded 140 basis points, and EBITDA grew 7% on a year-over-year basis. EBITDA margins expanded 240 basis points to 25.3%. Operating income grew 7% year-over-year, and operating income margins expanded 220 basis points to 22.8%. Net income was up 12%, and earnings per share were $2.23, up 12% year-over-year.  
Next, on Slide 9, we highlight a number of key metrics, which collectively give a good picture of the state of our business. I'll highlight a few metrics which neither Rob nor I have already mentioned. In this year of strong margins, we spent over 15% of our revenue in research and development, reflecting our continued investment in areas of strategic importance during the downturn. We ended the year with a backlog of $1.3 billion, up 11% from year ago levels. Our deferred revenue at the end of the year was $614 million, up 13% from the end of 2019. The health of our backlog and deferred revenue point to improved visibility for revenue growth heading into 2021.  
Turning now to Slide 10. Let's go through the fourth quarter revenue details at the reporting segment levels. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 1% on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of last year's extra week, organic revenue for the segment would have been up approximately 4%. Revenue growth was double-digit in both our SketchUp and civil hardware businesses. Segment margins were up 90 basis points due to higher margin revenue mix and cost control. 
Geospatial revenue was up 14% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core surveying and mapping business. Revenue was up in all regions, aided by successful new products, stimulus-driven activity and healthy project tender levels as projects, which were delayed earlier in 2020, came back online. Margins were up over 9 percentage points due to a combination of higher-margin revenue mix, lower levels of discounting and strong cost control. 
Resources and Utilities revenue was up 10% on an organic basis, driven principally by our precision agriculture business. Revenue growth was strongest outside the U.S. with higher commodity prices, stimulus programs, favorable weather and a strong reception to our new products, all contributing to growth in the quarter. Solid performance by our Cityworks business, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of last year, also contributed to segment revenue in the quarter. Margins expanded by over 5 percentage points, driven by operating cost control. 
Transportation revenue was down 22% on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the 14th week in the fourth quarter of 2019, organic revenues were down by about 19%. Operating margins were down over 8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Our fourth quarter financial performance in Transportation reflects many of the same factors we have discussed in prior quarters.  
Customer attrition in our mobility business since late 2019 accounts for the majority of the adverse development in segment revenue, ARR and margins. On that front, there is some good news as our product performance has improved and customer churn has declined sequentially in each of the last 3 quarters. Note that the ongoing subscription transition in our transportation enterprise software business depressed revenue trends in the quarter, and the Kuebix acquisition had an expected dilutive impact on segment margins. While we have more work ahead of us to improve the performance of this business, we continue to believe in the power of our connected transportation strategy and project the steps that the team is taking now will yield improved performance later in 2021.  
Turning now to Page 11. I'd like to share with you our outlook for this year. Our planning efforts have settled on a 2021 financial outlook based on a number of key assumptions. First, we assume that public health initiatives are successful in enabling a broad reopening of constrained sectors of the economy by midyear 2021. Second, our plan is rooted in the assumption that the economy grows through the year with 2021 GDP at least recovering to 2019 levels. Third, our projections exclude the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures. 
Our most important key performance indicator will continue to be ARR. We expect organic ARR growth to end 2021 in the high single-digit range, with sequential improvement as the quarters progress. ARR growth in 2021 will be driven by the combination of organic growth of our existing recurring offerings, ongoing transitions from perpetual software products and the gradual turnaround of our Transportation business. We project organic revenue growth in 2021 in the mid-single-digit range, with an additional 1 to 2 points if exchange rates remain near where they are today. That translates to a revenue range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Note that our revenue growth in 2021 will be negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points from our subscription model transitions. 
We anticipate that EBITDA and operating margins in 2021 will be higher than 2019 but lower than 2020. Overall, our gross margins this year are projected to remain stable at 2020 levels, but a number of factors are likely to cause EBITDA margins to come down somewhat when compared to the historically high levels of 2020. First, the return to a more normalized level of incentive compensation and, in the second half of this year, higher travel costs will naturally cause operating costs to grow at a rate faster than revenue. Second, we are incrementally allocating more capital in both CapEx and operating expense to the areas of focus in our Connect & Scale strategy, namely digital transformation, cloud infrastructure and autonomy. Third, our margins will be negatively impacted by the accelerating subscription model conversions of 150 basis points.  
I'll note that we project income from equity method investments to be approximately $35 million to $40 million and net interest expense to be about $65 million to $70 million with decreasing levels as the year progresses. We project our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 17%, and that our shares outstanding will be approximately 254 million. Incorporating all of these factors, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 for the full year.  
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to project that operating cash flow and free cash flow will exceed net income as the favorable cash characteristics of our business will continue. Nevertheless, cash flow will likely be flat or decline modestly from 2020 levels as we saw extraordinary improvement in working capital in late 2020. 
A few words on the segment dynamics in this outlook. Generally, we expect that each of our segments will mirror the trends I've just described, although I'll highlight a few factors specific to the individual segments. In Buildings and Infrastructure, our hardware offerings were most adversely impacted by COVID in the second quarter of 2020. So we expect growth in the second quarter of 2021 to be very strong. Our Geospatial and Resources and Utilities businesses have a lot of momentum now, and we anticipate that momentum to generate strong growth through the first half of the year with more moderate growth thereafter. In Transportation, we don't expect to see meaningful revenue growth or margin improvement until late in 2021.  
We don't intend to provide quarterly guidance at this point, but I'll offer a few comments on factors that will influence our revenue and margin performance as the year progresses. Year-on-year growth in each quarter will obviously be impacted by COVID-driven swings we've seen in 2020. We expect to grow in all 4 quarters, with the strongest growth rate in the second quarter when we lap the worst period of the COVID crisis. We expect that operating and EBITDA margins will be relatively constant across the quarters.  
Rob, back to you for closing comments."

So let's start in B&I if we run through the outlook and what we're hearing from some of the different constituents in -- throughout the chain. I'd start with saying that the outlook is pretty good. There are a few exceptions, but the outlook is pretty good. 
If we look at the type of work, infrastructure and residential backlogs are improving. EPC is down. So that's going to relate to oil and gas. Multi-sector, which picks up commercial work, that looks flat to down. And not surprisingly, retail is down, and elements such as data centers and logistics centers are up. When we look at the public sector, the outlook is generally better than it was a quarter as the financing is in a stronger position. In January, the Dodge Index was at its highest level since the pandemic started. Now they did warn the recovery may be uneven in the coming months, which sounds about right. And at an OEM level, I would say the signals are mixed. So it's stronger in heavy equipment, less so in the automotive space. So in aggregate, that outlook is a net positive. 
On the ARR front in B&I, really, it's a very solid quarter. Really, the team's executed at an outstanding level in the quarter and for the year. Our net retention businesses, such as e-Builder and Viewpoint, they're well over 100%. we had mid-teens ARR growth in Viewpoint and e-Builder, so continued strong performance from those businesses and those operators. Did I miss anything, Ann?"

We think we've got a favorable position and a favorable offering. I think we have the -- I'll say, the coverage of assets in this sector, which I think would be quite enviable from a competitive standpoint. So from the 20% level, it's absolutely the target that we have. It's to get this segment back up to the company level of profitability. 
In terms of how we measure that, given how much of the business is recurring, we'll also look at it from a customer lifetime value perspective. So I'll be cautious to be overly dogmatic about the 20% so long as we're continuing to get the bookings and to grow the business and to get the -- grow the business and get that trajectory. So the first order of business is to be able to show that demonstrable trajectory, which we said we would -- we feel like we'll be able to do towards the latter part of the year, second half of the year. And as we've got that trajectory, I think that's going to give all of us the confidence in what we're doing. And we'll look at measures such as lifetime value divided by the customer acquisition cost because that's a very indicative measure of how the business progresses. 
And then from the broader, I'd say, strategic lens of it, we'll continue to look at -- be open to looking at assets or partnerships that help us further and accelerate the strategy."

In North America specifically and looking at residential, we see that as a near to midterm catalyst. And then I would have an anticipation of normalization there.

So I would really see the Trimble story as a secular story with a cyclical undertone. So the cycle obviously has an impact but it's secular first, cyclical undertone. 
From an expectation of -- I think you asked about recovering churn or recovering business in the transportation market. Yes, we're very optimistic around that. That's -- I mean that's table stakes, frankly, when we look at the pieces we have across the technology landscape in Transportation, and we think we're in a favored position. We've got over 90% of the top 100 trucking companies use our technology. We've got over 1 million powered assets that are managed in the Trimble network. I look at the set of capabilities we have. We do telematics, video, ERP, maintenance, mapping, routing, navigation, analytics, visibility. 
So we have a strong set of capabilities. I believe we bring scale to the market. And when we look at Connect & Scale applied in the Transportation context, that's where I think we've become really unique because if we can sell, they'll come -- they'll look at the bundled offerings and then -- not only bundled offerings but where we can provide unique value by stitching together our products. And that's actually why we put that slide as an example of Trimble Dispatch Advisor because -- into the slide.

We anticipate that we'll begin to travel later in the year. A lot of the things we do normally, including hiring, were really low. And we are investing, as Rob said, in cloud and digital transformation. And then I'll add that part of the OpEx increase is FX because the U.S. dollar has weakened. So over half of our business is outside the U.S. So that naturally causes OpEx to grow."

We look at -- I talked to -- used an example in the prepared remarks around how we've ranked in diversity and inclusion score. So we see the culture in a strong place. 
And then from a share gain aspect, how all of this relates to, let's say, share gains in our competitive position, it's -- I have to admit it's notoriously difficult to be very specific on share gains in our markets. It's just really not a lot of good data. So you can't -- you really can't find like the singular report that's going to tell you all of this.

The last thing I would say around the area of cyber is as many threats as it provides, we also see it as an opportunity to distinguish ourselves. And the scope, the scale, the breadth of Trimble, we see as an advantage here because this is something customers are increasingly having to look at. And our ability to manage at scale and at this level of sophistication outstrips the ability of a smaller company to keep up and actually draw parallel to things like GDPR.

Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website and we ask you to please refer to the safe harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2 with the key messages we want to convey today. 
In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.32 billion, up 9% year-over-year, total revenue growth of 12%, EBITDA of 26% and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $745 million. Our results demonstrate the quality of our business model and an improving macroeconomic backdrop. They also highlight the strength of our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. On the basis of this competitive strength and the nature of the opportunities we see in the market, we plan to scale up investments in targeted areas of the company. At the same time, we are also raising our guidance for the year. 
Turning to Page 3 and the end market backdrop, the common thread across the industries we serve is delivering products and services that connect the physical and digital worlds. The industries we serve are large, global, underserved and underpenetrated with technology. As our end markets digitize, we are able to connect the office and the field with our hardware and our software offerings in a manner that delivers productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. 
In Buildings and Infrastructure, we exceeded expectations in the business. leveraging our strong market position and continuing the conversion of our business models. The segment now stands at approximately 65% software-related revenue. 
In Geospatial, the business experienced the strongest year-over-year growth we have seen since we created the reporting segment in 2017. Global demand is healthy and the innovation that the team has delivered has strengthened our competitive position. 
In Transportation, we met the P&L expectations we had for the segment in the quarter. Bookings in our mobility business improved to the best level since early 2019. Bookings in our Transportation Enterprise Software business were strong, with subscription bookings more than double the level of our first quarter 2020. We remain confident that we will deliver demonstrable improvement in revenue, margins and ARR trends in the second half of the year. 
In Resources and Utilities, the commodity price backdrop is providing global tailwinds to the business. and we delivered growth well ahead of our expectations. 
Let's turn next to Page 4 for some proof points on the Trimble operating system, capturing strategy, people and execution. On strategy, we continue to execute on revenue transition opportunities. Our Tekla design and engineering software business announced its shift to subscription that went into effect in March. Different but better is our tagline and I think that sums it up well, which is to say it's more than just change, it's progress. Our Mechanical Electrical Plumbing business also continued its subscription conversion. And as mentioned, we saw a strong level of recurring bookings in our Transportation Enterprise business. Finally, I'd like to note that we closed the divestiture of the Manhattan real estate software business early in the second quarter, and we wish the team well in its new home. 
On people, I am pleased to report that we ranked #15 out of 15,000 companies in the 2021 Best Global Culture Survey. I also want to announce that our CTO, Tom Fansler, retired at the end of the second quarter. Two of our other business leaders, Ron Antevy and Bryn Fosburgh, will assume new roles starting in the third quarter. Ron will operate as an entrepreneur in residence driving innovation efforts, and Bryn will act as our interim CTO. I'm pleased to say that we promoted from within for Ron and Bryn's current responsibilities for the e-Builder and overall construction businesses, respectively. 
On execution, we released our sustainability report a few weeks ago. I'm incredibly proud of the work of the team on this important initiative. Our teams also continue to innovate. We launched a civil construction estimating software package. We released a combination of our load right payload management system with our Earthworks grade control platform. We launched a new [ TSC 5 ] data controller, and we released a new SX12 scanning total station, which is an update to our successful SX10 instrument. The SX12 now supports additional applications in tunneling and underground construction. 
With respect to increasing investments in the business, we see Connect & Scale as being synonymous with an industry platform strategy. We want to play offense and invest now for the mid- to long-term opportunities that we see in the market. We see a generational opportunity out of a North America infrastructure bill and a strong commodity price backdrop in the agriculture market. We will invest in product development and go-to-market efforts around infrastructure and will step up investments in our agriculture business, all while continuing to invest in our Trimble Cloud platform and our autonomy efforts. 
A quick update on our plans for an Investor Day. We have concluded that an in-person meeting at our Colorado facility, where much of our leadership team is based, is the best way to facilitate the kind of in-depth interaction that many of you want from an Investor Day. We will hold the meeting in the spring of 2022, by which time the environment for business travel should be greatly improved. We also plan to hold 1 or 2 interactive virtual sessions with investors on specific topics of broad interest later this year. 
In closing, I'm as confident and optimistic about Trimble as ever. We have the right team pursuing a compelling strategy in attractive markets. It won't be easy, and it won't be linear, but nothing worth achieving is. David, over to you."

Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of first quarter results. First quarter revenue was $887 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3% and divestitures subtracted 1% for a total organic revenue increase of 1",1220,"Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of first quarter results. First quarter revenue was $887 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3% and divestitures subtracted 1% for a total organic revenue increase of 10%. Gross margin in the first quarter was 58.4%. Margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by product mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.1%, up 340 basis points, driven both by higher revenue and strong cost control. Operating income margins expanded 330 basis points to 23.6%. Net income dollars increased by 36% and earnings per share increased by $0.17 to $0.66 per share. 
Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $228 million, demonstrating the continued strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow again exceeded net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $218 million. We paid down $158 million of debt in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1.3x. At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $265 million in cash. With our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. 
Turning now to Slide 6, I'll review in more detail our first quarter revenue trends. As mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 9% in the quarter. Our nonrecurring revenue streams also grew with hardware growing 17% and perpetual software growing 11%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction, geospatial and agriculture. Our hardware growth also contributed to perpetual software growth as some of our hardware offerings are bundled with perpetual software. 
From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 9%. Excluding transportation, revenues in North America grew 15%. In Europe, revenues were up 16%. Roughly half of our Europe growth was driven by currency with the balance coming from catch-up on project activity slowed in 2020, fiscal stimulus measures and recovering demand in many end markets. Asia Pacific had the best performance in the quarter, up 17%, driven by strong growth in Australia and Japan. The rest of world, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 5% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector. 
Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. Annualized recurring revenue was $1.32 billion in the first quarter, up 9% on a year-over-year basis. Organic ARR growth was approximately 7%. Excluding our Transportation segment, Trimble ARR grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, was negative this quarter, representing approximately minus 1% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Research and development on a trailing 12-month basis was 15% of revenue. Our deferred revenue grew 12% on a year-over-year basis and our backlog, excluding the impact of the real estate software business divested early in the second quarter, was $1.4 billion, up 17% versus prior year. While growing backlog is obviously an indicator of strong momentum in the business, I'll note here that backlog at quarter end was unusually high, in part because Trimble, like so many manufacturers in this recovering economy, is experiencing shortages and extended delivery times for many key components of our hardware products. Our operations team is hard at work to expedite delivery of products, which are in short supply, But we do expect to manage challenges with both cost inflation and extended lead times of select hardware product lines in the quarters to come. 
Turning now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 13% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our Building and Civil Construction businesses. Segment margins were up 760 basis points due to higher-margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 22% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core branded survey equipment business. Margins were up 590 basis points due to strong revenue growth and cost control. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 10% on an organic basis. We experienced double-digit growth in each of our precision agriculture, positioning services and agriculture software offerings. Margins expanded 190 basis points, driven by increased revenue and cost control. 
Top line results in Transportation were consistent with our expectations. Revenue was down 6% on an organic basis year-on-year and margins declined 450 basis points. The drivers of revenue and margin decline are broadly consistent with those we have highlighted previously. Revenue and margins were roughly stable sequentially when compared with the fourth quarter of last year and leading indicators provide encouraging signs for the recovery ahead. As Rob mentioned, bookings were very strong in both our Mobility and Enterprise Software businesses. Our product performance is improving, and our sales pipeline is stronger than it has been in nearly 2 years. We remain confident that we are on track to improve performance later this year. 
Moving to Slide 9, I'll provide an update to our outlook for the year. Given our outperformance in the first quarter, our growing backlog and increasing confidence in our business trends, we are raising our revenue forecast range by $100 million to $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. I'll note here that the biggest risk we have to our revenue outlook for the next couple of quarters is the supply environment for critical hardware components. We expect that revenue growth will be strongest in the second quarter as we lapped the worst period of the COVID lockdowns in 2020, with more moderate growth in the back half of the year and especially in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to expect organic ARR growth in the high single digits with improving trends as the year progresses. From a profitability perspective, we continue to expect that EBITDA margins will come in between the levels of 2019 and 2020. Margins for the balance of 2021 and especially in the second half of the year, are likely to come down from the levels we achieved in the first quarter for a number of reasons. First, we expect some operating expense acceleration as the year progresses in the environment for business travel opens up. Second, we are accelerating investments that Rob mentioned earlier. These investments include spending on our digital transformation and cloud infrastructure and higher R&D on our autonomy projects and our agriculture product offerings. And third, we are seeing growing cost pressure in our hardware cost of goods across a broad range of commodities. We are adapting our pricing and discounting strategies to reflect these cost pressures, but still anticipate some adverse impact on our gross margins. 
We continue to expect that software business model transitions from perpetual to recurring will impact revenue growth and operating margins by approximately 150 basis points. Our earnings per share outlook is raised to $2.30 to $2.50. This reflects the revenue and operating margin trends I mentioned earlier and a modestly higher tax rate outlook than we had anticipated a quarter ago. From a cash flow perspective, we expect cash flow from operations of approximately 1.1x net income with free cash flow exceeding net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

I'll say the environment for product cost has changed a lot just in the last month or 2 and it's a fluid situation, so it's hard to make specific predictions. I will say that the product inflation that we're facing really only began toward the end of Q1. So the results that we just reported don't reflect the full impact we anticipate later this year. And you saw our gross margins decline year-on-year about 70 basis points and probably just under half of that can be accounted for in product cost increases. 
But we're seeing increases across the board. Obviously, we're all reading about semiconductor type supply and cost increases, but we're really seeing it across a whole broad range of commodities in transportation, particularly air transportation that we use to get our products where we need them to go. So without getting too specific, I'll say that we do expect underlying cost of goods inflation for the balance of the year to be noticeably higher than it was in Q1. Now I'll comment that we're adapting, as I mentioned in the script, our discounting strategy and our top line prices, and we hope to accommodate a meaningful portion of the impact of the cost increases. But nonetheless, we expect gross margins will come down for that reason in the remaining 3 quarters of the year. 
And then I'll turn it over to Rob for your questions about operating expense and the investments we're making."

So we see it as a generational opportunity, and I'll focus on North America, but highlight that places like the U.K. are going with a construction-led recovery. We see markets like Japan promoting digital technologies, Australia has strong infrastructure development as well. In North America, I think about it from the value proposition of what the technology can do. We think about the funding around that. And we mentioned that we would -- in respect to our own funding, we would step up investments in the area. And then we also think about policy. 
So from a value proposition perspective, with digital technology, we can build greener. We can build more inclusively and we can build better while doing so cheaper, so it just makes sense to use the technology. What we're hearing from customers and stakeholders in the industry actually is on the policy side as well as a desire to streamline project delivery by promoting the digital technology. So really streamlining project delivery really seems to be the core of what the market is talking about. 
And from a funding perspective, I'll start with government level funding. And we do anticipate that the final amount will be well negotiated, and it will be different than the proposed American Jobs Plan. Nevertheless, and we need to also reauthorize the Surface Transportation bill. So the Jobs Plan in addition to the reauthorization of the Surface Transportation bill, we think that will be significant, we think it will be incremental to the current baseline investments in our highways, airports, mass transit and our ports. Now we think that won't pass until later in the year and the benefits of that wouldn't be realized in 2022. 
So when we think about the investments in our business to get ahead of that, we think both at a product development level as well as a go-to-market level. So at a product development level, where we're going with the Connect part of Connect & Scale is integrating the hardware, the software, the physical, the digital, the office, the field, being able to round trip that data to streamline project delivery, so we'll continue our efforts on that front. And at a go-to-market level, it's putting the resources -- increase the level of resources and capabilities in place to actually execute against what we think is an attractive and important opportunity."

At an owner level, think about the Department of Transportation as an owner, to talk about state DOT as an owner. I do think there's increasing awareness of the technology. There's certainly increasing awareness of the concept of the digital twin and how this can play through the operations and maintenance phase. And if we use the technology during the design, engineering and construction phase, how that can then be leveraged in the operations and maintenance phase. 
So I think there is increased awareness. We see a few more projects that are promoting the use of technology. Actually, the Federal Highway Administration, they made an announcement recently  to -- recognizes the [ digitalized bill ] is an important technology innovation. So that's helpful to see that coming from that perspective. And the engineering community, certainly, it's in the interest of the engineering community to help build to deliver the projects better and faster, and for them to be able to win more of the work. And then at the contractor level, I'd see that's where we see the most level of proactive use and request for use of technology, because the contractors are the ones who are -- they're really seeing the most tactical benefit of better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener in their day-to-day work. So they're winning more work, it's becoming more just the way that construction is done. So very positive on the contractor side."

Chad, this is David.

So that's going to factor in. 
As far as the end markets that are driving the results, we mentioned in Transportation, we ended about where we thought we would, P&L-wise, but bookings were up. And obviously, the transportation market has picked up in terms of the macros with asset utilization and pricing and the financial solidity of our transportation customers is better. So that's more a tailwind for future quarters than this one. 
But look, beyond that, in the other 3 segments, we exceeded our expectations. So that's why the outlook came up in part because Q1 was above where we thought it would be, and we think some of those trends will continue. And the caution I'll provide is that hardware is still a meaningful part of our business. And for all the reasons I mentioned with the supply chain challenges, that's creating the greatest level of uncertainty.

There's no doubt that the macros in the transportation business are dramatically better than they were 3 to 4 quarters ago, and that's helpful. Our trends -- our business trends won't change linearly and right away with the changes in the macroenvironment that the customers that we serve, experience. So it's not at all surprising to any of us that we have some lag. 
But I'll say there are a number of factors that give us confidence that we're on the road back to better trends in Transportation. Just I'll highlight a few. Our churn is trending down. On a secular basis, there are bumps quarter-to-quarter as individual customers implement decisions they made some time ago. But the data surely points to a better trend there. Rob mentioned the bookings. Even beyond the bookings, our sales pipeline is looking up versus where it was a quarter or 2 ago. The performance of our products is improving, so our teams have done a great job of resolving the product issues. And I think we're seeing broader customer receptivity to the strategy of the integrated supply chain. So we have a lot of work to do in transportation, Kristen. But -- so I'm not -- we're not changing the outlook that things won't -- will get better immediately, but we do look to see improved trends toward the back half of the year and especially the fourth quarter."

So it's almost like the tail wagging the dog where that software is driving the demand for the hardware. 
There's also new -- there's also examples of, I would call them, new categories. So take our laser scanner, 3D laser scanner. It is an instrument called the X7. That's a market segment where we didn't historically drive as much business. So that's not a replacement market for us. That's a new, new.

First thing I'd say is that in terms of what I'll call cost generated by COVID, we didn't have much. The impact of COVID on our cost was really negative. We had some costs in our -- cleaning our facilities and that kind of thing, but it was relatively de minimis. So we had sort of artificially low costs in a number of areas with the revenue coming down, our incentive comp naturally reduced, we stopped traveling, canceled events and we really cut back on a lot of discretionary spending that wasn't core to the strategy. So that's coming back. 
And as you look at the operating expense growth going forward, I'll put it in a handful of buckets. First of all, some of our OpEx is overseas and the U.S. dollar has weakened. So just the FX impact sort of takes up our -- accounts for about 20% of our OpEx increase that we expect in the -- for the balance of the year. About 60% of the increase is what I'll call, go back to normal, as travel comes back, as incentive comp comes back as we start hiring. We didn't even have a salary increase last year, so that's a normal part of things. And then about 20% -- the remaining 20% of the year-on-year OpEx increase will be accounted for in higher spending in the investment areas that Rob mentioned. There are a couple of other things that are puts and takes. You've got some other headcount adds and divestitures. But hopefully, that gives you a broad bucketing. And we do think year-on-year OpEx, which was about flat in Q1, it won't be flat in the remaining quarters."

And you can look at entities such as ABI and Dodge and they're up, we look at OEM units. Those have been pretty good from both the construction and agriculture side, even mining in places like South Africa and Australia, where we have some exposure. Those have been good. So let's call it that general commercial work office buildings, that's low. Education is actually -- it's a bigger market than you might -- one might realize. And so it's still lower, but it's still a large number. And so that's doing okay. 
Geographically speaking, actually, it's a pretty broad-based strength. So Japan was strong, Australia strong, North America strong, Western Europe and the Nordics are strong. And we see it play through both in software -- I assume, I'm giving you some software answer, but we see it playing through in hardware. So for instance, when residential work picks up, we don't actually have as much exposure in residential on the building software side, but it helps us on the civil side, and it helps us on the Geospatial business. So in Civil Construction, we see more of the smaller building construction product-type equipment. Even some of that equipment is using technology or concrete screens for foundation work.

The other side of it is as we look at other business models, so say, for example, hardware where -- and they take in the machine control guidance business where we offer, we call it Trimble Platform as a Service. So to have technology assurance by buying the machine control technology, we're bundling that with software that allows us to connect that physical digital field and the office.

So our belief is that we can create more customer goodwill with the approach of the carrot. And so the carrot that we can offer, I'll use that machine control example, the fundamental value proposition around technology assurance, so staying current on the sensors. Staying current actually on the firmware that embedded software, you'd be surprised at how many customers can have outdated versions of the firmware. And when we can have a deeper insight to actually into the customer and help and drive customer success, I believe that's giving them a better value proposition and a better ROI on their investment. The classic one, as you know, as you move from perpetual to subscription is to move IT operations off center for a customer, and that's providing them a value proposition that I would characterize as a carrot. 
And then one more I would mention, Jason, is I think a smart -- we think, a smart way to do, to provide the carrot, is to increase -- I'll call it, increase the value of the offering when you move to the subscription. So in some cases, we're offering both the perpetual and the subscription offering. However, when you buy the subscription offering, you're getting a richer set of functionality. And we'll start to only develop additional functionality in the cloud because you have to make that break at some point. And we think that by providing the better value offering, that, that is consistent with the carrot approach as opposed to the stick. Now that doesn't mean that we'll do both offerings forever. At some point, you do have to wind it down. But thus far, we've given ample time to our customers to consider their own choices."

Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website and we ask you to please refer to the safe harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2 with the key messages we want to convey today. 
In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.32 billion, up 9% year-over-year, total revenue growth of 12%, EBITDA of 26% and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $745 million. Our results demonstrate the quality of our business model and an improving macroeconomic backdrop. They also highlight the strength of our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. On the basis of this competitive strength and the nature of the opportunities we see in the market, we plan to scale up investments in targeted areas of the company. At the same time, we are also raising our guidance for the year. 
Turning to Page 3 and the end market backdrop, the common thread across the industries we serve is delivering products and services that connect the physical and digital worlds. The industries we serve are large, global, underserved and underpenetrated with technology. As our end markets digitize, we are able to connect the office and the field with our hardware and our software offerings in a manner that delivers productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. 
In Buildings and Infrastructure, we exceeded expectations in the business, leveraging our strong market position and continuing the conversion of our business models. The segment now stands at approximately 65% software-related revenue. 
In Geospatial, the business experienced the strongest year-over-year growth we have seen since we created the reporting segment in 2017. Global demand is healthy and the innovation that the team has delivered has strengthened our competitive position. 
In Transportation, we met the P&L expectations we had for the segment in the quarter. Bookings in our mobility business improved to the best level since early 2019. Bookings in our Transportation Enterprise Software business were strong, with subscription bookings more than double the level of our first quarter 2020. We remain confident that we will deliver demonstrable improvement in revenue, margins and ARR trends in the second half of the year. 
In Resources and Utilities, the commodity price backdrop is providing global tailwinds to the business. and we delivered growth well ahead of our expectations. 
Let's turn next to Page 4 for some proof points on the Trimble Operating System: capturing strategy, people and execution. On strategy, we continue to execute on revenue transition opportunities. Our Tekla design and engineering software business announced its shift to subscription that went into effect in March. Different but better is our tagline and I think that sums it up well, which is to say it's more than just change, it's progress. 
Our mechanical electrical plumbing business also continued its subscription conversion. And as mentioned, we saw a strong level of recurring bookings in our Transportation Enterprise business. 
Finally, I'd like to note that we closed the divestiture of the Manhattan real estate software business early in the second quarter, and we wish the team well in its new home. 
On people, I am pleased to report that we ranked #15 out of 15,000 companies in the 2021 Best Global Culture Survey. I also want to announce that our CTO, Tom Fansler, retires at the end of the second quarter. Two of our other business leaders, Ron Antevy and Bryn Fosburgh, will assume new roles starting in the third quarter. 
Ron will operate as an entrepreneur in residence, driving innovation efforts, and Bryn will act as our interim CTO. I'm pleased to say that we promoted from within for Ron and Bryn's current responsibilities for the e-Builder and overall construction businesses, respectively. 
On execution, we released our sustainability report a few weeks ago. I'm incredibly proud of the work of the team on this important initiative. Our teams also continue to innovate. We launched a civil construction estimating software package. We released a combination of our load right payload management system with our Earthworks Grade Control Platform. 
We launched a new TSC5 data controller and we released a new SX12 scanning total station, which is an update to our successful SX10 instrument. The SX12 now supports additional applications in tunneling and underground construction. 
With respect to increasing investments in the business, we see Connect & Scale as being synonymous with an industry platform strategy. We want to play offense and invest now for the mid- to long-term opportunities that we see in the market. We see a generational opportunity out of a North America infrastructure bill and a strong commodity price backdrop in the agriculture market. 
We will invest in product development and go-to-market efforts around infrastructure and will step up investments in our agriculture business, all while continuing to invest in our Trimble cloud platform and our autonomy efforts. 
A quick update on our plans for an Investor Day. We have concluded that an in-person meeting at our Colorado facility, where much of our leadership team is based, is the best way to facilitate the kind of in-depth interaction that many of you want from an Investor Day. We will hold the meeting in the spring of 2022, by which time the environment for business travel should be greatly improved. We also plan to hold 1 or 2 interactive virtual sessions with investors on specific topics of broad interest later this year. 
In closing, I'm as confident and optimistic about Trimble as ever. We have the right team pursuing a compelling strategy in attractive markets. It won't be easy, and it won't be linear, but nothing worth achieving is. 
David, over to you."

Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of first quarter results. First quarter revenue was $887 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3% and divestitures subtracted 1% for a total organic revenue increase of 1",1220,"Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of first quarter results. First quarter revenue was $887 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3% and divestitures subtracted 1% for a total organic revenue increase of 10%. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 58.4%. Margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by product mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.1%, up 340 basis points, driven both by higher revenue and strong cost control. Operating income margins expanded 330 basis points to 23.6%. Net income dollars increased by 36% and earnings per share increased by $0.17 to $0.66 per share. 
Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $228 million, demonstrating the continued strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow again exceeded net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $218 million. We paid down $158 million of debt in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1.3x. 
At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $265 million in cash. With our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. 
Turning now to Slide 6, I'll review in more detail our first quarter revenue trends. As mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 9% in the quarter. Our nonrecurring revenue streams also grew with hardware growing 17% and perpetual software growing 11%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction, geospatial and agriculture. Our hardware growth also contributed to perpetual software growth as some of our hardware offerings are bundled with perpetual software. 
From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 9%. Excluding transportation, revenues in North America grew 15%. In Europe, revenues were up 16%. Roughly half of our Europe growth was driven by currency with the balance coming from catch-up on project activity slowed in 2020, fiscal stimulus measures and recovering demand in many end markets. 
Asia Pacific had the best performance in the quarter, up 17%, driven by strong growth in Australia and Japan. The rest of world, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 5% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector. 
Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. Annualized recurring revenue was $1.32 billion in the first quarter, up 9% on a year-over-year basis. Organic ARR growth was approximately 7%. Excluding our Transportation segment, Trimble ARR grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, was negative this quarter, representing approximately minus 1% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Research and development on a trailing 12-month basis was 15% of revenue. Our deferred revenue grew 12% on a year-over-year basis and our backlog, excluding the impact of the real estate software business divested early in the second quarter, was $1.4 billion, up 17% versus prior year. 
While growing backlog is obviously an indicator of strong momentum in the business, I'll note here that backlog at quarter end was unusually high, in part because Trimble, like so many manufacturers in this recovering economy, is experiencing shortages and extended delivery times for many key components of our hardware products. Our operations team is hard at work to expedite delivery of products, which are in short supply, but we do expect to manage challenges with both cost inflation and extended lead times of select hardware product lines in the quarters to come. 
Turning now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 13% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our Building and Civil Construction businesses. Segment margins were up 760 basis points due to higher-margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 22% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core branded survey equipment business. Margins were up 590 basis points due to strong revenue growth and cost control. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 10% on an organic basis. We experienced double-digit growth in each of our precision agriculture, positioning services and agriculture software offerings. Margins expanded 190 basis points, driven by increased revenue and cost control. 
Top line results in Transportation were consistent with our expectations. Revenue was down 6% on an organic basis year-on-year and margins declined 450 basis points. The drivers of revenue and margin decline are broadly consistent with those we have highlighted previously. Revenue and margins were roughly stable sequentially when compared with the fourth quarter of last year and leading indicators provide encouraging signs for the recovery ahead. 
As Rob mentioned, bookings were very strong in both our mobility and enterprise software businesses. Our product performance is improving, and our sales pipeline is stronger than it has been in nearly 2 years. We remain confident that we are on track to improve performance later this year. 
Moving to Slide 9, I'll provide an update to our outlook for the year. Given our outperformance in the first quarter, our growing backlog and increasing confidence in our business trends, we are raising our revenue forecast range by $100 million to $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. I'll note here that the biggest risk we have to our revenue outlook for the next couple of quarters is the supply environment for critical hardware components. We expect that revenue growth will be strongest in the second quarter as we lapped the worst period of the COVID lockdowns in 2020, with more moderate growth in the back half of the year and especially in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to expect organic ARR growth in the high single digits with improving trends as the year progresses. From a profitability perspective, we continue to expect that EBITDA margins will come in between the levels of 2019 and 2020. Margins for the balance of 2021 and especially in the second half of the year, are likely to come down from the levels we achieved in the first quarter for a number of reasons. 
First, we expect some operating expense acceleration as the year progresses in the environment for business travel opens up. Second, we are accelerating investments that Rob mentioned earlier. These investments include spending on our digital transformation and cloud infrastructure and higher R&D on our autonomy projects and our agriculture product offerings. And third, we are seeing growing cost pressure in our hardware cost of goods across a broad range of commodities. We are adapting our pricing and discounting strategies to reflect these cost pressures, but still anticipate some adverse impact on our gross margins. 
We continue to expect that software business model transitions from perpetual to recurring will impact revenue growth and operating margins by approximately 150 basis points. Our earnings per share outlook is raised to $2.30 to $2.50. This reflects the revenue and operating margin trends I mentioned earlier and a modestly higher tax rate outlook than we had anticipated a quarter ago. From a cash flow perspective, we expect cash flow from operations of approximately 1.1x net income with free cash flow exceeding net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

I'll say the environment for product cost has changed a lot just in the last month or 2 and it's a fluid situation, so it's hard to make specific predictions. I will say that the product inflation that we're facing really only began toward the end of Q1. So the results that we just reported don't reflect the full impact we anticipate later this year. And you saw our gross margins decline year-on-year about 70 basis points and probably just under half of that can be accounted for in product cost increases. 
But we're seeing increases across the board. Obviously, we're all reading about semiconductor type supply and cost increases, but we're really seeing it across a whole broad range of commodities in transportation, particularly air transportation that we use to get our products where we need them to go. So without getting too specific, I'll say that we do expect underlying cost of goods inflation for the balance of the year to be noticeably higher than it was in Q1. 
Now I'll comment that we're adapting, as I mentioned in the script, our discounting strategy and our top line prices, and we hope to accommodate a meaningful portion of the impact of the cost increases. But nonetheless, we expect gross margins will come down for that reason in the remaining 3 quarters of the year. 
And then I'll turn it over to Rob for your questions about operating expense and the investments we're making."

So we see it as a generational opportunity, and I'll focus on North America, but highlight the places like the U.K. are going with a construction-led recovery. We see markets like Japan promoting digital technologies, Australia has strong infrastructure development as well. 
In North America, I think about it from the value proposition of what the technology can do. We think about the funding around that. And we mentioned that we would -- in respect to our own funding, we would step up investments in the area. And then we also think about policy. 
So from a value proposition perspective, with digital technology, we can build greener. We can build more inclusively and we can build better while doing so cheaper, so it just makes sense to use the technology. What we're hearing from customers and stakeholders in the industry actually is on the policy side as well as a desire to streamline project delivery by promoting the digital technology. So really streamlining project delivery really seems to be the core of what the market is talking about. 
And from a funding perspective, I'll start with government level funding. And we do anticipate that the final amount will be well negotiated, and it will be different than the proposed American Jobs Plan. Nevertheless, and we need to also reauthorize the Surface Transportation bill. So the Jobs Plan in addition to the reauthorization of the Surface Transportation bill, we think that will be significant, we think it will be incremental to the current baseline investments in our highways, airports, mass transit and our ports. 
Now we think that won't pass until later in the year and the benefits of that wouldn't be realized in 2022. So when we think about the investments in our business to get ahead of that, we think both at a product development level as well as a go-to-market level. So at a product development level, where we're going with the Connect part of Connect & Scale is integrating the hardware, the software, the physical, the digital, the office, the field, being able to round trip that data to streamline project delivery, so we'll continue our efforts on that front. 
And at a go-to-market level, it's putting the resources -- increase the level of resources and capabilities in place to actually execute against what we think is an attractive and important opportunity."

And I think about it from a few dynamics. I'll address owners, engineers and contractors. At an owner level, think about the Department of Transportation as an owner, to talk about state DOT as an owner. I do think there's increasing awareness of the technology. There's certainly increasing awareness of the concept of the digital twin and how this can play through the operations and maintenance phase. And if we use the technology during the design, engineering and construction phase, how that can then be leveraged in the operations and maintenance phase. 
So I think there is increased awareness. We see a few more projects that are promoting the use of technology. Actually, the Federal Highway Administration, they made an announcement recently to -- recognize the digital as-builts, it's an important technology innovation. So that's helpful to see that coming from that perspective. 
And the engineering community, certainly, it's in the interest of the engineering community to help build to deliver the projects better and faster, and for them to be able to win more of the work. And then at the contractor level, I'd see that's where we see the most level of proactive use and request for use of technology, because the contractors are the ones who are -- they're really seeing the most tactical benefit of better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener in their day-to-day work. So they're winning more work, it's becoming more just the way that construction is done. So very positive on the contractor side."

So that's going to factor in. 
As far as the end markets that are driving the results, we mentioned in Transportation, we ended about where we thought we would, P&L-wise, but bookings were up. And obviously, the transportation market has picked up in terms of the macros with asset utilization and pricing and the financial solidity of our transportation customers is better. So that's more a tailwind for future quarters than this one. 
But look, beyond that, in the other 3 segments, we exceeded our expectations. So that's why the outlook came up in part because Q1 was above where we thought it would be, and we think some of those trends will continue. And the caution I'll provide is that hardware is still a meaningful part of our business. And for all the reasons I mentioned with the supply chain challenges, that's creating the greatest level of uncertainty.

And we did have some product performance issues. And so the pullback in ARR was a consequence of that. There's no doubt that the macros in the transportation business are dramatically better than they were 3 to 4 quarters ago, and that's helpful. 
Our trends -- our business trends won't change linearly and right away with the changes in the macroenvironment that the customers that we serve, experience. So it's not at all surprising to any of us that we have some lag. 
But I'll say there are a number of factors that give us confidence that we're on the road back to better trends in Transportation. Just I'll highlight a few. Our churn is trending down. On a secular basis, there are bumps quarter-to-quarter as individual customers implement decisions they made some time ago. But the data surely points to a better trend there. 
Rob mentioned the bookings, even beyond the bookings, our sales pipeline is looking up versus where it was a quarter or 2 ago. The performance of our products is improving, so our teams have done a great job of resolving the product issues. And I think we're seeing broader customer receptivity to the strategy of the integrated supply chain. So we have a lot of work to do in transportation, Kristen. But -- so I'm not -- we're not changing the outlook that things won't -- will get better immediately, but we do look to see improved trends toward the back half of the year and especially the fourth quarter."

We've got a tighter integration of our software workflows into the hardware. So we've seen customers who are orienting their field survey crews around a Trimble workflow. So it's almost like the tail wagging the dog where that software is driving the demand for the hardware. 
There's also new -- there's also examples of, I would call them, new categories. So take our laser scanner, 3D laser scanner. It is an instrument called the X7.

First thing I'd say is that in terms of what I'll call cost generated by COVID, we didn't have much. The impact of COVID on our cost was really negative. We had some costs in our -- cleaning our facilities and that kind of thing, but it was relatively de minimis. So we had sort of artificially low costs in a number of areas with the revenue coming down, our incentive comp naturally reduced, we stopped traveling, canceled events and we really cut back on a lot of discretionary spending that wasn't core to the strategy. 
So that's coming back. And as you look at the operating expense growth going forward, I'll put it in a handful of buckets. First of all, some of our OpEx is overseas and the U.S. dollar has weakened. So just the FX impact sort of takes up our -- accounts for about 20% of our OpEx increase that we expect in the -- for the balance of the year. 
About 60% of the increase is what I'll call, go back to normal, as travel comes back, as incentive comp comes back as we start hiring. We didn't even have a salary increase last year, so that's a normal part of things. And then about 20% -- the remaining 20% of the year-on-year OpEx increase will be accounted for in higher spending in the investment areas that Rob mentioned. There are a couple of other things that are puts and takes. You've got some other headcount adds and divestitures. But hopefully, that gives you a broad bucketing.

Geographically speaking, actually, it's a pretty broad-based strength. So Japan was strong, Australia strong, North America strong, Western Europe and the Nordics are strong. And we see it play through both in software -- I assume, I'm giving you some software answer, but we see it playing through in hardware. So for instance, when residential work picks up, we don't actually have as much exposure in residential on the building software side, but it helps us on the civil side, and it helps us on the Geospatial business, so in Civil Construction, we see more of the smaller building construction product-type equipment.

So our belief is that we can create more customer goodwill with the approach of the carrot. And so the carrot that we can offer, I'll use that machine control example, the fundamental value proposition around technology assurance, so staying current on the sensors. 
Staying current actually on the firmware that embedded software, you'd be surprised at how many customers can have outdated versions of the firmware. And when we can have a deeper insight to actually into the customer and help and drive customer success, I believe that's giving them a better value proposition and a better ROI on their investment. The classic one, as you know, as you move from perpetual to subscription is to move IT operations off center for a customer, and that's providing them a value proposition that I would characterize as a carrot. 
And then one more I would mention, Jason, is I think a smart -- we think, a smart way to do, to provide the carrot, is to increase -- I'll call it, increase the value of the offering when you move to the subscription. So in some cases, we're offering both the perpetual and the subscription offering. However, when you buy the subscription offering, you're getting a richer set of functionality. 
And we'll start to only develop additional functionality in the cloud because you have to make that break at some point. And we think that by providing the better value offering, that, that is consistent with the carrot approach as opposed to the stick. Now that doesn't mean that we'll do both offerings forever. At some point, you do have to wind it down. But thus far, we've given ample time to our customers to consider their own choices."

Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website and we ask you to please refer to the safe harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2 with the key messages we want to convey today. 
In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.32 billion, up 9% year-over-year, total revenue growth of 12%, EBITDA of 26% and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $745 million. Our results demonstrate the quality of our business model and an improving macroeconomic backdrop. They also highlight the strength of our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. On the basis of this competitive strength and the nature of the opportunities we see in the market, we plan to scale up investments in targeted areas of the company. At the same time, we are also raising our guidance for the year. 
Turning to Page 3 and the end market backdrop, the common thread across the industries we serve is delivering products and services that connect the physical and digital worlds. The industries we serve are large, global, underserved and underpenetrated with technology. As our end markets digitize, we are able to connect the office and the field with our hardware and our software offerings in a manner that delivers productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. 
In Buildings and Infrastructure, we exceeded expectations in the business, leveraging our strong market position and continuing the conversion of our business models. The segment now stands at approximately 65% software-related revenue. 
In Geospatial, the business experienced the strongest year-over-year growth we have seen since we created the reporting segment in 2017. Global demand is healthy and the innovation that the team has delivered has strengthened our competitive position. 
In Transportation, we met the P&L expectations we had for the segment in the quarter. Bookings in our mobility business improved to the best level since early 2019. Bookings in our Transportation Enterprise Software business were strong, with subscription bookings more than double the level of our first quarter 2020. We remain confident that we will deliver demonstrable improvement in revenue, margins and ARR trends in the second half of the year. 
In Resources and Utilities, the commodity price backdrop is providing global tailwinds to the business. and we delivered growth well ahead of our expectations. 
Let's turn next to Page 4 for some proof points on the Trimble Operating System: capturing strategy, people and execution. On strategy, we continue to execute on revenue transition opportunities. Our Tekla design and engineering software business announced its shift to subscription that went into effect in March. Different but better is our tagline and I think that sums it up well, which is to say it's more than just change, it's progress. 
Our mechanical electrical plumbing business also continued its subscription conversion. And as mentioned, we saw a strong level of recurring bookings in our Transportation Enterprise business. 
Finally, I'd like to note that we closed the divestiture of the Manhattan real estate software business early in the second quarter, and we wish the team well in its new home. 
On people, I am pleased to report that we ranked #15 out of 15,000 companies in the 2021 Best Global Culture Survey. I also want to announce that our CTO, Tom Fansler, retires at the end of the second quarter. Two of our other business leaders, Ron Antevy and Bryn Fosburgh, will assume new roles starting in the third quarter. 
Ron will operate as an entrepreneur in residence, driving innovation efforts, and Bryn will act as our interim CTO. I'm pleased to say that we promoted from within for Ron and Bryn's current responsibilities for the e-Builder and overall construction businesses, respectively. 
On execution, we released our sustainability report a few weeks ago. I'm incredibly proud of the work of the team on this important initiative. Our teams also continue to innovate. We launched a civil construction estimating software package. We released a combination of our LOADRITE payload management system with our Earthworks Grade Control Platform. 
We launched a new TSC5 data controller and we released a new SX12 scanning total station, which is an update to our successful SX10 instrument. The SX12 now supports additional applications in tunneling and underground construction. 
With respect to increasing investments in the business, we see Connect & Scale as being synonymous with an industry platform strategy. We want to play offense and invest now for the mid- to long-term opportunities that we see in the market. We see a generational opportunity out of a North America infrastructure bill and a strong commodity price backdrop in the agriculture market. 
We will invest in product development and go-to-market efforts around infrastructure and will step up investments in our agriculture business, all while continuing to invest in our Trimble cloud platform and our autonomy efforts. 
A quick update on our plans for an Investor Day. We have concluded that an in-person meeting at our Colorado facility, where much of our leadership team is based, is the best way to facilitate the kind of in-depth interaction that many of you want from an Investor Day. We will hold the meeting in the spring of 2022, by which time the environment for business travel should be greatly improved. We also plan to hold 1 or 2 interactive virtual sessions with investors on specific topics of broad interest later this year. 
In closing, I'm as confident and optimistic about Trimble as ever. We have the right team pursuing a compelling strategy in attractive markets. It won't be easy, and it won't be linear, but nothing worth achieving is. 
David, over to you."

Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of first quarter results. First quarter revenue was $887 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3% and divestitures subtracted 1% for a total organic revenue increase of 1",1220,"Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of first quarter results. First quarter revenue was $887 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3% and divestitures subtracted 1% for a total organic revenue increase of 10%. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 58.4%. Margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by product mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.1%, up 340 basis points, driven both by higher revenue and strong cost control. Operating income margins expanded 330 basis points to 23.6%. Net income dollars increased by 36% and earnings per share increased by $0.17 to $0.66 per share. 
Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $228 million, demonstrating the continued strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow again exceeded net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $218 million. We paid down $158 million of debt in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1.3x. 
At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $265 million in cash. With our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. 
Turning now to Slide 6, I'll review in more detail our first quarter revenue trends. As mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 9% in the quarter. Our nonrecurring revenue streams also grew with hardware growing 17% and perpetual software growing 11%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction, geospatial and agriculture. Our hardware growth also contributed to perpetual software growth as some of our hardware offerings are bundled with perpetual software. 
From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 9%. Excluding transportation, revenues in North America grew 15%. In Europe, revenues were up 16%. Roughly half of our Europe growth was driven by currency with the balance coming from catch-up on project activity slowed in 2020, fiscal stimulus measures and recovering demand in many end markets. 
Asia Pacific had the best performance in the quarter, up 17%, driven by strong growth in Australia and Japan. The rest of world, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 5% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector. 
Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. Annualized recurring revenue was $1.32 billion in the first quarter, up 9% on a year-over-year basis. Organic ARR growth was approximately 7%. Excluding our Transportation segment, Trimble ARR grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, was negative this quarter, representing approximately minus 1% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Research and development on a trailing 12-month basis was 15% of revenue. Our deferred revenue grew 12% on a year-over-year basis and our backlog, excluding the impact of the real estate software business divested early in the second quarter, was $1.4 billion, up 17% versus prior year. 
While growing backlog is obviously an indicator of strong momentum in the business, I'll note here that backlog at quarter end was unusually high, in part because Trimble, like so many manufacturers in this recovering economy, is experiencing shortages and extended delivery times for many key components of our hardware products. Our operations team is hard at work to expedite delivery of products, which are in short supply, but we do expect to manage challenges with both cost inflation and extended lead times of select hardware product lines in the quarters to come. 
Turning now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 13% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our Building and Civil Construction businesses. Segment margins were up 760 basis points due to higher-margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 22% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core branded survey equipment business. Margins were up 590 basis points due to strong revenue growth and cost control. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 10% on an organic basis. We experienced double-digit growth in each of our precision agriculture, positioning services and agriculture software offerings. Margins expanded 190 basis points, driven by increased revenue and cost control. 
Top line results in Transportation were consistent with our expectations. Revenue was down 6% on an organic basis year-on-year and margins declined 450 basis points. The drivers of revenue and margin decline are broadly consistent with those we have highlighted previously. Revenue and margins were roughly stable sequentially when compared with the fourth quarter of last year and leading indicators provide encouraging signs for the recovery ahead. 
As Rob mentioned, bookings were very strong in both our mobility and enterprise software businesses. Our product performance is improving, and our sales pipeline is stronger than it has been in nearly 2 years. We remain confident that we are on track to improve performance later this year. 
Moving to Slide 9, I'll provide an update to our outlook for the year. Given our outperformance in the first quarter, our growing backlog and increasing confidence in our business trends, we are raising our revenue forecast range by $100 million to $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. I'll note here that the biggest risk we have to our revenue outlook for the next couple of quarters is the supply environment for critical hardware components. We expect that revenue growth will be strongest in the second quarter as we lapped the worst period of the COVID lockdowns in 2020, with more moderate growth in the back half of the year and especially in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to expect organic ARR growth in the high single digits with improving trends as the year progresses. From a profitability perspective, we continue to expect that EBITDA margins will come in between the levels of 2019 and 2020. Margins for the balance of 2021 and especially in the second half of the year, are likely to come down from the levels we achieved in the first quarter for a number of reasons. 
First, we expect some operating expense acceleration as the year progresses and the environment for business travel opens up. Second, we are accelerating investments that Rob mentioned earlier. These investments include spending on our digital transformation and cloud infrastructure and higher R&D on our autonomy projects and our agriculture product offerings. And third, we are seeing growing cost pressure in our hardware cost of goods across a broad range of commodities. We are adapting our pricing and discounting strategies to reflect these cost pressures, but still anticipate some adverse impact on our gross margins. 
We continue to expect that software business model transitions from perpetual to recurring will impact revenue growth and operating margins by approximately 150 basis points. Our earnings per share outlook is raised to $2.30 to $2.50. This reflects the revenue and operating margin trends I mentioned earlier and a modestly higher tax rate outlook than we had anticipated a quarter ago. From a cash flow perspective, we expect cash flow from operations of approximately 1.1x net income with free cash flow exceeding net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

I'll say the environment for product cost has changed a lot just in the last month or 2 and it's a fluid situation, so it's hard to make specific predictions. I will say that the product inflation that we're facing really only began toward the end of Q1. So the results that we just reported don't reflect the full impact we anticipate later this year. And you saw our gross margins decline year-on-year about 70 basis points and probably just under half of that can be accounted for in product cost increases. 
But we're seeing increases across the board. Obviously, we're all reading about semiconductor type supply and cost increases, but we're really seeing it across a whole broad range of commodities in transportation, particularly air transportation that we use to get our products where we need them to go. So without getting too specific, I'll say that we do expect underlying cost of goods inflation for the balance of the year to be noticeably higher than it was in Q1. 
Now I'll comment that we're adapting, as I mentioned in the script, our discounting strategy and our top line prices, and we hope to accommodate a meaningful portion of the impact of the cost increases. But nonetheless, we expect gross margins will come down for that reason in the remaining 3 quarters of the year. 
And then I'll turn it over to Rob for your questions about operating expense and the investments we're making."

So we see it as a generational opportunity, and I'll focus on North America, but highlight the places like the U.K. are going with a construction-led recovery. We see markets like Japan promoting digital technologies, Australia has strong infrastructure development as well. 
In North America, I think about it from the value proposition of what the technology can do. We think about the funding around that. And we mentioned that we would -- in respect to our own funding, we would step up investments in the area. And then we also think about policy. 
So from a value proposition perspective, with digital technology, we can build greener. We can build more inclusively and we can build better while doing so cheaper, so it just makes sense to use the technology. What we're hearing from customers and stakeholders in the industry actually is on the policy side as well as a desire to streamline project delivery by promoting the digital technology. So really streamlining project delivery really seems to be the core of what the market is talking about. 
And from a funding perspective, I'll start with government level funding. And we do anticipate that the final amount will be well negotiated, and it will be different than the proposed American Jobs Plan. Nevertheless, and we need to also reauthorize the Surface Transportation bill. So the Jobs Plan in addition to the reauthorization of the Surface Transportation bill, we think that will be significant, we think it will be incremental to the current baseline investments in our highways, airports, mass transit and our ports. 
Now we think that won't pass until later in the year and the benefits of that wouldn't be realized in 2022. So when we think about the investments in our business to get ahead of that, we think both at a product development level as well as a go-to-market level. So at a product development level, where we're going with the Connect part of Connect & Scale is integrating the hardware, the software, the physical, the digital, the office, the field, being able to round trip that data to streamline project delivery, so we'll continue our efforts on that front. 
And at a go-to-market level, it's putting the resources -- increase the level of resources and capabilities in place to actually execute against what we think is an attractive and important opportunity."

And I think about it from a few dynamics. I'll address owners, engineers and contractors. At an owner level, think about the Department of Transportation as an owner, to talk about state DOT as an owner. I do think there's increasing awareness of the technology. There's certainly increasing awareness of the concept of the digital twin and how this can play through the operations and maintenance phase. And if we use the technology during the design, engineering and construction phase, how that can then be leveraged in the operations and maintenance phase. 
So I think there is increased awareness. We see a few more projects that are promoting the use of technology. Actually, the Federal Highway Administration, they made an announcement recently to -- recognize the digital as-built as it's an important technology innovation. So that's helpful to see that coming from that perspective. 
And the engineering community, certainly, it's in the interest of the engineering community to help build to deliver the projects better and faster, and for them to be able to win more of the work. And then at the contractor level, I see that's where we see the most level of proactive use and requests for use of technology, because the contractors are the ones who are -- they're really seeing the most tactical benefit of better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener in their day-to-day work. So they're winning more work, it's becoming more just the way that construction is done. So very positive on the contractor side."

Chad, this is David. I'll say, first of all, that comparing quarter-to-quarter last year is a tough drill because last year was so strange and particularly as you recall, Q2, we saw rapid contraction in demand in many of our end markets and then a lot of catch-up and pickup later in the year. So that's going to factor in. 
As far as the end markets that are driving the results, we mentioned in Transportation, we ended about where we thought we would, P&L-wise, but bookings were up. And obviously, the transportation market has picked up in terms of the macros with asset utilization and pricing and the financial solidity of our transportation customers is better. So that's more a tailwind for future quarters than this one. 
But look, beyond that, in the other 3 segments, we exceeded our expectations. So that's why the outlook came up in part because Q1 was above where we thought it would be, and we think some of those trends will continue. And the caution I'll provide is that hardware is still a meaningful part of our business. And for all the reasons I mentioned with the supply chain challenges, that's creating the greatest level of uncertainty. 
So I don't know if that answers your questions about seasonality. We do think seasonality will be different in 2021 from 2020 for a number of reasons, and you're probably better off comparing with 2019 for a normalized year."

And we did have some product performance issues. And so the pullback in ARR was a consequence of that. There's no doubt that the macros in the transportation business are dramatically better than they were 3 to 4 quarters ago, and that's helpful. 
Our trends -- our business trends won't change linearly and right away with the changes in the macroenvironment that the customers that we serve, experience. So it's not at all surprising to any of us that we have some lag. 
But I'll say there are a number of factors that give us confidence that we're on the road back to better trends in Transportation. Just I'll highlight a few. Our churn is trending down. On a secular basis, there are bumps quarter-to-quarter as individual customers implement decisions they made some time ago. But the data surely points to a better trend there. 
Rob mentioned the bookings, even beyond the bookings, our sales pipeline is looking up versus where it was a quarter or 2 ago. The performance of our products is improving, so our teams have done a great job of resolving the product issues. And I think we're seeing broader customer receptivity to the strategy of the integrated supply chain. So we have a lot of work to do in transportation, Kristen.

We've got a tighter integration of our software workflows into the hardware. So we've seen customers who are orienting their field survey crews around a Trimble workflow. So it's almost like the tail wagging the dog where that software is driving the demand for the hardware. 
There's also new -- there's also examples of, I would call them, new categories. So take our laser scanner, 3D laser scanner. It is an instrument called the X7.

First thing I'd say is that in terms of what I'll call cost generated by COVID, we didn't have much. The impact of COVID on our cost was really negative. We had some costs in our -- cleaning our facilities and that kind of thing, but it was relatively de minimis. So we had sort of artificially low costs in a number of areas with the revenue coming down, our incentive comp naturally reduced, we stopped traveling, canceled events and we really cut back on a lot of discretionary spending that wasn't core to the strategy. 
So that's coming back. And as you look at the operating expense growth going forward, I'll put it in a handful of buckets. First of all, some of our OpEx is overseas and the U.S. dollar has weakened. So just the FX impact sort of takes up our -- accounts for about 20% of our OpEx increase that we expect in the -- for the balance of the year. 
About 60% of the increase is what I'll call, go back to normal, as travel comes back, as incentive comp comes back as we start hiring. We didn't even have a salary increase last year, so that's a normal part of things. And then about 20% -- the remaining 20% of the year-on-year OpEx increase will be accounted for in higher spending in the investment areas that Rob mentioned. There are a couple of other things that are puts and takes. You've got some other headcount adds and divestitures. But hopefully, that gives you a broad bucketing.

So for instance, when residential work picks up, we don't actually have as much exposure in residential on the building software side, but it helps us on the civil side, and it helps us on the Geospatial business, so in Civil Construction, we see more of the smaller building construction product-type equipment.

The other side of it is as we look at other business models, so say, for example, hardware where -- and they take in the machine control guidance business where we offer, we call it Trimble Platform as a Service. So to have technology assurance by buying the machine control technology, we're bundling that with software that allows us to connect that physical digital field and the office.

So our belief is that we can create more customer goodwill with the approach of the carrot. And so the carrot that we can offer, I'll use that machine control example, the fundamental value proposition around technology assurance, so staying current on the sensors. 
Staying current actually on the firmware that embedded software, you'd be surprised at how many customers can have outdated versions of the firmware. And when we can have a deeper insight actually into the customer and help and drive customer success, I believe that's giving them a better value proposition and a better ROI on their investment. The classic one, as you know, as you move from perpetual to subscription is to move IT operations off center for a customer, and that's providing them a value proposition that I would characterize as a carrot. 
And then one more I would mention, Jason, is I think a smart -- we think, a smart way to do, to provide the carrot, is to increase -- I'll call it, increase the value of the offering when you move to the subscription. So in some cases, we're offering both the perpetual and the subscription offering. However, when you buy the subscription offering, you're getting a richer set of functionality. 
And we'll start to only develop additional functionality in the cloud because you have to make that break at some point. And we think that by providing the better value offering, that, that is consistent with the carrot approach as opposed to the stick. Now that doesn't mean that we'll do both offerings forever. At some point, you do have to wind it down. But thus far, we've given ample time to our customers to consider their own choices."

Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website and we ask you to please refer to the safe harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2 with the key messages we want to convey today. 
In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.32 billion, up 9% year-over-year, total revenue growth of 12%, EBITDA of 26% and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $745 million. Our results demonstrate the quality of our business model and an improving macroeconomic backdrop. They also highlight the strength of our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. On the basis of this competitive strength and the nature of the opportunities we see in the market, we plan to scale up investments in targeted areas of the company. At the same time, we are also raising our guidance for the year. 
Turning to Page 3 and the end market backdrop, the common thread across the industries we serve is delivering products and services that connect the physical and digital worlds. The industries we serve are large, global, underserved and underpenetrated with technology. As our end markets digitize, we are able to connect the office and the field with our hardware and our software offerings in a manner that delivers productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. 
In Buildings and Infrastructure, we exceeded expectations in the business, leveraging our strong market position and continuing the conversion of our business models. The segment now stands at approximately 65% software-related revenue. 
In Geospatial, the business experienced the strongest year-over-year growth we have seen since we created the reporting segment in 2017. Global demand is healthy and the innovation that the team has delivered has strengthened our competitive position. 
In Transportation, we met the P&L expectations we had for the segment in the quarter. Bookings in our mobility business improved to the best level since early 2019. Bookings in our Transportation Enterprise Software business were strong, with subscription bookings more than double the level of our first quarter 2020. We remain confident that we will deliver demonstrable improvement in revenue, margins and ARR trends in the second half of the year. 
In Resources and Utilities, the commodity price backdrop is providing global tailwinds to the business. and we delivered growth well ahead of our expectations. 
Let's turn next to Page 4 for some proof points on the Trimble Operating System: capturing strategy, people and execution. On strategy, we continue to execute on revenue transition opportunities. Our Tekla design and engineering software business announced its shift to subscription that went into effect in March. Different but better is our tagline and I think that sums it up well, which is to say it's more than just change, it's progress. 
Our mechanical electrical plumbing business also continued its subscription conversion. And as mentioned, we saw a strong level of recurring bookings in our Transportation Enterprise business. 
Finally, I'd like to note that we closed the divestiture of the Manhattan real estate software business early in the second quarter, and we wish the team well in its new home. 
On people, I am pleased to report that we ranked #15 out of 15,000 companies in the 2021 Best Global Culture Survey. I also want to announce that our CTO, Tom Fansler, retires at the end of the second quarter. Two of our other business leaders, Ron Antevy and Bryn Fosburgh, will assume new roles starting in the third quarter. 
Ron will operate as an entrepreneur in residence, driving innovation efforts, and Bryn will act as our interim CTO. I'm pleased to say that we promoted from within for Ron and Bryn's current responsibilities for the e-Builder and overall construction businesses, respectively. 
On execution, we released our sustainability report a few weeks ago. I'm incredibly proud of the work of the team on this important initiative. Our teams also continue to innovate. We launched a civil construction estimating software package. We released a combination of our LOADRITE payload management system with our Earthworks Grade Control Platform. 
We launched a new TSC5 data controller and we released a new SX12 scanning total station, which is an update to our successful SX10 instrument. The SX12 now supports additional applications in tunneling and underground construction. 
With respect to increasing investments in the business, we see Connect & Scale as being synonymous with an industry platform strategy. We want to play offense and invest now for the mid- to long-term opportunities that we see in the market. We see a generational opportunity out of a North America infrastructure bill and a strong commodity price backdrop in the agriculture market. 
We will invest in product development and go-to-market efforts around infrastructure and will step up investments in our agriculture business, all while continuing to invest in our Trimble cloud platform and our autonomy efforts. 
A quick update on our plans for an Investor Day. We have concluded that an in-person meeting at our Colorado facility, where much of our leadership team is based, is the best way to facilitate the kind of in-depth interaction that many of you want from an Investor Day. We will hold the meeting in the spring of 2022, by which time the environment for business travel should be greatly improved. We also plan to hold 1 or 2 interactive virtual sessions with investors on specific topics of broad interest later this year. 
In closing, I'm as confident and optimistic about Trimble as ever. We have the right team pursuing a compelling strategy in attractive markets. It won't be easy, and it won't be linear, but nothing worth achieving is. 
David, over to you."

Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of first quarter results. First quarter revenue was $887 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3% and divestitures subtracted 1% for a total organic revenue increase of 1",1220,"Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of first quarter results. First quarter revenue was $887 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3% and divestitures subtracted 1% for a total organic revenue increase of 10%. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 58.4%. Margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by product mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.1%, up 340 basis points, driven both by higher revenue and strong cost control. Operating income margins expanded 330 basis points to 23.6%. Net income dollars increased by 36% and earnings per share increased by $0.17 to $0.66 per share. 
Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $228 million, demonstrating the continued strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow again exceeded net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $218 million. We paid down $158 million of debt in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1.3x. 
At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $265 million in cash. With our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. 
Turning now to Slide 6, I'll review in more detail our first quarter revenue trends. As mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 9% in the quarter. Our nonrecurring revenue streams also grew with hardware growing 17% and perpetual software growing 11%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction, geospatial and agriculture. Our hardware growth also contributed to perpetual software growth as some of our hardware offerings are bundled with perpetual software. 
From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 9%. Excluding transportation, revenues in North America grew 15%. In Europe, revenues were up 16%. Roughly half of our Europe growth was driven by currency with the balance coming from catch-up on project activity slowed in 2020, fiscal stimulus measures and recovering demand in many end markets. 
Asia Pacific had the best performance in the quarter, up 17%, driven by strong growth in Australia and Japan. The rest of world, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 5% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector. 
Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. Annualized recurring revenue was $1.32 billion in the first quarter, up 9% on a year-over-year basis. Organic ARR growth was approximately 7%. Excluding our Transportation segment, Trimble ARR grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, was negative this quarter, representing approximately minus 1% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Research and development on a trailing 12-month basis was 15% of revenue. Our deferred revenue grew 12% on a year-over-year basis and our backlog, excluding the impact of the real estate software business divested early in the second quarter, was $1.4 billion, up 17% versus prior year. 
While growing backlog is obviously an indicator of strong momentum in the business, I'll note here that backlog at quarter end was unusually high, in part because Trimble, like so many manufacturers in this recovering economy, is experiencing shortages and extended delivery times for many key components of our hardware products. Our operations team is hard at work to expedite delivery of products, which are in short supply, but we do expect to manage challenges with both cost inflation and extended lead times of select hardware product lines in the quarters to come. 
Turning now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 13% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our Building and Civil Construction businesses. Segment margins were up 760 basis points due to higher-margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 22% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core branded survey equipment business. Margins were up 590 basis points due to strong revenue growth and cost control. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 10% on an organic basis. We experienced double-digit growth in each of our precision agriculture, positioning services and agriculture software offerings. Margins expanded 190 basis points, driven by increased revenue and cost control. 
Top line results in Transportation were consistent with our expectations. Revenue was down 6% on an organic basis year-on-year and margins declined 450 basis points. The drivers of revenue and margin decline are broadly consistent with those we have highlighted previously. Revenue and margins were roughly stable sequentially when compared with the fourth quarter of last year and leading indicators provide encouraging signs for the recovery ahead. 
As Rob mentioned, bookings were very strong in both our mobility and enterprise software businesses. Our product performance is improving, and our sales pipeline is stronger than it has been in nearly 2 years. We remain confident that we are on track to improve performance later this year. 
Moving to Slide 9, I'll provide an update to our outlook for the year. Given our outperformance in the first quarter, our growing backlog and increasing confidence in our business trends, we are raising our revenue forecast range by $100 million to $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. I'll note here that the biggest risk we have to our revenue outlook for the next couple of quarters is the supply environment for critical hardware components. We expect that revenue growth will be strongest in the second quarter as we lapped the worst period of the COVID lockdowns in 2020, with more moderate growth in the back half of the year and especially in the fourth quarter. 
We continue to expect organic ARR growth in the high single digits with improving trends as the year progresses. From a profitability perspective, we continue to expect that EBITDA margins will come in between the levels of 2019 and 2020. Margins for the balance of 2021 and especially in the second half of the year, are likely to come down from the levels we achieved in the first quarter for a number of reasons. 
First, we expect some operating expense acceleration as the year progresses and the environment for business travel opens up. Second, we are accelerating investments that Rob mentioned earlier. These investments include spending on our digital transformation and cloud infrastructure and higher R&D on our autonomy projects and our agriculture product offerings. And third, we are seeing growing cost pressure in our hardware cost of goods across a broad range of commodities. We are adapting our pricing and discounting strategies to reflect these cost pressures, but still anticipate some adverse impact on our gross margins. 
We continue to expect that software business model transitions from perpetual to recurring will impact revenue growth and operating margins by approximately 150 basis points. Our earnings per share outlook is raised to $2.30 to $2.50. This reflects the revenue and operating margin trends I mentioned earlier and a modestly higher tax rate outlook than we had anticipated a quarter ago. From a cash flow perspective, we expect cash flow from operations of approximately 1.1x net income with free cash flow exceeding net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

Obviously, we're all reading about semiconductor type supply and cost increases, but we're really seeing it across a whole broad range of commodities in transportation, particularly air transportation that we use to get our products where we need them to go. So without getting too specific, I'll say that we do expect underlying cost of goods inflation for the balance of the year to be noticeably higher than it was in Q1. 
Now I'll comment that we're adapting, as I mentioned in the script, our discounting strategy and our top line prices, and we hope to accommodate a meaningful portion of the impact of the cost increases. But nonetheless, we expect gross margins will come down for that reason in the remaining 3 quarters of the year. 
And then I'll turn it over to Rob for your questions about operating expense and the investments we're making."

So we see it as a generational opportunity, and I'll focus on North America, but highlight the places like the U.K. are going with a construction-led recovery. We see markets like Japan promoting digital technologies, Australia has strong infrastructure development as well. 
In North America, I think about it from the value proposition of what the technology can do. We think about the funding around that. And we mentioned that we would -- in respect to our own funding, we would step up investments in the area. And then we also think about policy. 
So from a value proposition perspective, with digital technology, we can build greener. We can build more inclusively and we can build better while doing so cheaper, so it just makes sense to use the technology. What we're hearing from customers and stakeholders in the industry actually is on the policy side as well as a desire to streamline project delivery by promoting the digital technology. So really streamlining project delivery really seems to be the core of what the market is talking about. 
And from a funding perspective, I'll start with government level funding. And we do anticipate that the final amount will be well negotiated, and it will be different than the proposed American Jobs Plan. Nevertheless, and we need to also reauthorize the Surface Transportation bill. So the Jobs Plan in addition to the reauthorization of the Surface Transportation bill, we think that will be significant, we think it will be incremental to the current baseline investments in our highways, airports, mass transit and our ports. 
Now we think that won't pass until later in the year and the benefits of that wouldn't be realized in 2022. So when we think about the investments in our business to get ahead of that, we think both at a product development level as well as a go-to-market level. So at a product development level, where we're going with the Connect part of Connect & Scale is integrating the hardware, the software, the physical, the digital, the office, the field, being able to round trip that data to streamline project delivery, so we'll continue our efforts on that front. 
And at a go-to-market level, it's putting the resources -- increase the level of resources and capabilities in place to actually execute against what we think is an attractive and important opportunity."

And I think about it from a few dynamics. I'll address owners, engineers and contractors. At an owner level, think about the Department of Transportation as an owner, to talk about state DOT as an owner. I do think there's increasing awareness of the technology. There's certainly increasing awareness of the concept of the digital twin and how this can play through the operations and maintenance phase. And if we use the technology during the design, engineering and construction phase, how that can then be leveraged in the operations and maintenance phase. 
So I think there is increased awareness. We see a few more projects that are promoting the use of technology. Actually, the Federal Highway Administration, they made an announcement recently to -- recognize the digital as-built as it's an important technology innovation. So that's helpful to see that coming from that perspective. 
And the engineering community, certainly, it's in the interest of the engineering community to help build to deliver the projects better and faster, and for them to be able to win more of the work. And then at the contractor level, I see that's where we see the most level of proactive use and requests for use of technology, because the contractors are the ones who are -- they're really seeing the most tactical benefit of better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener in their day-to-day work. So they're winning more work, it's becoming more just the way that construction is done. So very positive on the contractor side."

Chad, this is David. I'll say, first of all, that comparing quarter-to-quarter last year is a tough drill because last year was so strange and particularly as you recall, Q2, we saw rapid contraction in demand in many of our end markets and then a lot of catch-up and pickup later in the year. So that's going to factor in. 
As far as the end markets that are driving the results, we mentioned in Transportation, we ended about where we thought we would, P&L-wise, but bookings were up. And obviously, the transportation market has picked up in terms of the macros with asset utilization and pricing and the financial solidity of our transportation customers is better. So that's more a tailwind for future quarters than this one. 
But look, beyond that, in the other 3 segments, we exceeded our expectations. So that's why the outlook came up in part because Q1 was above where we thought it would be, and we think some of those trends will continue. And the caution I'll provide is that hardware is still a meaningful part of our business. And for all the reasons I mentioned with the supply chain challenges, that's creating the greatest level of uncertainty. 
So I don't know if that answers your questions about seasonality. We do think seasonality will be different in 2021 from 2020 for a number of reasons, and you're probably better off comparing with 2019 for a normalized year."

There's no doubt that the macros in the transportation business are dramatically better than they were 3 to 4 quarters ago, and that's helpful. 
Our trends -- our business trends won't change linearly and right away with the changes in the macroenvironment that the customers that we serve, experience. So it's not at all surprising to any of us that we have some lag. 
But I'll say there are a number of factors that give us confidence that we're on the road back to better trends in Transportation. Just I'll highlight a few. Our churn is trending down. On a secular basis, there are bumps quarter-to-quarter as individual customers implement decisions they made some time ago. But the data surely points to a better trend there. 
Rob mentioned the bookings, even beyond the bookings, our sales pipeline is looking up versus where it was a quarter or 2 ago. The performance of our products is improving, so our teams have done a great job of resolving the product issues. And I think we're seeing broader customer receptivity to the strategy of the integrated supply chain. So we have a lot of work to do in transportation, Kristen.

And then I would say on the go-to-market side, the team has done an excellent job on a global distribution basis of getting our dealers in a better, healthier state and really understanding their own local go-to-market execution. So definitely a mix of both. And really, the team has done great work."

First thing I'd say is that in terms of what I'll call cost generated by COVID, we didn't have much. The impact of COVID on our cost was really negative. We had some costs in our -- cleaning our facilities and that kind of thing, but it was relatively de minimis. So we had sort of artificially low costs in a number of areas with the revenue coming down, our incentive comp naturally reduced, we stopped traveling, canceled events and we really cut back on a lot of discretionary spending that wasn't core to the strategy. 
So that's coming back. And as you look at the operating expense growth going forward, I'll put it in a handful of buckets. First of all, some of our OpEx is overseas and the U.S. dollar has weakened. So just the FX impact sort of takes up our -- accounts for about 20% of our OpEx increase that we expect in the -- for the balance of the year. 
About 60% of the increase is what I'll call, go back to normal, as travel comes back, as incentive comp comes back as we start hiring. We didn't even have a salary increase last year, so that's a normal part of things. And then about 20% -- the remaining 20% of the year-on-year OpEx increase will be accounted for in higher spending in the investment areas that Rob mentioned. There are a couple of other things that are puts and takes. You've got some other headcount adds and divestitures. But hopefully, that gives you a broad bucketing. And we do think year-on-year OpEx, which was about flat in Q1, it won't be flat in the remaining quarters."

And you can look at indices such as ABI and Dodge and they're up, we look at OEM units. Those have been pretty good from both the construction and agriculture side, even mining in places like South Africa and Australia, where we have some exposure. Those have been good. 
So call it that general commercial work office buildings, that's low. Education is actually -- it's a bigger market than you might -- one might realize. And so it's still lower, but it's still a large number. And so that's doing okay. 
Geographically speaking, actually, it's a pretty broad-based strength. So Japan was strong, Australia strong, North America strong, Western Europe and the Nordics are strong. And we see it play through both in software -- I guess, I'm giving you some software answer, but we see it playing through in hardware. So for instance, when residential work picks up, we don't actually have as much exposure in residential on the building software side, but it helps us on the civil side, and it helps us on the Geospatial business, so in Civil Construction, we see more of the smaller building construction product-type equipment. Even some of that equipment is using technology or concrete screens for foundation work. In Geospatial, it's survey work. So yes, that's -- hopefully that give you a sense of what's going on."

The other side of it is as we look at other business models, so say, for example, hardware where -- and they take in the machine control guidance business where we offer, we call it Trimble Platform as a Service. So to have technology assurance by buying the machine control technology, we're bundling that with software that allows us to connect that physical digital field and the office.

So our belief is that we can create more customer goodwill with the approach of the carrot. And so the carrot that we can offer, I'll use that machine control example, the fundamental value proposition around technology assurance, so staying current on the sensors. 
Staying current actually on the firmware that embedded software, you'd be surprised at how many customers can have outdated versions of the firmware. And when we can have a deeper insight actually into the customer and help and drive customer success, I believe that's giving them a better value proposition and a better ROI on their investment. The classic one, as you know, as you move from perpetual to subscription is to move IT operations off center for a customer, and that's providing them a value proposition that I would characterize as a carrot. 
And then one more I would mention, Jason, is I think a smart -- we think, a smart way to do, to provide the carrot, is to increase -- I'll call it, increase the value of the offering when you move to the subscription. So in some cases, we're offering both the perpetual and the subscription offering. However, when you buy the subscription offering, you're getting a richer set of functionality. 
And we'll start to only develop additional functionality in the cloud because you have to make that break at some point. And we think that by providing the better value offering, that, that is consistent with the carrot approach as opposed to the stick. Now that doesn't mean that we'll do both offerings forever. At some point, you do have to wind it down. But thus far, we've given ample time to our customers to consider their own choices."

Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2 with the key messages we want to convey today. 
In the second quarter, our team delivered outstanding results. We exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.35 billion, up 11% year-over-year, total revenue growth of 29%, EBITDA margin of 26.4% and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $798 million. We achieved record levels of revenue in many of our businesses, with exceptionally strong performance in Machine Control and Civil Construction, Guidance in Agriculture and Survey and Mapping. Our results demonstrate the quality of our strategy and our business model. On the basis of this strength, we are raising our guidance for the year. 
Turning to market conditions. The overall landscape is generally robust. Construction backlog is healthy, especially in residential and infrastructure. We remain optimistic that an Infrastructure Bill will ultimately be passed in the United States, which would further improve our long-term outlook in our Construction and Surveying businesses. In Agriculture and Forestry, commodity price strength is translating into customer buying power. 
In Transportation, market strength has shifted back to carriers, and this, in addition to improved execution is translating into solid bookings growth. As discussed last quarter, we are investing in product development and go-to-market efforts around infrastructure and are stepping up investments in our agriculture business, all while continuing to invest in our Trimble Cloud Platform and our autonomy efforts. 
Our team is highly focused on executing our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy, which centers on building leading industry cloud platforms. Our strategy differentiates at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds. As an example, our hardware businesses allow us to capture data and execute work in the field, while improving the efficiency and efficacy of workflows between the office and the field. 
At Trimble, we develop our strategies with an endgame backwards mindset. We balance short-term and long-term deliverables with our 3, 4, 3 operating model, 3 months, 4 quarters, 3 years. This is worth noting as quarterly comparables are skewed with COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions. We have to be able to see through the performance of any given quarter and play the long game, which we continue to believe presents a compelling secular opportunity. 
We are focused on metrics such as ARR, backlog, EBITDA and cash flow as much as we focus on revenue and EPS. The combination of these metrics presents a more holistic picture of our performance. Let's turn next to Page 3 for some proof points that the Trimble Operating System, capturing strategy, people and execution is producing results. Starting with strategy. We continue to execute on revenue transition opportunities. in Buildings and Infrastructure, our structural steel, concrete, mechanical, electrical and plumbing businesses are hitting their stride with their business model transformations.  Bookings, ARR growth and new logo wins are evidence that the team is expanding the addressable market. 
In Transportation, our recurring bookings were up significantly year-over-year, also evidence that the conversion is working. On the divestiture front, we closed the sale of Manhattan Software in the second quarter and Solutions early in the third quarter. Since January of 2020, we have divested or exited 8 businesses. We are focused on building our industry-leading and cloud-connected technology platforms that enable customers to transform workflows by connecting Trimble and third-party capabilities. 
On people, I'm pleased to report that our leadership team was recognized by our employee base as one of the top leadership teams in a Global Culture Survey. We were also recognized as a top-performing company for women and diversity. And our engineering team ranked as a global leading team. I'm proud of my colleagues and our purpose-driven culture. It's this team that is transforming the way the world works. In addition, we strengthened our Board of Directors with the announcement that Ann Fandozzi will join our Board in the next couple of weeks. 
On execution, we continue to innovate. During the quarter, we announced an autonomy partnership with Horsch. We extended our machine control platform to soil compactors, and we introduced our infrastructure BIM collaboration software in North America. In addition, one of the proof points we monitor is cross-sell annual contract value. Early wins in Construction and Transportation increase our conviction that we are on the right track with our bundled offerings. 
Turning to Page 4. I'm excited to announce that earlier today, we launched Trimble Ventures, our corporate venture capital arm, with a commitment of $200 million of capital. Our objective is to co-invest in Series A through Series D rounds in emerging technologies as well as in companies that will extend our industry platforms. Our Co-Heads of Trimble Ventures include our Treasurer, Phil Sarisky; and Ron Antevy, Co-Founder of our e-Builder business. 
In closing, it was the second quarter last year where we faced the initial and biggest uncertainty with COVID-19. While the virus and its variants remain highly concerning around the world, I want to step back and reflect on an early principle we established, which is we said we would emerge from the pandemic on a stronger relative competitive footing than when we entered the pandemic. Our results demonstrate we are doing exactly this. My gratitude to my 11,000-plus Trimble colleagues and our global partners and customers, we've got this, David, over to you."

Customer demand was healthy, rebounding across all of our end markets at a rate stronger than we anticipated. 
Gross margin in the second quarter was 58.2%. Gross margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by the shift in mix in our business, with a higher percentage of hardware this quarter and the onset of product cost inflation, given the disruptions we are seeing in our supply chain, partially offset by lower discounting. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4%, up 70 basis points, driven by higher revenue. 
Operating income margins expanded 110 basis points to 24.2%. As expected, our operating costs were up meaningfully from the second quarter of last year, when we had unusually low compensation expense and a very tight focus on cost control in light of the COVID lockdowns. Net income increased by 40%, and earnings per share increased by $0.20 to $0.72 per share. Our second quarter cash flow from operations was $201 million, demonstrating the continued strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow again exceeded net income in the quarter. 
Free cash flow was $190 million. Our net debt decreased over $225 million in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1. At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $484 million in cash. With our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business, both organically and inorganically. 
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll review in a bit more detail our second quarter revenue trends. As noted earlier, our ARR was up 11% in the quarter, with organic ARR growth of approximately 10%. Excluding our Transportation segment, Trimble ARR grew at a high teens rate in the quarter. Encouragingly, ARR trends in Transportation improved with segment organic ARR approximately flat versus a year earlier. Our nonrecurring revenue streams experienced strong growth relative to the second quarter of 2020, during which our business was most negatively impacted by the COVID-19 shutdowns. 
Our Hardware revenue grew 47% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in Civil Construction, Geospatial and Agriculture. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 23%. In Europe, revenues were up 41%. Currency fluctuations positively impacted growth in Europe by about 9%, with the balance coming from catch up on project activity, which has slowed in 2020, fiscal stimulus measures and recovering demand in many end markets. 
Asia Pacific grew 19% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in Australia and New Zealand. The Rest of World, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 49% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector. 
Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the other key metrics that we follow. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, was negative this quarter, representing approximately minus 2% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. Our deferred revenue grew 14% year-over-year. An important story this quarter is the growth of our backlog. Total backlog at quarter end was approximately $1.5 billion. Of that total, approximately $300 million relates to unfilled orders for hardware products. This compares with hardware backlog of about $100 million at the end of the second quarter last year, which is a more typical level for our business. 
In this time of both exceptionally strong customer demand and increasing supply chain pressures, our operations team did an extraordinary job, which enabled our record year-on-year Hardware revenue growth of 47%. 
Turning now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 22% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our Building and Civil Construction businesses, with Hardware revenue across the segment up greater than 40%. Segment margins were down 40 basis points, due primarily to revenue mix. Across our recurring software offerings in this segment, bookings were strong, up approximately 25% versus a year ago. 
Geospatial revenue was up 48% on an organic basis. We saw a rebound in demand across nearly all of the end markets for our Geospatial offerings, and our new products are generating significant customer enthusiasm. Operating margins were up 430 basis points due to strong revenue growth and the success of new products. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 32% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in precision agriculture and positioning services. Margins expanded 160 basis points. 
Top line results in Transportation met our expectations.  Revenue was up 9% on an organic basis year-on-year. The drivers of revenue growth were improved trends in both our mobility and enterprise businesses. Margins declined 170 basis points on a year-over-year basis due to increased mix of low-margin hardware and increased operating costs, but margins improved sequentially over first quarter levels. We remain confident that we are on track for continued sequential improvement as the year progresses. 
Turning now to our outlook for the full year. Our performance in the second quarter and the strength of our backlog give us the visibility and confidence to raise our outlook for the year. I'll point out that supply chain constraints continue to present us with meaningful uncertainty as the availability of some critical components remains unpredictable. The outlook I'll describe represents our best sense of this dynamic environment. I'll also point out that comparisons versus the quarters of 2020 are difficult to draw meaning from is the impact of the onset of COVID and the recovery following market reopenings created large swings last year. 
We will focus more on sequential evolution from the second quarter through to the second half. We are raising our outlook for the full year revenue to between $3.55 billion and $3.65 billion. Demand remains resilient across all of our end markets, but our Hardware revenues will likely be constrained by our ability to source key components. Note that this new revenue range incorporates our divestitures, including the recent divestitures of our Manhattan Software and Iron Solutions businesses. Divestitures will reduce our revenue growth in 2021 by a little over 100 basis points, but are reflective of our increasing focus on platforms, which connect the workflows in RT end markets. 
Sequentially, we expect that revenue in the second half will be well above 2020 levels, but below the levels we realized in the first half of 2021. The expectation of lower revenue in the second half versus the first half is entirely driven by constraints in our supply chain. We expect to end the year with hardware backlog at levels similar to the end of the second quarter. Given our strong bookings trends across our recurring software businesses, we expect organic ARR growth of approximately 10% for the full year. 
We anticipate that second half gross margins will be down approximately 50 to 100 basis points below second half 2020 margins, due to the net impact of product mix and cost pressures, partially offset by price increases. We are implementing price increases across many of the product lines impacted by the recent inflationary spike. But overall, the net impact on gross margins will still be adverse year-over-year for both the back half and full year 2021. 
We expect to experience the greatest gross margin pressure in the third quarter as we won't realize the full benefit of our price increases until the fourth quarter. Our outlook for operating margins has improved as the leverage from higher revenue more than offsets the impact of mix shift, increasing product cost inflation and the investments we are making in support of our strategy. We now expect that operating margin for the full year 2021 will be comparable to 2020. 
Note that our software business model transitions from perpetual to recurring are accelerating in the back half of this year. These transitions will adversely impact operating margins by 150 to 200 basis points in the second half of 2021. Our outlook for full year earnings per share has increased to $2.45 to $2.65 per share. From a cash flow perspective, given our strong performance in the first half of 2021, we expect cash flow from operations for the full year of greater than 1.1x non-GAAP net income, with free cash flow comfortably exceeding non-GAAP net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

It's much more of the impact is in the back half of the year. We have been ratcheting down our discounting from the old prices already for a couple of quarters now. And the way to think about it is that, that ongoing reduction in discounting was sufficient to offset the cost -- most of the cost increases we had in the quarter. 
For the back half of the year, what's going to happen is that much more of the cost increases we're seeing for our hardware products, some of which, by the way, we believe -- a majority of which we believe are temporary in nature and they're related to the dislocation of the overall supply chain. But those are kicking in, in full force now here as we entered the third quarter. We are taking top line price increases across essentially all of our hardware offerings that are impacted by the cost increases.  
Those kick in gradually with slightly different approaches and timing from business to business. Overall, our outlook is that the top line price increases in the second half will offset most, but not all of the cost increase, but it will be reasonably close for the full year."

So we continue to see this as a generational opportunity to increase the competitiveness of the infrastructure in the U.S. and for the use of Trimble technology to help us build that infrastructure better, faster, safer, cheaper and greener. There is a real value proposition to the technology being deployed against these projects. 
Now let's talk about the funding aspect of it. The way we see it is that we have had a baseline spend on Surface Transportation, and that came in the form of continuing resolution last year. So now fast forward to 2021, the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act will set a new level of baseline funding that is more than 23% ahead of the previous continuing resolution level, so 23% ahead. 
Inside of that, that also contained an advanced digital construction management system provision and that provision encourages the use of digital technology. So that's very favorable to us. And then on top of that, that's the bipartisan infrastructure investment and Jobs Act. And that is set to provide an additional $550 billion over 5 years in infrastructure spending across segments such as roads, airports, ports, public transit and rail. 
And then if we just look at roads and bridges alone, that would be a 46% increase from the FAST Act baseline. So we are building solution capabilities around this opportunity, and we're staffing to support what we see as an attractive opportunity in front of us because this is a fundamentally different level of funding that we believe, if passed, will have a meaningful positive impact to our engineering and construction-related businesses."

With the positioning of correction services, we have the fast convergence that we can provide to farmers to get that high level accuracy. Think about position under Canopy to provide better outcomes for farmers for positioning. 
So we will continue to invest in the guidance side of the business. If I move next to the Precision side of the business, I think flow controls variable rate, which we see as the next really growth frontier within the agriculture market. We've been investing in this for a long time. The Mueller acquisition we did a few years ago really brought us forward into this space, and we continue to see attractive opportunities there. 
And then the 2 other areas I would put would be autonomy. And our autonomy efforts we are developing really in the core part of Trimble that serves construction end markets and agriculture end markets. So we could eliminate redundancy and duplication of efforts by serving multiple markets. So efforts in autonomy are important to us. And by way of example, the relationship that was announced as it puts credibility behind the efforts we have there. 
And then finally, I would look at the software side of the agriculture business and the bundling. It's more than just a bundling. But if we look at the software capabilities within agriculture, it's really that operational dashboard, an operational management system for a farm, and we believe deeply in the connection of what we're doing in the office and the field, the software, the hardware, the physical to digital, making it easier for the farmers to by the software, the services and the hardware together. So there's efforts in that front."

So as you think about the dynamics in the back half, it's safe to say that the cost impact will hit faster than our price increases. So I said we would offset most, but not all of the cost increase with pricing in the back half. And just the logic of that says gross margins will be under more pressure in Q3 and Q4. 
Another dynamic impacting the gross margin line is the mix of the business. We saw a pretty big spike up with 47% hardware growth, which comes in at lower gross margins, and that will abate a bit. So that -- those are the key drivers on the gross margin line. OpEx is going up for the reasons that Rob mentioned and a few others. In part, we're restoring normalcy to compensation base and bonus compensation. We're really, really unusually low last year, and we're hitting our targets this year. 
So that accounts for about half of the OpEx increase that we expect and the remainder is a function of the investments Rob mentioned and other costs that go up as our revenue grows.  We -- margins will be impacted -- have been impacted and will be impacted by the subscription transition. It will be a little more than 150 basis points in the back half of the year. So all of that complicated math gets you to a point where we now think operating margins for the full year will be roughly comparable to 2020. 
And you might recall, last time we said they would be between 19 and 20. But with the bigger revenue than we anticipated last time we're getting more fixed cost leverage. So hopefully, that points you to most of the items you need."

And it works -- so we believe it works so long as you're providing a compelling value proposition and the root of that compelling value proposition and construction is around technology assurance. 
So we will continue to push that forward. We've been really in North America in Civil Construction, and that will now start to go out to more of a global model. And then if we look at the software that goes along with the hardware that you were just asking about, we also see opportunities that even for hardware that continues to sell as a onetime sale that those -- that perpetual software that goes along with it, much of that does, we think, have an opportunity to go ratable over time.

When I look at your split and the commentary around different segment results, both in Buildings and Infrastructure and Transportation, you're noting that bookings are actually growing faster than ARR.

The bookings growth ahead of ARR growth, actually, I see is very virtuous in the business. And the bookings is, of course, going to precede ARR. So I look at the bookings growth that we're having as proof points that the strategy is working, both the strategy for individual products we have proof points that the macros are there, the fundamentals are there for the underlying businesses; proof points that the bundling efforts are working; proof points that we're driving new logo growth. 
Proof points as well, Gal, I'll give you a specific example. When we see -- we keep seeing when we have models that transition from perpetual to subscription that we're increasing the size of the addressable market. So our architecture and design business, for example, had yet another quarter of over 50% ARR growth. That's 6 quarters in a row. That doesn't happen unless you are expanding the size of the addressable market. Those growth rates exceed what we had before the model conversion. 
So going to show up in a booking growth before it shows up in ARR, that's exactly how I would want to see this play out in the business. So I'm very encouraged by seeing that dynamic."

We also were able to squeeze more out of the supply chain than we thought we would a quarter ago. I'd point you to the comments we made about our hardware backlog. So in a normal year, hardware backlog at the end of Q2 would be about $100 million. That's what we had a year ago. We actually saw it creep up as the supply chain issues began to show themselves in Q1. It was about $200 million. Now we're at $300 million. 
So the simple way to think about it is that an awful lot of that $300 million or the $200 million increment above a normal level is what customers want, that our supply chain isn't letting us get to them. And I'd love to say we're going to get through all of that in the back half of the year. But if you look through the guidance comments, you'll note that we're projecting that we think we'll end the year with backlog somewhere about where it is now. 
So we're -- our lead times on some products are longer than we or our customers would like, and we're working through it. But it's an interesting situation. We're not unique in facing these challenges. We've worked through it much better than we thought, but it will be -- it will constrain the growth we otherwise could have in the back half."

Rob, it's David. Let me frame this a little bit.

So that will improve that increases comp in a way that would likely normalize next year. 
The remainder of it is partly just the normal cost of growth and then about 20% or so of the $130 million is relating to the growth initiatives. I'll probably look to Rob for commentary, but I will say, I think using Rob's word, this is a long game, and we're engaged in a multiyear effort to create and exploit these platforms, the digital transformation where we have underway. The spending by no means will be over. That's not what we're signaling this year. We will be against those initiatives next year and thereafter."

I see the new product introduction, I see channel excellence, and I see positive macros. The team did an outstanding job in the quarter. They've done an outstanding job really over the last couple of years, couldn't be more proud of what this group of colleagues is doing because they are defying the messaging I've had in the past about the nature of growth potential in the market. 
And I'll follow the numbers that are published, we are outgrowing our competitors and peers in the market in this business. Now we'll eventually lap lap this and those numbers will get hard. On the new product introduction side, I'd say a couple of things. Yes, we have been mentioning many of the products that the team and the cadence that they've had here over time. And that does, let's say, create a replacement cycle opportunities. So whether we're talking our X7 laser scanner, we've got a new mobile mapping system GNSS system, the TSC5 handheld data collector, these are all driving excellent business. 
And this business was actually well positioned in context of supply chain constraints because when you have new products coming to market, you're buying components well ahead of that. So that's the new product introduction side. The second on channel excellence, really kudos to the sales leadership and channel development team who works with our global dealer partners, all of them, I think, are becoming more and more professional and how they run and manage their businesses and how they think about segmenting markets and addressing opportunities. 
And then finally, the macros. Clearly, macro such as residential and infrastructure are driving very positive benefits for this business. We saw oil and gas do better in the quarter. So in places like Texas, they were buying -- I'll say they were buying again. So we saw some growth in that in the quarter as well. And we look at those macros, Rob, not only for the current sales of the surveying, mapping products within Geospatial, but we look at the correlation of how that might connect to the civil construction products that would be downstream of that from a workflow perspective. 
And so that gives us conviction in and hope of an Infrastructure Bill getting passed that could -- that is a sign, an early sign of potential in our other -- some of our other businesses."

Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2 with the key messages we want to convey today.
In the second quarter, our team delivered outstanding results. We exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.35 billion, up 11% year-over-year; total revenue growth of 29%, EBITDA margin of 26.4%; and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $798 million. We achieved record levels of revenue in many of our businesses, with exceptionally strong performance in machine control in civil construction, guidance in agriculture and survey and mapping. Our results demonstrate the quality of our strategy and our business model. On the basis of this strength, we are raising our guidance for the year.
Turning to market conditions. The overall landscape is generally robust. Construction backlog is healthy, especially in residential and infrastructure. We remain optimistic that an infrastructure bill will ultimately be passed in the United States, which would further improve our long-term outlook in our construction and surveying businesses. In agriculture and forestry, commodity price strength is translating into customer buying power.
In transportation, market strength has shifted back to carriers. And this, in addition to improved execution, is translating into solid bookings growth. As discussed last quarter, we are investing in product development and go-to-market efforts around infrastructure and are stepping up investments in our agriculture business, all while continuing to invest in our Trimble cloud platform and our autonomy efforts.
Our team is highly focused on executing our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy, which centers on building leading industry cloud platforms. Our strategy differentiates at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds. As an example, our hardware businesses allow us to capture data and execute work in the field while improving the efficiency and efficacy of workflows between the office and the field.
At Trimble, we develop our strategies with an end game backwards mindset. We balance short-term and long-term deliverables with our 3, 4, 3 operating model, 3 months, 4 quarters, 3 years. This is worth noting as quarterly comparables are skewed with COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions. We have to be able to see through the performance of any given quarter and play the long game, which we continue to believe presents a compelling secular opportunity.
We are focused on metrics such as ARR, backlog, EBITDA and cash flow as much as we focus on revenue and EPS. The combination of these metrics presents a more holistic picture of our performance. Let's turn next to Page 3 for some proof points that the Trimble Operating System, capturing strategy, people and execution, is producing results.
Starting with strategy. We continue to execute on revenue transition opportunities. In Buildings and Infrastructure, our structural steel, concrete, mechanical, electrical and plumbing businesses are hitting their stride with their business model transformations. Bookings, ARR growth and new logo wins are evidence that the team is expanding the addressable market.
In Transportation, our recurring bookings were up significantly year-over-year, also evidence that the conversion is working. On the divestiture front, we closed the sale of Manhattan Software in the second quarter and IRON Solutions early in the third quarter. Since January of 2020, we have divested or exited 8 businesses. We are focused on building our industry-leading and cloud-connected technology platforms that enable customers to transform workflows by connecting Trimble and third-party capabilities.
On people, I'm pleased to report that our leadership team was recognized by our employee base as one of the top leadership teams in a global culture survey. We were also recognized as a top performing company for women and diversity. And our engineering team ranked as a global leading team. I'm proud of my colleagues and our purpose-driven culture. It's this team that is transforming the way the world works. In addition, we strengthened our Board of Directors with the announcement that Ann Fandozzi will join our Board in the next couple of weeks.
On execution, we continue to innovate. During the quarter, we announced an autonomy partnership with Horsch. We extended our machine control platform to soil compactors. And we introduced our infrastructure BIM collaboration software in North America. In addition, one of the proof points we monitor is cross-sell annual contract value. Early wins in construction and transportation increase our conviction that we are on the right track with our bundled offerings.
Turning to Page 4. I'm excited to announce that earlier today, we launched Trimble Ventures, our corporate venture capital arm, with a commitment of $200 million of capital. Our objective is to co-invest in Series A through Series D rounds in emerging technologies as well as in companies that will extend our industry platforms. Our co-heads of Trimble Ventures include our Treasurer, Phil Sawarynski; and Ron Antevy, co-founder of our e-Builder business.
In closing, it was the second quarter last year where we faced the initial and biggest uncertainty with COVID-19. While the virus and its variants remain highly concerning around the world, I want to step back and reflect on an early principle we established, which is we said we would emerge from the pandemic on a stronger relative competitive footing than when we entered the pandemic. Our results demonstrate we are doing exactly this. My gratitude to my 11,000-plus Trimble colleagues and our global partners and customers. We've got this. David, over to you."

Let's start on 5 with a review of second quarter results. Second quarter revenue was $945 million, up 29% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3% and divestitures subtracted 1% for a total organic revenue increase of 27%.",1420,"Thank you, Rob. Let's start on 5 with a review of second quarter results. Second quarter revenue was $945 million, up 29% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3% and divestitures subtracted 1% for a total organic revenue increase of 27%. Customer demand was healthy, rebounding across all of our end markets at a rate stronger than we anticipated.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 58.2%. Gross margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by the shift in mix in our business, with a higher percentage of hardware this quarter and the onset of product cost inflation, given the disruptions we are seeing in our supply chain, partially offset by lower discounting. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4%, up 70 basis points, driven by higher revenue. Operating income margins expanded 110 basis points to 24.2%.
As expected, our operating costs were up meaningfully from the second quarter of last year when we had unusually low compensation expense and a very tight focus on cost control in light of the COVID lockdowns. Net income increased by 40%, and earnings per share increased by $0.20 to $0.72 per share. Our second quarter cash flow from operations was $201 million, demonstrating the continued strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow again exceeded net income in the quarter.
Free cash flow was $190 million. Our net debt decreased over $225 million in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1. At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $484 million in cash. With our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business, both organically and inorganically.
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll review in a bit more detail our second quarter revenue trends. As noted earlier, our ARR was up 11% in the quarter, with the organic ARR growth of approximately 10%. Excluding our Transportation segment, Trimble ARR grew at a high teens rate in the quarter. Encouragingly, ARR trends in Transportation improved with segment organic ARR approximately flat versus a year earlier.
Our nonrecurring revenue streams experienced strong growth relative to the second quarter of 2020, during which our business was most negatively impacted by the COVID-19 shutdowns. Our hardware revenue grew 47% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in civil construction, Geospatial and agriculture.
From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 23%. In Europe, revenues were up 41%. Currency fluctuations positively impacted growth in Europe by about 9%, with the balance coming from catch-up on project activity, which had slowed in 2020; fiscal stimulus measures; and recovering demand in many end markets.
Asia Pacific grew 19% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in Australia and New Zealand. The rest of world, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 49% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector.
Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the other key metrics that we follow. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, was negative this quarter, representing approximately minus 2% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. Our deferred revenue grew 14% year-over-year.
An important story this quarter is the growth of our backlog. Total backlog at quarter end was approximately $1.5 billion. Of that total, approximately $300 million relates to unfilled orders for hardware products. This compares with hardware backlog of about $100 million at the end of the second quarter last year, which is a more typical level for our business.
In this time of both exceptionally strong customer demand and increasing supply chain pressures, our operations team did an extraordinary job, which enabled our record year-on-year hardware revenue growth of 47%.
Turning now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 22% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our building and civil construction businesses, with hardware revenue across the segment up greater than 40%. Segment margins were down 40 basis points, due primarily to revenue mix. Across our recurring software offerings in this segment, bookings were strong, up approximately 25% versus a year ago.
Geospatial revenue was up 48% on an organic basis. We saw a rebound in demand across nearly all of the end markets for our Geospatial offerings, and our new products are generating significant customer enthusiasm. Operating margins were up 430 basis points due to strong revenue growth and the success of new products.
Resources and Utilities revenue was up 32% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in precision agriculture and positioning services. Margins expanded 160 basis points.
Top line results in Transportation met our expectations.  Revenue was up 9% on an organic basis year-on-year. The drivers of revenue growth were improved trends in both our mobility and enterprise businesses. Margins declined 170 basis points on a year-over-year basis due to increased mix of low-margin hardware and increased operating costs, but margins improved sequentially over first quarter levels. We remain confident that we are on track for continued sequential improvement as the year progresses.
Turning now to our outlook for the full year. Our performance in the second quarter and the strength of our backlog give us the visibility and confidence to raise our outlook for the year. I'll point out that supply chain constraints continue to present us with meaningful uncertainty as the availability of some critical components remains unpredictable. The outlook I'll describe represents our best sense of this dynamic environment. I'll also point out that comparisons versus the quarters of 2020 are difficult to draw meaning from as the impact of the onset of COVID and the recovery following market reopenings created large swings last year. We will focus more on sequential evolution from the second quarter through to the second half.
We are raising our outlook for the full year revenue to between $3.55 billion and $3.65 billion. Demand remains resilient across all of our end markets, but our hardware revenues will likely be constrained by our ability to source key components. Note that this new revenue range incorporates our divestitures, including the recent divestitures of our Manhattan Software and IRON Solutions businesses. Divestitures will reduce our revenue growth in 2021 by a little over 100 basis points, but are reflective of our increasing focus on platforms, which connect the workflows in our key end markets.
Sequentially, we expect that revenue in the second half will be well above 2020 levels, but below the levels we realized in the first half of 2021. The expectation of lower revenue in the second half versus the first half is entirely driven by constraints in our supply chain. We expect to end the year with hardware backlog at levels similar to the end of the second quarter. Given our strong bookings trends across our recurring software businesses, we expect organic ARR growth of approximately 10% for the full year.
We anticipate that second half gross margins will be down approximately 50 to 100 basis points below second half 2020 margins due to the net impact of product mix and cost pressures, partially offset by price increases. We are implementing price increases across many of the product lines impacted by the recent inflationary spike. But overall, the net impact on gross margins will still be adverse year-over-year for both the back half and full year 2021.
We expect to experience the greatest gross margin pressure in the third quarter as we won't realize the full benefit of our price increases until the fourth quarter. Our outlook for operating margins has improved as the leverage from higher revenue more than offsets the impact of mix shift, increasing product cost inflation and the investments we are making in support of our strategy. We now expect that operating margin for the full year 2021 will be comparable to 2020.
Note that our software business model transitions from perpetual to recurring are accelerating in the back half of this year. These transitions will adversely impact operating margins by 150 to 200 basis points in the second half of 2021.
Our outlook for full year earnings per share has increased to $2.45 to $2.65 per share.

It's -- much more of the impact is in the back half of the year. We have been ratcheting down our discounting from the old prices already for a couple of quarters now. And the way to think about it is that ongoing reduction in discounting was sufficient to offset the cost -- most of the cost increases we had in the quarter.
For the back half of the year, what's going to happen is that much more of the cost increases we're seeing for our hardware products, some of which, by the way, we believe are -- a majority of which we believe are temporary in nature and they're related to the dislocation of the overall supply chain. But those are kicking in, in full force now here as we entered the third quarter. We are taking top line price increases across essentially all of our hardware offerings that are impacted by the cost increases.
Those kick in gradually with slightly different approaches and timing from business to business. Overall, our outlook is that the top line price increases in the second half will offset most, but not all of the cost increase. But it will be reasonably close for the full year."

So we continue to see this as a generational opportunity to increase the competitiveness of the infrastructure in the U.S. and for the use of Trimble technology to help us build that infrastructure better, faster, safer, cheaper and greener. There is a real value proposition to the technology being deployed against these projects.
Now let's talk about the funding aspect of it. The way we see it is that we have had a baseline spend on surface transportation, and that came in the form of continuing resolution last year. So now fast forward to 2021, the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act will set a new level of baseline funding that is more than 23% ahead of the previous continuing resolution level, so 23% ahead.
Inside of that, that also contained an advanced digital construction management system provision, and that provision encourages the use of digital technology. So that's very favorable to us. And then on top of that, that's the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. And that is set to provide an additional $550 billion over 5 years in infrastructure spending across segments such as roads, airports, ports, public transit and rail.
And then if we just look at roads and bridges alone, that would be a 46% increase from the FAST Act baseline. So we are building solution capabilities around this opportunity, and we're staffing to support what we see as an attractive opportunity in front of us. Because this is a fundamentally different level of funding that we believe, if passed, will have a meaningful positive impact to our engineering and construction-related businesses."

So we're increasing our level of investment there. And think of positioning technologies, think about ubiquity of coverage around the world. With the positioning or correction services, we have the fast convergence that we can provide to farmers to get that high level accuracy. Think about position under canopy to provide better outcomes for farmers for positioning. So we will continue to invest in the guidance side of the business.
If I move next to the precision side of the business, think flow controls, variable rate, which we see as the next really growth frontier within the agriculture market. We've been investing in this for a long time. The Müller acquisition we did a few years ago really brought us forward into this space. And we continue to see attractive opportunities there.
And then the 2 other areas I would put would be autonomy. And our autonomy efforts, we are developing really in the core part of Trimble that serves construction end markets and agriculture end markets, so we could eliminate redundancy and duplication of efforts by serving multiple markets. So efforts in autonomy are important to us. And by way of example, the HORSCH relationship that was announced, as it puts credibility behind the efforts we have there.
And then finally, I would look at the software side of the agriculture business and the bundling. It's more than just a bundling. But if we look at the software capabilities within agriculture, it's really that operational dashboard, an operational management system for a farm, and we believe deeply in the connection of what we're doing in the office and the field, the software, the hardware, the physical to digital, making it easier for the farmers to buy the software, the services and the hardware together. So there's efforts in that front."

So as you think about the dynamics in the back half, it's safe to say that the cost impact will hit faster than our price increases. So I said we would offset most, but not all of the cost increase with pricing in the back half. And just the logic of that says gross margins will be under more pressure in Q3 and Q4.
Another dynamic impacting the gross margin line is the mix of the business. We saw a pretty big spike up with 47% hardware growth, which comes in at lower gross margins, and that will abate a bit. So that -- those are the key drivers on the gross margin line. OpEx is going up for the reasons that Rob mentioned and a few others. In part, we're restoring normalcy to compensation base and bonus compensation. We were really, really unusually low last year, and we're hitting our targets this year.
So that accounts for about half of the OpEx increase that we expect. And the remainder is a function of the investments Rob mentioned and other costs that go up as our revenue grows. We -- margins will be impacted -- have been impacted and will be impacted by the subscription transition. It'll be a little more than 150 basis points in the back half of the year. So all of that complicated math gets you to a point where we now think operating margins for the full year will be roughly comparable to 2020.
And you might recall, last time, we said they would be between '19 and '20. But with the bigger revenue than we anticipated last time, we're getting more fixed cost leverage. So hopefully, that points you to most of the items you need."

So we believe it works so long as you're providing a compelling value proposition and the root of that compelling value proposition in construction is around technology assurance.
So we will continue to push that forward. We've been really in North America in civil construction, and that will now start to go out to more of a global model.

Proof points as well, Gal, I'll give you a specific example. When we see -- we keep seeing when we have models that transition from perpetual to subscription that we're increasing the size of the addressable market. So our architecture and design business, for example, had yet another quarter of over 50% ARR growth. That's 6 quarters in a row. That doesn't happen unless you are expanding the size of the addressable market. Those growth rates exceed what we had before the model conversion.
So that's going to show up in the booking growth before it shows up in ARR. That's exactly how I would want to see this play out in the business. So I'm very encouraged by seeing that dynamic."

We also were able to squeeze more out of the supply chain than we thought we would a quarter ago. I'd point you to the comments we made about our hardware backlog. So in a normal year, hardware backlog at the end of Q2 would be about $100 million. That's what we had a year ago. We actually saw it creep up as the supply chain issues began to show themselves in Q1. It was about $200 million. Now we're at $300 million.
So the simple way to think about it is that an awful lot of that $300 million or the $200 million increment above a normal level is what customers want that our supply chain isn't letting us get to them. And I'd love to say we're going to get through all of that in the back half of the year, but if you look through the guidance comments, you'll note that we're projecting that we think we'll end the year with backlog somewhere about where it is now.
So we're -- our lead times on some products are longer than we or our customers would like, and we're working through it. But it's an interesting situation. We're not unique in facing these challenges. We've worked through it much better than we thought, but it will be -- it will constrain the growth we otherwise could have in the back half."

Would -- should we think that those are still scaling up as we exit the year, and presumably, those will carry over into next year? That's one question.
And then relatedly, just around your compensation normalizing after the measures you took last year. I'm just curious if there's anything around the incentive side that we should think about perhaps resetting or resetting at a different level, a lower level next year as well."

If you sort of go through the outlook we gave on gross margins and operating margins, you'll see that we expect for the year operating expense to be up about $130 million plus or minus for the year. About half of that is relating to restoring compensation to a normal level. And we are beating our own benchmarks. So that will improve. That increases comp in a way that would likely normalize next year.
The remainder of it is partly just the normal cost of growth. And then about 20% or so of the $130 million is relating to the growth initiatives. I'll probably look to Rob for commentary. But I will say, I think using Rob's word, this is a long game, and we're engaged in a multiyear effort to create and exploit these platforms, the digital transformation where we have underway. The spending by no means will be over. That's not what we're signaling this year. We will be spending against those initiatives next year and thereafter."

I see the new product introduction, I see channel excellence, and I see positive macros. The team did an outstanding job in the quarter. They've done an outstanding job really over the last couple of years. Couldn't be more proud of what this group of colleagues is doing. Because they are defying the messaging I've had in the past about the nature of growth potential in the market.
And I follow the numbers that are published. We are outgrowing our competitors and peers in the market in this business. Now we'll eventually lap this, and those numbers will get hard. On the new product introduction side, I'd say a couple of things. Yes, we have been mentioning many of the products that the team and the cadence that they've had here over time. And that does, let's say, create replacement cycle opportunities. So whether we're talking our X7 laser scanner, we've got a new mobile mapping system, they're ultra-wide GNSS system, the TSC5 handheld data collector, these are all driving excellent business.
And this business was actually well positioned in context of supply chain constraints. Because when you have new products coming to market, you're buying components well ahead of that. So that's the new product introduction side. The second on channel excellence, really kudos to the sales leadership and channel development team who works with our global dealer partners, all of them, I think, are becoming more and more professional in how they run and manage their businesses and how they think about segmenting markets and addressing opportunities.
And then finally, the macros. Clearly, macro such as residential and infrastructure are driving very positive benefits for this business. We saw oil and gas do better in the quarter. So in places like Texas, they were buying -- I'll say they were buying again. So we saw some growth in that -- in the quarter as well. And we look at those macros, Rob, not only for the current sales of the surveying, mapping products within Geospatial, but we look at the correlation of how that might connect to the civil construction products that would be downstream of that from a workflow perspective.
And so that gives us conviction in and hope of an infrastructure bill getting passed. That could -- that is a sign, an early sign of potential in our other -- some of our other businesses."

Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2 with the key messages we want to convey today. 
In the third quarter, our team once again delivered the ending results and did so with an incredibly difficult supply chain environment. We exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.36 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% on an organic basis. Total revenue growth of 14%, EBITDA margin of 25.9% and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $784 million. We achieved record third quarter levels of revenue in many of our businesses with another exceptionally strong quarter in machine control and civil construction, guidance in agriculture and survey and mapping. 
Our results demonstrate the strength of the underlying market recovery and the quality of our execution against our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. Our results also demonstrate the quality of the Trimble team. And I want to give a special shout out to all our colleagues, led by Leah Lambertson, who are helping us manage through the supply chain challenges. On the basis of this collective strength, we are raising our annual earnings guidance despite a tightening supply chain environment. 
Let's start with market conditions where the overall landscape remains robust. Construction backlog is healthy, especially in residential and infrastructure translating to strength in our Geospatial and Buildings and Infrastructure reporting segments. We remain optimistic that the infrastructure bill will ultimately be passed in the United States, which would bolster our long-term outlook in our construction and surveying businesses, starting at some point in 2023. 
We have been and are building product and go-to-market capabilities ahead of this opportunity. I'm especially proud of the role Trimble has played in leading policy advocacy in support of technology adoption, more specifically around advanced digital construction management systems, which provide state departments of transportation with access to funding to help them accelerate adoption of proven design and construction technologies. We will continue our commitment and support to the nation's federal highway administration and state departments of transportation in their pursuit of achieving sustainable and state-of-the-art project delivery. 
In Agriculture & Forestry, commodity price strength continues to translate into customer buying power and our backlog remains strong. We are tracking inventory levels of major ag products which remain in a healthy position and provide some line of sight to continued farm financial strength, which we see as an important counterbalance to rising input costs. On the policy front, we have been advocating for a legislative proposal called SB 2750 Precision Agriculture Loan Program Act in the United States that provides low-cost loans to farmers to incentivize adoption of precision ag technologies. Outside the United States, we also see positive conditions, including ongoing subsidies, and we are beginning to see more policies that promote the use of technology to increase environmental sustainability. 
In transportation, we had another quarter of solid bookings growth, improved customer retention and higher operating margins. In September, we announced a strategic relationship with Procter & Gamble, which will shape the development of an agile procurement collaboration platform and will, in turn, complement our existing set of supply chain-focused solutions. Success looks like expediting contracting and onboarding processes to increase the velocity of business transactions while enabling more efficient movement of freight. 
I'm also pleased to report we were the first major technology provider to certify in Canada for the Canadian ELD mandate, evidence of the positive shift in product delivery in the business. On the downside, supply chain is especially disruptive to the operations of many of our trucking customers and will likely constrain our ability to see our execution progression flow through the near-term P&L. 
Let's turn to Page 3 and talk some -- about some notable progression of our Connect and Scale 2025 strategy seen through the lens of the Trimble operating system, capturing strategy, people and execution. To set context, our strategy is an industry platform strategy that manifests in bringing the best of Trimble together with ecosystem partners to transform industries that support how we live, what we eat and how we move. On the heels of COP26, we are also convinced that we can have a profoundly positive impact on addressing climate change through the use of technology. 
As a proof point of our strategy, we are excited to have announced on October 27, the formation of a strategic partnership with Microsoft to build, market and sell our industry cloud platforms and solutions that connect people, technology, tasks, data, processes and industry life cycles. Our initial focus will be to build the Trimble Construction Cloud powered by Microsoft Azure. Importantly, we will also partner on joint go-to-market strategies to globally deliver these cloud innovations. 
As an additional strategic proof point at our annual user conference for our Viewpoint construction management software business, we announced the transition of Viewpoint's branding to Trimble. At this user conference, we also launched Trimble Construction One, as shown on Page 4, which extends the capabilities of Viewpoint's current SaaS software suite with new and exciting capabilities from other parts of the Trimble software portfolio. 
in addition to the Viewpoint financial and operational management capabilities, Trimble Construction 1 incorporates Trimble's estimating and detailing solutions as well as Trimble's advanced project management offering in a single integrated package, which is now being sold by multiple Trimble divisions. Our direction is clear, we will continue to expand the capabilities of the Trimble Construction One platform for our Civil and Buildings customers to further connect the physical and digital worlds across construction, field and office workflows. 
On people, we continue to be recognized as a top company culture, and FastCompany recognized us as the best workplace for innovators. In an increasingly competitive job market, melding Trimble's mission with our innovative culture is top of mind for our talent attraction and retention efforts. As evidence of the attractiveness of Trimble, in September, we hired Jennifer Len as Chief Platform Officer; and Poppy Crum as our Chief Technology Officer, both world-class talent who see and believe in our vision and the potential of Trimble. 
On execution, we continue to innovate. Our MX50 mobile scanner launched in the third quarter as did a beta release of SketchUp for iPad, and we continue to enhance the capabilities of our best-in-class high accuracy correction services, which enable positioning down to centimeter levels globally. We are investing heavily in our own digital transformation, which will provide the system and process fuel to deliver our increasingly connected solutions in an efficient and scalable way. 
Before I turn the call over to David, I want to talk about how we are operating and leading in the current environment, which presents both volatility and unprecedented opportunity. For years, we have talked about our 3-4-3 operating model, 3 months, 4 quarters, 3 years. I see the role of Trimble leadership as being stewards of capital allocation on behalf of our shareholders, where we balance short-term realities with long-term possibility. As we move towards closing out 2021 and into 2022, we will continue to support the incremental investments we are putting towards our digital transformation, autonomy and infrastructure opportunities. 
We have high conviction that these investments will create new sustainable and differentiated long-term growth opportunities for Trimble, and we remain bullish on the long-term secular opportunity for digital technology to make our customers more successful, productive and sustainable. We will have the courage to look through term supply chain disruptions and upfront cost of our digital transformation and to hold ourselves accountable to progressing our Connect and Scale strategy. David, over to you."

Third quarter revenue was $901 million, up 14% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 1% and divestitures subtracted 2%, for a total organic revenue increase of 15%. Gross margin in the third quarter was 58.7%, down 10 basis points year-over-year, reflecting several factors, including higher product and freight costs in our supply chain, offset by increased pricing and lower discounting. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.9% down 90 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher operating expenses and investments in the business. Operating margin was 23.8% down 40 basis points year-over-year, but still up over 300 basis points versus the pre-COVID third quarter of 2019. Operating expenses last year were unusually low in a number of areas, including compensation expense. Net income dollars increased by 10% and earnings per share increased by $0.06 to $0.66 per share. 
Our third quarter cash flow from operations was $166 million and free cash flow was $156 million. Cash flow was down modestly year-over-year in the quarter as we are purchasing inventory in response to strong demand and supply chain shortages. Operating cash flow was up 23% on a year-to-date basis with a conversion ratio to net income above 1.1x. Our net debt declined $88 million in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 0.9x. During the third quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock. 
At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $513 million in cash. Our balance sheet is strong, and we are well positioned to invest in our business both organically and through acquisitions that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. 
Turning now to Slide 6, I'll review in more detail our third quarter revenue trends. As mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 8% in aggregate, and was up 11% organically on a year-over-year basis. The 11% rate excludes the impact of foreign exchange and our recent divestitures of Iron Solutions, Manhattan Real Estate Solutions and Construction Logistics. All 3 of these divested businesses had a recurring revenue component, but we're in areas outside of our strategic road map. 
Our nonrecurring revenue streams grew with hardware up 18% year-over-year and perpetual software growing 19%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction, geospatial and agriculture. Our hardware growth contributed to perpetual software growth as some of our hardware offerings are bundled with perpetual software. 
From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 11%. And Europe, revenues were up 18%. Asia Pacific was up 5% year-over-year, and the rest of the world was up 33%, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector in Brazil. 
Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics we follow, and I'll start with ARR. While total company ARR grew 11% organically on a year-over-year basis, ARR, excluding transportation, grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue continued to be negative, representing approximately minus 2% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis notwithstanding an acceleration in purchases of component inventory during Q3. 
Research and development on a trailing 12-month basis was 15% of revenue and our deferred revenue grew 17% year-over-year. Our backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.6 billion, up from $1.5 billion a quarter earlier and up over 30% year-over-year. While growth in our backlog is an indicator of momentum in the business, it is also reflective of the shortages and extended delivery times that we are experiencing for many key components in our hardware products. 
Of our $1.6 billion in backlog, just under $340 million relates to our hardware offerings, up from about $100 million in hardware backlog a year ago and $38 million higher than the end of Q2. We expect supply chain constraints for many key components to extend well into 2022. 
Let's turn now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 12% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our building and civil construction businesses, and organic ARR was up in the high teens in the quarter. 
Geospatial revenue was up 23% on an organic basis driven principally by strong performance in our core branded survey equipment. Margins were up 60 basis points due to both revenue growth and operating cost control. 
Resources and Utilities revenue was up 23% on an organic basis. We experienced double-digit growth in each of our precision agriculture and positioning services offerings. Margins and resources in utilities contracted 330 basis points and were hardest hit by product cost inflation in the quarter. 
Financial results in transportation showed progression in a number of areas. Revenue was up 3% on an organic basis year-over-year, but grew less than we expected due to supply chain challenges in our operations and our customers' businesses. Margins expanded 410 basis points year-over-year. 
Turning now to Page 9 for our updated outlook for the full year. We are raising our expectation for full year revenue with a new range of $3.59 billion to $3.64 billion representing growth for the full year in the mid-teens and single-digit year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. End market demand is even stronger than we thought it would be a quarter ago, but supply chain constraints will likely cause our backlog to remain at or above the increased levels from the end of Q3. 
ARR growth at the company level is trending as we anticipated, driven by strong bookings and subscription transition, and we expect organic ARR growth of greater than 10% in the fourth quarter and a strong entry point going into 2022. Gross margins in the fourth quarter are likely to be about flat sequentially with the third quarter. An increasing mix of software will have a favorable impact on sequential gross margin trends but this benefit will be offset by an anticipated decline in hardware margins. In aggregate, we now expect that the net impact of accelerating hardware cost inflation and our recent price increases will be modestly negative to hardware margins in Q4. 
Building off our strong third quarter results, our outlook for operating margins continues to improve and we now expect operating margins for the full year 2021 will be above 2020. Operating margins in the fourth quarter of this year will likely be lower than the fourth quarter of 2020 driven both by higher hardware component costs year-on-year and by higher operating expense as OpEx was unusually low in 2020, and we are now ramping up investments against our strategy. 
Our outlook for full year earnings per share has increased to $2.61 to $2.69, representing growth of approximately 17% to 21% year-over-year. We continue to expect operating cash flow greater than 1.1x net income and free cash flow greater than 1x net income, reflecting the strong cash generative aspects of our business model. 
I'd like to comment briefly on the outlook in the fourth quarter for our transportation segment. As Rob mentioned earlier, the leading indicators for this business are strong, with growing bookings of recruiting solutions, sequentially improving customer retention in our mobility business and increasing signs that our connected transportation strategy is resonating with customers. Nevertheless, factors related to the global supply chain and the extraordinary pressure on the transportation industry will negatively impact our business momentum in the short run. 
Our OEM business will be constrained by customer manufacturing challenges. And the aftermarket business will be slowed by the fact that trucking companies are reluctant to take assets off the road for technology upgrades at a time of high transportation prices and extraordinary asset utilization. We believe that these constraints will be resolved over time, and we remain confident in the turnaround of this business, but the pace of improvement of revenue, ARR and profitability will be lower than we had earlier projected. 
With regard to 2022, we don't plan to give detailed guidance or our year-end earnings release, but we can characterize some of the drivers that we see now and the expected impact on reveNue, ARR and margins. Demand across our end markets remain strong, and we believe that strength will sustain at least through the end of 2022. Our customers need for digital solutions to optimize their workflows and has never been stronger, and these customers have the money and the desire to invest. We expect organic ARR growth to accelerate in 2022 and building off the momentum we have now and aided by continued model transitions and the growing sale of connected recurring solutions. 
The supply chain environment remains our biggest challenge and that challenge is predicted to be with us for several more quarters. From a cost perspective, we anticipate that inflation in our hardware businesses will be sustained through the first quarters of 2022, driven both by higher component costs and higher cost of getting products shipped to our manufacturers and distribution centers. It is the goal of our pricing strategy to offset the impact of inflation on our hardware gross margins, and that pricing strategy continues to evolve. 
Rob referenced in his remarks, the investments we are making against our digital transformation. We anticipate that as we get through this investment cycle in 2022 and as our software businesses continue their transition to recurring revenue models, our operating leverage will be lower in 2022 than we expect over the longer term. The investments we are making in our digital transformation are at the core of unlocking the potential of our platform strategy, and we expect to end 2022 with business processes and systems that will accelerate our ability to transform the way we go to market and the way our customers do their work. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

So I'll give you kind of a walk around the end markets, and some of the positives and some of the potential gotchas that we're looking out for. And the things we're looking out for that could be to the negative would be around supply chain inflation and labor availability. And of course, all those things correlate. 
On the geospatial and construction side, we see strength in residential and infrastructure work right now. We see on the commercial side, strength in submarkets such as data centers and hospitals. We believe there's indicators that the residential work will drive light industrial work. 
As it relates to the infrastructure bill and if it doesn't pass, we would see a benefit of the infrastructure bill really in 2023. So we really don't expect anything in 2022. Of course, there's a sentiment aspect that's hard to quantify, or -- but we remain that optimistic, and I spent some time in Washington a couple of weeks ago to that end. And when I think about construction and I think about the labor side of it as a potential downside, the benefit of technology is that it can make an inexperienced operator, good or geospatial market, a robotic total station can turn a 2-person operation into a 1-person operation. 
On the ag side, what's positive are commodity prices, it looks like the harvest early data on the harvest would suggest lower harvest, which would hold up commodity prices and then we index that against the ending stocks or the inventory. As you said, absolutely input inflation, I think, is what's starting to dent the optimism on the farmer front. 
With that input inflation, though I look at the value proposition of the technology. So a spot spray technology can reduce the use of herbicide. And that's a really big deal or the variable rate can reduce the use of the other inputs. And as we know, also has a positive environmental sustainability benefit. At a geographic level, the subsidy policies tend to be more consistent and higher outside the United States. So that tends to be -- provide the ballast, let's say, to the overall market. But we're absolutely paying paying attention to all of this. At some point, right, this is -- will have to have an impact. 
On the transportation side, what we see is strength in spot pricing. And I mean, we've even seen it from our own rates on transportation, as David talked about, where they've gone up. a downside of driver availability in the market and availability of trucks coming out of the OEMs. So carriers are having trouble actually adding capacity. And when I think about a technology lens on that. An average driver effectively uses around 7 hours of their clock per day. Our strategy is to drive a more connected supply chain. That means dynamic schedules with the shippers and the receivers to better optimize waste to driver hours. We provide better routing and navigation solutions to create efficient trip management. And fundamentally, we want to get a more accurate order load information for the customers. And that can increase the network optimization. So there's puts and takes as always. And we think that technology has a role really in almost any market condition"

From a market -- overall market perspective, really the secular opportunity in construction technology. And by the way, I'd say this in our other end markets as well, is that these markets are large, they're global they're underserved and they're underpenetrated by technology, so them to digitization provides a value proposition that delivers productivity, quality, safety, efficiency, transparency and environmental sustainability. So there's a positive catalyst for technology to be adopted. And at some level, yes, that is replacing paper-based systems that exist or, let's say, just the mental based systems that exist. 
And we are seeing demonstrable interest from customers in the Connected Solutions that we offer and I've had a chance to talk to a number of the customers personally. Some that are shown as how they're already taking our technology and connecting the various solutions to improve their workflow. And 1 of the things they do is not only connect Trimble workflow, but in a Trimble environment that can provide actually that common data environment, we can connect in an open and really agnostic way to the other technology that our customers use. 
Our customers operate, as you know, in the construction industry is fragmented Therefore, the technology tends to be a bit fragmented as well. And so our ability and approach to connect Trimble and non-Trimble solutions is very up of mind for customers. And of course, COVID has also been a catalyst from a digitization perspective, so much of what we do can uniquely connect the work in the office and the field. that connects the hardware and the software and ultimately, that physical and digital."

From a tipping point perspective and an acceleration perspective, I think the numbers would prove the acceleration of the adoption of technology.

From a tipping point perspective and an acceleration perspective, I think the numbers would prove the acceleration of the adoption of technology. And if we were to get an infrastructure bill, which, by the way, we talk about that in a U.S. context. But we see a construction-led recovery really globally in many markets. 
And so HS2 is a really nice project in the U.K., Grand Paris and Paris, the rail project is expected to be a very large project. There's large projects happening in Saudi and Australia continues to have some big development. So we see the fundamentals and the macro is providing an ability to accelerate it. I think really move to I'd say digitization. COVID, I really do feel has accelerated that kind of perhaps hasn't inflected so many of our customers were unable to actually go out to the field like they used to be able to do or they realize the need to be cloud connected and cloud-enabled when they weren't going to their offices as frequently. And we think that's helped us drive more bookings in the business to the cloud offerings. 
And as it relates to a tipping point, that's a really good question. It's a bit of a crystal ball. I think 1 of the catalysts that could create a tipping point would be if we see more more of this driven from owners. And I'll say as well as, I'll say as well as regulators and maybe I really mean policy when I say that. So from an owner perspective, that's actually the premise of why we did the e-Builder acquisition because you fundamentally has the most at stake on the projects late or over budget. Of course, it's the owner, and so we help them manage their capital programs. from a policy and a regulatory perspective, where we have a point of view as we think take the U.S. infrastructure bill, as an example, I mean, this is a generational opportunity to increase the competitiveness of the infrastructure in the United States. 
And we can deliver that infrastructure 20%, 30% cheaper through the use of technology. So it just makes sense. And so if more of this is if we can increase the level of awareness I'm certainly an advocate that there's a policy measure here or certainly encouragement measure, and that's why I talked about that Digital Construction Management Act because it provides an incentive for DOTs to adopt technology. 
So I'd say we're all staying tuned for that one. If there's something that sort of fundamentally creates an acceleration on that on the tipping point part of it. And then you asked about platforms, Rob, and on the platform side, I think it's logical to think that there would be some coalescing around a few platforms. I mean, as you said, the industry is rather fragmented. We're not the only technology platform out there. Actually, I think there needs to be interoperability between those technology platforms, and that very much shapes how we build our technology. It is an underlying fundamental belief that we have."

Within the transportation business, I've historically talked about 3 legs on the stool, the technology stack. The first being that we provide mapping, routing, navigation engines second, that we prove the back-office technology for trucking companies; and third, that we provide the field mobility tools for companies. In terms of the booking, and then those are the 3 historic legs of that stool. And then over the last couple of years, we've moved as well to address the shipper side of the market, whereas historically, the strength is on the carrier side. 
So on the carrier side of the business, where we see the bookings growth is in a couple of places. So first, in that back-office ERP systems we call the transportation management system, and we're moving that business to a recurring model. So there's a model conversion that's happening in there. And we have seen evidence that we're increasing the size of the addressable market, which means we're reaching some customers that we hadn't previously reached. And that's translating into 20%-plus bookings growing year-over-year basis in that part of the business. 
What we're seeing as well on the mobility side, which is really more the ELD part of the business as we have seen some life there, both there are 2 things: One, increasing penetration in existing customers as some of our existing customers, actually, many of them are adding capacity given the market. In fact, they would like to add more capacity in many cases, aren't able to actually get the vehicles or the drivers to do it, but that's 1 area where we see growth; and the others is we do see some logos coming back to us, which has been a really good sign for us. 
Still a long way to go. But I'm just liking what I'm seeing from the team and the pace of the team and the trajectory in that Canadian ELD certification was a nice proof point that we're not just talking about these things that we actually also are delivering. That mapping routing navigation business has had many, many years of double-digit recurring revenue growth, which means bookings continue to grow strong and they continue to do a great job on quarter in and quarter out and added up, and that got to the commentary in the script.

What's ""in the bank"" and then what's the go get, when we think about that go get, then you can measure the pipeline you have and then you measure the qualified leads you have against that. So you kind of just keep working backwards from that equation. And then do you have the horsepower to go and positively affect the pipeline and to turn it into a booking, which eventually turns into the revenue. 
In addition, Jerry, another catalyst for us coming into next year is our structures business, so the Tekla business, the steel concrete business. So that in the summer, we stopped selling perpetual licenses. And so -- in fact, we sold more perpetual this year than we had anticipated. And now that we're off the almost entirely off the perpetual that just by the math, will provide a catalyst for ARR or ACV bookings, which will turn into ARR.

The business has, I'd say, a pretty good amount of backlog associated with it.

So I'm excited, and I'm actually quite inspired by the ability for Trimble to play a fundamentally positive impact -- or fundamentally positive role and impacting climate change. Now the truth of the matter is that our products and our technology has had a positive environmental sustainability benefit for as long as we have been around, and it's been a byproduct of the productivity and efficiency that our customers generate. 
And what I see as an opportunity is that comes more and more to the forefront. In some cases, it's as our customers have more reporting to do themselves. Whether they realize that now, some of them do or whether they don't, we see that coming, and then we see an ability to be able to move into that space. 
If you take agriculture as an example, we do have a small business in ag that essentially runs a carbon marketplace. We get calls from customers or potential customers asking for help and certifying the offsets that they're buying. So think about our -- we tend to talk about our agriculture business, but we also have a nice forestry business. These are 2 places that are hugely important in this conversation. 
And so as big companies are making their own commitments and buying offsets, they don't want to buy bad offsets. And so we're encouraged by the types of calls that we're getting because it's giving us conviction of where we take our product road map to positively impact us. I mean, if I think about the construction space, our structures business, so the steel part of the structures business, we did an announcement a couple of weeks ago of something that I think is pretty compelling as we can -- as we continue from a from a design perspective, essentially to design for sustainability to understand the carbon load that a building has during that design and engineering phase. For many years, we've had a predesigned product to help you understand, let's say, the energy consumption profile of a building. 
And as the users of the buildings and let's say, if there becomes regulatory pressure on this, to design with carbon in mind, the constructable models that we provide at Trimble have a profoundly positive ability to impact designing and maintaining and operating with sustainability in mind. So we're actually putting some resources to this because I see and all of us at Trimble see, our Board sees some really interesting opportunities that at some point, we'll turn into commercial opportunities. 
Now do they turn into commercial opportunities is something discrete and separate or are they part of the existing technologies we have. I would say there, I don't know. But boy, you follow what's going on. And you've got -- I've got to believe that there's some material business for us to have here."

And at Viewpoint, years ago, we moved from selling, I'll call it, an ERP-only, an office-based solution to moving to selling a combined team and field solutions. I think project management and field mobility tools, and we call it Viewpoint One and then we called an OTF office team field offering. So it moved from a point solution to a bundled Viewpoint solution. And now that next step is in the Trimble Construction One with the first release of it. 
That brings in many aspects of our MEP business of mechanical, electrical, plumbing business, where we're able to bring in a detailer and estimate our workflows into the product offering. And then from there, we have a basis where we can continue to expand across other architectural and engineering workflows and products that we have. 
So by and large, it's taking what we do already and having a better packaging around that, making it easier for our customers to consume the technology. From a technology perspective, it's better integration, tighter integration between the solutions that we have. Our customers have been asking for this. And so we're really excited to be able to start delivering upon it. I'd say it's just the start. It's Version 1 of Trimble Construction One. There are many other capabilities that we believe we can bring into that, both from a civil perspective as well as a vertical construction perspective. 
And the nature of the conversions we have thus far are predominantly with the existing customers and moving them over. But we did get -- I think there's a few dozen new logos during the quarter on Trimble Construction One. It's very much a persona-based growth platform. We think about personas and architectural engineering persona, we think about the contractor persona. We think about an owner persona. And then we'll -- as we migrate over time, we'll be able to get more and more, I'll say, specific and targeted to delivering construction -- Trimble Construction One to those individual persona. 
So I'd really say the start of much more to come. And the more that we connect the data, the users and the workflow across this, that begets the opportunity to move into richer data AI opportunities. And there, it gets then another level of exciting. So the more we can connect what we've got for our customers, the more that will create solutions down the road."

We're definitely running north of that. We're probably about $10 million more in product and freight inflation than we were anticipating. And we've adopted our pricing strategy all year in response to our best guess of where things are. You're right, there's some latency in when you can make a decision and implement the strategy. And it really differs by business and customer. 
In some cases, we can implement a price increase by smarter and less discounting. In some cases, there's a surcharge that's possible. In some cases, you have to wait for a list price. But I would say our pricing momentum has kept up with the inflation outlook that we started with, but we're running behind because inflation is hotter than we believe. So your understanding is correct, we're behind inflation now, even though the -- pretty much the full impact of our price increase came through in Q4, will be modestly negative, not hugely modestly negative. 
Going forward, it's a very tough world to get cost inflation. And we think it's going to get better soon. We're optimistic and won't get a lot worse. We have some more work to do on the pricing front. But I would say, in aggregate, it is still our view that over time, we can offset the inflation cost impact with pricing. It's just going to take us into next year to do that."

Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2 with the key messages we want to convey today. 
In the third quarter, our team once again delivered outstanding results and did so with an incredibly difficult supply chain environment. We exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.36 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% on an organic basis. Total revenue growth of 14%, EBITDA margin of 25.9% and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $784 million. We achieved record third-quarter levels of revenue in many of our businesses with another exceptionally strong quarter in machine control and civil construction, guidance and agriculture and survey and mapping. 
Our results demonstrate the strength of the underlying market recovery and the quality of our execution against our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. Our results also demonstrate the quality of the Trimble team. And I want to give a special shout out to all our colleagues, led by Leah Lambertson, who are helping us manage through the supply chain challenges. On the basis of this collective strength, we are raising our annual earnings guidance despite a tightening supply chain environment. 
Let's start with market conditions where the overall landscape remains robust. Construction backlog is healthy, especially in residential and infrastructure translating to strength in our Geospatial and Buildings and Infrastructure reporting segments. We remain optimistic that the infrastructure bill will ultimately be passed in the United States, which would bolster our long-term outlook in our construction and [ surveying businesses, starting at some point in 2023 ]. 
We have been and are building product and go-to-market capabilities ahead of this opportunity. I'm especially proud of the role Trimble has played in leading policy advocacy in support of technology adoption, most specifically around advanced digital construction management systems, which provide state departments of transportation with access to funding to help them accelerate adoption of proven digital design and construction technologies. We will continue our commitment and support to the nation's federal highway administration and state departments of transportation in their pursuit of achieving sustainable and state-of-the-art project delivery. 
In Agriculture & Forestry, commodity price strength continues to translate into customer buying power and our backlog remains strong. We are tracking inventory levels of major ag products which remain in a healthy position and provide some line of sight to continued farm financial strength, which we see as an important counterbalance to rising input costs. On the policy front, we have been advocating for a legislative proposal called SB 2750 (sic) [S.2750] Precision Agriculture Loan Program Act in the United States that provides low-cost loans to farmers to incentivize adoption of precision ag technologies. Outside the United States, we also see positive conditions, including ongoing subsidies, and we are beginning to see more policies that promote the use of technology to increase environmental sustainability. 
In Transportation, we had another quarter of solid bookings growth, improved customer retention and higher operating margins. In September, we announced a strategic relationship with Procter & Gamble, which will shape the development of an agile procurement collaboration platform and will, in turn, complement our existing set of supply chain-focused solutions. Success looks like expediting contracting and onboarding processes to increase the velocity of business transactions while enabling more efficient movement of freight. 
I'm also pleased to report we were the first major technology provider to certify in Canada for the Canadian ELD mandate, evidence of the positive shift in product delivery in the business. On the downside, supply chain is especially disruptive to the operations of many of our trucking customers and will likely constrain our ability to see our execution progression flow through the near-term P&L. 
Let's turn to Page 3 and talk some -- about some notable progression of our Connect and Scale 2025 strategy seen through the lens of the Trimble operating system, capturing strategy, people and execution. To set context, our strategy is an industry platform strategy that manifests in bringing the best of Trimble together with ecosystem partners to transform industries that support how we live, what we eat and how we move. On the heels of COP26, we are also convinced that we can have a profoundly positive impact on addressing climate change through the use of technology. 
As a proof point of our strategy, we are excited to have announced on October 27, the formation of a strategic partnership with Microsoft to build, market and sell our industry cloud platforms and solutions that connect people, technology, tasks, data, processes and industry life cycles. Our initial focus will be to build the Trimble Construction Cloud powered by Microsoft Azure. Importantly, we will also partner on joint go-to-market strategies to globally deliver these cloud innovations. 
As an additional strategic proof point at our annual user conference for our Viewpoint construction management software business, we announced the transition of Viewpoint's branding to Trimble. At this user conference, we also launched Trimble Construction One, as shown on Page 4, which extends the capabilities of Viewpoint's current SaaS software suite with new and exciting capabilities from other parts of the Trimble software portfolio. 
In addition to the Viewpoint financial and operational management capabilities, Trimble Construction One incorporates Trimble's estimating and detailing solutions as well as Trimble's advanced project management offering in a single integrated package, which is now being sold by multiple Trimble divisions. Our direction is clear, we will continue to expand the capabilities of the Trimble Construction One platform for our Civil and Buildings customers to further connect the physical and digital worlds across construction field and office workflows. 
On people, we continue to be recognized as a top company culture, and Fast Company recognized us as a best workplace for innovators. In an increasingly competitive job market, melding Trimble's mission with our innovative culture is top of mind for our talent attraction and retention efforts. As evidence of the attractiveness of Trimble, in September, we hired Jennifer Lin as Chief Platform Officer; and Poppy Crum as our Chief Technology Officer, both world-class talent who see and believe in our vision and the potential of Trimble. 
On execution, we continue to innovate. Our MX50 mobile scanner launched in the third quarter, as did a beta release of SketchUp for iPad, and we continue to enhance the capabilities of our best-in-class high accuracy correction services, which enable positioning down to centimeter levels globally. We are investing heavily in our own digital transformation, which will provide the system and process fuel to deliver our increasingly connected solutions in an efficient and scalable way. 
Before I turn the call over to David, I want to talk about how we are operating and leading in the current environment, which presents both volatility and unprecedented opportunity. For years, we have talked about our 3-4-3 operating model, 3 months, 4 quarters, 3 years. I see the role of Trimble leadership as being stewards of capital allocation on behalf of our shareholders, where we balance short-term realities with long-term possibility. As we move towards closing out 2021 and in to 2022, we will continue to support the incremental investments we are putting towards our digital transformation, autonomy and infrastructure opportunities. 
We have high conviction that these investments will create new sustainable and differentiated long-term growth opportunities for Trimble, and we remain bullish on the long-term secular opportunity for digital technology to make our customers more successful, productive and sustainable. We will have the courage to look through near-term supply chain disruptions and upfront cost of our digital transformation and to hold ourselves accountable to progressing our Connect and Scale strategy. David, over to you."

Third quarter revenue was $901 million, up 14% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 1% and divestitures subtracted 2%, for a total organic revenue increase of 15%. Gross margin in the third quarter was 58.7%, down 10 basis points year-over-year, reflecting several factors, including higher product and freight costs in our supply chain, offset by increased pricing and lower discounting. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.9% down 90 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher operating expenses and investments in the business. Operating margin was 23.8% down 40 basis points year-over-year, but still up over 300 basis points versus the pre-COVID third quarter of 2019. Operating expenses last year were unusually low in a number of areas, including compensation expense. Net income dollars increased by 10% and earnings per share increased by $0.06 to $0.66 per share. 
Our third quarter cash flow from operations was $166 million and free cash flow was $156 million. Cash flow was down modestly year-over-year in the quarter as we are purchasing inventory in response to strong demand and supply chain shortages. Operating cash flow was up 23% on a year-to-date basis with a conversion ratio to net income above 1.1x. Our net debt declined $88 million in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 0.9x. During the third quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock. 
At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $513 million in cash. Our balance sheet is strong, and we are well positioned to invest in our business both organically and through acquisitions that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. 
Turning now to Slide 6, I'll review in more detail our third quarter revenue trends. As mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 8% in aggregate, and was up 11% organically on a year-over-year basis. The 11% rate excludes the impact of foreign exchange and our recent divestitures of Iron Solutions, Manhattan Real Estate Solutions and Construction Logistics. All 3 of these divested businesses had a recurring revenue component, but were in areas outside of our strategic road map. 
Our nonrecurring revenue streams grew with hardware up 18% year-over-year and perpetual software growing 19%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction, geospatial and agriculture. Our hardware growth contributed to perpetual software growth as some of our hardware offerings are bundled with perpetual software. 
From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 11%. And Europe, revenues were up 18%. Asia Pacific was up 5% year-over-year, and the rest of the world was up 33%, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector in Brazil. 
Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics we follow, and I'll start with ARR. While total company ARR grew 11% organically on a year-over-year basis, ARR, excluding transportation, grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue continued to be negative, representing approximately minus 2% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis notwithstanding an acceleration in purchases of component inventory during Q3. 
Research and development on a trailing 12-month basis was 15% of revenue and our deferred revenue grew 17% year-over-year. Our backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.6 billion, up from $1.5 billion a quarter earlier and up over 30% year-over-year. While growth in our backlog is an indicator of momentum in the business, it is also reflective of the shortages and extended delivery times that we are experiencing for many key components in our hardware products. 
Of our $1.6 billion in backlog, just under $340 million relates to our hardware offerings, up from about $100 million in hardware backlog a year ago and $38 million higher than the end of Q2. We expect supply chain constraints for many key components to extend well into 2022. 
Let's turn now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 12% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our building and civil construction businesses, and organic ARR was up in the high teens in the quarter. 
Geospatial revenue was up 23% on an organic basis driven principally by strong performance in our core branded survey equipment. Margins were up 60 basis points due to both revenue growth and operating cost control. 
Resources and Utilities revenue was up 23% on an organic basis. We experienced double-digit growth in each of our precision agriculture and positioning services offerings. Margins and resources in utilities contracted 330 basis points and were hardest hit by product cost inflation in the quarter. 
Financial results in transportation showed progression in a number of areas. Revenue was up 3% on an organic basis year-over-year, but grew less than we expected due to supply chain challenges both in our operations and our customers' businesses. Margins expanded 410 basis points year-over-year. 
Turning now to Page 9 for our updated outlook for the full year. We are raising our expectation for full year revenue with a new range of $3.59 billion to $3.64 billion representing growth for the full year in the mid-teens and single-digit year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. End market demand is even stronger than we thought it would be a quarter ago, but supply chain constraints will likely cause our backlog to remain at or above the increased levels from the end of Q3. 
ARR growth at the company level is trending as we anticipated, driven by strong bookings and subscription transition, and we expect organic ARR growth of greater than 10% in the fourth quarter and a strong entry point going into 2022. Gross margins in the fourth quarter are likely to be about flat sequentially with the third quarter. An increasing mix of software will have a favorable impact on sequential gross margin trends but this benefit will be offset by an anticipated decline in hardware margins. In aggregate, we now expect that the net impact of accelerating hardware cost inflation and our recent price increases will be modestly negative to hardware margins in Q4. 
Building off our strong third-quarter results, our outlook for operating margins continues to improve and we now expect operating margins for the full year 2021 will be above 2020. Operating margins in the fourth quarter of this year will likely be lower than the fourth quarter of 2020 driven both by higher hardware component costs year-on-year and by higher operating expense as OpEx was unusually low in 2020, and we are now ramping up investments against our strategy. 
Our outlook for full year earnings per share has increased to $2.61 to $2.69, representing growth of approximately 17% to 21% year-over-year. We continue to expect operating cash flow greater than 1.1x net income and free cash flow greater than 1x net income, reflecting the strong cash generative aspects of our business model. 
I'd like to comment briefly on the outlook in the fourth quarter for our transportation segment. As Rob mentioned earlier, the leading indicators for this business are strong, with growing bookings of recurring solutions, sequentially improving customer retention in our mobility business and increasing signs that our connected transportation strategy is resonating with customers. Nevertheless, factors related to the global supply chain and the extraordinary pressure on the transportation industry will negatively impact our business momentum in the short run. 
Our OEM business will be constrained by customer manufacturing challenges. And the aftermarket business will be slowed by the fact that trucking companies are reluctant to take assets off the road for technology upgrades at a time of high transportation prices and extraordinary asset utilization. We believe that these constraints will be resolved over time, and we remain confident in the turnaround of this business, but the pace of improvement of revenue, ARR and profitability will be lower than we had earlier projected. 
With regard to 2022, we don't plan to give detailed guidance until our year-end earnings release, but we can characterize some of the drivers that we see now and their expected impact on revenue, ARR and margins. Demand across our end markets remain strong, and we believe that strength will sustain at least through the end of 2022. Our customers need for digital solutions to optimize their workflows has never been stronger, and these customers have the money and the desire to invest. We expect organic ARR growth to accelerate in 2022 building off the momentum we have now and aided by continued model transitions and the growing sale of connected recurring solutions. 
The supply chain environment remains our biggest challenge and that challenge is predicted to be with us for several more quarters. From a cost perspective, we anticipate that inflation in our hardware businesses will be sustained through the first quarters of 2022, driven both by higher component costs and higher cost of getting products shipped to our manufacturers and distribution centers. It is the goal of our pricing strategy to offset the impact of inflation on our hardware gross margins, and that pricing strategy continues to evolve. 
Rob referenced in his remarks, the investments we are making against our digital transformation. We anticipate that as we get through this investment cycle in 2022 and as our software businesses continue their transition to recurring revenue models, our operating leverage will be lower in 2022 than we expect over the longer term. The investments we are making in our digital transformation are at the core of unlocking the potential of our platform strategy, and we expect to end 2022 with business processes and systems that will accelerate our ability to transform the way we go to market and the way our customers do their work. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

So I'll give you kind of a walk around the end markets, and some of the positives and some of the potential gotchas that we're looking out for. And the things we're looking out for that could be to the negative would be around supply chain, inflation and labor availability. And of course, all those things correlate. 
On the geospatial and construction side, we see strength in residential and infrastructure work right now. We see on the commercial side, strength in submarkets such as data centers and hospitals. We believe there's indicators that the residential work will drive light industrial work. 
As it relates to the infrastructure bill and if it doesn't pass, we would see a benefit of the infrastructure bill really in 2023. So we really don't expect anything in 2022. Of course, there's a sentiment aspect that's hard to quantify, or -- but we remain that optimistic, and I spent some time in Washington a couple of weeks ago to that end. And when I think about construction and I think about the labor side of it as a potential downside, the benefit of technology is that it can make an inexperienced operator good or geospatial market, a robotic total station can turn a 2-person operation into a 1-person operation. 
On the ag side, what's positive are commodity prices, it looks like the harvest early data on the harvest would suggest a lower harvest, which would hold up commodity prices and then we index that against the ending stocks or the inventory. As you said, absolutely input inflation, I think, is what's starting to dent the optimism on the farmer front. 
With that input inflation, though I look at the value proposition of the technology. So a spot spray technology can reduce the use of herbicide. And that's a really big deal or the variable rate can reduce the use of the other inputs. And as we know, also has a positive environmental sustainability benefit. At a geographic level, the subsidy policies tend to be more consistent and higher outside the United States. So that tends to be -- provide the ballast, let's say, to the overall market. But we're absolutely paying -- paying attention to all of this. At some point, right, this is -- will have to have an impact. 
On the transportation side, what we see is strength in spot pricing. And I mean, we've even seen it from our own rates on transportation, as David talked about, where they've gone up. a downside of driver availability in the market and availability of trucks coming out of the OEMs. So carriers are having trouble actually adding capacity. And when I think about a technology lens on that. An average driver effectively uses around 7 hours of their clock per day. Our strategy is to drive a more connected supply chain. That means dynamic schedules with the shippers and the receivers to better optimize wasted driver hours. We provide better routing and navigation solutions to create efficient trip management. And fundamentally, we want to get at more accurate order load information for the customers. And that can increase the network optimization. So there's puts and takes as always, Ann. And we think that technology has a role really in almost any market condition"

From a market -- overall market perspective, really the secular opportunity in construction technology. And by the way, I'd say this in our other end markets as well, is that these markets are large, they're global they're underserved and they're underpenetrated by technology, so the move to digitization provides a value proposition that delivers productivity, quality, safety, efficiency, transparency and environmental sustainability. So there's a positive catalyst for technology to be adopted. And at some level, yes, that is replacing paper-based systems that exist or, let's say, just the mental based systems that exist. 
And we are seeing demonstrable interest from customers in the Connected Solutions that we offer and I've had a chance to talk to a number of the customers personally. Some that are showing us how they're already taking our technology and connecting the various solutions to improve their workflow. And one of the things they do is not only connect a Trimble workflow, but in a Trimble environment that can provide actually a common data environment, we can connect in an open and really agnostic way to the other technology that our customers use. 
Our customers operate, as you know, in the construction industry is fragmented Therefore, the technology tends to be a bit fragmented as well. And so our ability and approach to connect Trimble and non-Trimble solutions is very top of mind for customers.

From a tipping point perspective and an acceleration perspective, I think the numbers would prove the acceleration of the adoption of technology. And if we were to get an infrastructure bill, which, by the way, we talk about that in a U.S. context. But we see a construction-led recovery really globally in many markets. 
And so HS2 is a really nice project in the U.K., Grand Paris in Paris, the rail project is expected to be a very large project. There's large projects happening in Saudi and Australia continues to have some big development. So we see the fundamentals and the macro as providing an ability to accelerate it. I think really the move to I'd say digitization. COVID, I really do feel has accelerated that kind of perhaps hasn't inflected. So many of our customers were unable to actually go out to the field like they used to be able to do or they realized the need to be cloud connected and cloud-enabled when they weren't going to their offices as frequently. And we think that's helped us drive more bookings in the business to the cloud offerings. 
And as it relates to a tipping point, that's a really good question. It's a bit of a crystal ball. I think one of the catalysts that could create a tipping point would be if we see more -- more of this driven from owners. And I'll say as well as, I'll say as well as regulators and maybe I really mean policy when I say that. So from an owner perspective, that's actually the premise of why we did the e-Builder acquisition because who fundamentally has the most at stake for when a project is late or over budget? Of course, it's the owner, and so we help them manage their capital programs. from a policy and a regulatory perspective, where we have a point of view as we think take the U.S. infrastructure bill, as an example, I mean, this is a generational opportunity to increase the competitiveness of the infrastructure in the United States. 
And we can deliver that infrastructure 20%, 30% cheaper through the use of technology. So it just makes sense. And so if more of this is -- if we can increase the level of awareness I'm certainly an advocate that there's a policy measure here or certainly encouragement measure, and that's why I talked about that Digital Construction Management Act because it provides an incentive for DOTs to adopt technology. 
So I'd say we're all staying tuned for that one. If there's something that sort of fundamentally creates an acceleration on that on the tipping point part of it. And then you asked about platforms, Rob, and on the platform side, I think it's logical to think that there would be some coalescing around a few platforms. I mean, as you said, the industry is rather fragmented. We're not the only technology platform out there. Actually, I think there needs to be interoperability between those technology platforms, and that very much shapes how we build our technology. It is an underlying fundamental belief that we have."

The first being that we provide mapping, routing, navigation engines; second, that we provide the back-office technology for trucking companies; and third, that we provide the field mobility tools for companies. In terms of the booking, and then those are the 3 historic legs of that stool. And then over the last couple of years, we've moved as well to address the shipper side of the market, whereas historically, the strength is on the carrier side. 
So on the carrier side of the business, where we see the bookings growth is in a couple of places. So first, in that back-office ERP systems we call it the transportation management system, and we're moving that business to a recurring model. So there's a model conversion that's happening in there. And we have seen evidence that we're increasing the size of the addressable market, which means we're reaching some customers that we hadn't previously reached. And that's translating into 20%-plus bookings growth on a year-over-year basis in that part of the business. 
What we're seeing as well on the mobility side, which is really more the ELD part of the business as we have seen some life there, both through 2 things: One, increasing penetration in existing customers as some of our existing customers, actually, many of them are adding capacity given the market. In fact, they would like to add more capacity in many cases, aren't able to actually get the vehicles or the drivers to do it, but that's one area where we see growth; and the others is we do see some logos coming back to us, which has been a really good sign for us. 
Still a long way to go. But I'm just liking what I'm seeing from the team and the pace of the team and the trajectory in that Canadian ELD certification was a nice proof point that we're not just talking about these things that we actually also are delivering. That mapping routing navigation business has had many, many years of double-digit recurring revenue growth, which means bookings continue to grow strong and they continue to do a great job on quarter in and quarter out and added up, and that got to the commentary in the script. You asked, Jerry about churn rates as well?"

It absolutely is something that we have a line of -- a reasonable line of sight to the current bookings growth. As we plan the business forward, we'll think about in any given quarter or a year for that matter. What's ""in the bank?"" And then what's the go get? When we think about that go get, then you can measure the pipeline you have and then you measure the qualified leads you have against that. So you kind of just keep working backwards from that equation. And then do you have the horsepower to go and positively affect the pipeline and to turn it into a booking, which eventually turns into the revenue?
In addition, Jerry, another catalyst for us coming into next year is our structures business, so the old Tekla business, the steel concrete business. So that in the summer, we stopped selling perpetual licenses. And so -- in fact, we sold more perpetual this year than we had anticipated. And now that we're off the -- almost entirely off the perpetual that just by the math, will provide a catalyst for ARR or ACV bookings, which will turn into ARR. So that alone would be a catalyst to ARR growth in that business looking into next year."

The business has, I'd say, a pretty good amount of backlog associated with it. As we look forward into 2022, we think that we do have the wind at our backs and that we can continue to grow the business. now the stunning growth that we've had in that business in 2022 or 2021, excuse me. No, I don't see that, that one progresses. We had said a few years ago that this was -- we think -- thought of it as our most mature of the businesses that we have. And it has proved more than once lately to be one of the fastest growers within Trimble on a year-over-year basis. 
So really a lot of excellent innovation -- and as well, our go-to-market team has just done an outstanding job with channel management around -- around the world. And I would expect that to temper back somewhere closer into the company average of the 6% to 9% organic range as we go into next year. I would take that as a starting point."

So I'm excited, and I'm actually quite inspired by the ability for Trimble to play a fundamentally positive impact -- or fundamentally positive role in impacting climate change. Now the truth of the matter is that our products and our technology has had a positive environmental sustainability benefit for as long as we have been around, and it's been a byproduct of the productivity and efficiency that our customers generate. 
And what I see as an opportunity is that comes more and more to the forefront. In some cases, it's as our customers have more reporting to do themselves. Whether they realize it now, some of them do or whether they don't, we see that coming, and then we see an ability to be able to move into that space. 
If you take agriculture as an example, we do have a small business in ag that essentially runs a carbon marketplace. We get calls from customers or potential customers asking for help in certifying the offsets that they're buying. So think about our -- we tend to talk about our agriculture business, but we also have a nice forestry business. These are 2 places that are hugely important in this conversation. 
And so as big companies are making their own commitments and buying offsets, they don't want to buy bad offsets. And so we're encouraged by the types of calls that we're getting because it's giving us conviction of where we take our product road map to positively impact us. I mean, if I think about the construction space, our structures business, so the steel part of the structures business, we did an announcement a couple of weeks ago of something that I think is pretty compelling as we can -- as we continue from a from a design perspective, essentially to design for sustainability to understand the carbon load that a building has during that design and engineering phase. For many years, we've had a predesigned product to help you understand, let's say, the energy consumption profile of a building. 
And as the users of the buildings and let's say, if there becomes regulatory pressure on this, to design with carbon in mind, the constructable models that we provide at Trimble have a profoundly positive ability to impact designing and maintaining and operating with sustainability in mind. So we're actually putting some resources to this because I see and all of us at Trimble see, our Board sees some real interesting opportunities that at some point, we'll turn into commercial opportunities. 
Now do they turn into commercial opportunities as something discrete and separate or are they part of the existing technologies we have? I would say there, I don't know. But boy, you follow what's going on. And you've got -- I've got to believe that there's some material business for us to have here."

So where to start, our Trimble Construction One offering essentially right now can take what we do at Viewpoint. And at Viewpoint, years ago, we moved from selling, I'll call it, an ERP-only, an office-based solution to moving to selling a combined team and field solution. I think project management and field mobility tools, and we called it Viewpoint One and then we called an OTF office team field offering. So it moved from a point solution to a bundled Viewpoint solution. And now that next step is in the Trimble Construction One with the first release of it. 
That brings in many aspects of our MEP business of mechanical, electrical, plumbing business, where we're able to bring in a detailer and estimate our workflows into the product offering. And then from there, we have a basis where we can continue to expand across other architectural and engineering workflows and products that we have. 
So by and large, it's taking what we do already and having a better packaging around that, making it easier for our customers to consume the technology. From a technology perspective, it's better integration, tighter integration between the solutions that we have. Our customers have been asking for this. And so we're really excited to be able to start delivering upon it. I'd say it's just the start. It's Version 1 of Trimble Construction One. There are many other capabilities that we believe we can bring into that, both from a civil perspective as well as a vertical construction perspective. 
And the nature of the conversions we have thus far are predominantly with the existing customers and moving them over. But we did get -- I think there's a few dozen new logos during the quarter on Trimble Construction One. It's very much a persona-based growth platform. We think about personas and architectural engineering persona, we think about the contractor persona. We think about an owner persona. And then we'll -- as we migrate over time, we'll be able to get more and more, I'll say, specific and targeted to delivering construction -- Trimble Construction One to those individual persona. 
So I'd really say the start of much more to come. And the more that we connect the data, the users and the workflow across this, that begets the opportunity to move into richer data AI opportunities. And there, it gets then another level of exciting. So the more we can connect what we've got for our customers, the more that we'll create solutions down the road."

We're definitely running north of that. We're probably about $10 million more in product and freight inflation than we were anticipating. And we've adopted our pricing strategy all year in response to our best guess of where things are. You're right, there's some latency in when you can make a decision and implement the strategy. And it really differs by business and customer. 
In some cases, we can implement a price increase by smarter and less discounting. In some cases, there's a surcharge that's possible. In some cases, you have to wait for a list price. But I would say our pricing momentum has kept up with the inflation outlook that we started with, but we're running behind because inflation is hotter than we believe. So your understanding is correct, we're behind inflation now, even though the -- pretty much the full impact of our price increase came through in Q4, will be modestly negative, not hugely modestly negative. 
Going forward, it's a very tough world to guess cost inflation. And we think it's not going to get better soon. We're optimistic it won't get a lot worse. We have some more work to do on the pricing front. But I would say, in aggregate, it is still our view that over time, we can offset the inflation cost impact with pricing.

And then before then from a technology perspective, we get -- I'll say incentives and help to move technology that we have. So to help us accelerate the velocities and the development efforts. 
So we get help on the technology -- some help on the technology side there. Nature of relationship does give us a better pricing on the cloud cycles that we consume. And then yes, the idea is to build the Construction Cloud powered by Azure. And in doing so, we believe there are some unique and novel things that we can bring to that construction cloud and just think about the breadth and depth of what we do at Trimble. 
And now map that at a go-to-market perspective. I mean you've got tens of thousands of sellers between Microsoft and the partner network on top of the sellers that we have on a global scale and you quickly get a sense of why I'd be -- I am very excited about the opportunities to help us with reach and scale as a result of this relationship. And we do think that there's some really interesting technologies to combine between the 2 companies. Let's say, stay tuned for more on that in time."

Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2 with the key messages we want to convey today. 
In the third quarter, our team once again delivered outstanding results and did so with an incredibly difficult supply chain environment. We exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.36 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% on an organic basis. Total revenue growth of 14%, EBITDA margin of 25.9% and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $784 million. We achieved record third-quarter levels of revenue in many of our businesses with another exceptionally strong quarter in machine control and civil construction, guidance and agriculture and survey and mapping. 
Our results demonstrate the strength of the underlying market recovery and the quality of our execution against our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. Our results also demonstrate the quality of the Trimble team. And I want to give a special shout out to all our colleagues, led by Leah Lambertson, who are helping us manage through the supply chain challenges. On the basis of this collective strength, we are raising our annual earnings guidance despite a tightening supply chain environment. 
Let's start with market conditions where the overall landscape remains robust. Construction backlog is healthy, especially in residential and infrastructure translating to strength in our Geospatial and Buildings and Infrastructure reporting segments. We remain optimistic that the infrastructure bill will ultimately be passed in the United States, which would bolster our long-term outlook in our construction and [ surveying businesses, starting at some point in 2023 ]. 
We have been and are building product and go-to-market capabilities ahead of this opportunity. I'm especially proud of the role Trimble has played in leading policy advocacy in support of technology adoption, most specifically around advanced digital construction management systems, which provide state departments of transportation with access to funding to help them accelerate adoption of proven digital design and construction technologies. We will continue our commitment and support to the nation's federal highway administration and state departments of transportation in their pursuit of achieving sustainable and state-of-the-art project delivery. 
In Agriculture & Forestry, commodity price strength continues to translate into customer buying power and our backlog remains strong. We are tracking inventory levels of major ag products which remain in a healthy position and provide some line of sight to continued farm financial strength, which we see as an important counterbalance to rising input costs. On the policy front, we have been advocating for a legislative proposal called SB 2750 (sic) [S.2750] Precision Agriculture Loan Program Act in the United States that provides low-cost loans to farmers to incentivize adoption of precision ag technologies. Outside the United States, we also see positive conditions, including ongoing subsidies, and we are beginning to see more policies that promote the use of technology to increase environmental sustainability. 
In Transportation, we had another quarter of solid bookings growth, improved customer retention and higher operating margins. In September, we announced a strategic relationship with Procter & Gamble, which will shape the development of an agile procurement collaboration platform and will, in turn, complement our existing set of supply chain-focused solutions. Success looks like expediting contracting and onboarding processes to increase the velocity of business transactions while enabling more efficient movement of freight. 
I'm also pleased to report we were the first major technology provider to certify in Canada for the Canadian ELD mandate, evidence of the positive shift in product delivery in the business. On the downside, supply chain is especially disruptive to the operations of many of our trucking customers and will likely constrain our ability to see our execution progression flow through the near-term P&L. 
Let's turn to Page 3 and talk some -- about some notable progression of our Connect and Scale 2025 strategy seen through the lens of the Trimble operating system, capturing strategy, people and execution. To set context, our strategy is an industry platform strategy that manifests in bringing the best of Trimble together with ecosystem partners to transform industries that support how we live, what we eat and how we move. On the heels of COP26, we are also convinced that we can have a profoundly positive impact on addressing climate change through the use of technology. 
As a proof point of our strategy, we are excited to have announced on October 27, the formation of a strategic partnership with Microsoft to build, market and sell our industry cloud platforms and solutions that connect people, technology, tasks, data, processes and industry life cycles. Our initial focus will be to build the Trimble Construction Cloud powered by Microsoft Azure. Importantly, we will also partner on joint go-to-market strategies to globally deliver these cloud innovations. 
As an additional strategic proof point at our annual user conference for our Viewpoint construction management software business, we announced the transition of Viewpoint's branding to Trimble. At this user conference, we also launched Trimble Construction One, as shown on Page 4, which extends the capabilities of Viewpoint's current SaaS software suite with new and exciting capabilities from other parts of the Trimble software portfolio. 
In addition to the Viewpoint financial and operational management capabilities, Trimble Construction One incorporates Trimble's estimating and detailing solutions as well as Trimble's advanced project management offering in a single integrated package, which is now being sold by multiple Trimble divisions. Our direction is clear, we will continue to expand the capabilities of the Trimble Construction One platform for our Civil and Buildings customers to further connect the physical and digital worlds across construction field and office workflows. 
On people, we continue to be recognized as a top company culture, and Fast Company recognized us as a best workplace for innovators. In an increasingly competitive job market, melding Trimble's mission with our innovative culture is top of mind for our talent attraction and retention efforts. As evidence of the attractiveness of Trimble, in September, we hired Jennifer Lin as Chief Platform Officer; and Poppy Crum as our Chief Technology Officer, both world-class talent who see and believe in our vision and the potential of Trimble. 
On execution, we continue to innovate. Our MX50 mobile scanner launched in the third quarter, as did a beta release of SketchUp for iPad, and we continue to enhance the capabilities of our best-in-class high accuracy correction services, which enable positioning down to centimeter levels globally. We are investing heavily in our own digital transformation, which will provide the system and process fuel to deliver our increasingly connected solutions in an efficient and scalable way. 
Before I turn the call over to David, I want to talk about how we are operating and leading in the current environment, which presents both volatility and unprecedented opportunity. For years, we have talked about our 3-4-3 operating model, 3 months, 4 quarters, 3 years. I see the role of Trimble leadership as being stewards of capital allocation on behalf of our shareholders, where we balance short-term realities with long-term possibility. As we move towards closing out 2021 and in to 2022, we will continue to support the incremental investments we are putting towards our digital transformation, autonomy and infrastructure opportunities. 
We have high conviction that these investments will create new sustainable and differentiated long-term growth opportunities for Trimble, and we remain bullish on the long-term secular opportunity for digital technology to make our customers more successful, productive and sustainable. We will have the courage to look through near-term supply chain disruptions and upfront cost of our digital transformation and to hold ourselves accountable to progressing our Connect and Scale strategy. David, over to you."

Third quarter revenue was $901 million, up 14% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 1% and divestitures subtracted 2%, for a total organic revenue increase of 15%. Gross margin in the third quarter was 58.7%, down 10 basis points year-over-year, reflecting several factors, including higher product and freight costs in our supply chain, offset by increased pricing and lower discounting. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.9% down 90 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher operating expenses and investments in the business. Operating margin was 23.8% down 40 basis points year-over-year, but still up over 300 basis points versus the pre-COVID third quarter of 2019. Operating expenses last year were unusually low in a number of areas, including compensation expense. Net income dollars increased by 10% and earnings per share increased by $0.06 to $0.66 per share. 
Our third quarter cash flow from operations was $166 million and free cash flow was $156 million. Cash flow was down modestly year-over-year in the quarter as we are purchasing inventory in response to strong demand and supply chain shortages. Operating cash flow was up 23% on a year-to-date basis with a conversion ratio to net income above 1.1x. Our net debt declined $88 million in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 0.9x. During the third quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock. 
At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $513 million in cash. Our balance sheet is strong, and we are well positioned to invest in our business both organically and through acquisitions that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. 
Turning now to Slide 6, I'll review in more detail our third quarter revenue trends. As mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 8% in aggregate, and was up 11% organically on a year-over-year basis. The 11% rate excludes the impact of foreign exchange and our recent divestitures of Iron Solutions, Manhattan Real Estate Solutions and Construction Logistics. All 3 of these divested businesses had a recurring revenue component, but were in areas outside of our strategic road map. 
Our nonrecurring revenue streams grew with hardware up 18% year-over-year and perpetual software growing 19%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction, geospatial and agriculture. Our hardware growth contributed to perpetual software growth as some of our hardware offerings are bundled with perpetual software. 
From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 11%. And Europe, revenues were up 18%. Asia Pacific was up 5% year-over-year, and the rest of the world was up 33%, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector in Brazil. 
Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics we follow, and I'll start with ARR. While total company ARR grew 11% organically on a year-over-year basis, ARR, excluding transportation, grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue continued to be negative, representing approximately minus 2% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis notwithstanding an acceleration in purchases of component inventory during Q3. 
Research and development on a trailing 12-month basis was 15% of revenue and our deferred revenue grew 17% year-over-year. Our backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.6 billion, up from $1.5 billion a quarter earlier and up over 30% year-over-year. While growth in our backlog is an indicator of momentum in the business, it is also reflective of the shortages and extended delivery times that we are experiencing for many key components in our hardware products. 
Of our $1.6 billion in backlog, just under $340 million relates to our hardware offerings, up from about $100 million in hardware backlog a year ago and $38 million higher than the end of Q2. We expect supply chain constraints for many key components to extend well into 2022. 
Let's turn now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 12% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our building and civil construction businesses, and organic ARR was up in the high teens in the quarter. 
Geospatial revenue was up 23% on an organic basis driven principally by strong performance in our core branded survey equipment. Margins were up 60 basis points due to both revenue growth and operating cost control. 
Resources and Utilities revenue was up 23% on an organic basis. We experienced double-digit growth in each of our precision agriculture and positioning services offerings. Margins and resources in utilities contracted 330 basis points and were hardest hit by product cost inflation in the quarter. 
Financial results in transportation showed progression in a number of areas. Revenue was up 3% on an organic basis year-over-year, but grew less than we expected due to supply chain challenges both in our operations and our customers' businesses. Margins expanded 410 basis points year-over-year. 
Turning now to Page 9 for our updated outlook for the full year. We are raising our expectation for full year revenue with a new range of $3.59 billion to $3.64 billion representing growth for the full year in the mid-teens and single-digit year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. End market demand is even stronger than we thought it would be a quarter ago, but supply chain constraints will likely cause our backlog to remain at or above the increased levels from the end of Q3. 
ARR growth at the company level is trending as we anticipated, driven by strong bookings and subscription transition, and we expect organic ARR growth of greater than 10% in the fourth quarter and a strong entry point going into 2022. Gross margins in the fourth quarter are likely to be about flat sequentially with the third quarter. An increasing mix of software will have a favorable impact on sequential gross margin trends but this benefit will be offset by an anticipated decline in hardware margins. In aggregate, we now expect that the net impact of accelerating hardware cost inflation and our recent price increases will be modestly negative to hardware margins in Q4. 
Building off our strong third-quarter results, our outlook for operating margins continues to improve and we now expect operating margins for the full year 2021 will be above 2020. Operating margins in the fourth quarter of this year will likely be lower than the fourth quarter of 2020 driven both by higher hardware component costs year-on-year and by higher operating expense as OpEx was unusually low in 2020, and we are now ramping up investments against our strategy. 
Our outlook for full year earnings per share has increased to $2.61 to $2.69, representing growth of approximately 17% to 21% year-over-year. We continue to expect operating cash flow greater than 1.1x net income and free cash flow greater than 1x net income, reflecting the strong cash generative aspects of our business model. 
I'd like to comment briefly on the outlook in the fourth quarter for our transportation segment. As Rob mentioned earlier, the leading indicators for this business are strong, with growing bookings of recurring solutions, sequentially improving customer retention in our mobility business and increasing signs that our connected transportation strategy is resonating with customers. Nevertheless, factors related to the global supply chain and the extraordinary pressure on the transportation industry will negatively impact our business momentum in the short run. 
Our OEM business will be constrained by customer manufacturing challenges. And the aftermarket business will be slowed by the fact that trucking companies are reluctant to take assets off the road for technology upgrades at a time of high transportation prices and extraordinary asset utilization. We believe that these constraints will be resolved over time, and we remain confident in the turnaround of this business, but the pace of improvement of revenue, ARR and profitability will be lower than we had earlier projected. 
With regard to 2022, we don't plan to give detailed guidance until our year-end earnings release, but we can characterize some of the drivers that we see now and their expected impact on revenue, ARR and margins. Demand across our end markets remain strong, and we believe that strength will sustain at least through the end of 2022. Our customers need for digital solutions to optimize their workflows has never been stronger, and these customers have the money and the desire to invest. We expect organic ARR growth to accelerate in 2022 building off the momentum we have now and aided by continued model transitions and the growing sale of connected recurring solutions. 
The supply chain environment remains our biggest challenge and that challenge is predicted to be with us for several more quarters. From a cost perspective, we anticipate that inflation in our hardware businesses will be sustained through the first quarters of 2022, driven both by higher component costs and higher cost of getting products shipped to our manufacturers and distribution centers. It is the goal of our pricing strategy to offset the impact of inflation on our hardware gross margins, and that pricing strategy continues to evolve. 
Rob referenced in his remarks, the investments we are making against our digital transformation. We anticipate that as we get through this investment cycle in 2022 and as our software businesses continue their transition to recurring revenue models, our operating leverage will be lower in 2022 than we expect over the longer term. The investments we are making in our digital transformation are at the core of unlocking the potential of our platform strategy, and we expect to end 2022 with business processes and systems that will accelerate our ability to transform the way we go to market and the way our customers do their work. 
With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."

So I'll give you kind of a walk around the end markets, and some of the positives and some of the potential gotchas that we're looking out for. And the things we're looking out for that could be to the negative would be around supply chain, inflation and labor availability. And of course, all those things correlate. 
On the geospatial and construction side, we see strength in residential and infrastructure work right now. We see on the commercial side, strength in submarkets such as data centers and hospitals. We believe there's indicators that the residential work will drive light industrial work. 
As it relates to the infrastructure bill and if it doesn't pass, we would see a benefit of the infrastructure bill really in 2023. So we really don't expect anything in 2022. Of course, there's a sentiment aspect that's hard to quantify, or -- but we remain that optimistic, and I spent some time in Washington a couple of weeks ago to that end. And when I think about construction and I think about the labor side of it as a potential downside, the benefit of technology is that it can make an inexperienced operator good or geospatial market, a robotic total station can turn a 2-person operation into a 1-person operation. 
On the ag side, what's positive are commodity prices, it looks like the harvest early data on the harvest would suggest a lower harvest, which would hold up commodity prices and then we index that against the ending stocks or the inventory. As you said, absolutely input inflation, I think, is what's starting to dent the optimism on the farmer front. 
With that input inflation, though I look at the value proposition of the technology. So a spot spray technology can reduce the use of herbicide. And that's a really big deal or the variable rate can reduce the use of the other inputs. And as we know, also has a positive environmental sustainability benefit. At a geographic level, the subsidy policies tend to be more consistent and higher outside the United States. So that tends to be -- provide the ballast, let's say, to the overall market. But we're absolutely paying -- paying attention to all of this. At some point, right, this is -- will have to have an impact. 
On the transportation side, what we see is strength in spot pricing. And I mean, we've even seen it from our own rates on transportation, as David talked about, where they've gone up. a downside of driver availability in the market and availability of trucks coming out of the OEMs. So carriers are having trouble actually adding capacity. And when I think about a technology lens on that. An average driver effectively uses around 7 hours of their clock per day. Our strategy is to drive a more connected supply chain. That means dynamic schedules with the shippers and the receivers to better optimize wasted driver hours. We provide better routing and navigation solutions to create efficient trip management. And fundamentally, we want to get at more accurate order load information for the customers. And that can increase the network optimization. So there's puts and takes as always, Ann. And we think that technology has a role really in almost any market condition"

And the bookings that creates ARR later down the road, but the value proposition and the awareness from the customers is quite encouraging. And we've seen that in the bookings for some time now and which now starts now plays through the -- through the ARR expansion."

From a market -- overall market perspective, really the secular opportunity in construction technology. And by the way, I'd say this in our other end markets as well, is that these markets are large, they're global they're underserved and they're underpenetrated by technology, so the move to digitization provides a value proposition that delivers productivity, quality, safety, efficiency, transparency and environmental sustainability. So there's a positive catalyst for technology to be adopted. And at some level, yes, that is replacing paper-based systems that exist or, let's say, just the mental based systems that exist. 
And we are seeing demonstrable interest from customers in the Connected Solutions that we offer and I've had a chance to talk to a number of the customers personally. Some that are showing us how they're already taking our technology and connecting the various solutions to improve their workflow. And one of the things they do is not only connect a Trimble workflow, but in a Trimble environment that can provide actually a common data environment, we can connect in an open and really agnostic way to the other technology that our customers use. 
Our customers operate, as you know, in the construction industry is fragmented Therefore, the technology tends to be a bit fragmented as well. And so our ability and approach to connect Trimble and non-Trimble solutions is very top of mind for customers. And of course, COVID has also been a catalyst from a digitization perspective, so much of what we do can uniquely connect the work in the office and the field. that connects the hardware and the software and ultimately, that physical and digital."

From a tipping point perspective and an acceleration perspective, I think the numbers would prove the acceleration of the adoption of technology.

From a tipping point perspective and an acceleration perspective, I think the numbers would prove the acceleration of the adoption of technology. And if we were to get an infrastructure bill, which, by the way, we talk about that in a U.S. context. But we see a construction-led recovery really globally in many markets. 
And so HS2 is a really nice project in the U.K., Grand Paris in Paris, the rail project is expected to be a very large project. There's large projects happening in Saudi and Australia continues to have some big development. So we see the fundamentals and the macro as providing an ability to accelerate it. I think really the move to I'd say digitization. COVID, I really do feel has accelerated that kind of perhaps hasn't inflected. So many of our customers were unable to actually go out to the field like they used to be able to do or they realized the need to be cloud connected and cloud-enabled when they weren't going to their offices as frequently. And we think that's helped us drive more bookings in the business to the cloud offerings. 
And as it relates to a tipping point, that's a really good question. It's a bit of a crystal ball. I think one of the catalysts that could create a tipping point would be if we see more -- more of this driven from owners. And I'll say as well as, I'll say as well as regulators and maybe I really mean policy when I say that. So from an owner perspective, that's actually the premise of why we did the e-Builder acquisition because who fundamentally has the most at stake for when a project is late or over budget? Of course, it's the owner, and so we help them manage their capital programs. from a policy and a regulatory perspective, where we have a point of view as we think take the U.S. infrastructure bill, as an example, I mean, this is a generational opportunity to increase the competitiveness of the infrastructure in the United States. 
And we can deliver that infrastructure 20%, 30% cheaper through the use of technology. So it just makes sense. And so if more of this is -- if we can increase the level of awareness I'm certainly an advocate that there's a policy measure here or certainly encouragement measure, and that's why I talked about that Digital Construction Management Act because it provides an incentive for DOTs to adopt technology. 
So I'd say we're all staying tuned for that one. If there's something that sort of fundamentally creates an acceleration on that on the tipping point part of it. And then you asked about platforms, Rob, and on the platform side, I think it's logical to think that there would be some coalescing around a few platforms. I mean, as you said, the industry is rather fragmented. We're not the only technology platform out there. Actually, I think there needs to be interoperability between those technology platforms, and that very much shapes how we build our technology. It is an underlying fundamental belief that we have."

Within the transportation business, I've historically talked about 3 legs on the stool -- on the technology stack. The first being that we provide mapping, routing, navigation engines; second, that we provide the back-office technology for trucking companies; and third, that we provide the field mobility tools for companies. In terms of the booking, and then those are the 3 historic legs of that stool. And then over the last couple of years, we've moved as well to address the shipper side of the market, whereas historically, the strength is on the carrier side. 
So on the carrier side of the business, where we see the bookings growth is in a couple of places. So first, in that back-office ERP systems we call it the transportation management system, and we're moving that business to a recurring model. So there's a model conversion that's happening in there. And we have seen evidence that we're increasing the size of the addressable market, which means we're reaching some customers that we hadn't previously reached. And that's translating into 20%-plus bookings growth on a year-over-year basis in that part of the business. 
What we're seeing as well on the mobility side, which is really more the ELD part of the business as we have seen some life there, both through 2 things: One, increasing penetration in existing customers as some of our existing customers, actually, many of them are adding capacity given the market. In fact, they would like to add more capacity in many cases, aren't able to actually get the vehicles or the drivers to do it, but that's one area where we see growth; and the others is we do see some logos coming back to us, which has been a really good sign for us. 
Still a long way to go. But I'm just liking what I'm seeing from the team and the pace of the team and the trajectory in that Canadian ELD certification was a nice proof point that we're not just talking about these things that we actually also are delivering. That mapping routing navigation business has had many, many years of double-digit recurring revenue growth, which means bookings continue to grow strong and they continue to do a great job on quarter in and quarter out and added up, and that got to the commentary in the script.

When we think about that go get, then you can measure the pipeline you have and then you measure the qualified leads you have against that. So you kind of just keep working backwards from that equation. And then do you have the horsepower to go and positively affect the pipeline and to turn it into a booking, which eventually turns into the revenue?
In addition, Jerry, another catalyst for us coming into next year is our structures business, so the old Tekla business, the steel concrete business. So that in the summer, we stopped selling perpetual licenses. And so -- in fact, we sold more perpetual this year than we had anticipated. And now that we're off the -- almost entirely off the perpetual that just by the math, will provide a catalyst for ARR or ACV bookings, which will turn into ARR.

The business has, I'd say, a pretty good amount of backlog associated with it. As we look forward into 2022, we think that we do have the wind at our backs and that we can continue to grow the business. now the stunning growth that we've had in that business in 2022 or 2021, excuse me. No, I don't see that, that one progresses. We had said a few years ago that this was -- we think -- thought of it as our most mature of the businesses that we have. And it has proved more than once lately to be one of the fastest growers within Trimble on a year-over-year basis. 
So really a lot of excellent innovation -- and as well, our go-to-market team has just done an outstanding job with channel management around -- around the world.

So I'm excited, and I'm actually quite inspired by the ability for Trimble to play a fundamentally positive impact -- or fundamentally positive role in impacting climate change. Now the truth of the matter is that our products and our technology has had a positive environmental sustainability benefit for as long as we have been around, and it's been a byproduct of the productivity and efficiency that our customers generate. 
And what I see as an opportunity is that comes more and more to the forefront. In some cases, it's as our customers have more reporting to do themselves. Whether they realize it now, some of them do or whether they don't, we see that coming, and then we see an ability to be able to move into that space. 
If you take agriculture as an example, we do have a small business in ag that essentially runs a carbon marketplace. We get calls from customers or potential customers asking for help in certifying the offsets that they're buying. So think about our -- we tend to talk about our agriculture business, but we also have a nice forestry business. These are 2 places that are hugely important in this conversation. 
And so as big companies are making their own commitments and buying offsets, they don't want to buy bad offsets. And so we're encouraged by the types of calls that we're getting because it's giving us conviction of where we take our product road map to positively impact us. I mean, if I think about the construction space, our structures business, so the steel part of the structures business, we did an announcement a couple of weeks ago of something that I think is pretty compelling as we can -- as we continue from a from a design perspective, essentially to design for sustainability to understand the carbon load that a building has during that design and engineering phase. For many years, we've had a predesigned product to help you understand, let's say, the energy consumption profile of a building. 
And as the users of the buildings and let's say, if there becomes regulatory pressure on this, to design with carbon in mind, the constructable models that we provide at Trimble have a profoundly positive ability to impact designing and maintaining and operating with sustainability in mind. So we're actually putting some resources to this because I see and all of us at Trimble see, our Board sees some real interesting opportunities that at some point, we'll turn into commercial opportunities. 
Now do they turn into commercial opportunities as something discrete and separate or are they part of the existing technologies we have? I would say there, I don't know. But boy, you follow what's going on. And you've got -- I've got to believe that there's some material business for us to have here."

So where to start, our Trimble Construction One offering essentially right now can take what we do at Viewpoint. And at Viewpoint, years ago, we moved from selling, I'll call it, an ERP-only, an office-based solution to moving to selling a combined team and field solution. I think project management and field mobility tools, and we called it Viewpoint One and then we called an OTF office team field offering. So it moved from a point solution to a bundled Viewpoint solution. And now that next step is in the Trimble Construction One with the first release of it. 
That brings in many aspects of our MEP business of mechanical, electrical, plumbing business, where we're able to bring in a detailer and estimate our workflows into the product offering. And then from there, we have a basis where we can continue to expand across other architectural and engineering workflows and products that we have. 
So by and large, it's taking what we do already and having a better packaging around that, making it easier for our customers to consume the technology. From a technology perspective, it's better integration, tighter integration between the solutions that we have. Our customers have been asking for this. And so we're really excited to be able to start delivering upon it. I'd say it's just the start. It's Version 1 of Trimble Construction One. There are many other capabilities that we believe we can bring into that, both from a civil perspective as well as a vertical construction perspective. 
And the nature of the conversions we have thus far are predominantly with the existing customers and moving them over. But we did get -- I think there's a few dozen new logos during the quarter on Trimble Construction One. It's very much a persona-based growth platform. We think about personas and architectural engineering persona, we think about the contractor persona. We think about an owner persona. And then we'll -- as we migrate over time, we'll be able to get more and more, I'll say, specific and targeted to delivering construction -- Trimble Construction One to those individual persona. 
So I'd really say the start of much more to come. And the more that we connect the data, the users and the workflow across this, that begets the opportunity to move into richer data AI opportunities. And there, it gets then another level of exciting. So the more we can connect what we've got for our customers, the more that we'll create solutions down the road."

We're definitely running north of that. We're probably about $10 million more in product and freight inflation than we were anticipating. And we've adopted our pricing strategy all year in response to our best guess of where things are. You're right, there's some latency in when you can make a decision and implement the strategy. And it really differs by business and customer. 
In some cases, we can implement a price increase by smarter and less discounting. In some cases, there's a surcharge that's possible. In some cases, you have to wait for a list price. But I would say our pricing momentum has kept up with the inflation outlook that we started with, but we're running behind because inflation is hotter than we believe. So your understanding is correct, we're behind inflation now, even though the -- pretty much the full impact of our price increase came through in Q4, will be modestly negative, not hugely modestly negative. 
Going forward, it's a very tough world to guess cost inflation. And we think it's not going to get better soon. We're optimistic it won't get a lot worse. We have some more work to do on the pricing front. But I would say, in aggregate, it is still our view that over time, we can offset the inflation cost impact with pricing. It's just going to take us into next year to do that."

We do believe there'll be an infrastructure bill that comes. And even if it doesn't come, we believe there is a fundamental ability for us to play a positive impact within infrastructure to have it be built better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener. So we have been putting more resources to that, which we in turn think will -- will help us grow the business.

We went through our annual strategy exercise as we do each of our major franchises have defined their -- what Connect & Scale means to them and our industry cloud strategies or platform strategies. The relationship with Microsoft, we think, is a really big deal for us and where we take the business going forward. 
We've got demonstrable success on digital transformation efforts with some of the underlying plumbing that we're putting in place. So things like common identity, licensing entitlement engines, which really are just, I'll call it, the must-haves table stakes for where we're -- for where we're going as an organization. Most of our businesses have identified where they see cross-sell, upsell opportunity within, I'll say, common customer personas. 
So I like the work that we're doing in preparation. I wish it could come faster. I have to admit these things do have a bit of a natural course they take."

So to the extent that, that inflects and we see more adoption of that, and we have been seeing more adoption of that regardless of how the accounting is treated on it from a practical perspective, it does become more recurring and have an ability to drive that. In addition, the more we connect that hardware and the software that we have overall, there I think we see a large installed base of customers who have our hardware that would benefit also by connecting to let's say, to Office software to combine with the field hardware.
