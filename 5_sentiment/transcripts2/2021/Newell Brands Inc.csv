I sincerely hope that you and your loved ones are staying healthy and safe. While there's no doubt that 2020 was a very challenging year, I am immensely proud of the results our team delivered as we quickly adapted to the evolving environment. At the same time, we remain focused on ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees carefully operating our plants and distribution facilities while [indiscernible] keeping our capacity and maintaining financial viability and business community. 
We closed this to start the year in an -- on an exceptional manner with fourth quarter and full year results ahead of our expectations across the board. This is a testament to the incredible resilience, fortitude and commitment of our employees who execute with excellence. In fact, in [ first ] quarter, we pivoted to accelerate the turnaround plan and drove significantly stronger underlying performance in the business in the second half of the year across all key value drivers, top line margins, earnings per share and cash growth. We also achieved meaningful progress against our strategic priorities in 2020. First, we strengthened and diversified our team as we broadly [ work ] our leaders from the outside into our clients, commercial food and outdoor and recreation businesses as well as the driver functions. They hit the ground running. 
As COVID certainly hit off, did not allow for any down time. They complement our strong existing leaders across the remaining 4 businesses. 
The leadership team and I are focused on building a winning 1 new culture focused on trust, transparency and teamwork. A diversity inclusion belonging efforts are our top priority as we continue to [indiscernible] our employees and unify everyone behind the common purpose of delighting consumers with our innovative brands that create moment to guide, build confidence and provide peace of mind. 
Second, throughout the year, we improved customer relationships through enhanced collaboration, joint business planning efforts as well as increased emphasis on delivering excellent service for our customers. We are leveraging our omnichannel capabilities to advance joint business planning and believe there's an area of strength for you. We're also seizing opportunities to close our distribution gaps, particularly in the food drug and other channels. We're already making progress on that front across a number of businesses, such as Food, writing and Home Fragrance. 
Third, we drove a 30 basis point improvement in normalized operating margin in [indiscernible] and incredible fee, given the cost and business mix headwinds we had to overcome during the year. This was made possible by establishing a culture of productivity as well as aggressively attacking overhead costs and organizational complexity. In fact, normalized operating margin expanded 120 basis points year-over-year in the second half, reversing the losses in the second quarter that were mostly driven by fixed cost deleveraging. And for the full year, EPS of $1.79, wow, up nearly 12% from continuing operations for tight working capital management resulted in stellar operating cash flow of more than $1.4 billion. Yes, folks, $1.4 billion. Our business unit CFOs, led by our own $1 billion-man, Chris Peterson, did a phenomenal job. 
Lastly, 1 of the key objectives of turnaround has been to return the company to sustainable core sales growth. While core sales for the year declined 1.1%, I'm delighted to say that in the second half of 2020, we done the [ common ], core sales grew 6% and increase across 7 out of 8 business units with every geographic region growing. 
During 2020, we experienced healthy domestic consumption that's broad-based. The strength and resilience of our portfolio showed through as growth in Food, Commercial and Appliances, Cookware business units offset Writing softness. The team successfully navigated demand surges, product and container availability issues and tempering factor and distribution center closures. Highly focused on relevant generation, grounded in consumer insights as well as omnichannel execution are making a difference. During 2020, we grew, improved domestic market share across a number of businesses. including baby gear, food storage, vacuum scene, fresh preserving, tents, quarters and tents, to name a few. Many of our top bans delivered incredible results in 2020, as [indiscernible], FoodSaver, upholster, [indiscernible], Bob, Beverlyn, all grew at a double-digit rate. 
Omnichannel is the way forward and a critical priority for us. Our e-commerce business has continued to be a substantial growth engine for the company. In 2020, e-commerce revenue growth accelerated to the high 30s, and penetration online improved to about 22% of net sales on a local basis, close to double the rate versus 2 years ago. While baby remains, by far, the most highly penetrated business across the digital platforms, we'll see meaningful shift towards online consumption across the portfolio. In fact, in 2020, 4 business units commanded digital penetration as a percent of net sales of more than 20%, including Baby, Home Fragrance, Outdoor & Recreation and Appliances and Cookware, and Food is chasing that number. 
All of our leaders took quick and decisive actions to swiftly adapt to the COVID-19 environment and emerging trends. These trends including -- include preparing more food at home as regular people turn into home shares, heightened interest in outdoor hobbies and personal wellbeing and increased investment in sanitation. We anticipate that trends will continue to evolve throughout 2021. 
We also believe that many of the habits that have been formed during the pandemic are here to stay with our portfolio well-positioned to capitalize on them. 
Let me briefly touch upon how each of our businesses performed in 2020 as I'm truly thrilled with the progress we have made. Let's start with Appliances & Cookware, where we delivered mid-single-digit core sales growth driven by the strength in the international markets. 
In the U.S., consumption increased during the fourth quarter and for the full year as more people have been cooking, baking and spending time at home. In Latin America, despite COVID-related challenges, the team delivered outstanding results as they quickly pivoted towards the digital platform. 
Although I'm extremely proud of these results, I also realized that a lot more work needs to be done to reposition the Appliance business for sustainable growth. During 2020, the Appliances category accelerated significantly. And in some instances, we did not keep up, especially in the U.S. This resulted in share losses, albeit lower in magnitude than in prior years. Although we are seeing good traction with recent interventions such as Mr. Coffee iced coffee maker, Oster Texture Select Blenders and Oster Diamond for heating cooking parts, we need to extend the learnings and leverage consumer insights across the entire brand portfolio, Back where it began in 2020 and is continuing in earnest throughout 2021, as we implement the necessary strategic changes to successfully position appliances. We have a strong international Appliance franchise with strong brand equity for Oster [indiscernible] in LatAm and Australia and New Zealand, followed by branding in Europe, our challenge is to address payer category businesses in the U.S. with low gross margins that track down the portfolio. Chris Robins, our CEO for that business, will undertake actions in 2021 to prune the portfolio. 
Within the Commercial Solutions segment, our commercial business had a phenomenal 2020 as core sales growth during each quarter culminated and high single-digit growth for the year. We saw particularly strong sales growth in washroom, blow and scarring product as well as outdoor and garage organization businesses we've benefited from heightened consumer engagement across the home improvement categories. 
In response to strong demand for sanitization as well as our strategic investments to expand production capacity, we placed about 3.3 million soap and dispenser sanitizer dispensers globally and sold enough soap and sanitizers to clean over 30 billion pairs of hands. That's a lot of hands. We're not stopping there. We're introducing innovative stands and brackets that enable facility operators to put hand sanitizers virtually anywhere in the building, including on a wall, on a table top or any general open space. The breadth of the commercial business portfolio, which includes both consumer and commercial offerings as well as the diverse coverage of verticals and enhanced partnership with retail partners, position the business for the long -- for long-term success. 
Let's move to Connected Home & Security business. While core sales were down in 2020 due to supply constraints caused by pandemic-related plant shutdowns, the business performed well in the back half of the year, with top line accelerating in the fourth quarter. 
Within the Home Solutions segment, our Food business has certainly lived up to its rocket-ship status that have grown very funder. It actually returned to growth prior to the pandemic and built momentum to mid-20% core sales growth in 2020, propelled by strong consumption throughout the year as well as market share gains. In the U.S., our leading brands, Rubbermaid, FoodSaver and Ball, took share across food storage, food preservation and canning verticals, benefiting from improved commercialization of product, stronger consumer social engagement and programming as well as recent innovations, such as the latest vacuum sealing device, FoodSaver and VS3000 multiuse preservation system and Rubbermaid Brilliance Glass. The launch of Brilliance Glass is off to a rolling start. And the overall sub-brand of Rubbermaid Brilliance sales have almost doubled in 2020. 2020 was a stellar year for FoodSaver, which is the fastest-growing brand across all of your brands, and it broke through as a top 10 brand for us. Strong Appliance sales in 2020 should translate into increased consumer purchases in 2021. 
In Food, we continue to chase prolonged demand for January, and we are working hard to address supply constraints in certain product lines. 
At [indiscernible] to Home Fragrance, we experienced strong consumption growth at our Home Fragrance business during 2020 driven by surge in demand in the back half of the year. As a result, core sales increased in both North America and EMEA in the second half of the year and in the seasonally critical fourth quarter period. Full year top line sales performance was partially hindered by the temporary closure of [indiscernible] retail stores and other specialty chains for several months earlier in the year and the supply chain disruption experienced in the second quarter. 
I'm extremely proud of the team's resilience and creativity in addressing supply shortages as they work around the clock and [indiscernible] engaged the corporate teams in the manufacturing and packing operations. They went all out on production in an attempt to keep up with consumer demand, which remained robust in January. 
The scented category -- candle category [indiscernible] in 2020 [indiscernible] as demand for products that help bring tranquility into consumer homes remained robust. We held share despite supply constraints. As we look out to 2021, there are a number of exciting innovations in the hopper, including the  Yankee Candle Signature Collection, the largest update to the Yankee line in years, and it's launching this month. It will provide our best burning experience today. 
We continue to reposition the Home Fragrance business for the long time. During 2020, we exited the fundraising business and 77 retail stores with additional store closures [indiscernible] expected in 2021. At the same time, we are building great momentum on our direct-to-consumer business, which grew strong double digits in 2020, offsetting sharp falls in retail, expanding distribution into the grocery and truck channels and diversifying the product portfolio into auto diffusers, et cetera. 
In the Learning & Development segment, cross-sell for our Baby business grew modestly during 2020. The rebound from Q3 persisted into Q4, driven by healthy consumption recovering from the depressed levels in March and April, where lockdowns were in full effect. For the year, domestic demand improved across baby gear and in print care businesses, particularly [indiscernible] car seats, high chair, strings and bottles. We have seen a continuation of strong domestic consumption trends in January. 
As mobility improved post lockdowns, the rebound in demand for toddler cases has been nothing short of remarkable. What's even more craft fine is that we solidified our leading position in this important category in 2020, getting over 250 basis points of share. We're thrilled by the strong performance of our Graco brand, which picked up 130 basis points of share in 2020 in a year past this innovation. More exciting launches are planned for 2021, including Graco slimfit 3-in-1 car seat, our slimmer's designed that fits 3 car seats across savings space in the backseat without compromising on safety in the future feature's parent need. 
Now as anticipated, 2020 was a tough year for our Writing business as a category in [ trouble ], particularly in the commercial channel. Core sales pressure continued into the fourth quarter, albeit at lower levels relative to the part of [indiscernible] demand in the U.S. normalized a bit. During the fourth quarter, we did see continued consumption growth in the U.S., which started in September as the back-to-school season was extended. For the full year, there were also a few bright spots, including pens, living and fine art businesses, all of which grew POS despite the disruption. 
Although category headwinds were significant, both in the U.S. and internationally, we've made progress on the market share front. In our core Writing category, which position us to come out with pandemic on a stronger footing. 2020 was the year of the pen for the Writing business, with innovation delivering outstanding market share gains of about 750 basis points in gel pens and 260 basis points across the total pen category. We're optimistic about our momentum in the pen's category and have launched expansion to our Sharpie S-Gel platform with Sharpie S-Gel fashion designs and color expansion and Sharpie S-Gel metal bottle. We'll be launching this platform around the go. 
We also received -- achieved strong share performance in our business as [ Diamond ] reached record share, both in the U.S. and EMEA. While category challenges persist, consumption has remained positive thus far in 2021. We exited 2020 with the lowest retailer inventory position across the office superstores since several years. This should better position us in the retailers for a rebound, post-pandemic, as schools and offices return to more normal cadence. While there's a great degree of uncertainty around the timing of return to a sense of normalcy in schools and offices, we're assuming a more normal back-to-school season in 2021, but the offices may remain in a hybrid environment for the balance of the year impacting our commercial channel. 
Lastly, core sales and consumption in our Outdoor & Recreation business, while under pressure during 2020, [ break ] down by the softness in our technical apparel and beverages businesses as a result of further reduced on-the-go activities. 
We delivered fair performance in the Outdoor business in the back half of the year, particularly in the outdoor equipment category, such as scooters, stands and stirs. We also saw a number of favorable developments in the market share front in several core categories such as coolers and cans, where we gained about 90 and 190 basis points of share, respectively. 
I'm especially excited to share that Coleman, which is one of Newell's largest brands, returned to growth during 2020. What a way to celebrate the brand's 120th anniversary. Coleman had a number of successful launches in 2020, including the Coleman, [ Skyler ] and the refreshed many coolers. We are following up in the 2021 season with additional consumer-centric and purposeful innovations. 
To highlight just a few. We're expanding the assortment on the 2020 Coleman's Skydome 10 to larger dome 10 formats in a variety of styles and colors. We're also introducing a Coleman reunion collection of coolers, which will include new mat powered and 3 beautiful grand focused colors that elevate and rejuvenate the Coleman's still benefit cooler. Although I'm certainly encouraged by the progress we have made in outdoor equipment business, we have more work to do on technical apparel, which is especially led by [indiscernible] and brand and beverage with Contigo. We have brought in capable leaders to do just that and expect a stronger 2021. 
Newell is now 2 years into the turnaround with notable progress across the organization. As we look into -- look out to 2021 and beyond, we intend to build on the improving momentum. We will continue to position new brands for sustainable and profitable growth with our strategic priorities focused on the following 5 areas. First, galvanized our employees behind our process to create consumer-obsessed customer-focused organization that's digitally savvy and willing to experiment and learn while adhering to uphold values. Second, sustained top line growth by focusing on the end-to-end consumer journey, strengthening omnichannel capabilities while accelerating online penetration and focusing on scaling and modernizing our comp brands. We also want to strengthen efforts to improve supply availability to improve customer service levels with a strong focus on forecast accuracy. Third, become an innovation engine by sharpening our focus on consumer insights and trends implementing an enterprise-wide innovation, operating model, building cross-business unit platforms and better leveraging our R&D resources. Fourth, accelerate international growth and improve profitability by addressing fragmentation, high overheads, prioritizing dry countries, evolving autonomous geographic units to 1 Newell approach to build scale and move to a distributor model in nonpriority countries. And fifth, continue to make progress on the financial agenda, expanding margins through productivity type management of overhead cost and complexity reduction as well as strengthening Newell's New brands cash conversion cycle and balance sheet. 
Although 2020 was undeniably one of the most trying and volatile periods in recent history, I'm extremely [ clarified ], poised and resilient persistence, ability to adapt, pivot and execute with speed in the journey. This has enabled us to gain significant traction on our turnaround strategy and strengthen the underlying fundamentals, positioning the company to come out even stronger post the pandemic. I am excited about Newell's prospects and feel our better days are ahead of us. Onwards and upwards. 
And now I turn the call over to $1 billion-man, Chris Peterson."

In fact, our 2020 results e",2123,"Thanks, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. The team delivered an outstanding finish to the year with Q4 results ahead of our expectations across every key metric, including top line operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow. In fact, our 2020 results exceeded or were in line with the initial guidance we laid out a year ago despite the significant disruption from the pandemic. We are now 2 years into the turnaround and have come a long way in strengthening the financial performance and operational effectiveness of the company. Last year, we drove excellent progress on each area of the turnaround plan and gained significant momentum in the second half of 2020. 
Before getting into the financial results and outlook, I want to spend a few minutes on operational highlights. We made significant progress simplifying the organization. For example, on SKU count, we exceeded our target a year early and exited 2020 with 47,000 SKUs as compared to our goal of 50,000 by the end of '21. We have eliminated 54% of our SKUs over the past 2 years with a 37% reduction in 2020 alone. Effectively, we have doubled our revenue per SKU over the past 2 years. We've also meaningfully strengthened the quality of our inventory, cutting our excess and hostile inventory by more than half since 2018. We are not stopping here, and we'll continue to simplify the SKU portfolio across each of our businesses. 
Over the past 2 years, we've also significantly simplified our IT architecture as we rationalize nearly 90% of IT applications, ending 2020 with less than 800 apps; successfully implemented 8 ERP migrations, including the October 1 move of Coleman North America to SAP, which went smoothly. We expect to get 95% of our business on 2 ERP systems over the next 2 years. 
We also fully redesigned our digital technology platform, rationalizing the number of sites in North America from about 290 to 40. We have already migrated 35 of these 40 sites to the new platform, with another 3 conversions expected to be completed by the end of February. This is a remarkable achievement within an 18-month period, The new platform delivers a much higher quality, more engaging and impactful consumer experience and allows us to introduce exciting omnichannel features along the way. We expect to complete the conversion of the remaining U.S. sites by the summer and later this year, plan to extend this initiative to our international markets. 
As I mentioned on our prior call, during 2020, we also implemented a new technology to consolidate and better control the company's indirect overhead spending, which we expect to drive significant savings going forward. These are just a few examples of where we are eliminating complexity from the organization, but the efforts go well beyond the ones I mentioned, impacting areas, including the supply chain, legal entity structure, cost centers, profit centers, financial systems and real estate amongst others. We are driving overhead efficiencies through complexity reduction along with benefits from restructuring savings, which we started to realize in the back half of the year. We lowered our overhead as a percent of sales by another 100 basis points in 2020.
 Importantly, as we look forward, we see ample opportunity to continue to simplify our operations and optimize our supply chain. Beyond efficiency, simplification allows us to become a more preferred partner with our retail customers. As we continue to optimize normal cost structure, we are increasingly leaning into our productivity initiative called FUEL, a significant enabler of our margin ambition. 
In 2020, we drove a stellar outcome on fuel, reducing our cost-of-goods sold base by about 4% year-over-year as gross savings increased about 35%. This was not only the best annual result Newell Brands has delivered since we started tracking this measure, but also amongst best-in-class in the industry. We are systematizing these productivity efforts across the organization and have a strong pipeline of projects for 2021 and the coming years, which should help drive gross margin improvement going forward. 
Now let's turn to quarterly results. During the fourth quarter, Newell's net sales increased 2.5% year-over-year to $2.7 billion as core sales growth of 4.9% was partially offset by headwinds from foreign exchange as well as business and retail store exits. For the second consecutive quarter, we saw broad-based top line momentum, with core sales growth across all 4 geographic regions and 6 business units. Normalized operating margin improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 11.4%, which was ahead of our expectations. Overhead cost reduction and productivity savings helped to offset higher advertising and marketing expenses as well as pressure from business unit mix, COVID-related cost and inflation. We reduced our net interest expense by $1 million year-over-year to $69 million due to debt repayment during the year. We recorded a normalized tax benefit of $6 million as compared to a normalized tax expense of $51 million in the year-ago period, reflecting discrete tax benefits in the current quarter. 
We grew Q4 normalized diluted earnings per share 33% year-over-year to $0.56 a share. Stronger-than-anticipated top line results in combination with disciplined expense management and strong productivity enabled us to outperform versus our expectations. 
Moving on to our segments. Core sales for Appliance & Cookware increased 4.2% driven by international markets. Consumption trends continued to reflect increased frequency at at-home cooking. I would like to point out that effective January 1, 2021, the CEO of the Food business has taken over the responsibilities for the Calphalon Cookware business. As a result of this change, the Appliance & Cookware segment will be renamed Home Appliances in 2021. 
Core sales growth for the Commercial Solutions segment accelerated sequentially to 13.8%, with increases across both the Commercial and the Connected Home & Security businesses. Consumption trends also improved sequentially across both businesses. Within Commercial, we saw strong demand for many consumer-facing businesses as well as in washroom and hand protection. 
Core sales for the Home Solutions segment increased 12.4%, propelled by growth across both Food and Home Fragrance business units. Food was once again the strongest performer within the portfolio, continuing on its double-digit growth stream as consumption remains strong In a seasonally important quarter, core sales increased in the Home Fragrance business, reflecting strength in e-commerce, EMEA and the wholesale channel. As anticipated, core sales in the Outdoor & Rec segment were under pressure, declining 7.4%. Fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by the timing shift of sales in Coleman North America into Q3, ahead of the October 1 conversion to SAP. 
Looking past the timing shift and focusing on the second half of 2020, core sales per outgoing rent grew year-over-year as improved consumption in outdoor equipment categories offset softness in beverage and technical apparel. 
Core sales for the Learning & Development segment contracted 2.2%, which was a meaningful improvement from the prior 3 quarters. While core sales for Writing were challenged due to the impact of COVID-19 on school and office closures, we were encouraged to see continuation of positive consumption trends in the U.S. 
Top line momentum for Baby accelerated in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong consumer demand. 
Our efforts to tighten working capital delivered outstanding results, making cash flow 1 of the major highlights in 2020. We generated over $1.4 billion of operating cash flow during the year, which represents $388 million improvement from 2019. Last year at CAGNY, we set an ambitious target of delivering free cash flow productivity in excess of 100%, and this was our second consecutive year of meeting that goal. In fact, in 2020, Newell's free cash flow productivity was 154%, a remarkable achievement by all accounts. We shortened the cash conversion cycle by about 26 days to 72 days, which is very close to our benchmark target of 70 days. Accounts payable is the most significant driver of the improvement in the cash conversion cycle as we saw a flow-through of more favorable payment terms that we have renegotiated with our suppliers. We also ramped up our supply chain to build inventory in order to support demand, creating a timing benefit in payables that we expect to partially reverse in 2021. 
We are in a much stronger balance sheet position today than we have been in a very long time. We ended the year with a net debt-to-normalized EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.5x versus 4.0x at the end of 2019, and we are closing in on our target of 3.0x. 
During the fourth quarter, we completed a $300 million debt tender. And for the year, we reduced our net debt by $748 million to $4.6 billion. We exited 2020 in a very strong short-term liquidity position, which exceeded $2.5 billion, including nearly $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. 
Turning to 2021. I want to start by providing some context for our plan. We are encouraged by the momentum we have seen in our business in the second half of 2020. The first quarter of 2021 is off to a very strong start from both a consumption and shipment perspective. At the same time, we are balancing this optimism against the macro environment, which remains quite dynamic as a result of the ongoing pandemic. We are taking a prudent planning approach to 2021, capitalizing on growth opportunities while continuing to drive cost and cash discipline. While we expect many of the recent consumer habits to persist, we are assuming a normalization of category trends over the course of the year. Since the comparisons are much tougher in the back half of 2021, we expect a stronger first half relative to the second half. Additionally, we are seeing inflation trends pick up, primarily due to resins, transportation costs, wage rates and source finished good pricing. We plan to grow gross margins despite this cost pressure with both pricing and productivity actions. 
Specifically, in 2021, we expect to deliver on our evergreen financial targets for core sales growth, operating margin expansion and free cash flow productivity. For the full year of 2021, we are guiding for net sales of $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion, with core sales growing at a low single-digit rate and favorable foreign exchange more than offsetting the headwind from continued rationalization of the Yankee Candle retail store footprint and other minor business exits. 
We are planning for normalized operating margin improvement of 30 to 60 basis points year-over-year to 11.4% to 11.7%. We expect productivity and overhead savings will more than offset the impact of inflation as well as incremental investment behind higher advertising and marketing spend. 
We are assuming normalized effective tax rate in the high teens, significantly above the 2020 level, due to a lower benefit from discrete tax items. This outlook does not contemplate any potential changes in the U.S. corporate tax rate under the new administration. We expect this to net out a normalized earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.65 with a modest uptick in the number of shares relative to 2020 levels. The year-over-year step-up in the tax rate represents a more than $0.30 headwind to earnings per share in 2021. On a tax rate equivalent basis, we are projecting strong growth in earnings per share in 2021. 
For 2021, we expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion. Our outlook implies that we will continue to make progress on reducing our cash conversion cycle despite a lower year-over-year benefit from working capital. 
For Q1, we are guiding for net sales of $2.04 billion to $2.08 billion or 8% to 10% year-over-year growth, with core sales increasing in the high single-digit range versus Q1 2020. Favorable currency is expected to more than offset the impact from Yankee Candle store closures and minor business exits. Our first quarter guidance assumes normalized operating margin [ improve ] 90 to 130 basis points year-over-year to 6.9% to 7.3%, reflecting benefits from productivity efforts and overhead savings that are partially masked by higher advertising and marketing investments as well as heightened commodity and transportation costs. 
We are projecting a normalized effective tax rate in the mid-20s for the first quarter, reflecting a discrete tax headwind in the quarter. We expect normalized earnings per share in the $0.12 to $0.14 range, which represents strong double-digit growth as compared to $0.09 in the year-ago period. 
Over the past 2 years, we have made tremendous progress on our turnaround. We are coming out of 2020 in a much stronger position than we were coming in despite the ongoing disruption from the pandemic. We continue to see significant opportunity for value creation and will remain vigilant in executing on our goal of driving consistent and sustainable core sales growth, operating margin expansion and improved cash conversion cycle.

I mean I know it won't have as much impact on first quarter, but certainly on the back half. So just trying to understand what that does. And then third, I can't remember or I don't remember exactly what it was in terms of -- last year, you had a fair amount of plant closure around COVID that created shortages and out of stocks. Any idea of kind of what you can make back as we look at the first, second quarter of this year. Sorry, that's a lot."

As I said in the prepared remarks where we've gotten to our goal a year early. 
One of the things that we've done is we've put in place a systemic process that we call a Magic Quadrant analysis that looks at revenue per SKU and gross margin per SKU. And as we've gotten into that and systematized the process, we think we've got opportunity to go further on SKU count reduction going forward. We don't believe that this is going to be a revenue headwind. We actually think that this is going to be a revenue health for the company and a cost help because it allows us to improve our customer service levels. We're in the process of setting new targets, and we'll share more probably at CAGNY next week with regard to the out-front targets, but very encouraged by the results so far, and we see it as an enabler for both revenue growth and continued productivity. 
On Yankee stores, we ended 2020 by closing, I think, 77 stores in 2020. Our store count was 398 stores. I think our plan for '21 is to close somewhere about another 80 to 100. Most of those will happen, and in fact, most of those happened in January. So it's very part-of-the-year loaded. That does not have a significant impact on the company's revenue because we're growing very fast in that business on the e-commerce side, with the wholesale business and in the international markets. And so we believe that we're going to see a profitability benefit as we make that transition from retail to more online and wholesale in that business. 
And then on the plant closures, you're right, in the second quarter last year, of our about 135 manufacturing facilities and distribution centers, we had 20 that were closed via government mandate. As we sit here today, all of our facilities are open, largely operating at full capacity, and we have largely caught off across the majority of our product categories. That being said, we do have some product categories where we're still supply constrained. And those tend to be the product categories where we've seen outsized consumer demand increases But we are working hard to catch up and add capacity in those situations."

Bill, let me tackle that. But the first piece of good news in terms of the resilience of the portfolio when you look at 2020 with all the headwinds we had on Writing that we were able to do as well in the second half and actually contain the decline for the full year to a negative one is testimony to how we're beginning to get resilience with other brands. So homecoming may look from a long term. Writing is a very well-managed business for us. It's just the macro has been what it has been. When we look at but I think what we're assuming is that schools will go back to reopening [indiscernible] in the second half of the year. And we've taken that into consideration. We're preparing for it. We think it will be a more normal back-to-school season. And I think some of the universities as well. 
The big unknown at this stage is the commercial business. Because when you look at offices, the prediction I had thought that most of the offices would get back in by July, but everything we're reading and hearing is that until you get hurt in early, I think companies are low to sort of take that step. We have learned from Silicon Valley companies that they may actually remain closed not only into the fall, but the entire year. 
So that does get affected in terms of our commercial business, which is other part of the business. So we'll have to see on that. Overall, do we expect the Writing business to grow in 2021 versus 2020? Absolutely. How much? I think second half will be the question mark. 
And look, the other thing I should say, which I've said in my prepared remarks, the share gains we've had in Writing are truly spectacular Sharpie's brand strength that it can go beyond markers and how it is doing in the pen side and all the innovations we are coming up. 
And lastly, we're really comparing for a different future with this business. We're now -- our team is very focused on innovations, which is there's more stay-at-home stuff that we have prepared to do that in the longer term. So it's still very -- feel good about this business and -- but the other businesses are picking up as well."

So if we think about the margin guidance, the operating margin guidance in particular, gross margin impact for next year, for 2021, basically, there are 2 primary headwinds. The first is inflation, which, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks,",343,"Yes, sure. So if we think about the margin guidance, the operating margin guidance in particular, gross margin impact for next year, for 2021, basically, there are 2 primary headwinds. The first is inflation, which, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is due to resin wage rates; the sourced finished goods, primarily due to the strengthening of the Chinese currency and transportation costs. We expect that inflation pressure based on what we're seeing today to be almost a 200 basis point headwind for the company for next year, which is a significant ramp up from prior years. We also are planning to increase our advertising and marketing cost as a percent of sales in 2021, given that our innovation pipeline has strengthened in 2021 as we've brought new leadership on and they've begun to develop stronger innovation plans. So those are the 2 headwinds. 
We're guiding to operating margin growth because we have benefits that more than offset that. And the benefits that we're seeing are -- the biggest 1 is productivity with the fuel savings program. And so we're using that productivity drive to basically offset -- largely offset the inflation pressure. 
We also have -- we are going to take selective pricing. We're not taking pricing to fully offset inflation, but we are taking selective pricing in those categories that have seen the biggest inflationary pressure. We also expect business unit mix benefit. As Ravi mentioned, we are expecting the Writing business to come back and be a meaningful growth driver for the company in 2021. Actually, we're expecting the Writing business to grow starting in the first quarter from what we've seen. 
And then the last thing I would mention is continued focus on overhead cost reduction through our simplification initiatives. So those are sort of a walk through the puts and takes. I think when you net it all together, we're expecting to drive gross margin improvement in 2021 despite the inflation environment because of the productivity efforts the pricing and the mix from the business unit forecast."

So I don't think that's a concern, and we'll continue to grow there. 
Second, in terms of channels, as I mentioned, where the big thrust for us is the grocery business, the dollar stores, the drug stores. And we're making already good progress, especially our Food business really had a good year on the grocery side. We're putting together now a very focused sales team on this channel. We think that there's a lot of opportunity One, we continue to do well with our strong mass merchants or our biggest customers, so continued focus on that."

But frankly, it's pretty unique and rather substantial within the consumer space. So the long-term guidance calls for 50 basis points of improvement each year. You guide this year is 30 to 60 basis points. The question is, what's the organization's ability to lean in and accelerate the pace of that margin enhancement and unlocking that value for shareholders while balancing versus the investment needs and cost inflation that you'll encounter in any given year?

So let me start on the margin question, Kevin. So if you look at the underlying trends of what we're driving this year, the organization is driving sustainable margin improvement progress on both gross margin through the fuel program and on overhead reduction through the complexity reduction that dramatically exceeds our guidance of 30 to 60 basis points in operating margin improvement. The reason why we're guiding to 30 to 60 basis points is because we have an inflationary environment, which I mentioned is about a 200 basis point headwind. And we're planning to increase advertising and marketing costs as a percent of sales significantly in 2021. And so if those 2 things were not there, you would see our ability to fundamentally be driving operating margin improvement be higher than the net guidance. 
I think the evergreen model that we've put out of 50 basis points improvement each year, our guidance is very much in line with this year. So we're excited that our guidance this year has us fully on all metrics in line with the -- with our evergreen model. And we think that the company has really turned the corner in regard to delivering against that evergreen model. 
So in any given year, we'll guide as appropriate when we get there. But I feel very good about the underlying capabilities of the company to continue to drive margin improvement, primarily in the gross margin and overhead area."

So if you take the U.K., we have many businesses that are in different offices, there's not the synergies. So we've got to get focused. So what we're doing is focusing on sort of top 10 countries and saying how do you get after them and how do we create longer-term a country management system, more of a one-year approach. rather than everyone doing their own thing. 
Having said that, the teams have been still doing pretty well. And when you look at the fact that overall, international actually grew pretty well and slightly better than the U.S. in 2020. And when you think about appliances where Latin America is the strongest, it was double-digit growth -- strong double-digit growth in Latin America. So it's all positive.

So earlier in the pandemic, as I mentioned, in the second quarter of last year, it was about our manufacturing facilities and our distribution facilities. Now the disruption is more related to that port. We are getting products through there. We're also shipping through other ports on the East Coast and other places in the West Coast. The prices for containers have gone up dramatically. We are a large-scale importer from a volume standpoint. That gives us some advantage in the marketplace because we have contractual commitments for volume and pricing that I think advantages us versus many of our smaller competitors. So we don't see it as a major headwind for the quarter or for the year, but it is something we're sort of battling every day as we go along here."

The gross margins outside of the U.S. are actually quite good. So what the charge -- Chris often say, we've got to get that gross margin up over the next several years.

And I think when you look at that and you look at the -- like if you were to look at our 2-year stack growth rates, returned positive on a 2-year stack basis in Q3. We were positive on Q4, we're guiding positive on Q1, and we're guiding positive for all of 2021. 
If you look specifically at the categories, I think the category -- the category that has been most negatively impacted, as we've talked, has been Writing because of the schools and office closures But as Ravi mentioned in the prepared remarks and as we alluded to on the Q&A, we are exiting 2020 in a very good position from a retail inventory perspective, and we expect the Writing business to be back to growth in 2021 starting in the first quarter. So I don't think we're seeing categories that we're expecting to have declines heading into 2021."

I sincerely hope that you and your loved ones are staying healthy and safe. While there's no doubt that 2020 was a very challenging year, I am immensely proud of the results our team delivered as we quickly adapted to the evolving environment. At the same time, we remain focused on ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees carefully operating our plants and distribution facilities while [indiscernible] our capacity and maintaining financial viability and business community. 
We closed this to start the year on an exceptional manner with fourth quarter and full year results ahead of our expectations across the board. This is a testament to the incredible resilience, fortitude and commitment of our employees who execute with excellence. In fact, in first quarter, we pivoted to accelerate the turnaround plan and drove significantly stronger underlying performance in the business in the second half of the year across all key value drivers, top line margins, earnings per share and cash growth. 
We also achieved meaningful progress against our strategic priorities in 2020. First, we strengthened and diversified our team as we broadly [ worked with ] our leaders from the outside into our clients, commercial food and outdoor and recreation businesses as well as the driver functions. They hit the ground running. 
As COVID certainly hit off, did not allow for any down time. They complement our strong existing leaders across the remaining 4 businesses. 
The leadership team and I are focused on building a winning one new culture focused on trust, transparency and teamwork. A diversity inclusion belonging efforts are our top priority as we continue to 
gather our employees and unify everyone behind the common purpose of delighting consumers with our innovative brands that create moment of guide, build confidence and provide peace of mind. 
Second, throughout the year, we improved customer relationships through enhanced collaboration, joint business planning efforts as well as increased emphasis on delivering excellent service for our customers. We are leveraging our omnichannel capabilities to advance joint business planning and believe there's an area of strength for you. We're also seizing opportunities to close our distribution gaps, particularly in the food, drug and other channels. We're already making progress on that front across a number of businesses, such as Food, driving and Home Fragrance. 
Third, we drove a 30 basis point improvement in normalized operating margin in [ 2020 ] and incredible fee, given the cost and business mix headwinds, we had to overcome during the year. This was made possible by establishing a culture of productivity as well as aggressively attacking overhead costs and organizational complexity. 
In fact, normalized operating margin expanded 120 basis points year-over-year in the second half, reversing the losses in the second quarter that were mostly driven by fixed cost deleveraging. And for the full year, EPS of $1.79, wow, up nearly 12% from continuing operations for tight working capital management resulted in stellar operating cash flow of more than $1.4 billion. Yes, folks, $1.4 billion. Our business unit CFOs, led by our own $1 billion-man, Chris Peterson, did a phenomenal job. 
Lastly, one of the key objectives of turnaround has been to return the company to sustainable core sales growth. While core sales for the year declined 1.1%, I'm delighted to say that in the second half of 2020, we turned the corner. Core sales grew 6% and increase across 7 out of 8 business units with every geographic region growing. 
During 2020, we experienced healthy domestic consumption that's broad-based. The strength and resilience of our portfolio showed through as growth in Food, Commercial and Appliances, Cookware business units offset Writing softness. The team successfully navigated demand surges, product and container availability issues and tempering factor and distribution center closures. 
Highly focused on relevant generation, grounded in consumer insights as well as omnichannel execution are making a difference. During 2020, we grew, improved domestic market share across a number of businesses. including baby gear, food storage, vacuum scene, fresh preserving, tents, quarters and tents, to name a few. Many of our top brands delivered incredible results in 2020, as Rubbermaid, FoodSaver, Oster, Mapa, Spontex, [indiscernible], Breville and [indiscernible], all grew at a double-digit rate. 
Omnichannel is the way forward and a critical priority for us. Our e-commerce business has continued to be a substantial growth engine for the company. In 2020, e-commerce revenue growth accelerated to the high 30s, and penetration online improved to about 22% of net sales on a local basis, close to double the rate versus 2 years ago. While Baby remains, by far, the most highly penetrated business across the digital platforms, we'll see meaningful shift towards online consumption across the portfolio. 
In fact, in 2020, 4 business units commanded digital penetration as a percent of net sales of more than 20%, including Baby, Home Fragrance, Outdoor & Recreation and Appliances and Cookware, and Food is chasing that number. 
All of our leaders took quick and decisive actions to swiftly adapt to the COVID-19 environment and emerging trends. These trends include preparing more food at home as regular people turn into home chefs, heightened interest in outdoor hobbies and personal wellbeing and increased investment in sanitation. We anticipate that trends will continue to evolve throughout 2021. 
We also believe that many of the habits that have been formed during the pandemic are here to stay with our portfolio well-positioned to capitalize on them. 
Let me briefly touch upon how each of our businesses performed in 2020 as I'm truly thrilled with the progress we have made. Let's start with Appliances & Cookware, where we delivered mid-single-digit core sales growth, driven by the strength in the international markets. 
In the U.S., consumption increased during the fourth quarter and for the full year as more people have been cooking, baking and spending time at home. In Latin America, despite COVID-related challenges, the team delivered outstanding results as they quickly pivoted towards the digital platform. 
Although I'm extremely proud of these results, I also realized that a lot more work needs to be done to reposition the Appliance business for sustainable growth. During 2020, the Appliances category accelerated significantly. And in some instances, we did not keep up, especially in the U.S. This resulted in share losses, albeit lower in magnitude than in prior years. Although we are seeing good traction with recent innovations such as Mr. Coffee iced coffee maker, Oster Texture Select Blenders and Oster Diamond for heating cooking parties, we need to extend the learnings and leverage consumer insights across the entire brand portfolio. 
Back where it began in 2020 and is continuing in earnest throughout 2021, as we implement the necessary strategic changes to successfully position appliances. We have a strong international Appliance franchise with strong brand equity for Oster, Crockpot and Sunbeam in LatAm and Australia and New Zealand, followed by Breville in Europe. 
Our challenge is to address [ payer ] category businesses in the U.S. with low gross margins that drag down the portfolio. Chris Robins, our CEO for that business, will undertake actions in 2021 to prune the portfolio. 
Within the Commercial Solutions segment, our commercial business had a phenomenal 2020 as core sales growth during each quarter culminated in high single-digit growth for the year. We saw particularly strong sales growth in washroom, glove and scouring product as well as outdoor and garage organization businesses we've benefited from heightened consumer engagement across the home improvement categories. 
In response to strong demand for sanitization as well as our strategic investments to expand production capacity, we placed about 3.3 million soap and dispenser, sanitizer dispensers globally and sold enough soap and sanitizers to clean over 30 billion pairs of hands. That's a lot of hands. We're not stopping there. 
We're introducing innovative stands and brackets that enable facility operators to put hand sanitizers virtually anywhere in the building, including on the wall, on a table top or any general open space. The breadth of the commercial business portfolio, which includes both consumer and commercial offerings as well as the diverse coverage of verticals and enhanced partnership with retail partners, position the business for long-term success. 
Let's move to Connected Home & Security business. While core sales were down in 2020 due to supply constraints caused by pandemic-related plant shutdowns, the business performed well in the back half of the year, with top line accelerating in the fourth quarter. 
Within the Home Solutions segment, our Food business has certainly lived up to its rocket-ship status that have grown very founder. It actually returned to growth prior to the pandemic and built momentum to mid-20% core sales growth in 2020, propelled by strong consumption throughout the year as well as market share gains. In the U.S., our leading brands, Rubbermaid, FoodSaver and Ball, took share across food storage, food preservation and canning verticals, benefiting from improved commercialization of product, stronger consumer social engagement and programming as well as recent innovations, such as the latest vacuum sealing device, FoodSaver and VS3000 multiuse preservation system and Rubbermaid Brilliance Glass. 
The launch of Brilliance Glass is off to a rolling start. And the overall sub-brand of Rubbermaid Brilliance sales have almost doubled in 2020. 2020 was a stellar year for FoodSaver, which is the fastest-growing brand across all of Newell brands, and it broke through as a top 10 brand for us. Strong appliance sales in 2020 should translate into increased consumer purchases in 2021. 
In Food, we continue to chase prolonged demand for January, and we are working hard to address supply constraints in certain product lines. 
At [indiscernible] to Home Fragrance, we experienced strong consumption growth at our Home Fragrance business during 2020, driven by surge in demand in the back half of the year. As a result, core sales increased in both North America and EMEA in the second half of the year and in the seasonally critical fourth quarter period. 
Full year top line sales performance was partially hindered by the temporary closure of Yankee Candle retail stores and other specialty chains for several months early in the year and the supply chain disruption experienced in the second quarter. 
I'm extremely proud of the team's resilience and creativity in addressing supply shortages as they work around the clock and even engaged the corporate teams in the manufacturing and packing operations. They went all out on production in an attempt to keep up with consumer demand, which remained robust in January. 
The scented category -- candle category [ so far ] in 2020, no pun intended, as demand for products that help bring tranquility to consumer homes remained robust. We held share despite supply constraints. As we look out to 2021, there are a number of exciting innovations in the hopper, including the Yankee Candle Signature Collection, the largest update to the Yankee line in years, and it's launching this month. It will provide our best burning experience to date. 
We continue to reposition the Home Fragrance business for the long time. During 2020, we exited the fundraising business and 77 retail stores with additional store closures anticipated in 2021. At the same time, we are building great momentum on our direct-to-consumer business, which grew strong double digits in 2020, offsetting sharp falls in retail, expanding distribution into the grocery and truck channels and diversifying the product portfolio into auto diffusers, et cetera. 
In the Learning & Development segment, cross-sell for our Baby business grew modestly during 2020. The rebound from Q3 persisted into Q4, driven by healthy consumption recovering from the depressed levels in March and April, where lockdowns were in full effect. For the year, domestic demand improved across baby gear and in print care businesses, particularly [indiscernible] car seats, high chair, swings and bottles. We have seen a continuation of strong domestic consumption trends in January. 
As mobility improved post lockdowns, the rebound in demand for toddler cases has been nothing short of remarkable. What's even more craft fine is that we solidified our leading position in this important category in 2020, getting over 250 basis points of share. We're thrilled by the strong performance of our Graco brand, which picked up 130 basis points of share in 2020 in a year past this innovation. More exciting launches are planned for 2021, including Graco slim fit 3-in-1 car seat, our slimmest designed that fits 3 car seats across savings space in the backseat. Without compromising on safety in the future -- feature's need. 
Now as anticipated, 2020 was a tough year for our Writing business as a category in total, particularly in the commercial channel. Core sales pressure continued into the fourth quarter, albeit at lower levels relative to the part of [indiscernible] as demand in the U.S. normalized a bit. 
During the fourth quarter, we did see continued consumption growth in the U.S., which started in September as the back-to-school season was extended. For the full year, there were also a few bright spots, including pens, living and fine art businesses, all of which grew POS despite the disruption. 
Although category headwinds were significant, both in the U.S. and internationally, we've made progress on the market share front. In our core Writing category, which position us to come out with pandemic on a stronger footing. 
2020 was the year of the pen for the Writing business, with innovation delivering outstanding market share gains of about 750 basis points in gel pens and 260 basis points across the total pen category. We're optimistic about our momentum in the pens category and have launched expansion to our Sharpie S-Gel platform with Sharpie S-Gel fashion designs and color expansion and Sharpie S-Gel Metal Barrel. We'll be launching this platform around the globe. 
We also received -- achieved strong share performance in our [indiscernible] business as [ Dynamo ] reached record share, both in the U.S. and EMEA. While category challenges persist, consumption has remained positive thus far in 2021. We exited 2020 with the lowest retailer inventory position across the office superstores in several years. 
This should better position us in the retailers for a rebound, post-pandemic, as schools and offices return to more normal cadence. 
While there's a great degree of uncertainty around the timing of return to a sense of normalcy in schools and offices, we're assuming a more normal back-to-school season in 2021, but the offices may remain in a hybrid environment for the balance of the year impacting our commercial channel. 
Lastly, core sales and consumption in our Outdoor & Recreation business, while under pressure during 2020, [ break ] down by the softness in our technical apparel and beverages businesses as a result of further reduced on-the-go activities. 
We delivered fair performance in the Outdoor business in the back half of the year, particularly in the Outdoor Equipment category, such as scooters, tents and [indiscernible]. We also saw a number of favorable developments in the market share front in several core categories such as coolers and tents, where we gained about 90 and 190 basis points of share, respectively. 
I'm especially excited to share that Coleman, which is one of Newell's largest brands, returned to growth during 2020. What a way to celebrate the brand's 120th anniversary. Coleman had a number of successful launches in 2020, including The Coleman, Skydome, and with [ freshed many coolers ]. We are following up in the 2021 season with additional consumer-centric and purposeful innovations. 
To highlight just a few. We're expanding the assortment on the 2020 Coleman's Skydome Tent to larger dome tent in a variety of styles and colors. We're also introducing a Coleman reunion collection of coolers, which will include new mat-powered [indiscernible] and 3 beautiful trend-focused colors that elevate and rejuvenate the Coleman's [ still benefit cooler ]. 
Although I'm certainly encouraged by the progress we have made in outdoor equipment business, we have more work to do on technical apparel, which is especially led by Marmot brand and beverage with Contigo. We have brought in capable leaders to do just that and expect a stronger 2021. 
Newell is now 2 years into the turnaround with notable progress across the organization. As we look into -- look out to 2021 and beyond, we intend to build on the improving momentum. We will continue to position new brands for sustainable and profitable growth with our strategic priorities focused on the following 5 areas. 
First, galvanize our employees behind our process to create consumer-obsessed customer-focused organization that's digitally savvy and willing to experiment and learn while adhering to uphold values. Second, sustained top line growth by focusing on the end-to-end consumer journey, strengthening omnichannel capabilities while accelerating online penetration and focusing on scaling and modernizing our top brands. 
We also want to strengthen efforts to improve supply availability to improve customer service levels with a strong focus on forecast accuracy. Third, become an innovation engine by sharpening our focus on consumer insights and trends implementing an enterprise-wide innovation, operating model, building cross-business unit platforms and better leveraging our R&D resources. 
Fourth, accelerate international growth and improve profitability by addressing fragmentation, high overheads, prioritizing dry countries, evolving autonomous geographic units to One Newell approach to build scale and move to a distributor model in nonpriority countries. And fifth, continue to make progress on the financial agenda, expanding margins through productivity type management of overhead cost and complexity reduction as well as strengthening Newell brand's cash conversion cycle and balance sheet. 
Although 2020 was undeniably one of the most trying and volatile periods in recent history, I'm extremely [ clarified ], poised and resilient persistence, ability to adapt, pivot and execute with speed in the journey. This has enabled us to gain significant traction on our turnaround strategy and strengthen the underlying fundamentals, positioning the company to come out even stronger post the pandemic. I am excited about Newell's prospects and feel our better days are ahead of us. Onwards and upwards. 
And now I turn the call over to $1 billion-man, Chris Peterson."

The team delivered an outstanding finish to the year with Q4 results ahead of our expectations across every key metric, including top line operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow. In fact, our 2020 results exceeded or were in line with the initial guidance we laid out a year ago despite the significant disruption from the pandemic. 
We are now 2 years into the turnaround and have come a long way in strengthening the financial performance and operational effectiveness of the company. Last year, we drove excellent progress on each area of the turnaround plan and gained significant momentum in the second half of 2020. 
Before getting into the financial results and outlook, I want to spend a few minutes on operational highlights. We made significant progress simplifying the organization. For example, on SKU count, we exceeded our target a year early and exited 2020 with 47,000 SKUs as compared to our goal of 50,000 by the end of '21. We have eliminated 54% of our SKUs over the past 2 years with a 37% reduction in 2020 alone. Effectively, we have doubled our revenue per SKU over the past 2 years. We've also meaningfully strengthened the quality of our inventory, cutting our excess and hostile inventory by more than half since 2018. We are not stopping here, and we'll continue to simplify the SKU portfolio across each of our businesses. 
Over the past 2 years, we've also significantly simplified our IT architecture as we rationalize nearly 90% of IT applications, ending 2020 with less than 800 apps; successfully implemented 8 ERP migrations, including the October 1 move of Coleman North America to SAP, which went smoothly. We expect to get 95% of our business on 2 ERP systems over the next 2 years. 
We also fully redesigned our digital technology platform, rationalizing the number of sites in North America from about 290 to 40. We have already migrated 35 of these 40 sites to the new platform, with another 3 conversions expected to be completed by the end of February. This is a remarkable achievement within an 18-month period. 
The new platform delivers a much higher quality, more engaging and impactful consumer experience and allows us to introduce exciting omnichannel features along the way. We expect to complete the conversion of the remaining U.S. sites by the summer and later this year, plan to extend this initiative to our international markets. 
As I mentioned on our prior call, during 2020, we also implemented a new technology to consolidate and better control the company's indirect overhead spending, which we expect to drive significant savings going forward. These are just a few examples of where we are eliminating complexity from the organization, but the efforts go well beyond the ones I mentioned, impacting areas, including the supply chain, legal entity structure, cost centers, profit centers, financial systems and real estate, amongst others. 
We are driving overhead efficiencies through complexity reduction, along with benefits from restructuring savings, which we started to realize in the back half of the year. We lowered our overhead as a percent of sales by another 100 basis points in 2020.
Importantly, as we look forward, we see ample opportunity to continue to simplify our operations and optimize our supply chain. Beyond efficiency, simplification allows us to become a more preferred partner with our retail customers. As we continue to optimize normal cost structure, we are increasingly leaning into our productivity initiative called FUEL, a significant enabler of our margin ambition. 
In 2020, we drove a stellar outcome on FUEL, reducing our cost-of-goods sold base by about 4% year-over-year as gross savings increased about 35%. This was not only the best annual result Newell Brands has delivered since we started tracking this measure, but also amongst best-in-class in the industry. We are systematizing these productivity efforts across the organization and have a strong pipeline of projects for 2021 and the coming years, which should help drive gross margin improvement going forward. 
Now let's turn to quarterly results. During the fourth quarter, Newell's net sales increased 2.5% year-over-year to $2.7 billion as core sales growth of 4.9% was partially offset by headwinds from foreign exchange as well as business and retail store exits. For the second consecutive quarter, we saw broad-based top line momentum, with core sales growth across all 4 geographic regions and 6 business units. 
Normalized operating margin improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 11.4%, which was ahead of our expectations. Overhead cost reduction and productivity savings helped to offset higher advertising and marketing expenses as well as pressure from business unit mix, COVID-related cost and inflation. 
We reduced our net interest expense by $1 million year-over-year to $69 million due to debt repayment during the year. We recorded a normalized tax benefit of $6 million as compared to a normalized tax expense of $51 million in the year-ago period, reflecting discrete tax benefits in the current quarter. 
We grew Q4 normalized diluted earnings per share 33% year-over-year to $0.56 a share. Stronger-than-anticipated top line results in combination with disciplined expense management and strong productivity enabled us to outperform versus our expectations. 
Moving on to our segments. Core sales for Appliance & Cookware increased 4.2% driven by international markets. Consumption trends continued to reflect increased frequency at at-home cooking. I would like to point out that effective January 1, 2021, the CEO of the Food business has taken over the responsibilities for the Calphalon Cookware business. As a result of this change, the Appliance & Cookware segment will be renamed Home Appliances in 2021. 
Core sales growth for the Commercial Solutions segment accelerated sequentially to 13.8%, with increases across both the Commercial and the Connected Home & Security businesses. Consumption trends also improved sequentially across both businesses. Within Commercial, we saw strong demand for many consumer-facing businesses as well as in washroom and hand protection. 
Core sales for the Home Solutions segment increased 12.4%, propelled by growth across both Food and Home Fragrance business units. Food was once again the strongest performer within the portfolio, continuing on its double-digit growth streak as consumption remains strong. 
In a seasonally important quarter, core sales increased in the Home Fragrance business, reflecting strength in e-commerce, EMEA and the wholesale channel. As anticipated, core sales in the Outdoor & Rec segment were under pressure, declining 7.4%. Fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by the timing shift of sales in Coleman North America into Q3, ahead of the October 1 conversion to SAP. 
Looking past the timing shift and focusing on the second half of 2020. Core sales per outgoing rent grew year-over-year as improved consumption of outdoor equipment categories offset softness in beverage and technical apparel. 
Core sales for the Learning & Development segment contracted 2.2%, which was a meaningful improvement from the prior 3 quarters. While core sales for Writing were challenged due to the impact of COVID-19 on school and office closures, we were encouraged to see continuation of positive consumption trends in the U.S. Top line momentum for Baby accelerated in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong consumer demand. 
Our efforts to tighten working capital delivered outstanding results, making cash flow one of the major highlights in 2020. We generated over $1.4 billion of operating cash flow during the year, which represents a $388 million improvement from 2019. Last year at CAGNY, we set an ambitious target of delivering free cash flow productivity in excess of 100%, and this was our second consecutive year of meeting that goal. 
In fact, in 2020, Newell's free cash flow productivity was 154%, a remarkable achievement by all accounts. We shortened the cash conversion cycle by about 26 days to 72 days, which is very close to our benchmark target of 70 days. Accounts payable was the most significant driver of the improvement in the cash conversion cycle as we saw a flow-through of more favorable payment terms that we have renegotiated with our suppliers. We also ramped up our supply chain to build inventory in order to support demand, creating a timing benefit in payables that we expect to partially reverse in 2021. 
We are in a much stronger balance sheet position today than we have been in a very long time. We ended the year with a net debt-to-normalized EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.5x versus 4.0x at the end of 2019, and we are closing in on our target of 3.0x. 
During the fourth quarter, we completed a $300 million debt tender. And for the year, we reduced our net debt by $748 million to $4.6 billion. We exited 2020 in a very strong short-term liquidity position, which exceeded $2.5 billion, including nearly $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. 
Turning to 2021. I want to start by providing some context for our plan. We are encouraged by the momentum we have seen in our business in the second half of 2020. The first quarter of 2021 is off to a very strong start from both a consumption and shipment perspective. At the same time, we are balancing this optimism against the macro environment, which remains quite dynamic as a result of the ongoing pandemic. 
We are taking a prudent planning approach to 2021, capitalizing on growth opportunities while continuing to drive cost and cash discipline. While we expect many of the recent consumer habits to persist, we are assuming a normalization of category trends over the course of the year. Since the comparisons are much tougher in the back half of 2021, we expect a stronger first half relative to the second half. 
Additionally, we are seeing inflation trends pick up, primarily due to resins, transportation costs, wage rates and sourced finished good pricing. We plan to grow gross margins despite this cost pressure with both pricing and productivity actions. 
Specifically, in 2021, we expect to deliver on our evergreen financial targets for core sales growth, operating margin expansion and free cash flow productivity. For the full year of 2021, we are guiding for net sales of $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion, with core sales growing at a low single-digit rate and favorable foreign exchange more than offsetting the headwind from continued rationalization of the Yankee Candle retail store footprint and other minor business exits. 
We are planning for normalized operating margin improvement of 30 to 60 basis points year-over-year to 11.4% to 11.7%. We expect productivity and overhead savings will more than offset the impact of inflation as well as incremental investment behind higher advertising and marketing spend. 
We are assuming normalized effective tax rate in the high teens, significantly above the 2020 level, due to a lower benefit from discrete tax items. This outlook does not contemplate any potential changes in the U.S. corporate tax rate under the new administration. 
We expect this to net out a normalized earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.65, with a modest uptick in the number of shares relative to 2020 levels. The year-over-year step-up in the tax rate represents a more than $0.30 headwind to earnings per share in 2021. On a tax rate equivalent basis, we are projecting strong growth in earnings per share in 2021. 
For 2021, we expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion. Our outlook implies that we will continue to make progress on reducing our cash conversion cycle, despite a lower year-over-year benefit from working capital. 
For Q1, we are guiding for net sales of $2.04 billion to $2.08 billion or 8% to 10% year-over-year growth, with core sales increasing in the high single-digit range versus Q1 2020. Favorable currency is expected to more than offset the impact from Yankee Candle store closures and minor business exits. 
Our first quarter guidance assumes normalized operating margin improves of 90 to 130 basis points year-over-year to 6.9% to 7.3%, reflecting benefits from productivity efforts and overhead savings that are partially masked by higher advertising and marketing investments as well as heightened commodity and transportation costs. 
We are projecting a normalized effective tax rate in the mid-20s for the first quarter, reflecting a discrete tax headwind in the quarter. We expect normalized earnings per share in the $0.12 to $0.14 range, which represents strong double-digit growth as compared to $0.09 in the year-ago period. 
Over the past 2 years, we have made tremendous progress on our turnaround. We are coming out of 2020 in a much stronger position than we were coming in despite the ongoing disruption from the pandemic. We continue to see significant opportunity for value creation, and will remain vigilant in executing on our goal of driving consistent and sustainable core sales growth, operating margin expansion and improved cash conversion cycle.

As I said in the prepared remarks where we've gotten to our goal a year early. 
One of the things that we've done is we've put in place a systemic process that we call a Magic Quadrant analysis that looks at revenue per SKU and gross margin per SKU. And as we've gotten into that and systematized the process, we think we've got opportunity to go further on SKU count reduction going forward. We don't believe that this is going to be a revenue headwind. We actually think that this is going to be a revenue health for the company and a cost help because it allows us to improve our customer service levels. 
We're in the process of setting new targets, and we'll share more probably at CAGNY next week with regard to the out-front targets, but very encouraged by the results so far, and we see it as an enabler for both revenue growth and continued productivity. 
On Yankee stores. We ended 2020 by closing, I think, 77 stores in 2020. Our store count was 398 stores. I think our plan for '21 is to close somewhere about another 80 to 100. Most of those will happen, and in fact, most of those happened in January. So it's very part-of-the-year loaded. That does not have a significant impact on the company's revenue because we're growing very fast in that business on the e-commerce side, with the wholesale business and in the international markets. And so we believe that we're going to see a profitability benefit as we make that transition from retail to more online and wholesale in that business. 
And then on the plant closures. You're right, in the second quarter last year, of our about 135 manufacturing facilities and distribution centers, we had 20 that were closed via government mandate. As we sit here today, all of our facilities are open, largely operating at full capacity, and we have largely caught off across the majority of our product categories. That being said, we do have some product categories where we're still supply-constrained. And those tend to be the product categories where we've seen outsized consumer demand increases. But we are working hard to catch up and add capacity in those situations."

But the first piece of good news in terms of the resilience of the portfolio when you look at 2020 with all the headwinds we had on Writing that we were able to do as well in the second half and actually contain the decline for the full year to a negative one is testimony to how we're beginning to get resilience with other brands. So that may mean comforting from a long term. 
Writing is a very well-managed business for us. It's just the macro has been what it has been. When we look at '21, I think what we're assuming is that schools will go back to reopening are these the [indiscernible] in the second half of the year. And we've taken that into consideration. We're preparing for it. We think it will be a more normal back-to-school season. And I think some of the universities as well. 
The big unknown at this stage is the commercial business. Because when you look at offices, the prediction I had thought that most of the offices would head back in by July, but everything we're reading and hearing is that until you get hurt in early, I think companies are low to sort of take that step. We have learned from Silicon Valley companies that they may actually remain closed not only into the fall, but the entire year. 
So that does get affected in terms of our commercial business, which is softer part of the business. So we'll have to see on that. Overall, do we expect the Writing business to grow in 2021 versus 2020? Absolutely. How much? I think second half will be the question mark. 
And look, the other thing I should say, which I've said in my prepared remarks, the share gains we've had in Writing are truly spectacular. And Sharpie's brand strength that it can go beyond markers and how it is doing in the pen side and all the innovations we are coming up. 
And lastly, we're really comparing for a different future with this business. We're now -- our team is very focused on innovations, which is there's more stay-at-home stuff that we have prepared to do that in the longer term. So it's still very -- feel good about this business and -- but the other businesses are picking up as well."

The first is inflation, which, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is due to resin wage rates; the sourced finished goods, primarily due to the strengthening of the Chinese currency and transportation costs. 
We expect that inflation pressure based on what we're seeing today to be almost a 200 basis point headwind for the company for next year, which is a significant ramp up from prior years. We also are planning to increase our advertising and marketing cost as a percent of sales in 2021, given that our innovation pipeline has strengthened in 2021 as we've brought new leadership on and they've begun to develop stronger innovation plans. So those are the 2 headwinds. 
We're guiding to operating margin growth because we have benefits that more than offset that. And the benefits that we're seeing are -- the biggest one is productivity with the fuel savings program. And so we're using that productivity drive to basically offset -- largely offset the inflation pressure. 
We also have -- we are going to take selective pricing. We're not taking pricing to fully offset inflation, but we are taking selective pricing in those categories that have seen the biggest inflationary pressure. We also expect business unit mix benefit. 
As Ravi mentioned, we are expecting the Writing business to come back and be a meaningful growth driver for the company in 2021. Actually, we're expecting the Writing business to grow starting in the first quarter from what we've seen. 
And then the last thing I would mention is continued focus on overhead cost reduction through our simplification initiatives. So those are sort of a walk through the puts and takes. I think when you net it all together, we're expecting to drive gross margin improvement in 2021 despite the inflation environment because of the productivity efforts the pricing and the mix from the business unit forecast."

So I don't think that's a concern, and we'll continue to grow there. 
Second, in terms of channels. As I mentioned, where the big thrust for us is the grocery business, the dollar stores, the drug stores. And we're making already good progress, especially our Food business really had a good year on the grocery side. We're putting together now a very focused sales team on this channel. We think that there's a lot of opportunity One, we continue to do well with our strong mass merchants or our biggest customers, so continued focus on that."

So first, on the margin opportunity. Chris, as you're well aware, the 600 to 800 basis point opportunity with respect to combined gross margin and overheads, understanding those figures are gross and ex, any sort of reinvestment concerns? But frankly, it's pretty unique and rather substantial within the consumer space. 
So the long-term guidance calls for 50 basis points of improvement each year. You guide this year is 30 to 60 basis points. The question is, what's the organization's ability to lean in and accelerate the pace of that margin enhancement and unlocking that value for shareholders while balancing versus the investment needs and cost inflation that you'll encounter in any given year? So your comments there would be helpful. Then I have a quick follow-up on opportunities outside the U.S."

So let me start on the margin question, Kevin. So if you look at the underlying trends of what we're driving this year, the organization is driving sustainable margin improvement progress on both gross margin through the fuel program and on overhead reduction through the complexity reduction that dramatically exceeds our guidance of 30 to 60 basis points in operating margin improvement. 
The reason why we're guiding to 30 to 60 basis points is because we have an inflationary environment, which I mentioned is about a 200 basis point headwind. And we're planning to increase advertising and marketing costs as a percent of sales significantly in 2021. And so if those 2 things were not there, you would see our ability to fundamentally be driving operating margin improvement be higher than the net guidance. 
I think the evergreen model that we've put out of 50 basis points improvement each year, our guidance is very much in line with this year. So we're excited that our guidance this year has us fully on all metrics in line with the -- with our evergreen model. And we think that the company has really turned the corner in regard to delivering against that evergreen model. 
So in any given year, we'll guide as appropriate when we get there. But I feel very good about the underlying capabilities of the company to continue to drive margin improvement, primarily in the gross margin and overhead area."

So if you take the U.K., we have many businesses that are in different offices, there's not the synergies. So we've got to get focused. So what we're doing is focusing on sort of top 10 countries and saying how do you get after them and how do we create longer-term a country management system, more of a one-year approach rather than everyone doing their own thing. 
Having said that, the teams have been still doing pretty well. And when you look at the fact that overall, international actually grew pretty well and slightly better than the U.S. in 2020. And when you think about appliances where Latin America is the strongest, it was double-digit growth -- strong double-digit growth in Latin America. 
So it's all positive. I just think there's a lot of opportunity, and we're going to get after it with a very well-articulated strategy. COVID's also made it difficult to get to these countries. But this year, this is one of my big priorities as we go forward."

And then second, question. Actually, that's on the margins, but looking at it from a different perspective. My take is that the biggest hindrance to your overall margin is how low your margins have been in appliances and cookware specifically? And I know there's been a lot of lumpiness quarter-to-quarter.

So earlier in the pandemic, as I mentioned, in the second quarter of last year, it was about our manufacturing facilities and our distribution facilities. Now the disruption is more related to that port. We are getting products through there. We're also shipping through other ports on the East Coast and other places in the West Coast. 
The prices for containers have gone up dramatically. We are a large-scale importer from a volume standpoint. That gives us some advantage in the marketplace because we have contractual commitments for volume and pricing that I think advantages us versus many of our smaller competitors. So we don't see it as a major headwind for the quarter or for the year, but it is something we're sort of battling every day as we go along here."

The gross margins outside of the U.S. are actually quite good. So what the charge -- Chris often say, we've got to get that gross margin up over the next several years. 
And also, as we get out of these scale businesses, some of these we are finding were gross margin-negative so we really need to get out, if you are giving out sort of dollar bills with some things.

So I think you'll continue to see these, which brings many of the categories we compete in, are going to handle growth. And -- but importantly, we're also taking share. I mean this is the first year in '20, where we got shared in a number of categories. 
And Writing, we feel very good that we're pushing the share side. And second half, we'll just have to see. So I think overall -- and then I think one of the comments for some store closures which is really more of a -- it really affects 2 things, right?  Yankee Candles where ourselves closing and the D2C business for us has been very strong, so it's absorbing that. 
And on the specialty side, clearly, that affects our Writing business. And so the commercial business is affected there a little bit. But overall, I think we're hoping that the strength that we have both in terms of our brands will -- if this category growth will grow ahead of it or it flat, we will go after share so."

But just as background, I think 2 years ago, when I -- as I mentioned when I first showed up at CAGNY, with 2 months at the company, and I reported that we were -- our cash conversion cycle was 115 days, which had us as the worst company in the industry. 
And we set a goal of 70 days where we wanted to get to. And the 70 days was really based on looking at the categories that we compete in and trying to say if we could get to the median level based on our peer group, what would that look like, and that was 70. We ended this year at 72. So we've gotten there very quickly. I think the move from 115 days down to 72 has been phenomenal. 
I'm not satisfied with being at median. I think that we aspire to be best-in-class, not just median. And so we're working through similar to the SKU count, now that we've achieved the initial target that we've set, I think we're likely to set a more aspirational target that's more aggressive because we continue to see opportunity ahead of us for cash -- working capital takeout and cash conversion cycle improvement. 
Similar to SKU count, I'll share more detail on what that looks like next week when we get into the strategy discussion."

I sincerely hope that you and your loved ones are staying healthy and safe. While there's no doubt that 2020 was a very challenging year, I am immensely proud of the results our team delivered as we quickly adapted to the evolving environment. At the same time, we remain focused on ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees carefully operating our plants and distribution facilities while ratcheting our capacity and maintaining financial viability and business continuity. 
We closed this to start the year on an exceptional manner with fourth quarter and full year results ahead of our expectations across the board. This is a testament to the incredible resilience, fortitude and commitment of our employees who execute with excellence. In fact, in first quarter, we pivoted to accelerate the turnaround plan and drove significantly stronger underlying performance in the business in the second half of the year across all key value drivers, top line margins, earnings per share and cash growth. 
We also achieved meaningful progress against our strategic priorities in 2020. First, we strengthened and diversified our team as we broadly have world-class leaders from the outside and top lines, commercial food and outdoor and recreation businesses as well as the driver functions. They hit the ground running. 
As COVID certainly hit off, did not allow for any down time. They complement our strong existing leaders across the remaining 4 businesses. 
The leadership team and I are focused on building a winning one new culture focused on trust, transparency and teamwork. A diversity inclusion belonging efforts are our top priority as we continue to galvanize our employees and unify everyone behind the common purpose of delighting consumers with our innovative brands that create moment of guide, build confidence and provide peace of mind. 
Second, throughout the year, we improved customer relationships through enhanced collaboration, joint business planning efforts as well as increased emphasis on delivering excellent service for our customers. We are leveraging our omnichannel capabilities to advance joint business planning and believe there's an area of strength for you. We're also seizing opportunities to close our distribution gaps, particularly in the food, drug and other channels. We're already making progress on that front across a number of businesses, such as Food, driving and Home Fragrance. 
Third, we drove a 30 basis point improvement in normalized operating margin in 2020 and incredible fee, given the cost and business mix headwinds, we had to overcome during the year. This was made possible by establishing a culture of productivity as well as aggressively attacking overhead costs and organizational complexity. 
In fact, normalized operating margin expanded 120 basis points year-over-year in the second half, reversing the losses in the second quarter that were mostly driven by fixed cost deleveraging. And for the full year, EPS of $1.79, wow, up nearly 12% from continuing operations for tight working capital management resulted in stellar operating cash flow of more than $1.4 billion. Yes, folks, $1.4 billion. Our business unit CFOs, led by our own billion-dollar man, Chris Peterson, did a phenomenal job. 
Lastly, one of the key objectives of turnaround has been to return the company to sustainable core sales growth. While core sales for the year declined 1.1%, I'm delighted to say that in the second half of 2020, we turned the corner. Core sales grew 6% and increase across 7 out of 8 business units with every geographic region growing. 
During 2020, we experienced healthy domestic consumption that's broad-based. The strength and resilience of our portfolio showed through as growth in Food, Commercial and Appliances, Cookware business units offset Writing softness. The team successfully navigated demand surges, product and container availability issues and tempering factor and distribution center closures. 
Highly focused on relevant generation, grounded in consumer insights as well as omnichannel execution are making a difference. During 2020, we grew, improved domestic market share across a number of businesses. including baby gear, food storage, vacuum scene, fresh preserving, tents, quarters and tents, to name a few. Many of our top brands delivered incredible results in 2020, as Rubbermaid, FoodSaver, Oster, Mapa/Spontex, Bob, First Alert and WoodWick, all grew at a double-digit rate. 
Omnichannel is the way forward and a critical priority for us. Our e-commerce business has continued to be a substantial growth engine for the company. In 2020, e-commerce revenue growth accelerated to the high 30s, and penetration online improved to about 22% of net sales on a local basis, close to double the rate versus 2 years ago. While Baby remains, by far, the most highly penetrated business across the digital platforms, we'll see meaningful shift towards online consumption across the portfolio. 
In fact, in 2020, 4 business units commanded digital penetration as a percent of net sales of more than 20%, including Baby, Home Fragrance, Outdoor & Recreation and Appliances and Cookware, and Food is chasing that number. 
All of our leaders took quick and decisive actions to swiftly adapt to the COVID-19 environment and emerging trends. These trends include preparing more food at home as regular people turn into home chefs, heightened interest in outdoor hobbies and personal wellbeing and increased investment in sanitation. We anticipate that trends will continue to evolve throughout 2021. 
We also believe that many of the habits that have been formed during the pandemic are here to stay with our portfolio well-positioned to capitalize on them. 
Let me briefly touch upon how each of our businesses performed in 2020 as I'm truly thrilled with the progress we have made. Let's start with Appliances & Cookware, where we delivered mid-single-digit core sales growth, driven by the strength in the international markets. 
In the U.S., consumption increased during the fourth quarter and for the full year as more people have been cooking, baking and spending time at home. In Latin America, despite COVID-related challenges, the team delivered outstanding results as they quickly pivoted towards the digital platform. 
Although I'm extremely proud of these results, I also realized that a lot more work needs to be done to reposition the Appliance business for sustainable growth. During 2020, the Appliances category accelerated significantly. And in some instances, we did not keep up, especially in the U.S. This resulted in share losses, albeit lower in magnitude than in prior years. Although we are seeing good traction with recent innovations such as Mr. Coffee iced coffee maker, Oster Texture Select Blenders and Oster Diamond for heating cooking products, we need to extend the learnings and leverage consumer insights across the entire brand portfolio. 
Back where it began in 2020 and is continuing in earnest throughout 2021, as we implement the necessary strategic changes to successfully position appliances. We have a strong international Appliance franchise with strong brand equity for Oster, Crockpot and Sunbeam in LatAm and Australia and New Zealand, followed by Breville in Europe. 
Our challenge is to address [ payer ] category businesses in the U.S. with low gross margins that drag down the portfolio. Chris Robins, our CEO for that business, will undertake actions in 2021 to prune the portfolio. 
Within the Commercial Solutions segment, our commercial business had a phenomenal 2020 as core sales growth during each quarter culminated in high single-digit growth for the year. We saw particularly strong sales growth in washroom, glove and scouring product as well as outdoor and garage organization businesses we've benefited from heightened consumer engagement across the home improvement categories. 
In response to strong demand for sanitization as well as our strategic investments to expand production capacity, we placed about 3.3 million soap and dispenser, sanitizer dispensers globally and sold enough soap and sanitizers to clean over 30 billion pairs of hands. That's a lot of hands. We're not stopping there. 
We're introducing innovative stands and brackets that enable facility operators to put hand sanitizers virtually anywhere in the building, including on the wall, on a table top or any general open space. The breadth of the commercial business portfolio, which includes both consumer and commercial offerings as well as the diverse coverage of verticals and enhanced partnership with retail partners, position the business for long-term success. 
Let's move to Connected Home & Security business. While core sales were down in 2020 due to supply constraints caused by pandemic-related plant shutdowns, the business performed well in the back half of the year, with top line accelerating in the fourth quarter. 
Within the Home Solutions segment, our Food business has certainly lived up to its rocket-ship status that have grown very founder. It actually returned to growth prior to the pandemic and built momentum to mid-20% core sales growth in 2020, propelled by strong consumption throughout the year as well as market share gains. In the U.S., our leading brands, Rubbermaid, FoodSaver and Ball, took share across food storage, food preservation and canning verticals, benefiting from improved commercialization of product, stronger consumer social engagement and programming as well as recent innovations, such as the latest vacuum sealing device, FoodSaver and VS3000 multiuse preservation system and Rubbermaid Brilliance Glass. 
The launch of Brilliance Glass is off to a rolling start. And the overall sub-brand of Rubbermaid Brilliance sales have almost doubled in 2020. 2020 was a stellar year for FoodSaver, which is the fastest-growing brand across all of Newell brands, and it broke through as a top 10 brand for us. Strong appliance sales in 2020 should translate into increased consumer purchases in 2021. 
In Food, we continue to chase strong demand for January, and we are working hard to address supply constraints in certain product lines. 
Turning to Home Fragrance, we experienced strong consumption growth at our Home Fragrance business during 2020, driven by surge in demand in the back half of the year. As a result, core sales increased in both North America and EMEA in the second half of the year and in the seasonally critical fourth quarter period. 
Full year top line sales performance was partially hindered by the temporary closure of Yankee Candle retail stores and other specialty chains for several months early in the year and the supply chain disruption experienced in the second quarter. 
I'm extremely proud of the team's resilience and creativity in addressing supply shortages as they work around the clock and even engaged the corporate teams in the manufacturing and packing operations. They went all out on production in an attempt to keep up with consumer demand, which remained robust in January. 
The scented category -- candle category [ so far ] in 2020, no pun intended, as demand for products that help bring tranquility to consumer homes remained robust. We held share despite supply constraints. As we look out to 2021, there are a number of exciting innovations in the hopper, including the Yankee Candle Signature Collection, the largest update to the Yankee line in years, and it's launching this month. It will provide our best burning experience to date. 
We continue to reposition the Home Fragrance business for the long time. During 2020, we exited the fundraising business and 77 retail stores with additional store closures anticipated in 2021. At the same time, we are building great momentum on our direct-to-consumer business, which grew strong double digits in 2020, offsetting sharp falls in retail, expanding distribution into the grocery and truck channels and diversifying the product portfolio into auto diffusers, et cetera. 
In the Learning & Development segment, cross-sell for our Baby business grew modestly during 2020. The rebound from Q3 persisted into Q4, driven by healthy consumption recovering from the depressed levels in March and April, where lockdowns were in full effect. For the year, domestic demand improved across baby gear and in print care businesses, particularly [indiscernible] car seats, high chair, swings and bottles. We have seen a continuation of strong domestic consumption trends in January. 
As mobility improved post lockdowns, the rebound in demand for toddler cases has been nothing short of remarkable. What's even more craft fine is that we solidified our leading position in this important category in 2020, getting over 250 basis points of share. We're thrilled by the strong performance of our Graco brand, which picked up 130 basis points of share in 2020 in a year past this innovation. More exciting launches are planned for 2021, including Graco slim fit 3-in-1 car seat, our slimmest designed that fits 3 car seats across savings space in the backseat. Without compromising on safety in the future -- feature's need. 
Now as anticipated, 2020 was a tough year for our Writing business as a category in total, particularly in the commercial channel. Core sales pressure continued into the fourth quarter, albeit at lower levels relative to the part of prior 2 quarters as demand in the U.S. normalized a bit. 
During the fourth quarter, we did see continued consumption growth in the U.S., which started in September as the back-to-school season was extended. For the full year, there were also a few bright spots, including pens, living and fine art businesses, all of which grew POS despite the disruption. 
Although category headwinds were significant, both in the U.S. and internationally, we've made progress on the market share front. In our core Writing category, which position us to come out with pandemic on a stronger footing. 
2020 was the year of the pen for the Writing business, with innovation delivering outstanding market share gains of about 750 basis points in gel pens and 260 basis points across the total pen category. We're optimistic about our momentum in the pens category and have launched expansion to our Sharpie S-Gel platform with Sharpie S-Gel fashion designs and color expansion and Sharpie S-Gel Metal Barrel. We'll be launching this platform around the globe. 
We also received -- achieved strong share performance in our [indiscernible] business as [ Dynamo ] reached record share, both in the U.S. and EMEA. While category challenges persist, consumption has remained positive thus far in 2021. We exited 2020 with the lowest retailer inventory position across the office superstores in several years. 
This should better position us in the retailers for a rebound, post-pandemic, as schools and offices return to more normal cadence. 
While there's a great degree of uncertainty around the timing of return to a sense of normalcy in schools and offices, we're assuming a more normal back-to-school season in 2021, but the offices may remain in a hybrid environment for the balance of the year impacting our commercial channel. 
Lastly, core sales and consumption in our Outdoor & Recreation business, while under pressure during 2020, break down by the softness in our technical apparel and beverages businesses as a result of further reduced on-the-go activities. 
We delivered fair performance in the Outdoor business in the back half of the year, particularly in the Outdoor Equipment category, such as coolers, tents and stoves. We also saw a number of favorable developments in the market share front in several core categories such as coolers and tents, where we gained about 90 and 190 basis points of share, respectively. 
I'm especially excited to share that Coleman, which is one of the Newell's largest brands, returned to growth during 2020. What a way to celebrate the brand's 120th anniversary. Coleman had a number of successful launches in 2020, including The Coleman, Skydome, and we refreshed many coolers. We are following up in the 2021 season with additional consumer-centric and purposeful innovations. 
To highlight just a few. We're expanding the assortment on the 2020 Coleman's Skydome Tent to larger dome tent in a variety of styles and colors. We're also introducing a Coleman Reunion collection of coolers, which will include new Matte powder-coated finish and 3 beautiful trend-focused colors that elevate and rejuvenate the Coleman's steel-belted cooler.
Although I'm certainly encouraged by the progress we have made in outdoor equipment business, we have more work to do on technical apparel, which is especially led by Marmot brand and beverage with Contigo. We have brought in capable leaders to do just that and expect a stronger 2021. 
Newell is now 2 years into the turnaround with notable progress across the organization. As we look into -- look out to 2021 and beyond, we intend to build on the improving momentum. We will continue to position new brands for sustainable and profitable growth with our strategic priorities focused on the following 5 areas. 
First, galvanize our employees behind our purpose to create consumer-obsessed customer-focused organization that's digitally savvy and willing to experiment and learn while adhering to uphold values. 
Second, sustained top line growth by focusing on the end-to-end consumer journey, strengthening omnichannel capabilities while accelerating online penetration and focusing on scaling and modernizing our top brands. 
We also want to strengthen efforts to improve supply availability to improve customer service levels with a strong focus on forecast accuracy. 
Third, become an innovation engine by sharpening our focus on consumer insights and trends implementing an enterprise-wide innovation, operating model, building cross-business unit platforms and better leveraging our R&D resources. 
Fourth, accelerate international growth and improve profitability by addressing fragmentation, high overheads, prioritizing dry countries, evolving autonomous geographic units to One Newell approach to build scale and move to a distributor model in nonpriority countries. 
And fifth, continue to make progress on the financial agenda, expanding margins through productivity type management of overhead cost and complexity reduction as well as strengthening Newell brand's cash conversion cycle and balance sheet. 
Although 2020 was undeniably one of the most trying and volatile periods in recent history, I'm extremely clarified, poised and resilient persistence, ability to adapt, pivot and execute with speed in the journey. This has enabled us to gain significant traction on our turnaround strategy and strengthen the underlying fundamentals, positioning the company to come out even stronger post the pandemic. I am excited about Newell's prospects and feel our better days are ahead of us. Onwards and upwards. 
And now I turn the call over to billion-dollar man, Chris Peterson."

The team delivered an outstanding finish to the year with Q4 results ahead of our expectations across every key metric, including top line operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow. In fact, our 2020 results exceeded or were in line with the initial guidance we laid out a year ago despite the significant disruption from the pandemic. 
We are now 2 years into the turnaround and have come a long way in strengthening the financial performance and operational effectiveness of the company. Last year, we drove excellent progress on each area of the turnaround plan and gained significant momentum in the second half of 2020. 
Before getting into the financial results and outlook, I want to spend a few minutes on operational highlights. We made significant progress simplifying the organization. For example, on SKU count, we exceeded our target a year early and exited 2020 with 47,000 SKUs as compared to our goal of 50,000 by the end of '21. We have eliminated 54% of our SKUs over the past 2 years with a 37% reduction in 2020 alone. Effectively, we have doubled our revenue per SKU over the past 2 years. We've also meaningfully strengthened the quality of our inventory, cutting our excess and hostile inventory by more than half since 2018. We are not stopping here, and we'll continue to simplify the SKU portfolio across each of our businesses. 
Over the past 2 years, we've also significantly simplified our IT architecture as we rationalize nearly 90% of IT applications, ending 2020 with less than 800 apps; successfully implemented 8 ERP migrations, including the October 1 move of Coleman North America to SAP, which went smoothly. We expect to get 95% of our business on 2 ERP systems over the next 2 years. 
We also fully redesigned our digital technology platform, rationalizing the number of sites in North America from about 290 to 40. We have already migrated 35 of these 40 sites to the new platform, with another 3 conversions expected to be completed by the end of February. This is a remarkable achievement within an 18-month period. 
The new platform delivers a much higher quality, more engaging and impactful consumer experience and allows us to introduce exciting omnichannel features along the way. We expect to complete the conversion of the remaining U.S. sites by the summer and later this year, plan to extend this initiative to our international markets. 
As I mentioned on our prior call, during 2020, we also implemented a new technology to consolidate and better control the company's indirect overhead spending, which we expect to drive significant savings going forward. These are just a few examples of where we are eliminating complexity from the organization, but the efforts go well beyond the ones I mentioned, impacting areas, including the supply chain, legal entity structure, cost centers, profit centers, financial systems and real estate, amongst others. 
We are driving overhead efficiencies through complexity reduction, along with benefits from restructuring savings, which we started to realize in the back half of the year. We lowered our overhead as a percent of sales by another 100 basis points in 2020.
Importantly, as we look forward, we see ample opportunity to continue to simplify our operations and optimize our supply chain. Beyond efficiency, simplification allows us to become a more preferred partner with our retail customers. As we continue to optimize normal cost structure, we are increasingly leaning into our productivity initiative called FUEL, a significant enabler of our margin ambition. 
In 2020, we drove a stellar outcome on FUEL, reducing our cost-of-goods sold base by about 4% year-over-year as gross savings increased about 35%. This was not only the best annual result Newell Brands has delivered since we started tracking this measure, but also amongst best-in-class in the industry. We are systematizing these productivity efforts across the organization and have a strong pipeline of projects for 2021 and the coming years, which should help drive gross margin improvement going forward. 
Now let's turn to quarterly results. During the fourth quarter, Newell's net sales increased 2.5% year-over-year to $2.7 billion as core sales growth of 4.9% was partially offset by headwinds from foreign exchange as well as business and retail store exits. For the second consecutive quarter, we saw broad-based top line momentum, with core sales growth across all 4 geographic regions and 6 business units. 
Normalized operating margin improved 10 basis points year-over-year to 11.4%, which was ahead of our expectations. Overhead cost reduction and productivity savings helped to offset higher advertising and marketing expenses as well as pressure from business unit mix, COVID-related cost and inflation. 
We reduced our net interest expense by $1 million year-over-year to $69 million due to debt repayment during the year. We recorded a normalized tax benefit of $6 million as compared to a normalized tax expense of $51 million in the year-ago period, reflecting discrete tax benefits in the current quarter. 
We grew Q4 normalized diluted earnings per share 33% year-over-year to $0.56 a share. Stronger-than-anticipated top line results in combination with disciplined expense management and strong productivity enabled us to outperform versus our expectations. 
Moving on to our segments. Core sales for Appliance & Cookware increased 4.2% driven by international markets. Consumption trends continued to reflect increased frequency of at-home cooking. I would like to point out that effective January 1, 2021, the CEO of the Food business has taken over the responsibilities for the Calphalon Cookware business. As a result of this change, the Appliance & Cookware segment will be renamed Home Appliances in 2021. 
Core sales growth for the Commercial Solutions segment accelerated sequentially to 13.8%, with increases across both the Commercial and the Connected Home & Security businesses. Consumption trends also improved sequentially across both businesses. Within Commercial, we saw strong demand for many consumer-facing businesses as well as in washroom and hand protection. 
Core sales for the Home Solutions segment increased 12.4%, propelled by growth across both Food and Home Fragrance business units. Food was once again the strongest performer within the portfolio, continuing on its double-digit growth streak as consumption remains strong. 
In a seasonally important quarter, core sales increased in the Home Fragrance business, reflecting strength in e-commerce, EMEA and the wholesale channel. As anticipated, core sales in the Outdoor & Rec segment were under pressure, declining 7.4%. Fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by the timing shift of sales in Coleman North America into Q3, ahead of the October 1 conversion to SAP. 
Looking past the timing shift and focusing on the second half of 2020. Core sales per outgoing rent grew year-over-year as improved consumption of outdoor equipment categories offset softness in beverage and technical apparel. 
Core sales for the Learning & Development segment contracted 2.2%, which was a meaningful improvement from the prior 3 quarters. While core sales for Writing were challenged due to the impact of COVID-19 on school and office closures, we were encouraged to see continuation of positive consumption trends in the U.S. Top line momentum for Baby accelerated in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong consumer demand. 
Our efforts to tighten working capital delivered outstanding results, making cash flow one of the major highlights in 2020. We generated over $1.4 billion of operating cash flow during the year, which represents a $388 million improvement from 2019. Last year at CAGNY, we set an ambitious target of delivering free cash flow productivity in excess of 100%, and this was our second consecutive year of meeting that goal. 
In fact, in 2020, Newell's free cash flow productivity was 154%, a remarkable achievement by all accounts. We shortened the cash conversion cycle by about 26 days to 72 days, which is very close to our benchmark target of 70 days. Accounts payable was the most significant driver of the improvement in the cash conversion cycle as we saw a flow-through of more favorable payment terms that we have renegotiated with our suppliers. We also ramped up our supply chain to build inventory in order to support demand, creating a timing benefit in payables that we expect to partially reverse in 2021. 
We are in a much stronger balance sheet position today than we have been in a very long time. We ended the year with a net debt-to-normalized EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.5x versus 4.0x at the end of 2019, and we are closing in on our target of 3.0x. 
During the fourth quarter, we completed a $300 million debt tender. And for the year, we reduced our net debt by $748 million to $4.6 billion. We exited 2020 in a very strong short-term liquidity position, which exceeded $2.5 billion, including nearly $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. 
Turning to 2021. I want to start by providing some context for our plan. We are encouraged by the momentum we have seen in our business in the second half of 2020. The first quarter of 2021 is off to a very strong start from both a consumption and shipment perspective. At the same time, we are balancing this optimism against the macro environment, which remains quite dynamic as a result of the ongoing pandemic. 
We are taking a prudent planning approach to 2021, capitalizing on growth opportunities while continuing to drive cost and cash discipline. While we expect many of the recent consumer habits to persist, we are assuming a normalization of category trends over the course of the year. Since the comparisons are much tougher in the back half of 2021, we expect a stronger first half relative to the second half. 
Additionally, we are seeing inflation trends pick up, primarily due to resins, transportation costs, wage rates and sourced finished good pricing. We plan to grow gross margins despite this cost pressure with both pricing and productivity actions. 
Specifically, in 2021, we expect to deliver on our evergreen financial targets for core sales growth, operating margin expansion and free cash flow productivity. For the full year of 2021, we are guiding for net sales of $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion, with core sales growing at a low single-digit rate and favorable foreign exchange more than offsetting the headwind from continued rationalization of the Yankee Candle retail store footprint and other minor business exits. 
We are planning for normalized operating margin improvement of 30 to 60 basis points year-over-year to 11.4% to 11.7%. We expect productivity and overhead savings will more than offset the impact of inflation as well as incremental investment behind higher advertising and marketing spend. 
We are assuming normalized effective tax rate in the high teens, significantly above the 2020 level, due to a lower benefit from discrete tax items. This outlook does not contemplate any potential changes in the U.S. corporate tax rate under the new administration. 
We expect this to net out a normalized earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.65, with a modest uptick in the number of shares relative to 2020 levels. The year-over-year step-up in the tax rate represents a more than $0.30 headwind to earnings per share in 2021. On a tax rate equivalent basis, we are projecting strong growth in earnings per share in 2021. 
For 2021, we expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion. Our outlook implies that we will continue to make progress on reducing our cash conversion cycle, despite a lower year-over-year benefit from working capital. 
For Q1, we are guiding for net sales of $2.04 billion to $2.08 billion or 8% to 10% year-over-year growth, with core sales increasing in the high single-digit range versus Q1 2020. Favorable currency is expected to more than offset the impact from Yankee Candle store closures and minor business exits. 
Our first quarter guidance assumes normalized operating margin improves of 90 to 130 basis points year-over-year to 6.9% to 7.3%, reflecting benefits from productivity efforts and overhead savings that are partially masked by higher advertising and marketing investments as well as heightened commodity and transportation costs. 
We are projecting a normalized effective tax rate in the mid-20s for the first quarter, reflecting a discrete tax headwind in the quarter. We expect normalized earnings per share in the $0.12 to $0.14 range, which represents strong double-digit growth as compared to $0.09 in the year-ago period. 
Over the past 2 years, we have made tremendous progress on our turnaround. We are coming out of 2020 in a much stronger position than we were coming in despite the ongoing disruption from the pandemic. We continue to see significant opportunity for value creation, and will remain vigilant in executing on our goal of driving consistent and sustainable core sales growth, operating margin expansion and improved cash conversion cycle.

And then third, I can't remember or I don't remember exactly what it was in terms of -- last year, you had a fair amount of plant closure around COVID that created shortages and out of stocks.

As I said in the prepared remarks where we've gotten to our goal a year early. 
One of the things that we've done is we've put in place a systemic process that we call a Magic Quadrant analysis that looks at revenue per SKU and gross margin per SKU. And as we've gotten into that and systematized the process, we think we've got opportunity to go further on SKU count reduction going forward. We don't believe that this is going to be a revenue headwind. We actually think that this is going to be a revenue health for the company and a cost help because it allows us to improve our customer service levels. 
We're in the process of setting new targets, and we'll share more probably at CAGNY next week with regard to the out-front targets, but very encouraged by the results so far, and we see it as an enabler for both revenue growth and continued productivity. 
On Yankee stores. We ended 2020 by closing, I think, 77 stores in 2020. Our store count was 398 stores. I think our plan for '21 is to close somewhere about another 80 to 100. Most of those will happen, and in fact, most of those happened in January. So it's very part-of-the-year loaded. That does not have a significant impact on the company's revenue because we're growing very fast in that business on the e-commerce side, with the wholesale business and in the international markets. And so we believe that we're going to see a profitability benefit as we make that transition from retail to more online and wholesale in that business. 
And then on the plant closures. You're right, in the second quarter last year, of our about 135 manufacturing facilities and distribution centers, we had 20 that were closed via government mandate. As we sit here today, all of our facilities are open, largely operating at full capacity, and we have largely caught off across the majority of our product categories. That being said, we do have some product categories where we're still supply-constrained. And those tend to be the product categories where we've seen outsized consumer demand increases. But we are working hard to catch up and add capacity in those situations."

Bill, let me tackle that. But the first piece of good news in terms of the resilience of the portfolio when you look at 2020 with all the headwinds we had on Writing that we were able to do as well in the second half and actually contain the decline for the full year to a negative one is testimony to how we're beginning to get resilience with other brands. So that to me is comforting when you look from a long term. 
Writing is a very well-managed business for us. It's just the macro has been what it has been. When we look at '21, I think what we're assuming is that schools will go back to reopening are these the [indiscernible] in the second half of the year. And we've taken that into consideration. We're preparing for it. We think it will be a more normal back-to-school season. And I think some of the universities as well. 
The big unknown at this stage is the commercial business. Because when you look at offices, the prediction I had thought that most of the offices would head back in by July, but everything we're reading and hearing is that until you get hurt in early, I think companies are low to sort of take that step. We have learned from Silicon Valley companies that they may actually remain closed not only into the fall, but the entire year. 
So that does get affected in terms of our commercial business, which is softer part of the business. So we'll have to see on that. Overall, do we expect the Writing business to grow in 2021 versus 2020? Absolutely. How much? I think second half will be the question mark. 
And look, the other thing I should say, which I've said in my prepared remarks, the share gains we've had in Writing are truly spectacular. And Sharpie's brand strength that it can go beyond markers and how it is doing in the pen side and all the innovations we are coming up. 
And lastly, we're really comparing for a different future with this business. We're now -- our team is very focused on innovations, which is there's more stay-at-home stuff that we have prepared to do that in the longer term. So it's still very -- feel good about this business and -- but the other businesses are picking up as well."

So if we think about the margin guidance, the operating margin guidance in particular, gross margin impact for next year, for 2021, basically, there are 2 primary headwinds. The first is inflation, which, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is due to resin wage rates; the sourced finished goods, primarily due to the strengthening of the Chinese currency and transportation costs. 
We expect that inflation pressure based on what we're seeing today to be almost a 200 basis point headwind for the company for next year, which is a significant ramp up from prior years. We also are planning to increase our advertising and marketing cost as a percent of sales in 2021, given that our innovation pipeline has strengthened in 2021 as we've brought new leadership on and they've begun to develop stronger innovation plans. So those are the 2 headwinds. 
We're guiding to operating margin growth because we have benefits that more than offset that. And the benefits that we're seeing are -- the biggest one is productivity with the fuel savings program. And so we're using that productivity drive to basically offset -- largely offset the inflation pressure. 
We also have -- we are going to take selective pricing. We're not taking pricing to fully offset inflation, but we are taking selective pricing in those categories that have seen the biggest inflationary pressure. We also expect business unit mix benefit. 
As Ravi mentioned, we are expecting the Writing business to come back and be a meaningful growth driver for the company in 2021. Actually, we're expecting the Writing business to grow starting in the first quarter from what we've seen. 
And then the last thing I would mention is continued focus on overhead cost reduction through our simplification initiatives. So those are sort of a walk through the puts and takes. I think when you net it all together, we're expecting to drive gross margin improvement in 2021 despite the inflation environment because of the productivity efforts the pricing and the mix from the business unit forecast."

Second, in terms of channels. As I mentioned, where the big thrust for us is the grocery business, the dollar stores, the drug stores. And we're making already good progress, especially our Food business really had a good year on the grocery side. We're putting together now a very focused sales team on this channel.

So let me start on the margin question, Kevin. So if you look at the underlying trends of what we're driving this year, the organization is driving sustainable margin improvement progress on both gross margin through the fuel program and on overhead reduction through the complexity reduction that dramatically exceeds our guidance of 30 to 60 basis points in operating margin improvement. 
The reason why we're guiding to 30 to 60 basis points is because we have an inflationary environment, which I mentioned is about a 200 basis point headwind. And we're planning to increase advertising and marketing costs as a percent of sales significantly in 2021. And so if those 2 things were not there, you would see our ability to fundamentally be driving operating margin improvement be higher than the net guidance. 
I think the evergreen model that we've put out of 50 basis points improvement each year, our guidance is very much in line with this year. So we're excited that our guidance this year has us fully on all metrics in line with the -- with our evergreen model. And we think that the company has really turned the corner in regard to delivering against that evergreen model. 
So in any given year, we'll guide as appropriate when we get there. But I feel very good about the underlying capabilities of the company to continue to drive margin improvement, primarily in the gross margin and overhead area."

So obviously this is something that is near and dear to my heart. But our first priority was to really get U.S. focus, which we are now beginning to get traction. So we're telling more of our attention on that for '21 and beyond. 
I think there is a lot of opportunity. The key is depth, not breadth. We are not into branding drags, which has been the issue in the past as where I think in a lot of places, that the overhead in the international business are higher than U.S. So we've got to get -- it's very fragmented. 
So if you take the U.K., we have many businesses that are in different offices, there's not the synergies. So we've got to get focused. So what we're doing is focusing on sort of top 10 countries and saying how do you get after them and how do we create longer-term a country management system, more of a one-year approach rather than everyone doing their own thing. 
Having said that, the teams have been still doing pretty well. And when you look at the fact that overall, international actually grew pretty well and slightly better than the U.S. in 2020. And when you think about appliances where Latin America is the strongest, it was double-digit growth -- strong double-digit growth in Latin America. 
So it's all positive. I just think there's a lot of opportunity, and we're going to get after it with a very well-articulated strategy. COVID's also made it difficult to get to these countries. But this year, this is one of my big priorities as we go forward."

First is just in the very short term, we've read some reports about the port of Los Angeles having backlog issues. And Chris, I was just wondering if you had any issues given that you import some of your goods from China or your materials in China. Do you have any issues or bottlenecks there? 
And then second, question. Actually, that's on the margins, but looking at it from a different perspective. My take is that the biggest hindrance to your overall margin is how low your margins have been in appliances and cookware specifically? And I know there's been a lot of lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But with new management there, how long do you think it will be until that specific segment can firmly be in double digits from an EBIT margin perspective?"

We do import a significant amount of containers through the port of Los Angeles from Asia and primarily China. That has been a backlog and a source of supply disruption for us. 
So earlier in the pandemic, as I mentioned, in the second quarter of last year, it was about our manufacturing facilities and our distribution facilities. Now the disruption is more related to that port. We are getting products through there. We're also shipping through other ports on the East Coast and other places in the West Coast. 
The prices for containers have gone up dramatically. We are a large-scale importer from a volume standpoint. That gives us some advantage in the marketplace because we have contractual commitments for volume and pricing that I think advantages us versus many of our smaller competitors. So we don't see it as a major headwind for the quarter or for the year, but it is something we're sort of battling every day as we go along here."

So look, yes, we recognize that the Appliance business, we need to work on the margin structure here. There's no question. So the big issue is gross margins. And part of the issue for us is we deal with sort of the OPP and FPP segments. And so we've got to get more innovations out, which then can be at high gross margins. 
The good news is when you look at our brands, which are more premium outside of the United States, like Breville in Europe or Oster in Latin America. The gross margins outside of the U.S. are actually quite good. So what the charge -- Chris often say, we've got to get that gross margin up over the next several years. 
And also, as we get out of these scale businesses, some of these we are finding were gross margin-negative so we really need to get out, if you are giving out sort of dollar bills with some things. It's no good. So we're being very hard headed about looking at these categories. And while in the sharp down, that might have a little revenue shortfall. It's okay. We need to get the margins up.

And I think when you look at that and you look at the -- like if you were to look at our 2-year stack growth rates, returned positive on a 2-year stack basis in Q3. We were positive on Q4, we're guiding positive on Q1, and we're guiding positive for all of 2021. 
If you look specifically at the categories, I think the categories -- the category that has been most negatively impacted, as we've talked, has been Writing because of the schools and office closures. But as Ravi mentioned in the prepared remarks and as we alluded to on the Q&A, we are exiting 2020 in a very good position from a retail inventory perspective. And we expect the Writing business to be back to growth in 2021 starting in the first quarter. So I don't think we're seeing categories that we're expecting to have declines heading into 2021."

A very hearty good morning, everybody, and welcome to our call. I am pleased and honored to share the highlights of our phenomenal first quarter results as we carry forward the strong momentum from the back half of 2020. 
The top line grew an outstanding 21% as normalized operating profit doubled and normalized earnings per share tripled versus last year. This is the third consecutive quarter of core sales growth for the company and by far, the best result yet. Even on a 2-year stacked basis, gross sales grew in the mid-teens. I'm particularly encouraged that the first quarter growth was in all 8 businesses, all 4 regions and all channels. Importantly, the collective power of our iconic brands is evident in this performance with top 18 out of 20 brands, demonstrating growth with Oster, Yankee Candle, Coleman, Rubbermaid and Dymo leading the pack. While top line strength was truly broad-based as 7 out of 8 business units grew sales at double-digit rates. Home Fragrances and home appliances businesses stole the show. 
We were also really pleased to see that the Writing business is moving past the pandemic-related woes, as more schools open up for in-person learning. The business returned to strong core sales growth in the first quarter, mirroring the levels of the company. 
All 4 geographic regions grew core sales at a double-digit rate with international markets up nearly 27%, continuing to outpace North America. 
In the U.S., we experienced strong consumer demand throughout the first quarter with acceleration in the last month. We started to lap initial lockdowns from 2020 in mid-March and also saw a lift in demand following the passage of fiscal stimulus. Shoppers continue to seek out home-centric products as well as those that favor personal well-being and outdoor activities. 
With the gradual reopening of the economy, we're also seeing an uptick across some categories such as Writing, that have been disproportionately hit by the pandemic. We expect continued evolution of consumer behavior throughout this year as vaccination rate and mobility improved. At the same time, we believe many of the new habits consumers formed will persist beyond the pandemic. Example, at-home cooking. We expect the shift towards online shopping to have a lasting impact on consumption trends. 
Newell's e-commerce sales growth accelerated into the mid-40s range during the first quarter, as global sales penetration improved about 4 percentage points versus last year to approximately 21%. 
While sustained growth in the digital business paves the way for such a strong top line outcome in Q1, sales trends were also healthy across other channels as we started to lap year-ago lockdowns in mid-March and mobility improved, particularly in the U.S. 
E-commerce is a notable competitive advantage and an engine for growth for Newell Brands. I am thrilled to share that we have recently firmed a critical role in this area as we appointed [ Mike Gerra ] as President of E-commerce and Digital. He joined us from PepsiCo where he served as Senior Vice President, E-commerce, Marketing, Technology and Data Science. Prior to that, Mike spent 10 years in Amazon. With extensive e-commerce expertise, his technology prowess, data science and analytics capabilities is entrepreneurial zeal and intellectual curiosity, Mike will build on Newell's strong e-commerce foundation to make us a digital powerhouse and an omni leader. 
I am pleased to report that the leadership team now is complete. We've built a team that is best in class, diverse in thinking and unified and strategic direction and will pave the way for lasting success. The strength of the first quarter results reflects the progress we're making on the execution front, strengthening our brands, scaling innovations, increasing distribution, improving customer relationships, leveraging consumer trends as well as macro tailwinds. A common theme in this quarter was the broad base strength in consumption. Core sales growth across the entire portfolio, share gains in several categories and regions and strength in international. 
The Home Fragrance business delivered phenomenal results in the first quarter as consumption growth accelerated to about double the levels from the back half of 2020. In fact, this was by far our fastest-growing business, built from a core sales and POS perspectives, a reflection of pent-up demand following supply constraints in 2020. 
Consumers continue to seek our moments of serenity in their homes as they adopt a more holistic approach to well-being. We drove core sales growth more than double the rate of the overall company. To put it in perspective, Home Fragrance grew net sales at a double-digit rate both versus 2020 and 2019 despite closure of about 150 stores during this time frame and last year's exit from the fundraising business. We are successfully managing the purposeful transition of our business as we pivot towards expanding distribution across traditional, retail and direct-to-consumer channels while reducing our Yankee Candle retail store footprint. 
We're driving strong growth in our direct-to-consumer channel through personalization and loyalty programs that are maximizing lifetime customer value. Our recent launch of Yankee Candle Signature Collection, the most meaningful redesign of the Yankee line in years, is gaining traction. We're not just focused on winning in candles. We're gaining share in tracked channels, but also within the overall Home Fragrance category with an exciting pipeline of new products planned across. The sleep diffuser, wax molds, [ our wreaths ] and scented categories 
The Food business, which now includes [ Gallon ] cookware and cutlery, maintained a strong growth momentum as sales increased in the 20s, with a large portion of meal still prepared and eaten in the home. It is not surprising that consumption has remained strong, particularly in the food storage and fresh preserving categories. 
I am delighted to share that early in April, Rubbermaid was named the most trusted food storage brand in New Suite Magazine. What an honor. We've driven strong share gains from Rubbermaid and are seeing solid traction on the Brilliance Glass and Triton Food and pantry storage line. 
We continue to drive elevated demand for our canning business, where we also built on our leading share position with Ball leading the way. Heightened consumer interest in gardening bodes well for continuation of this trend, and we are continuing to bring new innovation and new users to the market. In the first quarter, Ball launched [ nesting gas ], the stack together, which helps make storage more compact and will reduce the amount of space needed for mason jars by 30%. 
FoodSaver continues to do well. Our VS3000 innovation launched in July 2020, as already sold 350,000 units and is moving the needle. 
Home Appliances delivered its strongest performance yet. Sales grew 38% with double-digit increases across all 4 regions as the category remained quite buoyant. In the U.S., double-digit growth in consumption was evident across [indiscernible] subcategories, including seated cooking, blending, coffee, pain management and app purifiers as stimulus provided additional fuel. Despite the lockdowns, Latin America posted very strong results across all countries with Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Peru being the standouts. Similar consumer trends play out in Asia Pacific and EMEA, where we saw broad-based sales growth. During the first quarter, we continued to build on the terrific fall 2020 launch of Mr. Coffee iced coffee maker by expanding its distribution with additional rollout plans in place for balance of the year as capacity comes online to meet demand. It's quickly becoming the #1 selling coffee SKU in relevant retailers where the product is available. I'm pleased that this is another innovation that's gaining traction. 
Just last week, Crock Pot, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, was recognized as the most trusted local brand in Newsweek. Another exciting news, NPD Mexico, awarded Oster as the winner of 2020 market share growth in the Kitchen Electronics segment. 
In the first quarter, our Writing business rebounded nicely as core sales grew at a strong double-digit rate with broad-based growth across writing and creating expressions, labeling and fine writing businesses. We're finally beginning to put the 2020 pandemic-related disruption on this business in the rearview mirror. While the category also returned to growth in the U.S. in the first quarter, Newell's consumption grew at approximately double the rate of the market in the segments we compete as we gain meaningful share. Dymo captured over 400 basis points of incremental share, while our share in gel pens increased by more than 1,300 basis points on the heels of the successful year-ago launch of Sharpie S-Gel. Sharpie S-Gel has become a needle mover with excellent gross margin. The fourth quarter expansion of Sharpie S-Gel platform through Sharpie S-Gel fashion barrels and cross blue and pearl white as well as Sharpie S-Gel metal barrels and gum metal and champagne are off to a promising start and already are among our top selling pens. 
The rebound in our Writing business as well as the category is driven by the return of nearly 60% of school districts to in-person learning and cycling against the onset of the pandemic. 
Similar dynamics played out in the U.K. and Australia and New Zealand where our consumption growth significantly outpaced the market. Although admittedly, there's still a fair amount of uncertainty surrounding the timing of return to normalcy in schools and offices. We're excited about the prospects for the Writing business this year. And together with our retail partners, are planning for a normal Back-to-School season. We continue to assume that offices may remain in a hybrid model for the balance of the year. 
Sales growth for our Baby business accelerated to mid-teens rate in the first quarter as we experienced a significant uptick in consumption levels across our baby gear and baby care categories. The strong outcome was driven by a combination of healthy share gains by Graco [ Nuke ] in the U.S., stimulus funding as well as cycling against comparatively depressed consumption levels in March 2020 as lockdowns were implemented. This team is knocking it out of the park with fantastic e-commerce penetration of more than 50% of global sales in the first quarter, up more than 700 basis points versus last year. Both Graco Nuke continue to bring news to the market in Q1 through launches such as Graco Slim Fit 3, a 3-in-1 car seat, and Nuke's pacifiers in EMEA. I'm also pleased to announce a new addition to our Baby portfolio with the launch of Century, a sustainable and stylish baby brand for young families. 
Q1 was another strong quarter for the commercial business unit as low double-digit sales growth reflected sustained momentum in many consumer-facing categories such as outdoor and garage, organization, gloves and home cleaning. Consumers continue to direct discretionary spending towards home improvement projects, with home still being their hub. We're beginning to see traction in commercial demand for some of our products such as cleaning carts, step-on containers and professional gloves. However, lockdowns along with slow global reopening and back-to-office is still a limiting factor in commercial categories, particularly within the foodservice, travel and entertainment and hospitality verticals as well as in washroom solutions. With good momentum on recent launches, such as Rubbermaid easy install shed, deck boxes and wheel brew as well as a robust innovation pipeline, we think commercial is very well positioned going forward. 
The Connected Home & Security business delivered double-digit growth. The team is making considerable progress on our complete innovation overhaul of their smoke alarm product line as part of UL 217 through advanced technology. This team leads in IoT and has made huge advances in automation in their Wares plant. 
Similar to the rest of our business units, Outdoor & Recreation started off 2021 on a solid note as sales increased at a high single-digit rate, reflecting growth in the outdoor equipment business with particular strength in the international regions. In the U.S., consumption accelerated versus the second half of 2020, driven by broad-based demand across most of our growing equipment categories such as coolers, tents and stoves. Consumers are tired of being cooped up inside and have seen the call of the doors. Although core sales were still under pressure, consumption for technical apparel turned positive during the first quarter. We expect the beverage business to rebound as the on-the-go activities pick up and more schools reopen. While still early days, we are seeing traction from the recent introduction of 3 new product lines in Contigo's hydration portfolio. Coleman continues to bring news to the market with an exciting assortment of new products launched in the first quarter, including Sky on tent expansion, expand soft cooler collection and the reunion steel-belted cooler collection. 
While the first quarter results came in ahead of our expectations, and Chris will explain the key reasons, we contended with a fair amount of challenges as well, including port congestion, the impact of Texas storms on raw material availability, a significant rise in inflationary costs, freight challenges as well as demand spikes across many categories. Our supply chain teams are [ appointed ] with excellence through these turbulent conditions and successfully managed broad-based demand surges. 
Looking out into the remainder of 2021 and beyond, we're laser-focused on building on the solid momentum in the business as our turnaround continues to gain traction. There's no change in the 5 strategic priorities that I laid out last quarter, which include. First, galvanize our employees behind our purpose to create a consumer-obsessed, customer-focused organization that is digital savvy and committed to providing moments of joy and peace of mind to consumers. 
Second, sustained top line growth by focusing on the end-to-end consumer journey, securing new distribution across channels, especially food dollar and home centers, strengthening omnichannel capabilities while accelerating online penetration and focusing on scaling and modernizing our top brands. We will also strengthen efforts to improve supply availability to improve customer service levels through a strong focus on forecast accuracy. 
Third, become an innovation engine by sharpening our focus on consumer insights and trends, and implementing an entire innovation operating model and building cross-business unit technology platforms. A distinguishing aspect of our global forward innovation efforts is that in addition to our normal line extensions, refreshes and renovations, we will strive to launch 3 to 5 major needle mover, new product innovations per year that can be scaled to $50 million to $100 million in sales and have strong gross margins. Sharp, FoodSaver VS 3000 and Mr. Coffee Ice are illustrative of this thinking. 
Fourth, accelerate international growth and improve profitability. And fifth, continue to make progress on reducing complexity, controlling overheads and strengthening the balance sheet. And in particular, for 2021, offsetting the significant search in raw material inflation as well as labor and freight costs through a combination of productivity improvements and selective price increases. 
We're still in the early stages of realizing the full potential of our business and see tremendous opportunity for value creation through focused execution of our strategic priorities and serving as a force for good in the world. We feel good about the last 3 quarters and are confident about the second quarter 2021 as we see sales and consumption momentum continuing in April. The second half of 2021 is difficult to predict, given global uncertainties around COVID and evolving consumer habits. Nevertheless, we're optimistic and see more upside than downside. 
I'd like to conclude by thanking our 31,000 employees for their commitment, hard work and perseverance, all of which made it possible to deliver such an incredibly strong outcome, onwards and upwards. 
And now, I'll turn over the call to my partner in crime, the $1 billion man, efficiency guru and complexity reductions czar, one and only, Chris Peterson."
291703,711080339,2264998,"Newell Brands Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Newell Brands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results were simply outstanding as the integrated set of strategies we put in place 2 years ago are driving accelerated financial results across all metrics. Before getting into the details, I want",1692,"Thanks, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results were simply outstanding as the integrated set of strategies we put in place 2 years ago are driving accelerated financial results across all metrics. 
Before getting into the details, I want to provide a little color on the current operating environment and proactive choices we are making. We are off to a much stronger-than-anticipated top line start in 2021. With healthy consumer demand early in the year, we expected and guided for a strong outcome during the first quarter as a result of the strategic improvements we have made to drive profitable top line growth as part of our turnaround plan. 
Three factors contributed to over delivery relative to our expectations. First, the U.S. stimulus package, which passed in March, turbocharged already robust demand across many of our categories. Second, the vaccination rate across the U.S. has been faster than anticipated, which led to more schools reopening their doors to in-person learning. And finally, operational improvements we have been driving across the company, particularly surrounding SKU count reduction, operating efficiency and the S&OP demand planning process are paying big dividends. 
Earlier this year, we made the proactive choice to invest in higher inventory levels on our top-selling SKUs. Because of the operating improvements we made, we were able to add capacity without incurring any significant capital expenditures. This allowed us to both meet the surge in consumer demand during Q1 and build inventory levels to support an improved top line outlook for Q2 and the balance of the year. 
Effectively, we have created more agility within our supply chain to respond to shifts in demand with the hard work from the past 2-plus years, clearly paying off. 
The other changing dynamic has been inflationary pressure as the recent run-up in costs, particularly in resin, transportation, source finished goods and labor has translated into approximately $150 million of additional expenses in 2021 for a total gross impact of about $360 million. We plan to mitigate these headwinds through a combination of strong productivity savings, driven by our FUEL program, operating leverage from the combination of strong revenue growth and tight cost controls and selective pricing actions across businesses that are most impacted by inflationary pressure. The net result is that we are maintaining our operating margin expansion outlook for the year. 
In the U.S., we announced price increases in mid-April across 5 of our business units, including Food, commercial, outdoor and recreation, Baby and Home Appliances, which are expected to go into effect in June. These pricing actions do not fully offset the inflationary cost pressure as we were using productivity savings and operating leverage as offsets as well. 
Now turning to first quarter results. Newell Brands' net sales increased 21.3% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, driven by core sales growth of 20.9%. The foreign exchange more than offset the unfavorable impact from business and Yankee retail store exits. This was the third consecutive quarter of core sales growth for the company. 
Growth was broad-based with each of our 8 business units and 4 geographic regions growing on a year-over-year basis. Importantly, core sales grew compared to both 2020 and 2019 levels. 
Normalized gross margin contracted 60 basis points year-over-year to 32.2% as fuel productivity savings and pricing were more than offset by significant inflationary pressure, particularly in resin, transportation and labor costs. Normalized operating margin expanded 410 basis points year-over-year to 10.1% with a better-than-expected outcome driven by operating leverage resulting from strong top line results, higher-than-anticipated fuel productivity savings and tight overhead cost controls. Normalized operating profit roughly doubled year-over-year to $230 million. 
Net interest expense increased by $4 million year-over-year to $67 million. The normalized tax rate was 22.4% above the year-ago level of 7.1% as the company realized discrete tax benefits last year. We grew Q1 normalized diluted earnings per share more than 3x year-over-year to $0.30. Stronger-than-anticipated top line results and resulting operating leverage, in addition to disciplined cost management and productivity, enables us to exceed our expectations. 
Let's turn to our segments. Core sales for Home Appliances increased 38.9%, driven by growth in all major regions. This was the first quarter without contribution from the Calphalon cookware business. As a reminder, cookware financial and operating results are now included in the Food business within the Home Solutions segment. 
Core sales growth for the Commercial Solutions segment increased 12.9% with double-digit increases across both the Commercial and the Connected Home & Security business units. 
Core sales for the Home Solutions segment increased 33.8% driven by double-digit growth across both the Food and Home Fragrance business units. 
The Learning & Development segment increased core sales 17.3%, a strong rebound, which reflected double-digit increases across both the Writing and Baby business units. 
The Outdoor & Recreation segment also returned to core sales growth, increasing 7.0%. 
Operating cash flow was $25 million -- operating cash outflow was $25 million during the seasonally small quarter, reflecting an increase in working capital to support consumer demand increases both in Q1 and Q2. Importantly, 2021 is off to a strong start on the cash conversion cycle as we shortened it by about 13 days versus last year. 
We continue to strengthen our balance sheet during the first quarter as the company's net debt-to-normalized EBITDA leverage ratio moved down to 3.3x, which is a 0.2 point improvement relative to year-end 2020 and a 0.9 point reduction versus the year-ago period. We are steadily marching toward our leverage target of 3x and expect debt paydown as well as EBITDA growth to contribute to this outcome. For perspective, in Q1, normalized EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis increased about 10% compared to last quarter. 
During the first quarter, the company redeemed the remaining $94 million of its 3.15% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in April 2021, and repurchased $5 million of its 3.85% senior notes due 2023. We remain in a very strong liquidity position with over $2 billion in available short-term liquidity, including $682 million of cash on the balance sheet. 
Let me provide some context for our underlying assumptions for the balance of the year and how they've evolved since February. The macro backdrop remains quite dynamic, both as it relates to the pandemic as well as input cost fluctuations. While we are optimistic about progress on vaccine rollout and the impact of the latest U.S. stimulus on the consumer, uncertainty remains, particularly in the back half of the year where comparisons are tougher. With stronger-than-anticipated momentum in the business in the first quarter and thus far, in Q2, a as well as improved capabilities within our supply chain to address demand spikes, we are pleased to raise our full year outlook on top line. We continue to expect a stronger first half relative to the second half. 
In the first quarter, core sales grew not just on a year-over-year basis but relative to 2019 as well. On a similar note, our updated outlook implies that core sales will be up versus 2020 and 2019 in both Q2 and for the full year. For the back half of 2021, we expect core sales to be up versus 2019 levels. 
Here are the specifics on our outlook. For the full year 2021, we are raising our net sales forecast by approximately $400 million to $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion, which represents 5% to 8% growth versus last year. We now forecast core sales growth of 5% to 7%, up from our prior assumption of low single-digit growth. Although currency has gotten slightly less favorable relative to a few months ago, we continue to expect it to remain a tailwind and more than offset the unfavorable impact from closure of Yankee Candle retail stores and other minor business exits. 
Despite the meaningful uptick in inflation, we are still planning for normalized operating margin expansion of 30 to 60 basis points year-over-year to 11.4% to 11.7%. We expect the combination of productivity, pricing, overhead savings and incremental volume leverage as a result of better top line growth to more than cover the increase in inflationary pressure. 
We are still planning for higher advertising and promotion spending relative to year-ago levels to support a strengthening innovation pipeline as well as our digital initiatives. 
There is no change in our assumption of a high-teens effective tax rate. We are not factoring in any potential changes in the U.S. corporate tax rate policy at this time. Our normalized earnings per share outlook moves up $0.08 to $1.63 to $1.73. Share count is still expected to be up slightly versus 2020. 
Our operating cash flow outlook for the year remains strong and unchanged at approximately $1 billion driven by continued reduction in Newell's cash conversion cycle. 
Q2 is off to a strong start, and we are planning for net sales of $2.5 billion to $2.58 billion, which implies 18% to 22% growth year-over-year. Core sales are expected to increase 17% to 20% as we lap a 12.6% decline from a year ago. As a reminder, in Q2, we are cycling against the most significant disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Currency should be a tailwind, helping to mitigate the impact from Yankee Candle store footprint rationalization and minor business exits. 
Our outlook for the second quarter reflects normalized operating margin expansion of 130 to 180 basis points year-over-year to 11.5% to 12.0% as volume leverage, in combination with productivity savings, should more than offset the inflationary pressures as well as planned increases in advertising and promotional spending. This outlook assumes that the normalized effective tax rate is in the high teens for Q2, with normalized earnings per share in the $0.41 to $0.45 range as compared to $0.30 in the year-ago period. 
We are energized by the overwhelming progress our teams are driving on the turnaround plan. We continue to take decisive strategic actions to improve the appeal of our brands and products and upgrade our operating effectiveness and efficiency. Despite the disruption and volatility in the macros, we have not wavered from our strategic imperatives, which has put us on a much stronger footing.

But Chris, I was a little bit surprised you didn't raise the outlook for our operating cash flow. That's the only metric that it looks like you didn't bump up, and I'm surprised by that. So just a question of are you making any incremental investments in working capital? Or is there some other headwind that's incremental that we should be aware of? 
And then, Ravi, just on the Writing business, obviously, easy comps to last year. I'm just wondering when you expect to see orders, is it the second quarter? Is it the third quarter?

We started seeing a little bit in the last few months in consumption in Writing. And inventory levels were quite low as we ended the year. And it is great to see now both consumption and our own sales going up. The decisive improvement on market share is very exciting. 
Let me give you 3 sort of statistics to think about, which make us optimistic. Number one, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, 61% of school districts are now back in person. Now that doesn't mean all the students are back, and that number is probably closer to 47% of K-12. And then, if you look at K-5, it's actually in excess of 70%. And as you know, the CDC just came out to say, in classrooms, the social distancing could be like 3P. That's making it easier for schools and as teachers are getting vaccinated, I think that's all boding well. There are some big school districts left but we're waiting to see the swing, California and New York. And so I think, look, we're planning right now a normal Back-to-School season. We've talked to all our retailers. They're certainly planning for that. 
And one thing to note, despite the fact that the whole office side is still on hybrid way, even the total channel of office very modestly grew in the first quarter. So that's a little encouraging. And so the only one that, for us, when we look at Writing, we've got 3 really big pieces of business Back-to-School or school, K-12, universities and then offices. I think we're quite confident on the schools front, getting more confident about universities. The big question mark, and that's a portion of our business is the offices at least this year. But with the innovations that we're driving, the market share that we're getting and don't forget, this business is not just U.S., it's global. And it goes beyond sort of everyday writing. When you look at Dymo. The market share gains we're making in Europe, in the U.S., the consumption increases and sales increases we're getting. I really think this Writing business is our [indiscernible]. And when I said in my prepared remarks, there's probably more upside than downside. To me, Writing is really that one. And it's a very well-managed business. That team is just outstanding. So I feel very good overall. And let's not forget the brilliant gross margins of this business."

To me, the candid answer is it's work in progress because there are 3 different businesses within Outdoor & Recreation. There's the outdoor equipment, the largest business, and that is really doing well. The Coleman brand, [ Jim Pisani and Bill Kush ] are really doing a great job turning it around. We're seeing also real tailwinds in the sense of 10 million more campers just in the U.S. You're seeing minority groups getting into camping that they didn't in the past. And our business in Japan and Asia Pacific is doing extremely well. Lot of innovations now. We're catching up with the tents, the dome tents and the great cooler line that we got last year. Now, we've got some soft cooler refreshes and the steel belted cooler. So quite positive about the outdoor equipment side. And so that -- and that's the big piece of the business. 
So there are 2 other businesses for us, and that is the beverage business, which is Contigo and Bawa. And this business did not get helped. In fact, it was headwind with the pandemic because it's an on-the-go business. And so it did suffer. And we have fallen behind a little bit on innovation. But we're turning the corner. We've got a new team on this. They are better understanding, [ the insights ]. We've just launched 3 new lines of hydration, esthetically much better, much better on the key points of spill-proof. and temperature control and those, I think, will give us headwinds. We're already seeing some upticks in April. So I feel quite positive about the future of beverages. And Baba has always been a good brand, and that's doing well. So -- and we're being -- look, the -- it's always had good distribution. 
The third business, which is Marmot and [ Exito ], our technical apparel business, that has struggled, but we've got a whole new team in place, and Jim has brought in some great people who have put in merchants, they have revamped the line. So towards the tail end of the year, I think we'll start really seeing some improvements. Already, this year, we started -- in the quarter, we started seeing a minor uptick on consumption. Marmot.com actually had a terrific quarter. So I do feel that's work in progress. 
So overall, when you look at the 3, I still -- it is -- it's not the same place that say a Food is. But I really think this team, we've got a great team. As you know, Jim came from Timberland, really understands this. He's brought in terrific players. So confident that by the end of this year, we'll have this business coming to."

So let's take appliances. this is -- look, I'm really pleased with the new team. They're making good progress. There's no question probably of all our businesses, the stimulus helped this business the most, just given the nature of the products and the price points and so on. Having said that, that was more in the U.S. because the strength of this business was really international, which had just an incredible -- because while we were slightly above expectations on the U.S. side, it was really -- the team hit the ball out of the park internationally. When I said standouts in Colombia, in Chile, Peru, Brazil, those were just huge, huge numbers. And because despite lockdowns and so on, that team created a real direct-to-consumer business, and that has just gained huge momentum. In Latin America, the team did take a price increase. So that's obviously to your question about volume price mix, that helped a bit in Latin America. But in EMEA and Asia Pacific -- in Asia Pacific, in Australia, we were doing SAP. So you saw a little bit of pull forward for SAP in Australia. But on the whole, I'd say it was a very good international performance in U.S. Don't forget, we now have good innovations coming out like the ice coffee. 
And your question about how do you sustain? Well, we're now putting out a full ice coffee line with frappe and so on coming out in the rest of the year. We still are just gaining distribution. Remember, last year, we were just in one retailer. And now we're going in and already everyone is clamoring to get it. So the issue for us is getting the supply going on there. So I think that is the appliance story. 
Chris, is there -- are there things you want to add? And then I'll come back and hit Baby?"

So -- and this performance is just indicative that they're getting momentum. 
On Baby, look, the perennial question is birth rates, right? So a couple of things. You still have immigration that's helping. And then when you look at in the U.S. But when you look at like kids 1 to 4 and so on, that stayed pretty steady. So a lot of our products are not just for the infant side, but really are more on the gear side. And so we progress through the life cycle of Baby becoming child and so on. So I think that helps us. 
Second, the power of the Graco brand is just fantastic. I mean, this is a leader. It's gaining share. The innovations -- this team really -- that's 3-in-1 car, the slim fit, just great idea, but there are so many innovations coming out.

In terms of the supply chain, we continue to be operating in a very disruptive environment because of container shortages coming from Asia, port congestion, trucking shortages. We are struggling in some locations to recruit labor to our plants. 
That being said, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we made a proactive choice earlier this year to build more inventory and invest more in inventory in our top-selling SKUs. And we factored those disruptions into our supply chain in plan. And so although our teams are still dealing with day-to-day disruption in a number of areas of the supply chain, we are in a dramatically better position today than we were 6 months ago or 9 months ago. 
We do expect it to be a difficult supply operating environment for the rest of the year. But we are very confident. And I think you've seen the results that we've been able to demonstrate by supplying the surge in core sales growth in Q1. Also, if you look at our balance sheet, we've built significant inventory in Q1 so that we are in a very strong position to be able to supply and take up our guidance for the year and for Q2 versus our initial expectations.

I think we haven't said what we plan to do after that point. I think we've been so focused on getting to that point that we have a little bit of time still ahead of us.

So Baby, clearly gaining share. So I think -- and then this is not just overall share, but we also track how do we do on Amazon and stuff and there clearly, we're gaining care. 
There are some businesses that are going to be tougher, like appliances because of the -- where a lot of our businesses are opening price point. So we may gain on units, but maybe not on dollars because there are a lot of brands that are very premium price. So that may be tougher.

And on the margin side, what I would say is that certainly, we're seeing significant inflationary pressures, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. It's about $150 million worse than what we thought when we talked last in February. That means it's a headwind for this year of about $360 million, which is roughly 350 basis points on the gross margin line of inflationary pressure. 
We are offsetting that with fuel productivity savings, which are -- we're making incredibly strong progress on. We are, as I mentioned, are implementing pricing, not fully to offset inflation, but across the categories that are the most impacted by inflation. And then we're driving operating leverage through strong top line growth and tight cost control. 
We don't guide on specifically what the outcome is for gross margin. But we do guide for operating margin, and we expect the combination of those 4 factors to result in us driving operating margin up for the year by 30 to 60 basis points. And that compares to last year where we grew operating margin as well. If you recall, when we started the turnaround plan, in 2018, our operating margin was 9.1% reported. And this year, we're guiding to 11.4% to 11.7%. Our 30 to 60 basis point guidance for this year is very much in line with our Evergreen model despite the significant inflationary pressure. And so the underlying progress that we're making is even stronger if you were to look sort of underneath the covers in terms of the progress from an operating efficiency and effectiveness standpoint across the company."

You raised the full year by about $0.08, even with a better top line, which implies that some of the cost pressures that you're seeing, the $150 million or so of incremental cost pressures you called out this morning, may not be fully offset. So how should we think about that in the second half of the year?"

The biggest difference of why we didn't flow the full over delivery in Q1 through to the full year is because of the inflationary pressure. And obviously, there's a timing difference between the inflationary pressure and the impact of pricing, which really impacts the back half of the year. 
What I would say, though, is that if you look at the full year result, we're still very pleased with the progress we're making because if you look at the first half, we're going to be up versus -- on top line, up versus prior year and up versus '19. If you look at the back half, we're going to be up versus '19. And if you look at the margin progress we're making, we're very much in line with our Evergreen model. And if you were to look at the core EPS growth on a tax-adjusted basis, our guidance is for very strong growth versus prior year-end versus 2 years ago."

A very hearty good morning, everybody, and welcome to our call. I am pleased and honored to share the highlights of our phenomenal first quarter results as we carry forward the strong momentum from the back half of 2020.  
The top line grew an outstanding 21% as normalized operating profit doubled and normalized earnings per share tripled versus last year. This is the third consecutive quarter of core sales growth for the company and by far, the best result yet. Even on a 2-year stacked basis, gross sales grew in the mid-teens. I'm particularly encouraged that the first quarter growth was in all 8 businesses, all 4 regions and all channels. Importantly, the collective power of our iconic brands is evident in this performance with top 18 out of 20 brands, demonstrating growth with Oster, Yankee Candle, Coleman, Rubbermaid and Dymo leading the pack. While top line strength was truly broad-based as 7 out of 8 business units grew sales at double-digit rates. Home Fragrances and Home Appliances businesses stole the show.  
We were also really pleased to see that the Writing business is moving past the pandemic-related woes, as more schools open up for in-person learning. The business returned to strong core sales growth in the first quarter, mirroring the levels of the company.  
All 4 geographic regions grew core sales at a double-digit rate with international markets up nearly 27%, continuing to outpace North America.  
In the U.S., we experienced strong consumer demand throughout the first quarter with acceleration in the last month. We started to lap initial lockdowns from 2020 in mid-March and also saw a lift in demand following the passage of fiscal stimulus.  
Shoppers continue to seek out home-centric products as well as those that favor personal well-being and outdoor activities. With the gradual reopening of the economy, we're also seeing an uptick across some categories such as Writing, that have been disproportionately hit by the pandemic. We expect continued evolution of consumer behavior throughout this year as vaccination rates and mobility improve. At the same time, we believe many of the new habits consumers formed will persist beyond the pandemic.  
Example, at-home cooking. We expect the shift towards online shopping to have a lasting impact on consumption trends.  
Newell's e-commerce sales growth accelerated into the mid-40s range during the first quarter, as global sales penetration improved about 4 percentage points versus last year to approximately 21%.  
While sustained growth in the digital business paved the way for such a strong top line outcome in Q1, sales trends were also healthy across other channels as we started to lap year-ago lockdowns in mid-March and mobility improved, particularly in the U.S.  
E-commerce is a notable competitive advantage and an engine for growth for Newell Brands. I am thrilled to share that we have recently filled a critical role in this area as we appointed Mike Geller as President of E-commerce & Digital. He joined us from PepsiCo where he served as Senior Vice President, E-commerce, Marketing, Technology and Data Science. Prior to that, Mike spent 10 years at Amazon. With extensive e-commerce expertise, his technology prowess, data science and analytics capabilities, his entrepreneurial zeal and intellectual curiosity, Mike will build on Newell's strong e-commerce foundation to make us a digital powerhouse and an omni leader.  
I am pleased to report that the leadership team now is complete. We've built a team that is best in class, diverse in thinking and unified in strategic direction and will pave the way for lasting success. The strength of the first quarter results reflects the progress we're making on the execution front, strengthening our brands, scaling innovations, increasing distribution, improving customer relationships, leveraging consumer trends as well as macro tailwinds. The common theme in this quarter was the broad-based strength in consumption, core sales growth across the entire portfolio, share gains in several categories and regions and strength in international.  
The Home Fragrance business delivered phenomenal results in the first quarter as consumption growth accelerated to about double the levels from the back half of 2020. In fact, this was by far our fastest-growing business, built from a core sales and POS perspectives, a reflection of pent-up demand following supply constraints in 2020.  
Consumers continue to seek out moments of serenity in their homes as they adopt a more holistic approach to well-being. We drove core sales growth more than double the rate of the overall company. To put it in perspective, Home Fragrance grew net sales at a double-digit rate both versus 2020 and 2019 despite closure of about 150 stores during this time frame and last year's exit from the fundraising business.  
We are successfully managing the purposeful transition of our business as we pivot towards expanding distribution across traditional, retail and direct-to-consumer channels while reducing our Yankee Candle retail store footprint.  
We're driving strong growth in our direct-to-consumer channel through personalization and loyalty programs that are maximizing lifetime customer value. Our recent launch of Yankee Candle Signature Collection, the most meaningful redesign of the Yankee line in years, is gaining traction. We're not just focused on winning in candles. We're gaining share in tracked channels, but also within the overall Home Fragrance category with an exciting pipeline of new products planned across, the sleep diffuser, wax melts, autumn wreaths and ScentPlug categories. 
The Food business, which now includes Calphalon cookware and cutlery, maintained a strong growth momentum as sales increased in the 20s, with a large portion of meals still prepared and eaten in the home. It is not surprising that consumption has remained strong, particularly in the food storage and fresh-preserving categories. I am delighted to share that early in April, Rubbermaid was named the most trusted food storage brand in Newsweek magazine. What an honor. We've driven strong share gains from Rubbermaid and are seeing solid traction on the Brilliance Glass and [ Triton ] food and pantry storage line.  
We continue to drive elevated demand for our canning business, where we also built on our leading share position with Ball leading the way. Heightened consumer interest in gardening bodes well for continuation of this trend, and we are continuing to bring new innovation and new users to the market. In the first quarter, Ball launched nesting jars that stack together, which helps make storage more compact and will reduce the amount of space needed for mason jars by 30%.  
FoodSaver continues to do well. Our VS3000 innovation launched in July 2020 has already sold 350,000 units and is moving the needle.  
Home Appliances delivered its strongest performance yet. Sales grew 38% with double-digit increases across all 4 regions as the category remained quite buoyant. In the U.S., double-digit growth in consumption was evident across most subcategories, including heated cooking, blending, coffee, pain management and air purifiers as stimulus provided additional fuel. Despite the lockdowns, Latin America posted very strong results across all countries with Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Peru being the standouts. Similar consumer trends played out in Asia Pacific and EMEA, where we saw broad-based sales growth. During the first quarter, we continued to build on the terrific fall 2020 launch of Mr. Coffee iced coffee maker by expanding its distribution with additional rollout plans in place for balance of the year as capacity comes online to meet demand. It's quickly becoming the #1 selling coffee SKU in relevant retailers where the product is available. I'm pleased that this is another innovation that's gaining traction.  
Just last week, Crock-Pot, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, was recognized as the most trusted slow cooker brand in Newsweek. In other exciting news, NPD Mexico awarded Oster as the winner of 2020 market share growth in the kitchen electronics segment.  
In the first quarter, our Writing business rebounded nicely as core sales grew at a strong double-digit rate with broad-based growth across writing and creating expressions, labeling and fine writing businesses. We're finally beginning to put the 2020 pandemic-related disruption on this business in the rearview mirror. While the category also returned to growth in the U.S. in the first quarter, Newell's consumption grew at approximately double the rate of the market in the segments we compete as we gain meaningful share. Dymo captured over 400 basis points of incremental share, while our share in gel pens increased by more than 1,300 basis points on the heels of the successful year-ago launch of Sharpie S-Gel. Sharpie S-Gel has become a needle mover with excellent gross margins. The fourth quarter expansion of Sharpie S-Gel platform through Sharpie S-Gel fashion barrels in frost blue and pearl white as well as Sharpie S-Gel metal barrels in gun metal and champagne are off to a promising start and already are among our top selling pens.  
The rebound in our Writing business as well as the category is driven by the return of nearly 60% of school districts to in-person learning and cycling against the onset of the pandemic.  
Similar dynamics played out in the U.K. and Australia and New Zealand where our consumption growth significantly outpaced the market. Although admittedly, there's still a fair amount of uncertainty surrounding the timing of return to normalcy in schools and offices, we're excited about the prospects for the Writing business this year and together with our retail partners are planning for a normal back-to-school season. We continue to assume that offices may remain in a hybrid model for the balance of the year.  
Sales growth for our Baby business accelerated to mid-teens rate in the first quarter as we experienced a significant uptick in consumption levels across our baby gear and baby care categories. The strong outcome was driven by a combination of healthy share gains by Graco and NUK in the U.S., stimulus funding as well as cycling against comparatively depressed consumption levels in March 2020 as lockdowns were implemented. This team is knocking it out of the park with fantastic e-commerce penetration of more than 50% of global sales in the first quarter, up more than 700 basis points versus last year. Both Graco and NUK continue to bring news to the market in Q1 through launches such as Graco SlimFit 3, a 3-in-1 car seat, and NUK Space line of pacifiers in EMEA. I'm also pleased to announce a new addition to our Baby portfolio with the launch of Century, a sustainable and stylish baby brand for young families.  
Q1 was another strong quarter for the commercial business unit as low double-digit sales growth reflected sustained momentum in many consumer-facing categories such as outdoor and garage, organization, gloves and home cleaning. Consumers continue to direct discretionary spending towards home improvement projects, with home still being their hub. We're beginning to see traction in commercial demand for some of our products such as cleaning carts, step-on containers and professional gloves. However, lockdowns along with slow global reopening and back-to-office is still a limiting factor in commercial categories, particularly within the foodservice, travel and entertainment and hospitality verticals as well as in washroom solutions. With good momentum on recent launches, such as Rubbermaid Easy Install 7x7 in sheds, deck boxes and [ Real Brew ] as well as a robust innovation pipeline, we think commercial is very well positioned going forward.  
The Connected Home & Security business delivered double-digit growth. The team is making considerable progress on our complete innovation overhaul of their smoke alarm product line as part of UL 217 through advanced technology. This team leads in IoT and has made huge advances in automation in their Juarez plant.  
Similar to the rest of our business units, Outdoor & Recreation started off 2021 on a solid note as sales increased at a high single-digit rate, reflecting growth in the outdoor equipment business with particular strength in the international regions. In the U.S., consumption accelerated versus the second half of 2020, driven by broad-based demand across most of our growing equipment categories such as coolers, tents and stoves. Consumers are tired of being cooped up inside and have seen the call of the outdoors. Although core sales were still under pressure, consumption for technical apparel turned positive during the first quarter. We expect the beverage business to rebound as the on-the-go activities pick up and more schools reopen. While still early days, we are seeing traction from the recent introduction of 3 new product lines in Contigo's hydration portfolio. Coleman continues to bring news to the market with an exciting assortment of new products launched in the first quarter, including Skydome tent expansion, XPAND soft cooler collection and the Reunion steel-belted cooler collection.  
While the first quarter results came in ahead of our expectations, and Chris will explain the key reasons, we contended with a fair amount of challenges as well, including port congestion, the impact of Texas storms on raw material availability, a significant rise in inflationary costs, freight challenges as well as demand spikes across many categories. Our supply chain teams operated with excellence through these turbulent conditions and successfully managed broad-based demand surges.  
Looking out into the remainder of 2021 and beyond, we're laser-focused on building on the solid momentum in the business as our turnaround continues to gain traction. There's no change in the 5 strategic priorities that I laid out last quarter, which include: first, galvanize our employees behind our purpose to create a consumer-obsessed, customer-focused organization that is digital savvy and committed to providing moments of joy and peace of mind to consumers. 
Second, sustain top line growth by focusing on the end-to-end consumer journey, securing new distribution across channels, especially food, dollar and home centers, strengthening omnichannel capabilities while accelerating online penetration and focusing on scaling and modernizing our top brands.  We will also strengthen efforts to improve supply availability to improve customer service levels through a strong focus on forecast accuracy. 
Third, become an innovation engine by sharpening our focus on consumer insights and trends and implementing an enterprise innovation operating model and building cross-business unit technology platforms. A distinguishing aspect of our go-forward innovation efforts is that in addition to our normal line extensions, refreshes and renovations, we will strive to launch 3 to 5 major needle mover, new product innovations per year that can be scaled to $50 million to $100 million in sales and have strong gross margins. Sharpie S-Gel, FoodSaver VS3000 and Mr. Coffee Ice are illustrative of this thinking. 
Fourth, accelerate international growth and improve profitability. And fifth, continue to make progress on reducing complexity, controlling overheads and strengthening the balance sheet. And in particular, for 2021, offsetting the significant surge in raw material inflation as well as labor and freight costs through a combination of productivity improvements and selective price increases. 
We're still in the early stages of realizing the full potential of our business and see tremendous opportunity for value creation through focused execution of our strategic priorities and serving as a force for good in the world. We feel good about the last 3 quarters and are confident about the second quarter 2021 as we see sales and consumption momentum continuing in April. The second half of 2021 is difficult to predict, given global uncertainties around COVID and evolving consumer habits. Nevertheless, we're optimistic and see more upside than downside. 
I'd like to conclude by thanking our 31,000 employees for their commitment, hard work and perseverance, all of which made it possible to deliver such an incredibly strong outcome, onwards and upwards. 
And now, I'll turn over the call to my partner in crime, the billion-dollar man, efficiency guru and complexity reductions czar, one and only, Chris Peterson."
291703,711080339,2265218,"Newell Brands Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Newell Brands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results were simply outstanding as the integrated set of strategies we put in place 2 years ago are driving accelerated financial results across all metrics. Before getting into the details, I want",1689,"Thanks, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results were simply outstanding as the integrated set of strategies we put in place 2 years ago are driving accelerated financial results across all metrics. 
Before getting into the details, I want to provide a little color on the current operating environment and proactive choices we are making. We are off to a much stronger-than-anticipated top line start in 2021. With healthy consumer demand early in the year, we expected and guided for a strong outcome during the first quarter as a result of the strategic improvements we have made to drive profitable top line growth as part of our turnaround plan. 
Three factors contributed to over-delivery relative to our expectations. First, the U.S. stimulus package, which passed in March, turbocharged already robust demand across many of our categories. Second, the vaccination rate across the U.S. has been faster than anticipated, which led to more schools reopening their doors to in-person learning. And finally, operational improvements we have been driving across the company, particularly surrounding SKU count reduction, operating efficiency and the S&OP demand planning process are paying big dividends. 
Earlier this year, we made the proactive choice to invest in higher inventory levels on our top-selling SKUs. Because of the operating improvements we made, we were able to add capacity without incurring any significant capital expenditures. This allowed us to both meet the surge in consumer demand during Q1 and build inventory levels to support an improved top line outlook for Q2 and the balance of the year. 
Effectively, we have created more agility within our supply chain to respond to shifts in demand with the hard work from the past 2-plus years clearly paying off. 
The other changing dynamic has been inflationary pressure as the recent run-up in costs, particularly in resin, transportation, source finished goods and labor has translated into approximately $150 million of additional expenses in 2021 for a total gross impact of about $360 million. We plan to mitigate these headwinds through a combination of strong productivity savings, driven by our FUEL program, operating leverage from the combination of strong revenue growth and tight cost controls and selective pricing actions across businesses that are most impacted by inflationary pressure. The net result is that we are maintaining our operating margin expansion outlook for the year. 
In the U.S., we announced price increases in mid-April across 5 of our business units, including Food, Commercial, Outdoor & Recreation, Baby and Home Appliances, which are expected to go into effect in June. These pricing actions do not fully offset the inflationary cost pressure as we were using productivity savings and operating leverage as offsets as well. 
Now turning to first quarter results. Newell Brands' net sales increased 21.3% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, driven by core sales growth of 20.9%. Foreign exchange more than offset the unfavorable impact from business and Yankee retail store exits. This was the third consecutive quarter of core sales growth for the company. 
Growth was broad-based with each of our 8 business units and 4 geographic regions growing on a year-over-year basis. Importantly, core sales grew compared to both 2020 and 2019 levels. 
Normalized gross margin contracted 60 basis points year-over-year to 32.2% as fuel productivity savings and pricing were more than offset by significant inflationary pressure, particularly in resin, transportation and labor costs. Normalized operating margin expanded 410 basis points year-over-year to 10.1% with a better-than-expected outcome driven by operating leverage resulting from strong top line results, higher-than-anticipated fuel productivity savings and tight overhead cost controls. Normalized operating profit roughly doubled year-over-year to $230 million. 
Net interest expense increased by $4 million year-over-year to $67 million. The normalized tax rate was 22.4%, above the year-ago level of 7.1% as the company realized discrete tax benefits last year. We grew Q1 normalized diluted earnings per share more than 3x year-over-year to $0.30. Stronger-than-anticipated top line results and resulting operating leverage, in addition to disciplined cost management and productivity, enabled us to exceed our expectations. 
Let's turn to our segments. Core sales for Home Appliances increased 38.9%, driven by growth in all major regions. This was the first quarter without contribution from the Calphalon cookware business. As a reminder, cookware financial and operating results are now included in the Food business within the Home Solutions segment. 
Core sales growth for the Commercial Solutions segment increased 12.9% with double-digit increases across both the Commercial and the Connected Home & Security business units. 
Core sales for the Home Solutions segment increased 33.8% driven by double-digit growth across both the Food and Home Fragrance business units. 
The Learning & Development segment increased core sales 17.3%, a strong rebound, which reflected double-digit increases across both the Writing and Baby business units. 
The Outdoor & Recreation segment also returned to core sales growth, increasing 7.0%. 
Operating cash flow was $25 million -- operating cash outflow was $25 million during the seasonally small quarter, reflecting an increase in working capital to support consumer demand increases both in Q1 and Q2. Importantly, 2021 is off to a strong start on the cash conversion cycle as we shortened it by about 13 days versus last year. 
We continue to strengthen our balance sheet during the first quarter as the company's net debt-to-normalized EBITDA leverage ratio moved down to 3.3x, which is a 0.2 point improvement relative to year-end 2020 and a 0.9 point reduction versus the year-ago period. We are steadily marching toward our leverage target of 3x and expect debt pay-down as well as EBITDA growth to contribute to this outcome. For perspective, in Q1, normalized EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis increased about 10% compared to last quarter. 
During the first quarter, the company redeemed the remaining $94 million of its 3.15% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in April 2021 and repurchased $5 million of its 3.85% senior notes due 2023. We remain in a very strong liquidity position with over $2 billion in available short-term liquidity, including $682 million of cash on the balance sheet. 
Let me provide some context for our underlying assumptions for the balance of the year and how they've evolved since February. The macro backdrop remains quite dynamic, both as it relates to the pandemic as well as input cost fluctuations. While we are optimistic about progress on vaccine rollout and the impact of the latest U.S. stimulus on the consumer, uncertainty remains, particularly in the back half of the year where comparisons are tougher. With stronger-than-anticipated momentum in the business in the first quarter and, thus far, in Q2 as well as improved capabilities within our supply chain to address demand spikes, we are pleased to raise our full year outlook on top line. We continue to expect a stronger first half relative to the second half. 
In the first quarter, core sales grew not just on a year-over-year basis but relative to 2019 as well. On a similar note, our updated outlook implies that core sales will be up versus 2020 and 2019 in both Q2 and for the full year. For the back half of 2021, we expect core sales to be up versus 2019 levels. 
Here are the specifics on our outlook. For the full year 2021, we are raising our net sales forecast by approximately $400 million to $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion, which represents 5% to 8% growth versus last year. We now forecast core sales growth of 5% to 7%, up from our prior assumption of low single-digit growth. Although currency has gotten slightly less favorable relative to a few months ago, we continue to expect it to remain a tailwind and more than offset the unfavorable impact from closure of Yankee Candle retail stores and other minor business exits. 
Despite the meaningful uptick in inflation, we are still planning for normalized operating margin expansion of 30 to 60 basis points year-over-year to 11.4% to 11.7%. We expect the combination of productivity, pricing, overhead savings and incremental volume leverage as a result of better top line growth to more than cover the increase in inflationary pressure. 
We are still planning for higher advertising and promotion spending relative to year-ago levels to support a strengthening innovation pipeline as well as our digital initiatives. 
There is no change in our assumption of a high-teens effective tax rate. We are not factoring in any potential changes in the U.S. corporate tax rate policy at this time. Our normalized earnings per share outlook moves up $0.08 to $1.63 to $1.73. Share count is still expected to be up slightly versus 2020. 
Our operating cash flow outlook for the year remains strong and unchanged at approximately $1 billion driven by continued reduction in Newell's cash conversion cycle. 
Q2 is off to a strong start, and we are planning for net sales of $2.5 billion to $2.58 billion, which implies 18% to 22% growth year-over-year. Core sales are expected to increase 17% to 20% as we lap a 12.6% decline from a year ago. As a reminder, in Q2, we are cycling against the most significant disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Currency should be a tailwind, helping to mitigate the impact from Yankee Candle store footprint rationalization and minor business exits. 
Our outlook for the second quarter reflects normalized operating margin expansion of 130 to 180 basis points year-over-year to 11.5% to 12.0% as volume leverage, in combination with productivity savings, should more than offset the inflationary pressures as well as planned increases in advertising and promotional spending. This outlook assumes that the normalized effective tax rate is in the high teens for Q2, with normalized earnings per share in the $0.41 to $0.45 range as compared to $0.30 in the year-ago period. 
We are energized by the overwhelming progress our teams are driving on the turnaround plan. We continue to take decisive strategic actions to improve the appeal of our brands and products and upgrade our operating effectiveness and efficiency. Despite the disruption and volatility in the macros, we have not wavered from our strategic imperatives, which has put us on a much stronger footing. 
Operator, let's now open up the Q&A session."

My first is the raise in the beat is just fantastic, and it looks like there's maybe more room for upside as we go through the course of the year just given how strong 1 and 2Q are supposed to be. But Chris, I was a little bit surprised you didn't raise the outlook for our operating cash flow. That's the only metric that it looks like you didn't bump up, and I'm surprised by that. So just a question of are you making any incremental investments in working capital? Or is there some other headwind that's incremental that we should be aware of? 
And then, Ravi, just on the Writing business, obviously, easy comps to last year. I'm just wondering when you expect to see orders, is it the second quarter? Is it the third quarter? Orders and shipments, when will we know whether the Writing sort of business, not just for you, but the category as a whole, has kind of been permanently impaired by COVID and more people even if they go back to classrooms in person or still using an iPad, when will we have a sense of what that category really looks like?"

We still expect to deliver in line with our evergreen model of about 100% free cash flow productivity. 
The first quarter is always the seasonally smallest cash flow quarter. And given the strength in the revenue forecast and the uptick in revenue, we do expect a little bit more investment in working capital. Although for the year, we still expect working capital to be a help because we expect to make continued progress on our cash conversion cycle. 
I think we're being prudent in our guidance on operating cash flow, and we'll see how the year progresses as we go forward."

We started seeing a little bit in the last few months in consumption in Writing. And inventory levels were quite low as we ended the year. And it is great to see now both consumption and our own sales going up. The decisive improvement on market share is very exciting. 
Let me give you 3 sort of statistics to think about, which make us optimistic. Number one, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, 61% of school districts are now back in person. Now that doesn't mean all the students are back, and that number is probably closer to 47% of K-12. And then, if you look at K-5, it's actually in excess of 70%. And as you know, the CDC just came out to say, in classrooms, the social distancing could be like 3 feet. That's making it easier for schools and as teachers are getting vaccinated, I think that's all boding well. There are some big school districts left but we're waiting to see the swing, California and New York. And so I think, look, we're planning right now for a normal back-to-school season. We've talked to all our retailers. They're certainly planning for that. 
And one thing to note, despite the fact that the whole office side is still on hybrid model way, even the total channel of office very modestly grew in the first quarter. So that's a little encouraging. And so the only one that, for us, when we look at Writing, we've got 3 really big pieces of business, back-to-school or school, K-12, universities and then offices. I think we're quite confident on the schools front, getting more confident about universities. The big question mark, and that's a portion of our business, is the offices at least this year. 
But with the innovations that we're driving, the market share that we're getting and don't forget, this business is not just U.S., it's global. And it goes beyond sort of everyday writing. When you look at Dymo, the market share gains we're making in Europe, in the U.S., the consumption increases and sales increases we're getting, I really think this Writing business is our ace up our sleeve. And when I said in my prepared remarks there's probably more upside than downside, to me, Writing is really that one. And it's a very well-managed business. That team is just outstanding. So I feel very good overall. And let's not forget the brilliant gross margins of this business."

To me, the candid answer is it's work in progress because there are 3 different businesses within Outdoor & Recreation. There's the outdoor equipment, the largest business, and that is really doing well. The Coleman brand, Jim Pisani and Bill Kirchner are really doing a great job turning it around. We're seeing also real tailwinds in the sense of 10 million more campers just in the U.S. You're seeing minority groups getting into camping that they didn't in the past. And our business in Japan and Asia Pacific is doing extremely well. A lot of innovations now. We're catching up with the tents, the dome tents and the great cooler line that we got last year. Now, we've got some soft cooler refreshers and the steel-belted cooler. So quite positive about the outdoor equipment side. And so that -- and that's the big piece of the business. 
So there are 2 other businesses for us, and that is the beverage business, which is Contigo and bubba. And this business did not get helped. In fact, it was a headwind with the pandemic because it's an on-the-go business. And so it did suffer. And we have fallen behind a little bit on innovation. But we're turning the corner. We've got a new team on this. They are better understanding the insights. We've just launched 3 new lines of hydration, esthetically much better, much better on the key points of spill-proof and temperature control and those, I think, will give us headwinds. We're already seeing some upticks in April. So I feel quite positive about the future of beverages. And bubba has always been a good brand, and that's doing well. So -- and we're being -- look, the -- it's always had good distribution. 
The third business, which is Marmot and ExOfficio, our technical apparel business, that has struggled, but we've got a whole new team in place. And Jim has brought in some great people who have put in merchants, they have revamped the line. So towards the tail end of the year, I think we'll start really seeing some improvements. Already, this year, we started -- in the quarter, we started seeing a minor uptick on consumption. Marmot.com actually had a terrific quarter. So I do feel that's work in progress. 
So overall, when you look at the 3, I still -- it is -- it's not the same place that, say, Food is. But I really think this team, we've got a great team. As you know, Jim came from Timberland, really understands this. He's brought in terrific players. So confident that by the end of this year, we'll have this business coming too."

So let's take appliances. This is -- look, I'm really pleased with the new team. They're making good progress. There's no question probably of all our businesses, the stimulus helped this business the most, just given the nature of the products and the price points and so on. Having said that, that was more in the U.S. because the strength of this business was really international, which had just an incredible -- because while we were slightly above expectations on the U.S. side, it was really -- the team hit the ball out of the park internationally. 
When I said standouts in Colombia, in Chile, Peru, Brazil, those were just huge, huge numbers. And because despite lockdowns and so on, that team created a real direct-to-consumer business, and that has just gained huge momentum. In Latin America, the team did take a price increase. So that's obviously to your question about volume price/mix, that helped a bit in Latin America. But in EMEA and Asia Pacific -- in Asia Pacific, in Australia, we were doing SAP. So you saw a little bit of pull forward for SAP in Australia. But on the whole, I'd say it was a very good international performance in U.S. Don't forget, we now have good innovations coming out like the iced coffee. 
And your question about how do we sustain? Well, we're now putting out a full iced coffee line with frappe and so on coming out in the rest of the year. We still are just gaining distribution. Remember, last year, we were just in one retailer. And now we're going in and already, everyone is clamoring to get it. So the new issue for us is getting the supply going on there. So I think that is the appliance story. 
Chris, is there other things you want to add? And then I'll come back and hit Baby?"

We brought a great marketing eye who used to be with SC Johnson. So I think that team -- I'm now a lot more confident about the future of appliances than I was perhaps 6 months ago or a year ago. So -- and this performance is just indicative that they're getting momentum. 
On Baby, look, the perennial question is birth rates, right? So a couple of things. You still have immigration that's helping. And then when you look at in the U.S. -- but when you look at like kids 1 to 4 and so on, that has stayed pretty steady. So a lot of our products are not just for the infant side, but really are more on the gear side. And so we progress through the life cycle of Baby becoming child and so on. So I think that helps us. 
Second, the power of the Graco brand is just fantastic. I mean, this is a leader. It's gaining share. The innovations -- this team really -- that's 3-in-1 car, the SlimFit, just great idea, but there are so many innovations coming out. And this new Century brand, which is really going after millennials, very much about environmentally conscious and good price value. So -- and then we're now undertaking a whole effort on Baby Jogger, which this is one of those that we need to bring some life back to it. So very -- feel very good. This is a solid, great business.

In terms of the supply chain, we continue to be operating in a very disruptive environment because of container shortages coming from Asia, port congestion, trucking shortages.

That being said, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we made a proactive choice earlier this year to build more inventory and invest more in inventory in our top-selling SKUs. And we factored those disruptions into our supply chain in plan. And so although our teams are still dealing with day-to-day disruption in a number of areas of the supply chain, we are in a dramatically better position today than we were 6 months ago or 9 months ago. 
We do expect it to be a difficult supply operating environment for the rest of the year. But we are very confident. And I think you've seen the results that we've been able to demonstrate by supplying the surge in core sales growth in Q1. Also, if you look at our balance sheet, we've built significant inventory in Q1 so that we are in a very strong position to be able to supply and take up our guidance for the year and for Q2 versus our initial expectations.

I think we haven't said what we plan to do after that point. I think we've been so focused on getting to that point that we have a little bit of time still ahead of us.

And then secondly, Chris, I know there are a lot of puts and takes on inflation and pricing, productivity and business mix and maybe I missed it, but did you give a range or could you give a range on expected gross margin for the year? Both of those would be helpful."

So Steve, I think here's the thing. Right now, because we've got a different set of portfolios each with their own hot buttons, and we're really looking at it brand by brand, category by category. And there are some winners and where market share will be -- where we're doing very well. So I think we talked about Writing. We've talked about some of our Food brands. 
And so I think commercial, difficult business to track because it's so driven by distributors and so on. But we're pretty confident we're a leader and continuing to do extremely well there. So Baby, clearly gaining share. So I think -- and then this is not just overall share, but we also track how do we do on Amazon and stuff and there clearly, we're gaining share. 
There are some businesses that are going to be tougher, like appliances because of the -- where a lot of our businesses are opening price point. So we may gain on units, but maybe not on dollars because there are a lot of brands that are very premium priced. So that may be tougher. So with our portfolio, tough to tell whether even looking overall, is that meaningful? The issue for us is each of our businesses, what are the drivers of winning? What is the role of that business? And how do we win?"

And on the margin side, what I would say is that certainly, we're seeing significant inflationary pressures, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. It's about $150 million worse than what we thought when we talked last in February. That means it's a headwind for this year of about $360 million, which is roughly 350 basis points on the gross margin line of inflationary pressure. 
We are offsetting that with fuel productivity savings, which are -- we're making incredibly strong progress on. We are, as I mentioned, are implementing pricing, not fully to offset inflation, but across the categories that are the most impacted by inflation. And then we're driving operating leverage through strong top line growth and tight cost control. 
We don't guide on specifically what the outcome is for gross margin. But we do guide for operating margin, and we expect the combination of those 4 factors to result in us driving operating margin up for the year by 30 to 60 basis points. And that compares to last year where we grew operating margin as well. If you recall, when we started the turnaround plan, in 2018, our operating margin was 9.1% reported. And this year, we're guiding to 11.4% to 11.7%. Our 30 to 60 basis point guidance for this year is very much in line with our evergreen model despite the significant inflationary pressure. And so the underlying progress that we're making is even stronger if you were to look sort of underneath the covers in terms of the progress from an operating efficiency and effectiveness standpoint across the company."

If you look at the back half, we're going to be up versus '19. And if you look at the margin progress we're making, we're very much in line with our evergreen model.

I'm pleased to announce another outstanding quarter for Newell as we further built on the strong momentum from the past 3 quarters. We delivered 25% core sales growth, 59% normalized operating income growth and 87% normalized EPS growth in the quarter versus prior year. We have now given 4 consecutive quarters of core sales growth and experienced 5 consecutive quarters of domestic consumption growth. Based on first half 2021 sales momentum, we are raising our top line outlook for the year.
During the second quarter, core sales growth exceeded 25% as we lapped significant disruption from the pandemic. Importantly, even on a 2-year stacked basis, core sales grew low double digits both in the second quarter and during the first half, showing the underlying momentum in the business. I'm especially pleased that once again we saw broad-based top line strength across each of our 8 business units and across major channels, with every region growing at a double-digit rate. While performance in North America was excellent as core sales grew almost 22%, international markets once again shone, registering nearly 35% core growth in the second quarter and almost 31% in the first half with particular strength in Latin America.
7 of our top 10 beloved brands, including Coleman, Graco, Oster, Sharpie, Yankee Candle, Paper Mate and First Alert grew at a strong double-digit pace. Yankee Candle stood out as its sales nearly doubled versus last year. We delivered strong top line results even in businesses such as Food and Home Appliances that faced tough comparisons versus prior year as a result of demand spikes. At the same time. It was extremely encouraging to see the continued rebound in Writing as it has come roaring back, folks, roaring back.
From a channel perspective, e-commerce sales growth moderated to a mid-single-digit trend, accounting for about 20% of Newell's global net sales versus peak penetration of around 24% a year ago. During the quarter, we saw resurgence in consumption in brick-and-mortar as recent progress on vaccine rollout and increased mobility brought people back to the stores. In fact, growth in brick-and-mortar outpaced digital as the retail industry lapped significant pandemic-related store closures and lockdowns from the second quarter 2020.
Given our ongoing investment in omni capabilities, we are well positioned to capitalize on consumer demand regardless of which channels consumers choose to shop. We do, however, believe that over time, digital penetration will continue to move up despite the potential for quarterly fluctuations as channel dynamics settle.
The U.S. economy is continuing to regain its footing. We generally saw healthy consumption during the second quarter. There has been some normalization in trend across businesses in the U.S. that experienced significant spikes in demand a year ago, such as Home Appliances and Food. At the same time, consumption accelerated in Writing, which was the victim of the pandemic last year. Recent consumer behavior reinforces our belief that home as the hub theme will persist well after the pandemic. The home has become central to people's lives and has truly become a sanctuary, a part-time office, a part learning center, a kid's activity zone and the kitchen, a family hub. Newell is well positioned to capitalize on the home-as-hub phenomenon, not only due to the composition of our business portfolio, but also because of all the work we've done to reinvigorate our iconic brands and innovation funnels that enhance life at home and outside.
7 out of our 8 business units grew core sales at a double-digit rate, and we made notable progress on market share across a number of categories. Let's start with Home Fragrance, whose sells in the second quarter nearly doubled versus last year, as the business lapped retail store closures and significant disruption in our manufacturing operations due to the pandemic. Net sales increased at a strong double-digit pace relative to 2019 as well, overcoming the unfavorable impact from Yankee Candle store closures and exit from our fundraising business.
Home Fragrance was once again the star of the show, delivering the highest level of top line and consumption growth within our portfolio as we continue to gain market share, particularly in scented candles, and expanded our distribution both in the U.S. and EMEA. Although we expect the scented candle category to continue to moderate, results from a recent survey among scented candle users showed that used frequency remains high, with almost 33% of those surveyed aiming to use the product more often in the next 6 months.
I'm very excited about the long-term prospects of Home Fragrance, which is our most omnichannel business. It has strong gross margins and strong growth potential.
The Food business remained on a solid footing across all regions as core sales increased low double digits against a very difficult base period comparison. As anticipated, POS decelerated in the quarter as the category softened but remained significantly ahead of the 2019 level as our strong brands continue to take significant share in food storage, fresh preserving and kitchen organization categories.
I'm delighted to share some of the recognitions our brands have received this year as consumer reports named FoodSaver as the best vacuum sealer for 2021. And Good Housekeeping chose Rubbermaid Brilliance as best food storage for 2021 and Canfor as #1 editor's choice for best nonstick in 2021. It is so exciting to see those accolades, especially at a time when the kitchen is so important to our consumers and our innovation machine has been in full gear. This is another terrific quarter for Home Appliances business.
Core sales growth exceeded 15% even as it lapped a high single-digit growth comparison. Once again, Latin America stole the show as we continue to leverage our e-commerce presence to reach consumers, with particularly strong results in Chile, Peru and Argentina. As expected, consumption in the U.S. is moderating against elevated levels from a year ago but remained significantly ahead of 2019.
Our needle over launch of Mr. Coffee Iced from fall 2020 training continues to generate demand, supported by a social media campaign Switch-up Your #brewton. We further broadened distribution during the second quarter with new on-trend colors. Mr. Coffee also introduced his team espresso maker to capture consumers' heightened interest in specialty and espresso beverages. Mr. Coffee's consistent share gains on the back of innovations and great price value is impressive.
Top line momentum in our Writing business accelerated nicely on a sequential basis. Core sales growth for this business exceeded the company's total result, with every region delivering terrific growth against a suppressed base in the year ago period. The rebound across most Writing categories as more schools return to in-person learning to finish out the school year in combination with share gains in key categories, such as pens, presentation markets, permanent markets and highlighters, translated into terrific consumption in the U.S. for us. Consumption was up in other parts of the world as well.
Newell's share of the gel pen segment increased over 700 basis points to 26% as our consumption nearly doubled behind our needle-mover innovation, Sharpie S-Gel, boy, do I love that pen, which continues to delight consumers and bring incremental dollars to the category. We also POS growth in other markets, such as Australia, New Zealand and in the U.K. In the second quarter, the office channel also grew versus last year. But as expected, it has not fully come back to pre-pandemic levels due to the prevalence of flexible work arrangements.
We are encouraged by the second consecutive quarter of strong POS growth in Writing and remain optimistic about the back-to-school season with robust merchandising plans in place. Based on the latest available information, in-person instruction, which is the gold standard, is expected to make a comeback this year. According to school opening cracker by a leading industry source for the upcoming school year, 96% of K-12 student body in the U.S. is in school districts that have already announced they will offer in-person education.
Of course, uncertainty remains to some degree given the recent spread of the Delta variant. While we are closely monitoring the situation, we remain bullish on this back-to-school season and believe we are well positioned to win as we continue to grow sales and overall share.
During the second quarter, strong double-digit core sales growth for our Baby business was nearly identical to that of Writing, fueled by broad-based momentum across all the regions. A double-digit increase in consumption, which reflected share gains by Graco in a rapidly growing category, a benefit from stimulus funding as well as an easy comparison, all contributed to such a strong result in the U.S. We think that improving mobility and higher appetite by U.S. consumers to go on overnight trips by car this summer bode well for demand in car seats, the biggest subsegment of the baby gear category in our Baby business. We continue to innovate in this category. Earlier this year, Graco introduced a Snug Right, Snug Fit, a new line of infant cases with integrated anti-rebound bar that provides an extra layer of safety for families.
We're also excited by a new report from the Institute of Family Studies that just came in that suggests that the U.S. may be witnessing a surprising rise in births, potentially a result of government stimulus checks and flexible work arrangements. Is there a baby boom going on folks?
Our commercial business unit delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of core sales growth, just shy of double digits, with strong top line momentum across all regions. Higher domestic consumption of material handling, refuse, cleaning, outdoor organization and hand protection and covering products helped to mitigate declines in washroom solutions, which started to cycle against a significant surge in demand late in the second quarter 2020. We're seeing signs of reopening-related demand in verticals, such as foodservice, hospitality as well as travel and entertainment. And also the builder channel is really beginning to surge, but somewhat offset by softness in washroom solutions and use of sanitizers.
Core sales for the Connected Home & Security business also accelerated to a strong double-digit growth rate, lapping significant disruption in the year ago period. The team is navigating through some supply constraints as it relates to chip shortages.
Just like other businesses that were negatively impacted by the pandemic last year, we saw significant acceleration in Outdoor & Recreation as core sales increased 25%, with growth in every region and every major category. Coleman, the largest brand in this business unit, delivered terrific results as one of the largest contributors to the company's top line growth this quarter. While the Call of the Outdoors campaign has already bolstered the outdoor equipment category, this quarter, we also saw a resurgence in sales growth where our on-the-go beverage and technical apparels businesses driven by robust demand. In beverage, Contigo's newly launched product lines are off to a strong start and are driving share gains in the hydration category. 
Power of our strategic vision, the strength of our brand and business portfolio and the focus on the turnaround have been brought to life through strong, resilient and agile execution in an ever-changing and fluid operating environment. We delivered outstanding top and bottom line results during the second quarter and first half of '21 both relative to the year ago period as well as 2019. We have gained considerable momentum on our turnaround.
Let me illustrate. We brought together world-class leadership team who has helped unlock the passion of our people. We invested in omnichannel capabilities that have been instrumental in capturing consumer demand across all channels; substantially strengthened our innovation and marketing muscle, leveraging consumer insights and foresights; sharpened brand positioning for many of our top brands; established joint business plans with key strategic retail partners; instituted a new hybrid organization model that brings our domain experts close to our customers and consumers while leveraging the center for scale and efficiencies; made productivity a way of life, providing both FUEL for margin enhancement as well as reinvestment in the business to drive sustainable and profitable top line growth; reduced complexity, be it consolidation of ERP systems or reduction in websites or SKUs; and we have made meaningful progress in taking our overheads, improving cash conversion cycle and strengthening the balance sheet.
Importantly, we've become very skilled at managing our 8 business unit portfolio and assigning clear roles to the individual businesses in some sub businesses. For instance, we focused on the Food, Commercial and Home Appliance business units in 2020 to leverage COVID-related consumer trends. And as some of these trends moderated, we are shoring up Writing and Home Fragrance in 2021. Our strategy is to ensure that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
As we approach the second half, we faced a tough macro operating environment with unprecedented inflationary pressures that we expect will top $0.5 billion as well as extraordinary externally driven supply chain challenges. Notwithstanding the situation, I am proud of our team's resilience, execution of progress and ingenuity, so much so that we raised our top line guidance for the year and continue to project normalized operating income and EPS growth on a full year basis.
Looking ahead, I can confidently state that we are a much stronger company than before and well positioned to drive sustainable and profitable growth in the years ahead and add significant shareholder value. I'd like to express my sincere and profound gratitude to all our 31,000 employees and frontline hires worldwide for their tenacity in delivering another great quarter. Our best days are truly ahead of us.
With that, over to Chris Peterson. Now please go easy on him with the questions. It is his birthday. Happy birthday Chris, onwards and upwards."

Second quarter results were outstanding as the integrated set of strategies we put in place several years ago continue to drive strong financial results across all key metrics. Before getting into the details, I want to provide a little color on the current operating environment and proactive choices we are making.
We delivered better-than-anticipated results in Q2 as consumer demand across our categories remained robust, and our supply chain teams did a heroic job navigating a choppy operating environment. To give a little perspective on the supply environment, we continue to face a number of externally driven supply challenges. As a reminder, in the second quarter of 2020, our supply chain was significantly pressured as a result of government-mandated closures across many of our facilities due to the pandemic. That was a low point for the business, and we are in a much better position today with our factories, distribution centers and retail stores open.
More recently, however, our teams have worked tirelessly to overcome various supply challenges surrounding longer lead times for sourced products, trucking capacity in the U.S. as well as labor shortages, raw material and component availability. COVID-related disruptions across ports as well as consumer demand spikes following stimulus payments have exacerbated these issues.
Early on, we took a number of proactive actions to mitigate the impact from these dynamics, including building inventory on top-selling SKUs; allowing for longer in-transit times as part of our planning process; accelerating the pace of automation where feasible; and being creative with increased incentives to attract and retain employees in factories by raising wages, further enhancing benefits and working conditions; and providing employee development programs amongst other actions.
The complexity reduction work that we executed as part of the turnaround has put us in a much better position to deal with these challenges. While we have successfully navigated these dynamics and created more agility within our supply chain, it certainly has not been easy, and the challenges are ongoing.
The other changing dynamic has been inflationary pressure. We have seen continued escalation inflation largely driven by increasing resin prices, ocean freight costs, source finished goods pricing due to a strengthening Chinese yuan and labor wage pressure. These factors are not unique to Newell and are affecting everyone in our industry. To put it in perspective, we currently expect inflation to amount to nearly $560 million in 2021. This is about $200 million worse than what we expected just 3 months ago and $350 million worse than we expected at the beginning of the year.
We are taking a number of actions to mitigate this significant inflation spike, including a more aggressive push on productivity savings, continuing to tightly manage costs, optimizing promotional spend, driving operating leverage from stronger top line growth and taking additional selective pricing later this year in categories where we are seeing the greatest impact. The net result is that we are maintaining our EPS outlook for the year, which calls for strong operating profit growth despite the significant increase in inflationary pressure.
In the U.S., we have now announced price increases across 7 of our 8 business units. These pricing actions do not fully offset the inflationary cost pressure as we are using productivity savings and operating leverage as offsets as well.
As we start to think about 2022, we expect this headwind to become a tailwind. As inflation is largely in the base, we benefit from carryover pricing, and we continue to drive productivity savings and manage costs tightly.
Moving on to second quarter performance. We delivered very strong results as demand exceeded our expectations. This yielded the better-than-anticipated outcome on top line that also flowed through to the bottom line. The company's net sales increased 28.3% year-over-year to $2.7 billion. Core sales grew 25.4% as we lapped a 12.6% decline from a year ago. Favorable foreign exchange more than offset the headwind from business and Yankee Candle retail store exits.
We saw broad-based strength during the quarter, with each of our 8 business units in all 4 geographic regions growing. Core sales in the first half of the year grew 23.3%. On a 2-year stack basis, which helps smooth out noise from the year-ago figures, we grew core sales in the low double digits both during the quarter and in the first half.
Normalized gross margin expanded to 32.7% from 31.6% in the year ago period. The benefit from FUEL productivity savings, favorable business mix and pricing more than offset a more than 700 basis point headwind from inflation, primarily related to resin-sourced finished goods transportation and labor costs.
Normalized operating margin expanded 240 basis points year-over-year to 12.6%. Gross margin improvement in combination with sales leverage and disciplined overhead cost controls more than offset the impact of an increase in advertising and promotion expense. Normalized operating profit grew 59% year-over-year to $341 million.
Net interest expense decreased by $6 million year-over-year to $65 million, reflecting about a $700 million year-over-year reduction in outstanding debt. The normalized tax rate was 15.2%, above the year ago level of 11.2% due to a higher rate impact last year from discrete tax items. Second quarter normalized diluted earnings per share were $0.56, nearly doubling year-over-year.
Now turning to our segment performance. Core sales for the Commercial Solutions segment increased 16.6%, with strong growth in both the Commercial and Connected Home & Security business units. Core sales for Home Appliances increased 15.3% primarily driven by Latin America. The Home Solutions segment increased core sales 33.7%, with double-digit growth in both the Food and Home Fragrance businesses. Core sales for the Learning & Development segment increased 31.6%, which reflected similar level of strong growth in both the Writing and Baby business units. Lastly, the Outdoor & Rec segment increased core sales 25.0%.
Given the meaningful business disruption from the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020, we think it is informative to compare the company's current results to the second quarter of 2019. Newell's net sales exceeded the 2019 level by 9.2% as results were higher across every segment, other than Learning & Development, which was only slightly lower.
Year-to-date through Q2, Newell generated operating cash flow of $76 million as compared to $132 million a year ago. While operating income increased substantially versus last year, that was more than offset by a temporary increase in working capital to support strong demand in 2021 and managed through longer lead times. We continued to accelerate our cash conversion cycle in the second quarter, which improved by about 14 days versus the year ago period.
We ended Q2 with a leverage ratio of 3.1x, a meaningful improvement from 4.6x a year ago and very close to our target of 3x. The year-over-year step down in Newell's leverage was driven by a combination of a net debt reduction of over $700 million as well as an almost 30% increase in trailing 12 months normalized EBITDA. We have over $2 billion in available short-term liquidity, including $637 million of cash on hand, which is a very strong position.
Before sharing our outlook for the third quarter and full year, let me walk you through our underlying assumptions as they have changed relative to late April. The macros in the U.S. are generally healthy, and the consumer is still flushed with cash as a result of the stimulus benefits as well as the enhanced Child Tax Credit more recently. However, with the surge in the Delta variant across various geographies, uncertainty around the pandemic remains.
Our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes a much higher than previously contemplated forecast on top line growth; a significant year-over-year increase in advertising spending; substantial escalation and inflationary pressures, with some offset from pricing and continued traction on productivity; previously discussed supply chain constraints; as well as much more difficult comparisons as we lap a 6% core sales growth comparison from the back half of 2020.
We are still forecasting a much stronger first half relative to the second half of 2021. Our upwardly revised top line forecast for the full year 2021 implies that core sales will increase versus 2020 and 2019 in the third quarter as well as for the full year and will be up versus 2019 in the back half.
Let's discuss the full year outlook in detail. Our revised net sales guidance for 2021 is $10.1 billion to $10.35 billion, an increase from $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion previously, which implies 8% to 10% year-over-year growth. We now forecast core sales growth of 7% to 10%, which compares favorably to our previous outlook of 5% to 7%, reflecting better-than-anticipated results in Q2 as well as an improved outlook for the balance of the year. Currency is still expected to be a tailwind to top line, helping to more than offset the year-over-year headwind from closure of Yankee Candle retail stores and other minor business exit.
We now expect a flattish normalized operating margin in 2021, around 11.1%. Our forecast implies that normalized operating profit increases in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, which would be a great outcome given the magnitude of inflationary pressure we are absorbing. We continue to plan for higher advertising expense versus 2020 to support new product launches and omnichannel investments. Our outlook continues to assume a high-teens normalized effective tax rate and a modest uptick in shares outstanding.
We are maintaining our normalized earnings per share forecast at $1.63 to $1.73. Our operating cash flow guidance for full year 2021 also remains the same at approximately $1 billion driven by improvement in the company's cash conversion cycle.
For the third quarter, we are forecasting net sales of $2.7 billion to $2.78 billion, with core sales flat to up 3%. We expect Q3 to be the peak quarter for inflation pressure, which will significantly weigh on the company's margin performance. We are forecasting normalized operating margin of 10.3% to 10.8% as compared to 14.9% in the year ago period as inflation and a meaningful increase in advertising and promotion spending will more than offset the benefit from volume leverage, productivity and pricing. We expect to realize discrete tax benefits in Q3 so that the normalized effective tax rate will be in the mid-single-digit range. This translates into normalized earnings per share in the $0.46 to $0.50 range. 
We have made tremendous progress on our turnaround as demonstrated by our strong financial results. As we look forward, we are pivoting from complexity reduction to driving operational excellence in everything we do. We remain laser-focused on executing our strategy, which we believe shows a clear path to creating long-term shareholder value.

Clearly, it's a bit premature to offer a perspective on guidance, and I know you're not looking for that. Nevertheless, it's still difficult because we're now entering into -- we're coming sort of out of the pandemic, but the Delta variant is sort of lurking around. And so the second half will be an important determinant.
Having said that, I think as I said in my prepared remarks, the company is in far better shape than we have been in many years. Our brands are much stronger. We've put a lot of focus on innovation. Our Writing category is very strong. In fact, I'd say all our businesses now are in pretty good shape. Remember, we just talked, I think, a year ago where I had big questions about Home Appliances and Outdoor. I'm really feeling very good about what the Home Appliances team has done. Their real strength is in international, particularly in Latin America, if you look at this quarter, the fact that it was up so high. And that is what -- so we should look at Newell, not just as a U.S. business but as a global business given 1/3 of our business or so is international. And we're now going to put a lot more focus on international as well. And just you've seen how we're growing.
So I would say, look, long term, we're still committed to having modest top line core sales growth. I can't give you a view on '22 in particular. But I think the key is -- and there's the whole issue about the portfolio, right, where if we have very strong growth in one and some other businesses not doing as well, you leverage, like I said, this year, Writing and Home Fragrance.
But I think the good news is I'm now seeing innovation across all our businesses. The little Baby uptick was encouraging. The thing I know you're always interested in the old Baby business and not only the innovations, but just to see there is the slightest hope on birth rates going up. And then the 0 to 4 remains constant. So when I look at all of that, it's tough to give a sense, but look, we're very committed to being a growth company. And that is probably the best I can do for you versus giving numbers. I would hate for people to just think"

And obviously, you can do the math to get through the implication.
But we are very much thinking about our guidance as a prudent guidance range, and we are shooting for the higher end of our guidance range. But given the external dynamics and the uncertainty, we felt like it was prudent to maintain a wide range in this environment."

And look, even when we look at consumption I mentioned that Q2, we saw healthy consumption growth where we've just had the July numbers, and we'll continue to see consumption growth. So I'm optimistic. I think it's tough for us to give a real handle on Q4. So we're just taking the prudent steps.

At the end of the first quarter, we thought it was going to be $360 million, and now we're forecasting $560 million.
And so we've taken sort of around the pricing that went into effect that in late June, early July, we've announced or are announcing pricing -- additional pricing that's going into effect in the fourth quarter, in October, November. And the combination of that, I think, is not fully pricing for inflation because we're also using productivity and operating leverage and cost controls to offset, but we are pricing for a significant part of inflation, which we think is prudent. And so far, our discussions with the retailers have gone reasonably well. But we're managing it day in and day out."

And then second, I guess, maybe for you, Chris, on the pricing front. Some of your categories -- I mean my jaw dropped when you said you gained, I think, 700 points of share in gel pens.

So look, we're seeing category growth in many of our businesses. So you're seeing really -- like Baby is a good example where you're seeing double-digit category growth. But having said that, we're doing even better, and that's why gaining share because the strength of the Graco brand and all the innovations that we are launching.
And I think the -- one of the factors -- because we always go to what is the underlying reason. You're seeing a lot more -- I think people were cooped up last year, start getting vaccinated, feeling bolder to start driving into overnight trips, therefore, buying car seats, this whole grandparents effect, where people are trying to -- they're -- sometimes they're now -- they've been at COVID together, so they're buying car seats. So I think you're seeing the categories going up, and the stimulus certainly helped. And with the stimulus, there has been a tendency to go to some of the premium brands and the leaders, and Graco has really benefited. So that's a great example of that.
And specifically on Outdoor, we're doing a lot of great work. And I think we're seeing the benefits of that even more this year because Coleman was in a turnaround. I think the team has done a great job on soft coolers, for instance. They've come out with some nice steel-belted coolers, the whole dome tents that they've come out with, the [ 1 source ]. There have been a lot of innovations that have helped. And if we look at category by category, we've certainly done well.
The thing that has really been a tough problem for us on the Coleman brand has been keeping pace with demand. We have been chasing demand because we get a lot of stuff from Asia. And so this is one where we've had a real tough time keeping pace. So the demand is certainly there and it's been -- so when we think about the second half, too, the supply thing is more in our minds rather than any worries about our brands at all.
Now some of the consumption on like food and appliances in the U.S., there was some slowdown because last year, they were up so much. But then the good news is, look, Food, every one of our brands, we're gaining share. That just goes to the power of the strength of our brands and what our teams are doing and the innovations.

And the thing that's important here, I think, is that the cost inflation that we're facing is not unique to us. It's something that the entire industry is facing. So -- and we're not fully pricing to recover because we're using the ramp-up that we have in productivity savings. We're going to generate productivity savings this year of 3.5% to 4% of cost of goods, which is a very strong result on top of what we did last year. And that's helping to partially mitigate.
And so as we take the pricing, generally what we're hearing, and we're monitoring it day by day, is that the whole industry is moving prices up. Now in any particular category, there could be a competitor that tries to lag us or maybe they price ahead of us. And so that's what we're monitoring sort of on a day-to-day to make sure that we don't wind up with a sustainable price gap. Our strategy is not to gain market share by undercutting people on price. Our strategy is to gain market share by coming out with very strong product innovation that offers a superior consumer value.

We plan to maintain our current dividend. We are getting close to the leverage target that we set of 3.0x or 3.1. And I think beyond that, we'll start to look at things like share repurchase as well as tuck-in acquisitions to the extent that we think they can be significant, value-accretive to the company. And so we're excited to get to our target on the balance sheet, and we think that does open more flexibility as we go into the next few years."

Because you're obviously we're not just talking for consumer demand, but also the increased difficulty in satisfying that demand because of the externals. You sort of touched on this with respect to Writing, but kind of curious on the rest of your key businesses where you stand with respect to that. And I would imagine with respect to supply chain, that -- 2 things. One, sort of major categories, which your competition looks like. Again, you talked about that with Writing, but kind of curious on the other categories. And then also what you're seeing from them with respect to pricing? Is the magnitude similar? Is the timing similar? And if not, where do they differ?"

So on the supply chain, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it is a challenging external environment. And the challenges are largely due to ocean freight availability of containers; length of time it takes containerships to move from Asia to the U",298,"Yes. So on the supply chain, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it is a challenging external environment. And the challenges are largely due to ocean freight availability of containers; length of time it takes containerships to move from Asia to the U.S.; trucking capacity in the U.S.; labor availability in the U.S.; some raw material and component availability, depending on the business unit; and then you couple that with the consumer demand spike that we're trying to navigate and meet.
I think that we've done -- that our teams have done a really a heroic job of meeting and navigating through this environment. But our guidance does contemplate that this environment remains difficult for the remainder of the year. So we are not expecting an improvement in the external environment, but we do expect us to continue to navigate it.
I think the good news is that this is not an environment that's unique to Newell. This is an environment that all of our competitors face. I mentioned on Writing that I think we're better positioned than at least one of our major competitors.
The balance of our categories, I think we're largely similarly positioned. And so we don't see major gaps in our external pressure versus our direct competitors' external pressure on the whole. So that's how I would characterize the supply chain. And I think our -- part of the reason why we've given a wide guidance range is recognizing the variability and the uncertainty of that supply environment, including the ramp-up of the Delta variant, which can have an impact on that. As I said, we're shooting more for the top half of our guidance range, but we think it's prudent to maintain the guidance range given the variability in the external environment."

So I think on the inflation side is -- there are really 4 factors that are driving inflation: increased resin costs; sourced finished goods, which is largely a function of the Chinese currency strengthening versus the U.S. dollar; transportation cost",370,"Yes. So I think on the inflation side is -- there are really 4 factors that are driving inflation: increased resin costs; sourced finished goods, which is largely a function of the Chinese currency strengthening versus the U.S. dollar; transportation cost, which is, in our case, is largely ocean freight-related; and then labor pressure.
The interesting thing about that is resin is probably the biggest impact out of those 4, out of our $560 million that we're talking about this year. And one of the services that doesn't outfront forecast on resin is IHS. And at least their forecast is that we're at peak resin prices right now, and resin prices are likely to come down significantly over the next 6 to 12 months.
Now we're heading into hurricane season, and so I never want to predict whether there's going to be a hurricane that hits the Texas or Louisiana coast. But by all accounts, it feels like the resin environment is sort of peaking at the moment and is likely to get better as we head over the next 6 to 12 months.
Again, on sourced finished goods, it's hard to predict. The Chinese currency strengthened versus the U.S. dollar but has been relatively stable more recently. And so we will begin to lap that unless there's another devaluation of the U.S. dollar.
I think ocean freight is likely to remain a challenge for the next 6 to 12 months because of the capacity constraints that carriers and containers have that -- this is not unique to Newell. But again, it feels like that is transitory in nature. And then I think labor cost is likely to be a sustaining inflationary pressure, but that probably is the smallest of the 4 that I mentioned.
So we think we're navigating the peak inflation environment well. We're excited that driving low single -- or I'm sorry, high single-digit to low double-digit operating income growth is what our guidance implies for this year despite this inflation. And we think that the productivity savings that we've got, the cost management that we've got and the top line momentum that we have positions us well as the inflation pressure starts to ease going forward."

I'm pleased to announce another outstanding quarter for Newell as we further built on the strong momentum from the past 3 quarters. We delivered 25% core sales growth, 59% normalized operating income growth and 87% normalized EPS growth in the quarter versus prior year. We have now given 4 consecutive quarters of core sales growth and experienced 5 consecutive quarters of domestic consumption growth. Based on first half 2021 sales momentum, we are raising our top line outlook for the year.
During the second quarter, core sales growth exceeded 25% as we lapped significant disruption from the pandemic. Importantly, even on a 2-year stack basis, core sales grew low double digits both in the second quarter and during the first half, showing the underlying momentum in the business. 
I'm especially pleased that once again we saw broad-based top line strength across each of our 8 business units and across major channels, with every region growing at a double-digit rate. While performance in North America was excellent as core sales grew almost 22%, international markets once again shone, registering nearly 35% core growth in the second quarter and almost 31% in the first half, with particular strength in Latin America.
7 of our top 10 beloved brands, including Coleman, Graco, Oster, Sharpie, Yankee Candle, Paper Mate and First Alert grew at a strong double-digit pace. Yankee Candle stood out as its sales nearly doubled versus last year. We delivered strong top line results even in businesses such as Food and Home Appliances that faced tough comparisons versus prior year as a result of demand spikes. 
At the same time. It was extremely encouraging to see the continued rebound in Writing as it has come roaring back, folks, roaring back. From a channel perspective, e-commerce sales growth moderated to a mid-single-digit trend, accounting for about 20% of Newell's global net sales versus peak penetration of around 24% a year ago. 
During the quarter, we saw a resurgence in consumption in brick-and-mortar as recent progress on vaccine rollout and increased mobility brought people back to the stores. In fact, growth in brick-and-mortar outpaced digital as the retail industry lapped significant pandemic-related store closures and lockdowns from the second quarter 2020.
Given our ongoing investment in omni capabilities, we are well positioned to capitalize on consumer demand regardless of which channels consumers choose to shop. We do, however, believe that over time, digital penetration will continue to move up despite the potential for quarterly fluctuations as channel dynamics settle.
The U.S. economy is continuing to regain its footing. We generally saw healthy consumption during the second quarter. There has been some normalization in trend across businesses in the U.S. that experienced significant spikes in demand a year ago, such as Home Appliances and Food. At the same time, consumption accelerated in Writing, which was the victim of the pandemic last year. 
Recent consumer behavior reinforces our belief that home as the hub theme will persist well after the pandemic. The home has become central to people's lives and has truly become a sanctuary, a part-time office, a part learning center, a kid's activity zone; and the kitchen, a family hub. Newell is well positioned to capitalize on the home-as-hub phenomenon, not only due to the composition of our business portfolio, but also because of all the work we've done to reinvigorate our iconic brands and innovation funnels that enhance life at home and outside.
7 out of our 8 business units grew core sales at a double-digit rate, and we made notable progress on market share across a number of categories. Let's start with Home Fragrance, whose sells in the second quarter nearly doubled versus last year, as the business lapped retail store closures and significant disruption in our manufacturing operations due to the pandemic. Net sales increased at a strong double-digit pace relative to 2019 as well, overcoming the unfavorable impact from Yankee Candle store closures and exit from our fundraising business.
Home Fragrance was once again the star of the show, delivering the highest level of top line and consumption growth within our portfolio as we continue to gain market share, particularly in scented candles, and expanded our distribution both in the U.S. and EMEA. Although we expect the scented candle category to continue to moderate, results from a recent survey among scented candle users showed that used frequency remains high, with almost 33% of those surveyed aiming to use the product more often in the next 6 months.
I'm very excited about the long-term prospects of Home Fragrance, which is our most omni-channel business. It has strong gross margins and strong growth potential.
The Food business remained on a solid footing across all regions as core sales increased low double digits against a very difficult base period comparison. As anticipated, POS decelerated in the quarter as the category softened but remained significantly ahead of the 2019 level, as our strong brands continue to take significant share in food storage, fresh preserving and kitchen organization categories.
I'm delighted to share some of the recognitions our brands have received this year as Consumer Reports named FoodSaver as the best vacuum sealer for 2021. And Good Housekeeping chose Rubbermaid Brilliance as best food storage for 2021 and [ Calphalon ] as #1 editor's choice for best nonstick in 2021. It is so exciting to see those accolades, especially at a time when the kitchen is so important to our consumers and our innovation machine has been in full gear. This is another terrific quarter for Home Appliances business.
Core sales growth exceeded 15% even as it lapped a high single-digit growth comparison. Once again, Latin America stole the show as we continue to leverage our e-commerce presence to reach consumers, with particularly strong results in Chile, Peru and Argentina. As expected, consumption in the U.S. is moderating against elevated levels from a year ago but remained significantly ahead of 2019.
Our needle-mover launch of Mr. Coffee Iced from fall 2020 continues to generate demand, supported by the social media campaign, Switch Up Your #Brewtine. We further broadened distribution during the second quarter with new on-trend colors. Mr. Coffee also introduced the steam espresso maker to capture consumers' heightened interest in specialty and espresso beverages. Mr. Coffee's consistent share gains on the back of innovations and great price value is impressive.
Top line momentum in our Writing business accelerated nicely on a sequential basis. Core sales growth for this business exceeded the company's total result, with every region delivering terrific growth against a suppressed base in the year ago period. The rebound across most Writing categories as more schools return to in-person learning to finish out the school year in combination with share gains in key categories, such as pens, presentation markers, permanent markers and highlighters, translated into terrific consumption in the U.S. for us. Consumption was up in other parts of the world as well.
Newell's share of the gel pen segment increased over 700 basis points to 26% as our consumption nearly doubled behind our needle-mover innovation, Sharpie S-Gel, boy, do I love that pen, which continues to delight consumers and bring incremental dollars to the category. We also have POS growth in other markets, such as Australia, New Zealand and in the U.K. In the second quarter, the office channel also grew versus last year. But as expected, it has not fully come back to pre-pandemic levels due to the prevalence of flexible work arrangements.
We are encouraged by the second consecutive quarter of strong POS growth in Writing and remain optimistic about the back-to-school season with robust merchandising plans in place. Based on the latest available information, in-person instruction, which is the gold standard, is expected to make a comeback this year. According to school opening tracker by a leading industry source, for the upcoming school year, 96% of K-12 student body in the U.S. is in school districts that have already announced they will offer in-person education.
Of course, uncertainty remains to some degree given the recent spread of the Delta variant. While we are closely monitoring the situation, we remain bullish on this back-to-school season and believe we are well positioned to win as we continue to grow sales and overall share.
During the second quarter, strong double-digit core sales growth for our Baby business was nearly identical to that of Writing, fueled by broad-based momentum across all the regions. A double-digit increase in consumption, which reflected share gains by Graco in a rapidly growing category, a benefit from stimulus funding as well as an easy comparison, all contributed to such a strong result in the U.S. 
We think that improving mobility and higher appetite by U.S. consumers to go on overnight trips by car this summer bode well for demand in car seats, the biggest subsegment of the baby gear category in our Baby business. We continue to innovate in this category. Earlier this year, Graco introduced a SnugRide SnugFit, a new line of infant car seats with integrated anti-rebound bar that provides an extra layer of safety for families.
We're also excited by a new report from the Institute of Family Studies that just came in that suggests that the U.S. may be witnessing a surprising rise in births, potentially a result of government stimulus checks and flexible work arrangements. Is there a baby boom going on folks?
Our Commercial business unit delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of core sales growth, just shy of double digits, with strong top line momentum across all regions. Higher domestic consumption of material handling, refuse, cleaning, outdoor organization and hand protection and scouring products helped to mitigate declines in washroom solutions, which started to cycle against a significant surge in demand late in the second quarter 2020. We're seeing signs of reopening-related demand in verticals such as foodservice, hospitality as well as travel and entertainment. And also the builder channel is really beginning to surge, but somewhat offset by softness in washroom solutions and use of sanitizers.
Core sales for the Connected Home & Security business also accelerated to a strong double-digit growth rate, lapping significant disruption in the year ago period. The team is navigating through some supply constraints as it relates to chip shortages.
Just like other businesses that were negatively impacted by the pandemic last year, we saw significant acceleration in Outdoor & Recreation as core sales increased 25%, with growth in every region and every major category. Coleman, the largest brand in this business unit, delivered terrific results as one of the largest contributors to the company's top line growth this quarter. 
While the Call of the Outdoors campaign has already bolstered the outdoor equipment category, this quarter, we also saw a resurgence in sales growth for our on-the-go beverage and technical apparels businesses driven by robust demand. In beverage, Contigo's newly launched product lines are off to a strong start and are driving share gains in the hydration category. 
The power of our strategic vision, the strength of our brand and business portfolio and the focus on the turnaround have been brought to life through strong, resilient and agile execution in an ever-changing and fluid operating environment. We delivered outstanding top and bottom line results during the second quarter and first half of '21 both relative to the year ago period as well as 2019. We have gained considerable momentum on our turnaround.
Let me illustrate. We brought together a world-class leadership team who has helped unlock the passion of our people; we invested in omni-channel capabilities that have been instrumental in capturing consumer demand across all channels; substantially strengthened our innovation and marketing muscle, leveraging consumer insights and foresights; sharpened brand positioning for many of our top brands; established joint business plans with key strategic retail partners; instituted a new hybrid organization model that brings our domain experts close to our customers and consumers while leveraging the center for scale and efficiencies; made productivity a way of life, providing both fuel for margin enhancement as well as reinvestment in the business to drive sustainable and profitable top line growth; reduced complexity, be it consolidation of ERP systems or reduction in websites or SKUs; and we have made meaningful progress in taking our overheads, improving cash conversion cycle and strengthening the balance sheet.
Importantly, we've become very skilled at managing our 8 business unit portfolio and assigning clear roles to the individual businesses and some sub-businesses. For instance, we focused on the Food, Commercial and Home Appliance business units in 2020 to leverage COVID-related consumer trends. And as some of these trends moderated, we are shoring up Writing and Home Fragrance in 2021. Our strategy is to ensure that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
As we approach the second half, we faced a tough macro operating environment with unprecedented inflationary pressures that we expect will top $0.5 billion as well as extraordinary externally driven supply chain challenges. Notwithstanding the situation, I am proud of our team's resilience, execution of progress and ingenuity, so much so that we raised our top line guidance for the year and continue to project normalized operating income and EPS growth on a full year basis.
Looking ahead, I can confidently state that we are a much stronger company than before and well positioned to drive sustainable and profitable growth in the years ahead and add significant shareholder value.

291703,1673687208,2357305,"Newell Brands Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Newell Brands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter results were outstanding as the integrated set of strategies we put in place several years ago continue to drive strong financial results across all key metrics. Before getting into the details, I",1787,"Thanks, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter results were outstanding as the integrated set of strategies we put in place several years ago continue to drive strong financial results across all key metrics. 
Before getting into the details, I want to provide a little color on the current operating environment and proactive choices we are making. We delivered better-than-anticipated results in Q2 as consumer demand across our categories remained robust, and our supply chain teams did a heroic job navigating a choppy operating environment. 
To give a little perspective on the supply environment, we continue to face a number of externally driven supply challenges. As a reminder, in the second quarter of 2020, our supply chain was significantly pressured as a result of government-mandated closures across many of our facilities due to the pandemic. That was a low point for the business, and we are in a much better position today with our factories, distribution centers and retail stores open.
More recently, however, our teams have worked tirelessly to overcome various supply challenges surrounding longer lead times for sourced products, trucking capacity in the U.S. as well as labor shortages, raw material and component availability. COVID-related disruptions across ports as well as consumer demand spikes following stimulus payments have exacerbated these issues.
Early on, we took a number of proactive actions to mitigate the impact from these dynamics, including building inventory on top-selling SKUs; allowing for longer in-transit times as part of our planning process; accelerating the pace of automation where feasible; and being creative with increased incentives to attract and retain employees in factories by raising wages, further enhancing benefits and working conditions; and providing employee development programs amongst other actions.
The complexity reduction work that we executed as part of the turnaround has put us in a much better position to deal with these challenges. While we have successfully navigated these dynamics and created more agility within our supply chain, it certainly has not been easy, and the challenges are ongoing.
The other changing dynamic has been inflationary pressure. We have seen continued escalation inflation largely driven by increasing resin prices, ocean freight costs, source finished goods pricing due to a strengthening Chinese yuan and labor wage pressure. These factors are not unique to Newell and are affecting everyone in our industry. To put it in perspective, we currently expect inflation to amount to nearly $560 million in 2021. This is about $200 million worse than what we expected just 3 months ago and $350 million worse than we expected at the beginning of the year.
We are taking a number of actions to mitigate this significant inflation spike, including a more aggressive push on productivity savings, continuing to tightly manage costs, optimizing promotional spend, driving operating leverage from stronger top line growth and taking additional selective pricing later this year in categories where we are seeing the greatest impact. The net result is that we are maintaining our EPS outlook for the year, which calls for strong operating profit growth despite the significant increase in inflationary pressure.
In the U.S., we have now announced price increases across 7 of our 8 business units. These pricing actions do not fully offset the inflationary cost pressure as we are using productivity savings and operating leverage as offsets as well.
As we start to think about 2022, we expect this headwind to become a tailwind. As inflation is largely in the base, we benefit from carryover pricing, and we continue to drive productivity savings and manage costs tightly.
Moving on to second quarter performance. We delivered very strong results as demand exceeded our expectations. This yielded the better-than-anticipated outcome on top line that also flowed through to the bottom line. The company's net sales increased 28.3% year-over-year to $2.7 billion. Core sales grew 25.4% as we lapped a 12.6% decline from a year ago. Favorable foreign exchange more than offset the headwind from business and Yankee Candle retail store exits.
We saw broad-based strength during the quarter, with each of our 8 business units in all 4 geographic regions growing. Core sales in the first half of the year grew 23.3%. On a 2-year stack basis, which helps smooth out noise from the year-ago figures, we grew core sales in the low double digits both during the quarter and in the first half.
Normalized gross margin expanded to 32.7% from 31.6% in the year ago period. The benefit from FUEL productivity savings, favorable business mix and pricing more than offset a more than 700 basis point headwind from inflation, primarily related to resin-sourced finished goods transportation and labor costs.
Normalized operating margin expanded 240 basis points year-over-year to 12.6%. Gross margin improvement in combination with sales leverage and disciplined overhead cost controls more than offset the impact of an increase in advertising and promotion expense. Normalized operating profit grew 59% year-over-year to $341 million.
Net interest expense decreased by $6 million year-over-year to $65 million, reflecting about a $700 million year-over-year reduction in outstanding debt. The normalized tax rate was 15.2%, above the year ago level of 11.2% due to a higher rate impact last year from discrete tax items. Second quarter normalized diluted earnings per share were $0.56, nearly doubling year-over-year.
Now turning to our segment performance. Core sales for the Commercial Solutions segment increased 16.6%, with strong growth in both the Commercial and Connected Home & Security business units. Core sales for Home Appliances increased 15.3% primarily driven by Latin America. 
The Home Solutions segment increased core sales 33.7%, with double-digit growth in both the Food and Home Fragrance businesses. Core sales for the Learning & Development segment increased 31.6%, which reflected similar level of strong growth in both the Writing and Baby business units. Lastly, the Outdoor & Rec segment increased core sales 25.0%.
Given the meaningful business disruption from the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020, we think it is informative to compare the company's current results to the second quarter of 2019. Newell's net sales exceeded the 2019 level by 9.2% as results were higher across every segment, other than Learning & Development, which was only slightly lower.
Year-to-date through Q2, Newell generated operating cash flow of $76 million as compared to $132 million a year ago. While operating income increased substantially versus last year, that was more than offset by a temporary increase in working capital to support strong demand in 2021 and managed through longer lead times. We continued to accelerate our cash conversion cycle in the second quarter, which improved by about 14 days versus the year ago period.
We ended Q2 with a leverage ratio of 3.1x, a meaningful improvement from 4.6x a year ago and very close to our target of 3x. The year-over-year step down in Newell's leverage was driven by a combination of a net debt reduction of over $700 million as well as an almost 30% increase in trailing 12 months normalized EBITDA. We have over $2 billion in available short-term liquidity, including $637 million of cash on hand, which is a very strong position.
Before sharing our outlook for the third quarter and full year, let me walk you through our underlying assumptions as they have changed relative to late April. The macros in the U.S. are generally healthy and the consumer is still flushed with cash as a result of the stimulus benefits as well as the enhanced Child Tax Credit more recently. However, with the surge in the Delta variant across various geographies, uncertainty around the pandemic remains.
Our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes a much higher than previously contemplated forecast on top line growth; a significant year-over-year increase in advertising spending; substantial escalation and inflationary pressures, with some offset from pricing and continued traction on productivity; previously discussed supply chain constraints; as well as much more difficult comparisons as we lap a 6% core sales growth comparison from the back half of 2020.
We are still forecasting a much stronger first half relative to the second half of 2021. Our upwardly revised top line forecast for the full year 2021 implies that core sales will increase versus 2020 and 2019 in the third quarter as well as for the full year and will be up versus 2019 in the back half.
Let's discuss the full year outlook in detail. Our revised net sales guidance for 2021 is $10.1 billion to $10.35 billion, an increase from $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion previously, which implies 8% to 10% year-over-year growth. We now forecast core sales growth of 7% to 10%, which compares favorably to our previous outlook of 5% to 7%, reflecting better-than-anticipated results in Q2 as well as an improved outlook for the balance of the year. 
Currency is still expected to be a tailwind to top line, helping to more than offset the year-over-year headwind from closure of Yankee Candle retail stores and other minor business exit. We now expect a flattish normalized operating margin in 2021, around 11.1%. 
Our forecast implies that normalized operating profit increases in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, which would be a great outcome given the magnitude of inflationary pressure we are absorbing. We continue to plan for higher advertising expense versus 2020 to support new product launches and omni-channel investments. 
Our outlook continues to assume a high-teens normalized effective tax rate and a modest uptick in shares outstanding. We are maintaining our normalized earnings per share forecast at $1.63 to $1.73. Our operating cash flow guidance for full year 2021 also remains the same at approximately $1 billion, driven by improvement in the company's cash conversion cycle.
For the third quarter, we are forecasting net sales of $2.7 billion to $2.78 billion, with core sales flat to up 3%. We expect Q3 to be the peak quarter for inflation pressure, which will significantly weigh on the company's margin performance. We are forecasting normalized operating margin of 10.3% to 10.8% as compared to 14.9% in the year ago period, as inflation and a meaningful increase in advertising and promotion spending will more than offset the benefit from volume leverage, productivity and pricing. 
We expect to realize discrete tax benefits in Q3 so that the normalized effective tax rate will be in the mid-single-digit range. This translates into normalized earnings per share in the $0.46 to $0.50 range. 
We have made tremendous progress on our turnaround as demonstrated by our strong financial results. As we look forward, we are pivoting from complexity reduction to driving operational excellence in everything we do. We remain laser-focused on executing our strategy, which we believe shows a clear path to creating long-term shareholder value.

Clearly, it's a bit premature to offer a perspective on guidance, and I know you're not looking for that. Nevertheless, it's still difficult because we're now entering into -- we're coming sort of out of the pandemic, but the Delta variant is sort of lurking around. And so the second half will be an important determinant.
Having said that, I think as I said in my prepared remarks, the company is in far better shape than we have been in many years. Our brands are much stronger. We've put a lot of focus on innovation. Our Writing category is very strong. In fact, I'd say all our businesses now are in pretty good shape. 
Remember, we just talked, I think, a year ago where I had big questions about Home Appliances and Outdoor. I'm really feeling very good about what the Home Appliances team has done. Their real strength is in international, particularly in Latin America, if you look at this quarter, the fact that it was up so high. And that is what -- so we should look at Newell, not just as a U.S. business but as a global business given 1/3 of our business or so is international. And we're now going to put a lot more focus on international as well. And just you've seen how we're growing.
So I would say, long term, we're still committed to having modest top line core sales growth. I can't give you a view on '22 in particular. But I think the key is -- and there's the whole issue about the portfolio, right, where if we have very strong growth in one and some other businesses not doing as well, you leverage, like I said, this year, Writing and Home Fragrance.
But I think the good news is I'm now seeing innovation across all our businesses. The little Baby uptick was encouraging. The thing I know you're always interested in the old Baby business. And not only the innovations, but just to see there is the slightest hope on birth rates going up and then the 0 to 4 remains constant. 
So when I look at all of that, it's tough to give a sense, but look, we're very committed to being a growth company. And that is probably the best I can do for you versus giving numbers. I would hate for people to just think all the bumps we have had are just due to COVID. I really want us to show that we are a sustainable and profitable growth company."

At the end of the first quarter, we thought it was going to be $360 million, and now we're forecasting $560 million.
And so we've taken sort of around the pricing that went into effect that in late June, early July, we've announced or are announcing pricing -- additional pricing that's going into effect in the fourth quarter, in October, November. And the combination of that, I think, is not fully pricing for inflation because we're also using productivity and operating leverage and cost controls to offset, but we are pricing for a significant part of inflation, which we think is prudent. And so far, our discussions with the retailers have gone reasonably well. But we're managing it day in and day out."

And then second, I guess, maybe for you, Chris, on the pricing front. Some of your categories -- I mean my jaw dropped when you said you gained, I think, 700 points of share in gel pens.

So look, we're seeing category growth in many of our businesses. So you're seeing really -- like Baby is a good example where you're seeing double-digit category growth. But having said that, we're doing even better and that's by gaining share because of the strength of the Graco brand and all the innovations that we are launching.
And I think the -- one of the factors -- because we always go to what is the underlying reason. You're seeing a lot more -- I think people were cooped up last year, start getting vaccinated, feeling bolder to start driving into overnight trips, therefore, buying car seats. This whole grandparents effect, where people are trying to -- they're -- sometimes they're now -- they've been at COVID together, so they're buying car seats. So I think you're seeing the categories going up, and the stimulus certainly helped. And with the stimulus, there has been a tendency to go to some of the premium brands and the leaders, and Graco has really benefited. So that's a great example of that.
And specifically on Outdoor, we're doing a lot of great work. And I think we're seeing the benefits of that even more this year because Coleman was in a turnaround. I think the team has done a great job on soft coolers, for instance. They've come out with some nice steel-belted coolers, the whole dome tents that they've come out with, the OneSource. There have been a lot of innovations that have helped. And if we look at category by category, we've certainly done well.
The thing that has really been a tough problem for us on the Coleman brand has been keeping pace with demand. We have been chasing demand because we get a lot of stuff from Asia. And so this is one where we've had a real tough time keeping pace. So the demand is certainly there and it's been -- so when we think about the second half, too, the supply thing is more in our minds rather than any worries about our brands at all.
Now some of the consumption on like Food and Appliances in the U.S., there was some slowdown because last year, they were up so much. But then the good news is, look, Food, every one of our brands we're gaining share. That just goes to the power of the strength of our brands and what our teams are doing and the innovations.

And the thing that's important here, I think, is that the cost inflation that we're facing is not unique to us. It's something that the entire industry is facing. So -- and we're not fully pricing to recover, because we're using the ramp-up that we have in productivity savings, we're going to generate productivity savings this year of 3.5% to 4% of cost of goods, which is a very strong result on top of what we did last year. And that's helping to partially mitigate.
And so as we take the pricing, generally what we're hearing -- and we're monitoring it day by day, is that the whole industry is moving prices up. Now in any particular category, there could be a competitor that tries to lag us or maybe they price ahead of us. And so that's what we're monitoring sort of on a day-to-day to make sure that we don't wind up with a sustainable price gap. 
But our strategy is not to gain market share by undercutting people on price, our strategy is to gain market share by coming out with very strong product innovation that offers a superior consumer value. And that's -- when you hear us talk about market share gains, it's not because we're trying to undercut anybody on price. It's because we're driving innovation that's compelling for the consumer and for the retailer."

Schools seem like they would just kind of return to normal. And then two, everything we hear throughout the industry is supply sources and supply chain constraints.

So that does have an impact.
Having said that, it's still early days because, look, the back-to-school season has just taken off and we're still going into the height of it. And the fact that, as we said on Writing, it -- the core sales exceeded the company's average of 25% gives us great -- and look, while it was below '19, it's just a little -- it's not -- we feel pretty good about the trends. Consumption is also up. And then our market share is up, overall Writing, not just gel pens. So when I look at all of that, I feel very bullish about Writing.
And the last thing that you mentioned, which we've seen through the studies, there are a lot of schools that have advanced by, say, 5 days to 7. So that's a positive thing. And then colleges, it's sort of this 2 freshman class that's coming in. So I think we feel pretty good about what's happening on this business. And believe me, that team is very focused because they want to show that this is a top-notch business."

The other thing I would point out is -- that is a positive is some of our competitors in Writing are not as well positioned, where they're not manufacturing in the U.S. and they're suffering from some supply issues. And so supply could turn out to be a real benefit for us on the Writing business versus at least one of our major competitors."

Because obviously, we're not just talking consumer demand, but also the increased difficulty in satisfying that demand because of the externals. You sort of touched on this with respect to Writing, but kind of curious on the rest of your key businesses where you stand with respect to that. 
And I would imagine with respect to supply chain, that -- 2 things. One, sort of major categories, what your competition looks like. Again, you talked about that with Writing, but kind of curious on the other categories. And then also what you're seeing from them with respect to pricing. Is the magnitude similar? Is the timing similar? And if not, where do they differ?"

So on the supply chain, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it is a challenging external environment. And the challenges are largely due to ocean freight availability of containers, length of time it takes containerships to move from Asia to the U.S., trucking capacity in the U.S., labor availability in the U.S., some raw material and component availability depending on the business unit, and then you couple that with the consumer demand spike that we're trying to navigate and meet.
I think that we've done -- our teams have done a really a heroic job of meeting and navigating through this environment. But our guidance does contemplate that this environment remains difficult for the remainder of the year. So we are not expecting an improvement in the external environment, but we do expect us to continue to navigate it. I think the good news is that this is not an environment that's unique to Newell. This is an environment that all of our competitors face. I mentioned on Writing that I think we're better positioned than at least one of our major competitors.
The balance of our categories, I think we're largely similarly positioned. And so we don't see major gaps in our external pressure versus our direct competitors' external pressure on the whole. So that's how I would characterize the supply chain. And I think our -- part of the reason why we've given a wide guidance range is recognizing the variability and the uncertainty of that supply environment, including the ramp-up of the Delta variant, which can have an impact on that. As I said, we're shooting more for the top half of our guidance range, but we think it's prudent to maintain the guidance range given the variability in the external environment."

So I think on the inflation side is -- there are really 4 factors that are driving inflation: increased resin costs; sourced finished goods, which is largely a function of the Chinese currency strengthening versus the U.S. dollar; transportation cost",369,"Yes. So I think on the inflation side is -- there are really 4 factors that are driving inflation: increased resin costs; sourced finished goods, which is largely a function of the Chinese currency strengthening versus the U.S. dollar; transportation cost, which is, in our case, is largely ocean freight-related; and then labor pressure.
The interesting thing about that is resin is probably the biggest impact out of those 4, out of our $560 million that we're talking about this year. And one of the services that doesn't out-front forecast on resin is IHS. And at least their forecast is that we're at peak resin prices right now, and resin prices are likely to come down significantly over the next 6 to 12 months.
Now we're heading into hurricane season, and so I never want to predict whether there's going to be a hurricane that hits the Texas or Louisiana coast. But by all accounts, it feels like the resin environment is sort of peaking at the moment and is likely to get better as we head over the next 6 to 12 months.
Again, on sourced finished goods, it's hard to predict. The Chinese currency strengthened versus the U.S. dollar but has been relatively stable more recently. And so we will begin to lap that unless there's another devaluation of the U.S. dollar.
I think ocean freight is likely to remain a challenge for the next 6 to 12 months because of the capacity constraints that carriers and containers have, but this is not unique to Newell. But again, it feels like that is transitory in nature. And then I think labor costs is likely to be a sustaining inflationary pressure, but that probably is the smallest of the 4 that I mentioned.
So we think we're navigating the peak inflation environment well. We're excited that driving low single -- or I'm sorry, high single-digit to low double-digit operating income growth is what our guidance implies for this year despite this inflation. And we think that the productivity savings that we've got, the cost management that we've got and the top line momentum that we have positions us well as the inflation pressure starts to ease going forward."

On the inflation front, in Q3, as I mentioned, we do expect inflation to be peaking in Q3 of this year. So our -- of our $560 million, the biggest impact is to the third quarter on inflation, and that is a fairly dramatic impact.

I'm pleased to announce another outstanding quarter for Newell as we further built on the strong momentum from the past 3 quarters. We delivered 25% core sales growth, 59% normalized operating income growth and 87% normalized EPS growth in the quarter versus prior year. We have now delivered 4 consecutive quarters of core sales growth and experienced 5 consecutive quarters of domestic consumption growth. Based on first half 2021 sales momentum, we are raising our top line outlook for the year.
During the second quarter, core sales growth exceeded 25% as we lapped significant disruption from the pandemic. Importantly, even on a 2-year stack basis, core sales grew low double digits both in the second quarter and during the first half, showing the underlying momentum in the business. 
I'm especially pleased that once again we saw broad-based top line strength across each of our 8 business units and across major channels, with every region growing at a double-digit rate. While performance in North America was excellent as core sales grew almost 22%, international markets once again shone, registering nearly 35% core growth in the second quarter and almost 31% in the first half, with particular strength in Latin America.
7 of our top 10 beloved brands, including Coleman, Graco, Oster, Sharpie, Yankee Candle, Paper Mate and First Alert grew at a strong double-digit pace. Yankee Candle stood out as its sales nearly doubled versus last year. We delivered strong top line results even in businesses such as Food and Home Appliances that faced tough comparisons versus prior year as a result of demand spikes. 
At the same time, it was extremely encouraging to see the continued rebound in Writing as it has come roaring back, folks, roaring back. From a channel perspective, e-commerce sales growth moderated to a mid-single-digit trend, accounting for about 20% of Newell's global net sales versus peak penetration of around 24% a year ago. 
During the quarter, we saw resurgence in consumption in brick-and-mortar as recent progress on vaccine rollout and increased mobility brought people back to the stores. In fact, growth in brick-and-mortar outpaced digital as the retail industry lapped significant pandemic-related store closures and lockdowns from the second quarter 2020.
Given our ongoing investment in omni capabilities, we are well-positioned to capitalize on consumer demand regardless of which channels consumers choose to shop. We do, however, believe that over time digital penetration will continue to move up despite the potential for quarterly fluctuations as channel dynamics settle.
The U.S. economy is continuing to regain its footing. We generally saw healthy consumption during the second quarter. There has been some normalization in trend across businesses in the U.S. that experienced significant spikes in demand a year ago, such as Home Appliances and Food. At the same time, consumption accelerated in Writing, which was the victim of the pandemic last year. 
Recent consumer behavior reinforces our belief that home as the hub theme will persist well after the pandemic. The home has become central to people's lives and has truly become a sanctuary; a part-time office; a part learning center; a kid's activity zone; and the kitchen, a family hub. Newell is well-positioned to capitalize on the home-as-hub phenomenon, not only due to the composition of our business portfolio but also because of all the work we've done to reinvigorate our iconic brands and innovation funnels that enhance life at home and outside.
7 out of our 8 business units grew core sales at a double-digit rate, and we made notable progress on market share across a number of categories. Let's start with Home Fragrance, whose sales in the second quarter nearly doubled versus last year, as the business lapped retail store closures and significant disruption in our manufacturing operations due to the pandemic. Net sales increased at a strong double-digit pace relative to 2019 as well, overcoming the unfavorable impact from Yankee Candle store closures and exit from our fundraising business.
Home Fragrance was once again the star of the show, delivering the highest level of top line and consumption growth within our portfolio as we continue to gain market share, particularly in scented candles, and expanded our distribution both in the U.S. and EMEA. Although we expect the scented candle category to continue to moderate, results from a recent survey among scented candle users showed that use frequency remains high, with almost 33% of those surveyed aiming to use the product more often in the next 6 months.
I'm very excited about the long-term prospects of Home Fragrance, which is our most omni-channel business. It has strong gross margins and strong growth potential.
The Food business remained on a solid footing across all regions as core sales increased low double digits against a very difficult base period comparison. As anticipated, POS decelerated in the quarter as the category softened but remained significantly ahead of the 2019 level, as our strong brands continue to take significant share in food storage, fresh preserving and kitchen organization categories.
I'm delighted to share some of the recognitions our brands have received this year as Consumer Reports named FoodSaver as the best vacuum sealer for 2021 and Good Housekeeping chose Rubbermaid Brilliance as best food storage for 2021 and Calphalon as #1 editor's choice for best nonstick in 2021. It is so exciting to see those accolades, especially at a time when the kitchen is so important to our consumers and our innovation machine has been in full gear. This is another terrific quarter for Home Appliances business.
Core sales growth exceeded 15% even as it lapped a high-single-digit growth comparison. Once again, Latin America stole the show as we continue to leverage our e-commerce presence to reach consumers, with particularly strong results in Chile, Peru and Argentina. As expected, consumption in the U.S. is moderating against elevated levels from a year ago but remained significantly ahead of 2019.
Our needle-mover launch of Mr. Coffee Iced from fall 2020 continues to generate demand, supported by the social media campaign, Switch Up Your #Brewtine. We further broadened distribution during the second quarter with new on-trend colors. Mr. Coffee also introduced the steam espresso maker to capture consumers' heightened interest in specialty and espresso beverages. Mr. Coffee's consistent share gains on the back of innovations and great price value is impressive.
Top line momentum in our Writing business accelerated nicely on a sequential basis. Core sales growth for this business exceeded the company's total result, with every region delivering terrific growth against a suppressed base in the year ago period. The rebound across most Writing categories as more schools return to in-person learning to finish out the school year in combination with share gains in key categories, such as pens, presentation markers, permanent markers and highlighters translated into terrific consumption in the U.S. for us. Consumption was up in other parts of the world as well.
Newell's share of the gel pen segment increased over 700 basis points to 26% as our consumption nearly doubled behind our needle-mover innovation, Sharpie S-Gel, boy, do I love that pen, which continues to delight consumers and bring incremental dollars to the category. We also have POS growth in other markets, such as Australia, New Zealand and in the U.K. In the second quarter, the office channel also grew versus last year. But as expected, it has not fully come back to pre-pandemic levels due to the prevalence of flexible work arrangements.
We are encouraged by the second consecutive quarter of strong POS growth in Writing and remain optimistic about the back-to-school season with robust merchandising plans in place. Based on the latest available information, in-person instruction, which is the gold standard, is expected to make a comeback this year. According to school opening tracker by a leading industry source, for the upcoming school year, 96% of K-12 student body in the U.S. is in school districts that have already announced they will offer in-person education.
Of course, uncertainty remains to some degree given the recent spread of the Delta variant. While we are closely monitoring the situation, we remain bullish on this back-to-school season and believe we are well-positioned to win as we continue to grow sales and overall share.
During the second quarter, strong double-digit core sales growth for our Baby business was nearly identical to that of Writing, fueled by broad-based momentum across all the regions. A double-digit increase in consumption, which reflected share gains by Graco in a rapidly growing category, a benefit from stimulus funding as well as an easy comparison, all contributed to such a strong result in the U.S. 
We think that improving mobility and higher appetite by U.S. consumers to go on overnight trips by car this summer bode well for demand in car seats, the biggest subsegment of the baby gear category in our Baby business. We continue to innovate in this category. Earlier this year, Graco introduced a SnugRide SnugFit, a new line of infant car seats with integrated anti-rebound bar that provides an extra layer of safety for families.
We're also excited by a new report from the Institute of Family Studies that just came in that suggests that the U.S. may be witnessing a surprising rise in births, potentially a result of government stimulus checks and flexible work arrangements. Is there a baby boomer going on folks?
Our Commercial business unit delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of core sales growth, just shy of double digits, with strong top line momentum across all regions. Higher domestic consumption of material handling, refuse, cleaning, outdoor organization and hand protection and scouring products helped to mitigate declines in washroom solutions, which started to cycle against a significant surge in demand late in the second quarter 2020. We're seeing signs of reopening-related demand in verticals such as Foodservice, Hospitality as well as Travel & Entertainment, and also the Builder channel is really beginning to surge, but somewhat offset by softness in washroom solutions and use of sanitizers.
Core sales for the Connected Home & Security business also accelerated to a strong double-digit growth rate, lapping significant disruption in the year ago period. The team is navigating through some supply constraints as it relates to chip shortages.
Just like other businesses that were negatively impacted by the pandemic last year, we saw significant acceleration in Outdoor & Recreation as core sales increased 25%, with growth in every region and every major category. Coleman, the largest brand in this business unit, delivered terrific results as one of the largest contributors to the company's top line growth this quarter. 
While the Call of the Outdoors campaign has already bolstered the outdoor equipment category, this quarter we also saw a resurgence in sales growth for our on-the-go beverage and technical apparels businesses driven by robust demand. In beverage, Contigo's newly launched product lines are off to a strong start and are driving share gains in the hydration category. 
The power of our strategic vision, the strength of our brand and business portfolio and the focus on the turnaround have been brought to life through strong, resilient and agile execution in an ever-changing and fluid operating environment. We delivered outstanding top and bottom line results during the second quarter and first half of '21, both relative to the year ago period as well as 2019. We have gained considerable momentum on our turnaround.
Let me illustrate. We brought together a world-class leadership team who has helped unlock the passion of our people; we invested in omni-channel capabilities that have been instrumental in capturing consumer demand across all channels; substantially strengthened our innovation and marketing muscle, leveraging consumer insights and foresights; sharpened brand positioning for many of our top brands; established joint business plans with key strategic retail partners; instituted a new hybrid organization model that brings our domain experts closer to our customers and consumers while leveraging the center for scale and efficiencies; made productivity a way of life, providing both fuel for margin enhancement as well as reinvestment in the business to drive sustainable and profitable top line growth; reduced complexity, be it consolidation of ERP systems or reduction in websites or SKUs; and we have made meaningful progress in taking out overheads, improving cash conversion cycle and strengthening the balance sheet.
Importantly, we've become very skilled at managing our 8 business unit portfolio and assigning clear roles to the individual businesses and some sub-businesses. For instance, we focused on the Food, Commercial and Home Appliance business units in 2020 to leverage COVID-related consumer trends. And as some of these trends moderated, we are shoring up Writing and Home Fragrance in 2021. Our strategy is to ensure that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
As we approach the second half, we face a tough macro operating environment with unprecedented inflationary pressures that we expect will top $0.5 billion as well as extraordinary externally driven supply chain challenges. Notwithstanding the situation, I am proud of our team's resilience, execution of progress and ingenuity so much so that we raised our top line guidance for the year and continue to project normalized operating income and EPS growth on a full year basis.
Looking ahead, I can confidently state that we are a much stronger company than before and well positioned to drive sustainable and profitable growth in the years ahead and add significant shareholder value. I'd like to express my sincere and profound gratitude to all our 31,000 employees and frontline peers worldwide for their tenacity in delivering another great quarter. Our best days are truly ahead of us.
With that, over to Chris Peterson. Now please go easy on him with the questions. It is his birthday. Happy Birthday, Chris. Onwards and upwards."

Second quarter results were outstanding as the integrated set of strategies we put in place several years ago continue to drive strong financial results across all key metrics. Before getting into the details, I",1787,"Thanks, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter results were outstanding as the integrated set of strategies we put in place several years ago continue to drive strong financial results across all key metrics. 
Before getting into the details, I want to provide a little color on the current operating environment and proactive choices we are making. We delivered better-than-anticipated results in Q2 as consumer demand across our categories remained robust and our supply chain teams did a heroic job navigating a choppy operating environment. 
To give a little perspective on the supply environment, we continue to face a number of externally driven supply challenges. As a reminder, in the second quarter of 2020, our supply chain was significantly pressured as a result of government-mandated closures across many of our facilities due to the pandemic. That was a low point for the business, and we are in a much better position today with our factories, distribution centers and retail stores open.
More recently, however, our teams have worked tirelessly to overcome various supply challenges surrounding longer lead times for sourced products, trucking capacity in the U.S. as well as labor shortages, raw material and component availability. COVID-related disruptions across ports as well as consumer demand spikes following stimulus payments have exacerbated these issues.
Early on, we took a number of proactive actions to mitigate the impact from these dynamics, including building inventory on top-selling SKUs; allowing for longer in-transit times as part of our planning process; accelerating the pace of automation where feasible; and being creative with increased incentives to attract and retain employees in factories by raising wages, further enhancing benefits and working conditions and providing employee development programs amongst other actions.
The complexity reduction work that we executed as part of the turnaround has put us in a much better position to deal with these challenges. While we have successfully navigated these dynamics and created more agility within our supply chain, it certainly has not been easy, and the challenges are ongoing.
The other changing dynamic has been inflationary pressure. We have seen continued escalation inflation, largely driven by increasing resin prices, ocean freight costs, source finished goods pricing due to a strengthening Chinese yuan and labor wage pressure. These factors are not unique to Newell and are affecting everyone in our industry. To put it in perspective, we currently expect inflation to amount to nearly $560 million in 2021. This is about $200 million worse than what we expected just 3 months ago and $350 million worse than we expected at the beginning of the year.
We are taking a number of actions to mitigate this significant inflation spike, including a more aggressive push on productivity savings, continuing to tightly manage cost, optimizing promotional spend, driving operating leverage from stronger top line growth and taking additional selective pricing later this year in categories where we are seeing the greatest impact. The net result is that we are maintaining our EPS outlook for the year, which calls for strong operating profit growth despite the significant increase in inflationary pressure.
In the U.S., we have now announced price increases across 7 of our 8 business units. These pricing actions do not fully offset the inflationary cost pressure as we are using productivity savings and operating leverage as offsets as well.
As we start to think about 2022, we expect this headwind to become a tailwind. As inflation is largely in the base, we benefit from carryover pricing, and we continue to drive productivity savings and manage costs tightly.
Moving on to second quarter performance. We delivered very strong results as demand exceeded our expectations. This yielded the better-than-anticipated outcome on top line that also flowed through to the bottom line. The company's net sales increased 28.3% year-over-year to $2.7 billion. Core sales grew 25.4% as we lapped a 12.6% decline from a year ago. Favorable foreign exchange more than offset the headwind from business and Yankee Candle retail store exits.
We saw broad-based strength during the quarter, with each of our 8 business units in all 4 geographic regions growing. Core sales in the first half of the year grew 23.3%. On a 2-year stack basis, which helps smooth out noise from the year-ago figures, we grew core sales in the low double digits both during the quarter and in the first half.
Normalized gross margin expanded to 32.7% from 31.6% in the year ago period. The benefit from FUEL productivity savings, favorable business mix and pricing more than offset a more than 700 basis point headwind from inflation, primarily related to resin-sourced finished goods transportation and labor cost.
Normalized operating margin expanded 240 basis points year-over-year to 12.6%. Gross margin improvement in combination with sales leverage and disciplined overhead cost controls more than offset the impact of an increase in advertising and promotion expense. Normalized operating profit grew 59% year-over-year to $341 million.
Net interest expense decreased by $6 million year-over-year to $65 million, reflecting about a $700 million year-over-year reduction in outstanding debt. The normalized tax rate was 15.2%, above the year ago level of 11.2% due to a higher rate impact last year from discrete tax items. Second quarter normalized diluted earnings per share were $0.56, nearly doubling year-over-year.
Now turning to our segment performance. Core sales for the Commercial Solutions segment increased 16.6%, with strong growth in both the Commercial and Connected Home & Security business units. Core sales for Home Appliances increased 15.3%, primarily driven by Latin America. 
The Home Solutions segment increased core sales 33.7%, with double-digit growth in both the Food and Home Fragrance businesses. Core sales for the Learning & Development segment increased 31.6%, which reflected similar level of strong growth in both the Writing and Baby business units. Lastly, the Outdoor & Rec segment increased core sales 25.0%.
Given the meaningful business disruption from the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020, we think it is informative to compare the company's current results to the second quarter of 2019. Newell's net sales exceeded the 2019 level by 9.2% as results were higher across every segment other than Learning & Development, which was only slightly lower.
Year-to-date through Q2, Newell generated operating cash flow of $76 million as compared to $132 million a year ago. While operating income increased substantially versus last year, that was more than offset by a temporary increase in working capital to support strong demand in 2021 and managed through longer lead times. We continued to accelerate our cash conversion cycle in the second quarter, which improved by about 14 days versus the year ago period.
We ended Q2 with a leverage ratio of 3.1x, a meaningful improvement from 4.6x a year ago and very close to our target of 3x. The year-over-year step down in Newell's leverage was driven by a combination of a net debt reduction of over $700 million as well as an almost 30% increase in trailing 12 months normalized EBITDA. We have over $2 billion in available short-term liquidity, including $637 million of cash on hand, which is a very strong position.
Before sharing our outlook for the third quarter and full year, let me walk you through our underlying assumptions as they have changed relative to late April. The macros in the U.S. are generally healthy and the consumer is still flush with cash as a result of the stimulus benefits as well as the enhanced Child Tax Credit more recently. However, with the surge in the Delta variant across various geographies, uncertainty around the pandemic remains.
Our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes a much higher than previously contemplated forecast on top line growth; a significant year-over-year increase in advertising spending; substantial escalation and inflationary pressures, with some offset from pricing and continued traction on productivity; previously discussed supply chain constraints; as well as much more difficult comparisons as we lap a 6% core sales growth comparison from the back half of 2020.
We are still forecasting a much stronger first half relative to the second half of 2021. Our upwardly revised top line forecast for the full year 2021 implies that core sales will increase versus 2020 and 2019 in the third quarter as well as for the full year and will be up versus 2019 in the back half.
Let's discuss the full year outlook in detail. Our revised net sales guidance for 2021 is $10.1 billion to $10.35 billion, an increase from $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion previously, which implies 8% to 10% year-over-year growth. We now forecast core sales growth of 7% to 10%, which compares favorably to our previous outlook of 5% to 7%, reflecting better-than-anticipated results in Q2 as well as an improved outlook for the balance of the year. 
Currency is still expected to be a tailwind to top line, helping to more than offset the year-over-year headwind from closure of Yankee Candle retail stores and other minor business exit. We now expect a flattish normalized operating margin in 2021, around 11.1%. 
Our forecast implies that normalized operating profit increases in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, which would be a great outcome given the magnitude of inflationary pressure we are absorbing. We continue to plan for higher advertising expense versus 2020 to support new product launches and omni-channel investments. 
Our outlook continues to assume a high-teens normalized effective tax rate and a modest uptick in shares outstanding. We are maintaining our normalized earnings per share forecast at $1.63 to $1.73. Our operating cash flow guidance for full year 2021 also remains the same at approximately $1 billion, driven by improvement in the company's cash conversion cycle.
For the third quarter, we are forecasting net sales of $2.7 billion to $2.78 billion, with core sales flat to up 3%. We expect Q3 to be the peak quarter for inflation pressure, which will significantly weigh on the company's margin performance. We are forecasting normalized operating margin of 10.3% to 10.8% as compared to 14.9% in the year ago period, as inflation and a meaningful increase in advertising and promotion spending will more than offset the benefit from volume leverage, productivity and pricing. 
We expect to realize discrete tax benefits in Q3 so that the normalized effective tax rate will be in the mid-single-digit range. This translates into normalized earnings per share in the $0.46 to $0.50 range. 
We have made tremendous progress on our turnaround as demonstrated by our strong financial results. As we look forward, we are pivoting from complexity reduction to driving operational excellence in everything we do. We remain laser-focused on executing our strategy, which we believe shows a clear path to creating long-term shareholder value.

Clearly, it's a bit premature to offer a perspective on guidance, and I know you're not looking for that. Nevertheless, it's still difficult because we're now entering into -- we're coming sort of out of the pandemic but the Delta variant is sort of lurking around, and so the second half will be an important determinant.
Having said that, I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, the company is in far better shape than we have been in many years. Our brands are much stronger. We've put a lot of focus on innovation. Our Writing category is very strong. In fact, I'd say all our businesses now are in pretty good shape. 
Remember, we just talked, I think, a year ago where I had big questions about Home Appliances and Outdoor. And I'm really feeling very good about what the Home Appliances team has done. Their real strength is in international, particularly in Latin America, if you look at this quarter, the fact that it was up so high. And that is what -- so we should look at Newell not just as a U.S. business but as a global business given 1/3 of our business or so is international. And we're now going to put a lot more focus on international as well. And just you've seen how we're growing.
So I would say, long term, we're still committed to having modest top line core sales growth. I can't give you a view on '22 in particular. But I think the key is -- and there's the whole issue about the portfolio, right, where if we have very strong growth in one and some other businesses not doing as well, you leverage, like I said, this year, Writing and Home Fragrance.
But I think the good news is, I'm now seeing innovation across all our businesses. The little Baby uptick was encouraging. The thing I know you're always interested in the old Baby business, and not only the innovations but just to see there is the slightest hope on birth rates going up and then the 0 to 4 remains constant. 
So when I look at all of that, it's tough to give a sense, but look, we're very committed to being a growth company. And that is probably the best I can do for you versus giving numbers. I would hate for people to just think all the bumps we have had are just due to COVID. I really want us to show that we are a sustainable and profitable growth company."

At the end of the first quarter, we thought it was going to be $360 million, and now we're forecasting $560 million.
And so we've taken sort of around the pricing that went into effect that in late June, early July, we've announced or are announcing pricing -- additional pricing that's going into effect in the fourth quarter, in October, November. And the combination of that, I think, is not fully pricing for inflation because we're also using productivity and operating leverage and cost controls to offset, but we are pricing for a significant part of inflation, which we think is prudent. And so far, our discussions with the retailers have gone reasonably well. But we're managing it day in and day out."

So look, we're seeing category growth in many of our businesses. So you're seeing really -- like Baby is a good example where you're seeing double-digit category growth. But having said that, we're doing even better and that's why gaining share because the strength of the Graco brand and all the innovations that we are launching.
And I think the -- one of the factors -- because we always go to what is the underlying reason, you're seeing a lot more -- I think people were cooped up last year, start getting vaccinated, feeling bolder to start driving into overnight trips, therefore, buying car seats. This whole grandparents effect, where people are trying to -- they're -- sometimes they're now -- they've been at COVID together, so they're buying car seats. So I think you're seeing the categories going up, and the stimulus certainly helped. And with the stimulus, there has been a tendency to go to some of the premium brands and the leaders, and Graco has really benefited. So that's a great example of that.
And specifically on Outdoor, we're doing a lot of great work. And I think we're seeing the benefits of that even more this year because Coleman was in a turnaround. I think the team has done a great job on soft coolers, for instance. They've come out with some nice steel-belted coolers, the whole dome tents that they've come out with, the OneSource. There have been a lot of innovations that have helped. And if we look at category by category, we've certainly done well.
The thing that has really been a tough problem for us on the Coleman brand has been keeping pace with demand. We have been chasing demand because we get a lot of stuff from Asia. And so this is one where we've had a real tough time keeping pace. So the demand is certainly there and it's been -- so when we think about the second half, too, the supply thing is more in our minds rather than any worries about our brands at all.
Now some of the consumption on like Food and Appliances in the U.S., there was some slowdown because last year, they were up so much. But then the good news is, look, Food, every one of our brands we're gaining share. That just goes to the power of the strength of our brands and what our teams are doing and the innovations.

And the thing that's important here, I think, is that the cost inflation that we're facing is not unique to us. It's something that the entire industry is facing. So -- and we're not fully pricing to recover because we're using the ramp-up that we have in productivity savings. We're going to generate productivity savings this year of 3.5% to 4% of cost of goods, which is a very strong result on top of what we did last year. And that's helping to partially mitigate.
And so as we take the pricing, generally what we're hearing, and we're monitoring it day by day, is that the whole industry is moving prices up. Now in any particular category, there could be a competitor that tries to lag us or maybe they price ahead of us. And so that's what we're monitoring sort of on a day-to-day to make sure that we don't wind up with a sustainable price gap. 
But our strategy is not to gain market share by undercutting people on price. Our strategy is to gain market share by coming out with very strong product innovation that offers a superior consumer value. And that's -- when you hear us talk about market share gains, it's not because we're trying to undercut anybody on price.

In the release, you said, obviously, consumption or sales were still below 2019 levels, and that makes sense. April, May, most of us -- and even June, July, still working from home. But -- and it seems like most businesses are kind of targeting a post-Labor Day return, Delta variant aside, schools here in Georgia and elsewhere, I mean, start in the next few weeks. 
So trying to understand, is there a pent-up -- 2 questions there. One, do you think there's pent-up demand just from the past 12, 18 months where you could be well above 2019 levels, especially on the office side? Schools seem like they would just kind of return to normal. And then two, everything we hear throughout the industry is supply shortages and supply chain constraints. Do you have the bandwidth or the supply available to meet that need if there is that kind of surge? Or could there be out of stocks or issues where you can't capture the full demand over these next 3, 4 months?"

Look, our fervent wish is to try and get back to 2019 levels on Writing, and the team is really focused on that. Having said that, the -- you pointed out the whole -- there is the office component of this. 
Now despite the fact that you're hearing all the stuff on the media and people going back to September, but the Delta variant is also creating -- already, you've seen some companies announce shifts through October. We went to NPD and looked at the survey. They had done a very good quantitative one, where we saw -- I think they're forecasting that at least 1/3 of people will continue to be hybrid for a while. So that does have an impact.
Having said that, it's still early days because, look, the back-to-school season has just taken off and we're still going into the height of it. And the fact that, as we said on Writing, it -- the core sales exceeded the company's average of 25% gives us great -- and look, while it was below '19, it's just a little -- it's not -- we feel pretty good about the trends. Consumption is also up. And then our market share is up, overall Writing, not just gel pens. So when I look at all of that, I feel very bullish about Writing.
And the last thing that you mentioned, which we've seen through the studies, there are a lot of schools that have advanced by, say, 5 days to 7. So that's a positive thing. And then colleges, it's sort of this 2 freshman class that's coming in. So I think we feel pretty good about what's happening on this business. And believe me, that team is very focused because they want to show that this is a top-notch business."

The other thing I would point out is -- that is a positive is some of our competitors in Writing are not as well-positioned, where they're not manufacturing in the U.S. and they're suffering from some supply issues. And so supply could turn out to be a real benefit for us on the Writing business versus at least one of our major competitors."

We plan to maintain our current dividend. We are getting close to the leverage target that we set of 3.0x or 3.1x. And I think beyond that, we'll start to look at things like share repurchase as well as tuck-in acquisitions to the extent that we think they can be significant value accretive to the company.

Because obviously, we're not just talking consumer demand but also the increased difficulty in satisfying that demand because of the externals. You sort of touched on this with respect to Writing, but kind of curious on the rest of your key businesses where you stand with respect to that. 
And I would imagine with respect to supply chain, that -- 2 things. One, sort of major categories, what your competition looks like. Again, you talked about that with Writing, but kind of curious on the other categories. And then also what you're seeing from them with respect to pricing. Is the magnitude similar? Is the timing similar? And if not, where do they differ?"

So on the supply chain, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it is a challenging external environment. And the challenges are largely due to ocean freight, availability of containers, length of time it takes containerships to move from Asia to the U.S., trucking capacity in the U.S., labor availability in the U.S., some raw material and component availability depending on the business unit, and then you couple that with the consumer demand spike that we're trying to navigate and meet.
I think that we've done -- our teams have done a really a heroic job of meeting and navigating through this environment. But our guidance does contemplate that this environment remains difficult for the remainder of the year. So we are not expecting an improvement in the external environment, but we do expect us to continue to navigate it. I think the good news is that this is not an environment that's unique to Newell. This is an environment that all of our competitors face. I mentioned on Writing that I think we're better positioned than at least one of our major competitors.
The balance of our categories, I think we're largely similarly positioned. And so we don't see major gaps in our external pressure versus our direct competitors' external pressure on the whole. So that's how I would characterize the supply chain. And I think our -- part of the reason why we've given a wide guidance range is recognizing the variability and the uncertainty of that supply environment, including the ramp-up of the Delta variant, which can have an impact on that. As I said, we're shooting more for the top half of our guidance range, but we think it's prudent to maintain the guidance range given the variability in the external environment."

So I think on the inflation side is -- there are really 4 factors that are driving inflation: increased resin costs; sourced finished goods, which is largely a function of the Chinese currency strengthening versus the U.S. dollar; transportation cost",370,"Yes. So I think on the inflation side is -- there are really 4 factors that are driving inflation: increased resin costs; sourced finished goods, which is largely a function of the Chinese currency strengthening versus the U.S. dollar; transportation cost, which is, in our case, is largely ocean freight-related; and then labor pressure.
The interesting thing about that is resin is probably the biggest impact out of those 4, out of our $560 million that we're talking about this year. And one of the services that doesn't out-front forecast on resin is IHS. And at least their forecast is that we're at peak resin prices right now and resin prices are likely to come down significantly over the next 6 to 12 months.
Now we're heading into hurricane season, and so I never want to predict whether there's going to be a hurricane that hits the Texas or Louisiana coast. But by all accounts, it feels like the resin environment is sort of peaking at the moment and is likely to get better as we head over the next 6 to 12 months.
Again, on sourced finished goods, it's hard to predict. The Chinese currency strengthened versus the U.S. dollar but has been relatively stable more recently. And so we will begin to lap that unless there's another devaluation of the U.S. dollar.
I think ocean freight is likely to remain a challenge for the next 6 to 12 months because of the capacity constraints that carriers and containers have, but this is not unique to Newell. But again, it feels like that is transitory in nature. And then I think labor cost is likely to be a sustaining inflationary pressure, but that probably is the smallest of the 4 that I mentioned.
So we think we're navigating the peak inflation environment well. We're excited that we're driving low single -- or I'm sorry, high single-digit to low double-digit operating income growth is what our guidance implies for this year despite this inflation. And we think that the productivity savings that we've got, the cost management that we've got and the top line momentum that we have positions us well as the inflation pressure starts to ease going forward."

We also have much stronger innovation in the market this year. And so advertising costs are up significantly this year versus last year both in dollar terms and in percentage terms.
On the inflation front, in Q3, as I mentioned, we do expect inflation to be peaking in Q3 of this year. So our -- of our $560 million, the biggest impact is to the third quarter on inflation, and that is a fairly dramatic impact. We are mitigating that to a significant extent through productivity actions and through cost containment and some volume leverage.

I'm pleased to announce another outstanding quarter for Newell as we further built on the strong momentum from the past 3 quarters. We delivered 25% core sales growth, 59% normalized operating income growth and 87% normalized EPS growth in the quarter versus prior year. We have now delivered 4 consecutive quarters of core sales growth and experienced 5 consecutive quarters of domestic consumption growth. Based on first half 2021 sales momentum, we are raising our top line outlook for the year.
During the second quarter, core sales growth exceeded 25% as we lapped significant disruption from the pandemic. Importantly, even on a 2-year stack basis, core sales grew low double digits both in the second quarter and during the first half, showing the underlying momentum in the business. 
I'm especially pleased that once again we saw broad-based top line strength across each of our 8 business units and across major channels, with every region growing at a double-digit rate. While performance in North America was excellent as core sales grew almost 22%, international markets once again shone, registering nearly 35% core growth in the second quarter and almost 31% in the first half, with particular strength in Latin America.
7 of our top 10 beloved brands, including Coleman, Graco, Oster, Sharpie, Yankee Candle, Paper Mate and First Alert grew at a strong double-digit pace. Yankee Candle stood out as its sales nearly doubled versus last year. We delivered strong top line results even in businesses such as Food and Home Appliances that faced tough comparisons versus prior year as a result of demand spikes. 
At the same time, it was extremely encouraging to see the continued rebound in Writing as it has come roaring back, folks, roaring back. From a channel perspective, e-commerce sales growth moderated to a mid-single-digit trend, accounting for about 20% of Newell's global net sales versus peak penetration of around 24% a year ago. 
During the quarter, we saw resurgence in consumption in brick-and-mortar as recent progress on vaccine rollout and increased mobility brought people back to the stores. In fact, growth in brick-and-mortar outpaced digital as the retail industry lapped significant pandemic-related store closures and lockdowns from the second quarter 2020.
Given our ongoing investment in omni capabilities, we are well-positioned to capitalize on consumer demand regardless of which channels consumers choose to shop. We do, however, believe that over time digital penetration will continue to move up despite the potential for quarterly fluctuations as channel dynamics settle.
The U.S. economy is continuing to regain its footing. We generally saw healthy consumption during the second quarter. There has been some normalization in trend across businesses in the U.S. that experienced significant spikes in demand a year ago, such as Home Appliances and Food. At the same time, consumption accelerated in Writing, which was the victim of the pandemic last year. 
Recent consumer behavior reinforces our belief that home as the hub theme will persist well after the pandemic. The home has become central to people's lives and has truly become a sanctuary; a part-time office; a part learning center; a kid's activity zone; and the kitchen, a family hub. Newell is well-positioned to capitalize on the home-as-hub phenomenon, not only due to the composition of our business portfolio but also because of all the work we've done to reinvigorate our iconic brands and innovation funnels that enhance life at home and outside.
7 out of our 8 business units grew core sales at a double-digit rate, and we made notable progress on market share across a number of categories. Let's start with Home Fragrance, whose sales in the second quarter nearly doubled versus last year, as the business lapped retail store closures and significant disruption in our manufacturing operations due to the pandemic. Net sales increased at a strong double-digit pace relative to 2019 as well, overcoming the unfavorable impact from Yankee Candle store closures and exit from our fundraising business.
Home Fragrance was once again the star of the show, delivering the highest level of top line and consumption growth within our portfolio as we continue to gain market share, particularly in scented candles, and expanded our distribution both in the U.S. and EMEA. Although we expect the scented candle category to continue to moderate, results from a recent survey among scented candle users showed that use frequency remains high, with almost 33% of those surveyed aiming to use the product more often in the next 6 months.
I'm very excited about the long-term prospects of Home Fragrance, which is our most omni-channel business. It has strong gross margins and strong growth potential.
The Food business remained on a solid footing across all regions as core sales increased low double digits against a very difficult base period comparison. As anticipated, POS decelerated in the quarter as the category softened but remained significantly ahead of the 2019 level, as our strong brands continue to take significant share in food storage, fresh preserving and kitchen organization categories.
I'm delighted to share some of the recognitions our brands have received this year as Consumer Reports named FoodSaver as the best vacuum sealer for 2021 and Good Housekeeping chose Rubbermaid Brilliance as best food storage for 2021 and Calphalon as #1 editor's choice for best nonstick in 2021. It is so exciting to see those accolades, especially at a time when the kitchen is so important to our consumers and our innovation machine has been in full gear. This is another terrific quarter for Home Appliances business.
Core sales growth exceeded 15% even as it lapped a high-single-digit growth comparison. Once again, Latin America stole the show as we continue to leverage our e-commerce presence to reach consumers, with particularly strong results in Chile, Peru and Argentina. As expected, consumption in the U.S. is moderating against elevated levels from a year ago but remained significantly ahead of 2019.
Our needle-mover launch of Mr. Coffee Iced from fall 2020 continues to generate demand, supported by the social media campaign, Switch Up Your #Brewtine. We further broadened distribution during the second quarter with new on-trend colors. Mr. Coffee also introduced the steam espresso maker to capture consumers' heightened interest in specialty and espresso beverages. Mr. Coffee's consistent share gains on the back of innovations and great price value is impressive.
Top line momentum in our Writing business accelerated nicely on a sequential basis. Core sales growth for this business exceeded the company's total result, with every region delivering terrific growth against a suppressed base in the year ago period. The rebound across most Writing categories as more schools return to in-person learning to finish out the school year in combination with share gains in key categories, such as pens, presentation markers, permanent markers and highlighters translated into terrific consumption in the U.S. for us. Consumption was up in other parts of the world as well.
Newell's share of the gel pen segment increased over 700 basis points to 26% as our consumption nearly doubled behind our needle-mover innovation, Sharpie S-Gel, boy, do I love that pen, which continues to delight consumers and bring incremental dollars to the category. We also have POS growth in other markets, such as Australia, New Zealand and in the U.K. In the second quarter, the office channel also grew versus last year. But as expected, it has not fully come back to pre-pandemic levels due to the prevalence of flexible work arrangements.
We are encouraged by the second consecutive quarter of strong POS growth in Writing and remain optimistic about the back-to-school season with robust merchandising plans in place. Based on the latest available information, in-person instruction, which is the gold standard, is expected to make a comeback this year. According to school opening tracker by a leading industry source, for the upcoming school year, 96% of K-12 student body in the U.S. is in school districts that have already announced they will offer in-person education.
Of course, uncertainty remains to some degree given the recent spread of the Delta variant. While we are closely monitoring the situation, we remain bullish on this back-to-school season and believe we are well-positioned to win as we continue to grow sales and overall share.
During the second quarter, strong double-digit core sales growth for our Baby business was nearly identical to that of Writing, fueled by broad-based momentum across all the regions. A double-digit increase in consumption, which reflected share gains by Graco in a rapidly growing category, a benefit from stimulus funding as well as an easy comparison, all contributed to such a strong result in the U.S. 
We think that improving mobility and higher appetite by U.S. consumers to go on overnight trips by car this summer bode well for demand in car seats, the biggest subsegment of the baby gear category in our Baby business. We continue to innovate in this category. Earlier this year, Graco introduced a SnugRide SnugFit, a new line of infant car seats with integrated anti-rebound bar that provides an extra layer of safety for families.
We're also excited by a new report from the Institute of Family Studies that just came in that suggests that the U.S. may be witnessing a surprising rise in births, potentially a result of government stimulus checks and flexible work arrangements. Is there a baby boomer going on folks?
Our Commercial business unit delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of core sales growth, just shy of double digits, with strong top line momentum across all regions. Higher domestic consumption of material handling, refuse, cleaning, outdoor organization and hand protection and scouring products helped to mitigate declines in washroom solutions, which started to cycle against a significant surge in demand late in the second quarter 2020. We're seeing signs of reopening-related demand in verticals such as Foodservice, Hospitality as well as Travel & Entertainment, and also the Builder channel is really beginning to surge, but somewhat offset by softness in washroom solutions and use of sanitizers.
Core sales for the Connected Home & Security business also accelerated to a strong double-digit growth rate, lapping significant disruption in the year ago period. The team is navigating through some supply constraints as it relates to chip shortages.
Just like other businesses that were negatively impacted by the pandemic last year, we saw significant acceleration in Outdoor & Recreation as core sales increased 25%, with growth in every region and every major category. Coleman, the largest brand in this business unit, delivered terrific results as one of the largest contributors to the company's top line growth this quarter. 
While the Call of the Outdoors campaign has already bolstered the outdoor equipment category, this quarter we also saw a resurgence in sales growth for our on-the-go beverage and technical apparels businesses driven by robust demand. In beverage, Contigo's newly launched product lines are off to a strong start and are driving share gains in the hydration category. 
The power of our strategic vision, the strength of our brand and business portfolio and the focus on the turnaround have been brought to life through strong, resilient and agile execution in an ever-changing and fluid operating environment. We delivered outstanding top and bottom line results during the second quarter and first half of '21, both relative to the year ago period as well as 2019. We have gained considerable momentum on our turnaround.
Let me illustrate. We brought together a world-class leadership team who has helped unlock the passion of our people; we invested in omni-channel capabilities that have been instrumental in capturing consumer demand across all channels; substantially strengthened our innovation and marketing muscle, leveraging consumer insights and foresights; sharpened brand positioning for many of our top brands; established joint business plans with key strategic retail partners; instituted a new hybrid organization model that brings our domain experts closer to our customers and consumers while leveraging the center for scale and efficiencies; made productivity a way of life, providing both fuel for margin enhancement as well as reinvestment in the business to drive sustainable and profitable top line growth; reduced complexity, be it consolidation of ERP systems or reduction in websites or SKUs; and we have made meaningful progress in taking out overheads, improving cash conversion cycle and strengthening the balance sheet.
Importantly, we've become very skilled at managing our 8 business unit portfolio and assigning clear roles to the individual businesses and some sub-businesses. For instance, we focused on the Food, Commercial and Home Appliance business units in 2020 to leverage COVID-related consumer trends. And as some of these trends moderated, we are shoring up Writing and Home Fragrance in 2021. Our strategy is to ensure that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
As we approach the second half, we face a tough macro operating environment with unprecedented inflationary pressures that we expect will top $0.5 billion as well as extraordinary externally driven supply chain challenges. Notwithstanding the situation, I am proud of our team's resilience, execution of progress and ingenuity so much so that we raised our top line guidance for the year and continue to project normalized operating income and EPS growth on a full year basis.
Looking ahead, I can confidently state that we are a much stronger company than before and well positioned to drive sustainable and profitable growth in the years ahead and add significant shareholder value. I'd like to express my sincere and profound gratitude to all our 31,000 employees and frontline peers worldwide for their tenacity in delivering another great quarter. Our best days are truly ahead of us.
With that, over to Chris Peterson. Now please go easy on him with the questions. It is his birthday. Happy Birthday, Chris. Onwards and upwards."

Second quarter results were outstanding as the integrated set of strategies we put in place several years ago continue to drive strong financial results across all key metrics. Before getting into the details, I",1787,"Thanks, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter results were outstanding as the integrated set of strategies we put in place several years ago continue to drive strong financial results across all key metrics. 
Before getting into the details, I want to provide a little color on the current operating environment and proactive choices we are making. We delivered better-than-anticipated results in Q2 as consumer demand across our categories remained robust and our supply chain teams did a heroic job navigating a choppy operating environment. 
To give a little perspective on the supply environment, we continue to face a number of externally driven supply challenges. As a reminder, in the second quarter of 2020, our supply chain was significantly pressured as a result of government-mandated closures across many of our facilities due to the pandemic. That was a low point for the business, and we are in a much better position today with our factories, distribution centers and retail stores open.
More recently, however, our teams have worked tirelessly to overcome various supply challenges surrounding longer lead times for sourced products, trucking capacity in the U.S. as well as labor shortages, raw material and component availability. COVID-related disruptions across ports as well as consumer demand spikes following stimulus payments have exacerbated these issues.
Early on, we took a number of proactive actions to mitigate the impact from these dynamics, including building inventory on top-selling SKUs; allowing for longer in-transit times as part of our planning process; accelerating the pace of automation where feasible; and being creative with increased incentives to attract and retain employees in factories by raising wages, further enhancing benefits and working conditions and providing employee development programs amongst other actions.
The complexity reduction work that we executed as part of the turnaround has put us in a much better position to deal with these challenges. While we have successfully navigated these dynamics and created more agility within our supply chain, it certainly has not been easy, and the challenges are ongoing.
The other changing dynamic has been inflationary pressure. We have seen continued escalation inflation, largely driven by increasing resin prices, ocean freight costs, source finished goods pricing due to a strengthening Chinese yuan and labor wage pressure. These factors are not unique to Newell and are affecting everyone in our industry. To put it in perspective, we currently expect inflation to amount to nearly $560 million in 2021. This is about $200 million worse than what we expected just 3 months ago and $350 million worse than we expected at the beginning of the year.
We are taking a number of actions to mitigate this significant inflation spike, including a more aggressive push on productivity savings, continuing to tightly manage cost, optimizing promotional spend, driving operating leverage from stronger top line growth and taking additional selective pricing later this year in categories where we are seeing the greatest impact. The net result is that we are maintaining our EPS outlook for the year, which calls for strong operating profit growth despite the significant increase in inflationary pressure.
In the U.S., we have now announced price increases across 7 of our 8 business units. These pricing actions do not fully offset the inflationary cost pressure as we are using productivity savings and operating leverage as offsets as well.
As we start to think about 2022, we expect this headwind to become a tailwind. As inflation is largely in the base, we benefit from carryover pricing, and we continue to drive productivity savings and manage costs tightly.
Moving on to second quarter performance. We delivered very strong results as demand exceeded our expectations. This yielded the better-than-anticipated outcome on top line that also flowed through to the bottom line. The company's net sales increased 28.3% year-over-year to $2.7 billion. Core sales grew 25.4% as we lapped a 12.6% decline from a year ago. Favorable foreign exchange more than offset the headwind from business and Yankee Candle retail store exits.
We saw broad-based strength during the quarter, with each of our 8 business units in all 4 geographic regions growing. Core sales in the first half of the year grew 23.3%. On a 2-year stack basis, which helps smooth out noise from the year-ago figures, we grew core sales in the low double digits both during the quarter and in the first half.
Normalized gross margin expanded to 32.7% from 31.6% in the year ago period. The benefit from FUEL productivity savings, favorable business mix and pricing more than offset a more than 700 basis point headwind from inflation, primarily related to resin-sourced finished goods transportation and labor cost.
Normalized operating margin expanded 240 basis points year-over-year to 12.6%. Gross margin improvement in combination with sales leverage and disciplined overhead cost controls more than offset the impact of an increase in advertising and promotion expense. Normalized operating profit grew 59% year-over-year to $341 million.
Net interest expense decreased by $6 million year-over-year to $65 million, reflecting about a $700 million year-over-year reduction in outstanding debt. The normalized tax rate was 15.2%, above the year ago level of 11.2% due to a higher rate impact last year from discrete tax items. Second quarter normalized diluted earnings per share were $0.56, nearly doubling year-over-year.
Now turning to our segment performance. Core sales for the Commercial Solutions segment increased 16.6%, with strong growth in both the Commercial and Connected Home & Security business units. Core sales for Home Appliances increased 15.3%, primarily driven by Latin America. 
The Home Solutions segment increased core sales 33.7%, with double-digit growth in both the Food and Home Fragrance businesses. Core sales for the Learning & Development segment increased 31.6%, which reflected similar level of strong growth in both the Writing and Baby business units. Lastly, the Outdoor & Rec segment increased core sales 25.0%.
Given the meaningful business disruption from the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020, we think it is informative to compare the company's current results to the second quarter of 2019. Newell's net sales exceeded the 2019 level by 9.2% as results were higher across every segment other than Learning & Development, which was only slightly lower.
Year-to-date through Q2, Newell generated operating cash flow of $76 million as compared to $132 million a year ago. While operating income increased substantially versus last year, that was more than offset by a temporary increase in working capital to support strong demand in 2021 and managed through longer lead times. We continued to accelerate our cash conversion cycle in the second quarter, which improved by about 14 days versus the year ago period.
We ended Q2 with a leverage ratio of 3.1x, a meaningful improvement from 4.6x a year ago and very close to our target of 3x. The year-over-year step down in Newell's leverage was driven by a combination of a net debt reduction of over $700 million as well as an almost 30% increase in trailing 12 months normalized EBITDA. We have over $2 billion in available short-term liquidity, including $637 million of cash on hand, which is a very strong position.
Before sharing our outlook for the third quarter and full year, let me walk you through our underlying assumptions as they have changed relative to late April. The macros in the U.S. are generally healthy and the consumer is still flush with cash as a result of the stimulus benefits as well as the enhanced Child Tax Credit more recently. However, with the surge in the Delta variant across various geographies, uncertainty around the pandemic remains.
Our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes a much higher than previously contemplated forecast on top line growth; a significant year-over-year increase in advertising spending; substantial escalation and inflationary pressures, with some offset from pricing and continued traction on productivity; previously discussed supply chain constraints; as well as much more difficult comparisons as we lap a 6% core sales growth comparison from the back half of 2020.
We are still forecasting a much stronger first half relative to the second half of 2021. Our upwardly revised top line forecast for the full year 2021 implies that core sales will increase versus 2020 and 2019 in the third quarter as well as for the full year and will be up versus 2019 in the back half.
Let's discuss the full year outlook in detail. Our revised net sales guidance for 2021 is $10.1 billion to $10.35 billion, an increase from $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion previously, which implies 8% to 10% year-over-year growth. We now forecast core sales growth of 7% to 10%, which compares favorably to our previous outlook of 5% to 7%, reflecting better-than-anticipated results in Q2 as well as an improved outlook for the balance of the year. 
Currency is still expected to be a tailwind to top line, helping to more than offset the year-over-year headwind from closure of Yankee Candle retail stores and other minor business exit. We now expect a flattish normalized operating margin in 2021, around 11.1%. 
Our forecast implies that normalized operating profit increases in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, which would be a great outcome given the magnitude of inflationary pressure we are absorbing. We continue to plan for higher advertising expense versus 2020 to support new product launches and omni-channel investments. 
Our outlook continues to assume a high-teens normalized effective tax rate and a modest uptick in shares outstanding. We are maintaining our normalized earnings per share forecast at $1.63 to $1.73. Our operating cash flow guidance for full year 2021 also remains the same at approximately $1 billion, driven by improvement in the company's cash conversion cycle.
For the third quarter, we are forecasting net sales of $2.7 billion to $2.78 billion, with core sales flat to up 3%. We expect Q3 to be the peak quarter for inflation pressure, which will significantly weigh on the company's margin performance. We are forecasting normalized operating margin of 10.3% to 10.8% as compared to 14.9% in the year ago period, as inflation and a meaningful increase in advertising and promotion spending will more than offset the benefit from volume leverage, productivity and pricing. 
We expect to realize discrete tax benefits in Q3 so that the normalized effective tax rate will be in the mid-single-digit range. This translates into normalized earnings per share in the $0.46 to $0.50 range. 
We have made tremendous progress on our turnaround as demonstrated by our strong financial results. As we look forward, we are pivoting from complexity reduction to driving operational excellence in everything we do. We remain laser-focused on executing our strategy, which we believe shows a clear path to creating long-term shareholder value.

Clearly, it's a bit premature to offer a perspective on guidance, and I know you're not looking for that. Nevertheless, it's still difficult because we're now entering into -- we're coming sort of out of the pandemic but the Delta variant is sort of lurking around, and so the second half will be an important determinant.
Having said that, I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, the company is in far better shape than we have been in many years. Our brands are much stronger. We've put a lot of focus on innovation. Our Writing category is very strong. In fact, I'd say all our businesses now are in pretty good shape. 
Remember, we just talked, I think, a year ago where I had big questions about Home Appliances and Outdoor. And I'm really feeling very good about what the Home Appliances team has done. Their real strength is in international, particularly in Latin America, if you look at this quarter, the fact that it was up so high. And that is what -- so we should look at Newell not just as a U.S. business but as a global business given 1/3 of our business or so is international. And we're now going to put a lot more focus on international as well. And just you've seen how we're growing.
So I would say, long term, we're still committed to having modest top line core sales growth. I can't give you a view on '22 in particular. But I think the key is -- and there's the whole issue about the portfolio, right, where if we have very strong growth in one and some other businesses not doing as well, you leverage, like I said, this year, Writing and Home Fragrance.
But I think the good news is, I'm now seeing innovation across all our businesses. The little Baby uptick was encouraging. The thing I know you're always interested in the old Baby business, and not only the innovations but just to see there is the slightest hope on birth rates going up and then the 0 to 4 remains constant. 
So when I look at all of that, it's tough to give a sense, but look, we're very committed to being a growth company. And that is probably the best I can do for you versus giving numbers. I would hate for people to just think all the bumps we have had are just due to COVID. I really want us to show that we are a sustainable and profitable growth company."

And so we've taken sort of around the pricing that went into effect that in late June, early July, we've announced or are announcing pricing -- additional pricing that's going into effect in the fourth quarter, in October, November. And the combination of that, I think, is not fully pricing for inflation because we're also using productivity and operating leverage and cost controls to offset, but we are pricing for a significant part of inflation, which we think is prudent. And so far, our discussions with the retailers have gone reasonably well. But we're managing it day in and day out."

So look, we're seeing category growth in many of our businesses. So you're seeing really -- like Baby is a good example where you're seeing double-digit category growth. But having said that, we're doing even better and that's why gaining share because the strength of the Graco brand and all the innovations that we are launching.
And I think the -- one of the factors -- because we always go to what is the underlying reason, you're seeing a lot more -- I think people were cooped up last year, start getting vaccinated, feeling bolder to start driving into overnight trips, therefore, buying car seats. This whole grandparents effect, where people are trying to -- they're -- sometimes they're now -- they've been at COVID together, so they're buying car seats. So I think you're seeing the categories going up, and the stimulus certainly helped. And with the stimulus, there has been a tendency to go to some of the premium brands and the leaders, and Graco has really benefited. So that's a great example of that.
And specifically on Outdoor, we're doing a lot of great work. And I think we're seeing the benefits of that even more this year because Coleman was in a turnaround. I think the team has done a great job on soft coolers, for instance. They've come out with some nice steel-belted coolers, the whole dome tents that they've come out with, the OneSource. There have been a lot of innovations that have helped. And if we look at category by category, we've certainly done well.
The thing that has really been a tough problem for us on the Coleman brand has been keeping pace with demand. We have been chasing demand because we get a lot of stuff from Asia. And so this is one where we've had a real tough time keeping pace. So the demand is certainly there and it's been -- so when we think about the second half, too, the supply thing is more in our minds rather than any worries about our brands at all.
Now some of the consumption on like Food and Appliances in the U.S., there was some slowdown because last year, they were up so much. But then the good news is, look, Food, every one of our brands we're gaining share. That just goes to the power of the strength of our brands and what our teams are doing and the innovations.

And the thing that's important here, I think, is that the cost inflation that we're facing is not unique to us. It's something that the entire industry is facing. So -- and we're not fully pricing to recover because we're using the ramp-up that we have in productivity savings. We're going to generate productivity savings this year of 3.5% to 4% of cost of goods, which is a very strong result on top of what we did last year. And that's helping to partially mitigate.
And so as we take the pricing, generally what we're hearing, and we're monitoring it day by day, is that the whole industry is moving prices up. Now in any particular category, there could be a competitor that tries to lag us or maybe they price ahead of us. And so that's what we're monitoring sort of on a day-to-day to make sure that we don't wind up with a sustainable price gap. 
But our strategy is not to gain market share by undercutting people on price. Our strategy is to gain market share by coming out with very strong product innovation that offers a superior consumer value. And that's -- when you hear us talk about market share gains, it's not because we're trying to undercut anybody on price. It's because we're driving innovation that's compelling for the consumer and for the retailer."

In the release, you said, obviously, consumption or sales were still below 2019 levels, and that makes sense. April, May, most of us -- and even June, July, still working from home. But -- and it seems like most businesses are kind of targeting a post-Labor Day return, Delta variant aside, schools here in Georgia and elsewhere, I mean, start in the next few weeks. 
So trying to understand, is there a pent-up -- 2 questions there. One, do you think there's pent-up demand just from the past 12, 18 months where you could be well above 2019 levels, especially on the office side? Schools seem like they would just kind of return to normal. And then two, everything we hear throughout the industry is supply shortages and supply chain constraints. Do you have the bandwidth or the supply available to meet that need if there is that kind of surge? Or could there be out of stocks or issues where you can't capture the full demand over these next 3, 4 months?"

Look, our fervent wish is to try and get back to 2019 levels on Writing, and the team is really focused on that. Having said that, the -- you pointed out the whole -- there is the office component of this. 
Now despite the fact that you're hearing all the stuff on the media and people going back to September, but the Delta variant is also creating -- already, you've seen some companies announce shifts through October. We went to NPD and looked at the survey. They had done a very good quantitative one, where we saw -- I think they're forecasting that at least 1/3 of people will continue to be hybrid for a while. So that does have an impact.
Having said that, it's still early days because, look, the back-to-school season has just taken off and we're still going into the height of it. And the fact that, as we said on Writing, it -- the core sales exceeded the company's average of 25% gives us great -- and look, while it was below '19, it's just a little -- it's not -- we feel pretty good about the trends. Consumption is also up. And then our market share is up, overall Writing, not just gel pens. So when I look at all of that, I feel very bullish about Writing.
And the last thing that you mentioned, which we've seen through the studies, there are a lot of schools that have advanced by, say, 5 days to 7. So that's a positive thing. And then colleges, it's sort of this 2 freshman class that's coming in. So I think we feel pretty good about what's happening on this business. And believe me, that team is very focused because they want to show that this is a top-notch business."

Because obviously, we're not just talking consumer demand but also the increased difficulty in satisfying that demand because of the externals. You sort of touched on this with respect to Writing, but kind of curious on the rest of your key businesses where you stand with respect to that. 
And I would imagine with respect to supply chain, that -- 2 things. One, sort of major categories, what your competition looks like. Again, you talked about that with Writing, but kind of curious on the other categories. And then also what you're seeing from them with respect to pricing. Is the magnitude similar?

So on the supply chain, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it is a challenging external environment. And the challenges are largely due to ocean freight, availability of containers, length of time it takes containerships to move from Asia to the U.S., trucking capacity in the U.S., labor availability in the U.S., some raw material and component availability depending on the business unit, and then you couple that with the consumer demand spike that we're trying to navigate and meet.
I think that we've done -- our teams have done a really a heroic job of meeting and navigating through this environment. But our guidance does contemplate that this environment remains difficult for the remainder of the year. So we are not expecting an improvement in the external environment, but we do expect us to continue to navigate it. I think the good news is that this is not an environment that's unique to Newell. This is an environment that all of our competitors face. I mentioned on Writing that I think we're better positioned than at least one of our major competitors.
The balance of our categories, I think we're largely similarly positioned. And so we don't see major gaps in our external pressure versus our direct competitors' external pressure on the whole. So that's how I would characterize the supply chain. And I think our -- part of the reason why we've given a wide guidance range is recognizing the variability and the uncertainty of that supply environment, including the ramp-up of the Delta variant, which can have an impact on that. As I said, we're shooting more for the top half of our guidance range, but we think it's prudent to maintain the guidance range given the variability in the external environment."

So I think on the inflation side is -- there are really 4 factors that are driving inflation: increased resin costs; sourced finished goods, which is largely a function of the Chinese currency strengthening versus the U.S. dollar; transportation cost, which is, in our case, is largely ocean freight-related; and then labor pressure.
The interesting thing about that is resin is probably the biggest impact out of those 4, out of our $560 million that we're talking about this year. And one of the services that doesn't out-front forecast on resin is IHS. And at least their forecast is that we're at peak resin prices right now and resin prices are likely to come down significantly over the next 6 to 12 months.
Now we're heading into hurricane season, and so I never want to predict whether there's going to be a hurricane that hits the Texas or Louisiana coast. But by all accounts, it feels like the resin environment is sort of peaking at the moment and is likely to get better as we head over the next 6 to 12 months.
Again, on sourced finished goods, it's hard to predict. The Chinese currency strengthened versus the U.S. dollar but has been relatively stable more recently. And so we will begin to lap that unless there's another devaluation of the U.S. dollar.
I think ocean freight is likely to remain a challenge for the next 6 to 12 months because of the capacity constraints that carriers and containers have, but this is not unique to Newell. But again, it feels like that is transitory in nature. And then I think labor cost is likely to be a sustaining inflationary pressure, but that probably is the smallest of the 4 that I mentioned.
So we think we're navigating the peak inflation environment well. We're excited that we're driving low single -- or I'm sorry, high single-digit to low double-digit operating income growth is what our guidance implies for this year despite this inflation. And we think that the productivity savings that we've got, the cost management that we've got and the top line momentum that we have positions us well as the inflation pressure starts to ease going forward."

On the inflation front, in Q3, as I mentioned, we do expect inflation to be peaking in Q3 of this year. So our -- of our $560 million, the biggest impact is to the third quarter on inflation, and that is a fairly dramatic impact.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. We delivered solid results in the third quarter, which reflect the effectiveness of our strategy as well as the resilience and agility of our operating model and portfolio.  Year-to-date,",2314,"Thank you, Sofya. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. We delivered solid results in the third quarter, which reflect the effectiveness of our strategy as well as the resilience and agility of our operating model and portfolio.  Year-to-date, core sales grew 15.2% versus 2020 as each business unit contributed to such a terrific outcome. Normalized operating profit improved over 21% in and normalized earnings per share increased about 14%. We further strengthened our track record as the third quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter of core sales growth and sixth straight quarter of domestic consumption growth for the company. 
Core sales in the quarter increased 3.2% driven by excellent performance across 5 business units,  Writing, Baby, Home Appliances, Home Fragrance and Outdoor & Recreation. This was no small feat given the difficult year ago comparison of 7.2% core sales growth, which embedded a recovery across the majority of Newell's businesses. 
To normalize for pandemic-related shifts, we think it's useful to compare this year's top line to 2019. On a 2-year stack basis, Newell's core sales grew low single digits in the third quarter. We also saw strong domestic consumption relative to 2019 across each of our business units, a terrific result and a testament to the significant progress we've been -- that we've made in forging stronger relationships with shoppers as we leverage consumer insights and foresights in new product launches. 
The resurgence in our Writing business continue. The team has done a superb job during the important back-to-school season with outstanding performance in consumption and share momentum. As anticipated, top line trends moderated against elevated year ago results in our Food and commercial businesses. However, sales as well as domestic consumption for both business units remain about 2019 levels. 
Consumer behavior will undoubtedly evolve and categories will continue to normalize, but we believe that home and hub mindset will linger on, as well the heightened interest in outdoor activities and personal well-being. It's also evident in the company's consumption trends as domestic POS remains well ahead of 2020 and 2019 levels both in the third quarter and year-to-date, despite supply constraints core sales in North America mirrored that of the total company. Outside North America, Latin America stood up once again, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth despite elevated comparisons. 
I'm also delighted that the strength of our iconic brands continue to come through this year, harnessing the benefits from the fortified innovation funnels and our brand-building efforts. Year-to-date, many of our largest brands such as Graco, Coleman, Oster, Yankee Candle, Sharpie, Rubbermaid, First Alert, Paper Mate, Dymo, EXPO, Ball and Mr. Coffee delivered excellent top line growth our brand strength has also helped to successfully implement price increases. We are laser-focused on protecting the company's gross market. And if necessary, we will take additional pricing actions to ensure that we fully recoup the impact of inflation over time. 
Similarly, to the second quarter, e-commerce top line grew mid-single digits with digital penetration close to 22%, slightly above last year and significantly ahead of the mid-teens level from 2018. We continue to invest behind our omni capabilities and are well positioned to capitalize on consumer demand regardless of where they shop. 
Let me spend a few minutes on our business units beginning with Writing, the third quarter superstar. Core sales increased at a double-digit rate driven by broad-based strength in the U.S. and international markets. Core sales grew on a 2-year stack basis as well, even though the commercial channel has not fully recovered yet. This is a testament to the excellent health of our Writing business. Consumption in the U.S. has been strong throughout 2021 and accelerated sequentially in the third quarter as we leaned into the business momentum with higher A&P investment. 
The vast majority of K-12 schools in the U.S. returned to in-person learnings. During the back-to-school season, we saw a strong rebound in everyday Writing business. which benefited from innovations such as Sharpie S-Gel and Sharpie S-Note, strong merchandising plans and distribution gains. 
We picked up considerable share during the quarter in our Writing business as a whole, including key back-to-school categories such as pens, pencils, glue, permanent markets, dry erase markers and highlighters. Over the past 2 years, we've meaningfully enhanced Newell's position in the pen category, where we've gained over 850 basis points of share. Thus far, in 2021, we then highlight us  Sharpie S-Note has tripled its share of the growing highlighter market segment. 
Core sales for our Baby business increased at a double-digit rate. supported by terrific domestic consumption growth, both relative to 2020 and '19. Q3 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of core sales growth driven by expanded points of distribution, innovation, continued strength in e-commerce as well as stimulus funding. While Baby is the most highly penetrated business online with the Newell's portfolio, we leveraged our omni progress to further boost our digital penetration in the quarter into the mid-50s. We believe child tax credits as well as increases in disposable income and durable goods consumption have all benefited the gear market over the past several quarters. While the category is likely to moderate, we expect it to remain healthy. In the U.S., Graco continued to gain momentum and picked up share in the rapidly growing market. 
Home Fragrance turned in its fifth consecutive quarter of core sales improvement as core sales grew both versus the elevated 2020 level as well as relative to 2019 driven in large part by EMEA. In the U.S., Yankee Candle retail stores maintained their positive growth momentum, benefiting from consumers increased mobility. As we continue to expand our omni capabilities, we rolled out buy online and pick up in stores as well as ship from store options across our Yankee Candle retail stores, which drove a favorable response from consumers and helped us to fulfill consumer demand. 
As anticipated, consumption moderated relative to the elevated base period but was significantly ahead of the 2019 level. Home Fragrance, along with Writing and Food, our growth and value accelerator businesses, and I see tremendous run rate for growth ahead. The team is gearing up for the holidays as Q4 is a crucial -- for the business. 
In the third quarter, the Food business lapped its toughest double-digit core sales growth comparison of 2020 and was exacerbated by supply challenges, including a COVID-related lockdown of our Sistema plant in New Zealand, resulting in core sales decline. However, both top line and domestic consumption were meaningfully ahead of the 2019 base, which highlights the stickiness of the habits that consumers develop throughout the pandemic. We expect the category to continue to normalize, and that's been most evident on the cookware side. 
We drove strong share momentum in Food Storage and food preserving. Recent innovations such as Rubbermaid TakeAlongs new -- the updated Rubbermaid beverage line as well as Brilliance Glass have been instrumental in driving market share improvement for Rubbermaid as they elevate the consumer experience. In fresh preserving, Ball pantry storage latch and Ball nesting -- have contributed to share gains for Ball. 
In Home Appliances, core sales increased for the sixth consecutive quarter, even as we lapped the toughest double-digit comparison of the year. Latin America once again led the charge. In this market, our beloved Oster brand is spearheading the trend for multicooking functions and recently launched Oster toaster oven with airfry as well as Oster rice cooker with air fry. Throughout 2021, Oster blenders are celebrating the 75th anniversary in the U.S. and Latin America with brand activation and new product launches in each region. 
Domestic POS remained significantly ahead of 2019 levels and only modestly below last year's level, although the category continues to normalize relative to the outsized growth levels seen throughout the pandemic. Despite the fact that people have come back to dine-in restaurants, consumers continue to show interest in cooking at home post the pandemic. 
In our commercial business, sales -- core sales declined versus the elevated base as the business cycled against a significant search surge and washroom solutions. On a 2-year stack basis, gross sales increased nicely during the third quarter. The team has done a great job in landing new wins, both on the B2B and retail sides, across a wide swap of categories ranging from cleaning and refuse to material handling and others. We saw healthy POS and tracked channels but have been significantly challenged on the supply side. The team is diligently addressing these constraints as well as inflationary pressures. 
During the third quarter, core sales for Connected Home & Security business were under pressure despite very strong consumption in the U.S. Core sales softness reflects both a challenging year ago comparison as we were restocking inventory at retail last year as well as component availability challenges in the current year mostly due to the well-publicized chip shortage. 
Our Outdoor & Recreation business delivered its third straight quarter of core sales growth at nearly 2% against a difficult year ago comparison of 8%. Core sales improvement was fueled by the strength in the outdoor equipment and on-the-go beverage categories with the latter continuing to rebound during improved consumer mobility. We are encouraged by the momentum in the outdoor and equipment unit with POS exceeding 2019 levels. The consumer continues to show interest in outdoors, a trend we think will endure and one we will continue to leverage throughout our innovation. 
Coleman turned another quarter growth benefiting from enhanced product lineup in 2021 with strong plans in place for next year as well. Many of our Coleman products such as the Skydome -- cooler bag and 2-burner stove are featured by USA TODAY as perfect gifts for people who love to travel. So keep them in mind for the holidays. 
Strong results thus far gave us confidence to improve our outlook on both top line and normalized earnings per share in 2021 despite significant inflationary and supply chain-related pressures that continue to plague the industry. Our updated guidance for 2021 implies that normalized operating profit is expected to grow high single digits, a great outcome, particularly in the context of a difficult operating environment. 
Although we are certainly not immune to the external forces the strategic decisions we have actioned over the past several years have substantially strengthened the company and have made our portfolio much more resilient. First, we invested in omnichannel capabilities that have been instrumental in capturing consumer demand across all channels and, on the direct-to-consumer side, recently completed migration of our sites in North America to one consolidated platform with a dedicated team focused on continuous improvement on consumer experience. 
We substantially strengthened our innovation and marketing muscle, leveraging consumer insights and foresights. Then we've sharpened brand positioning for many of our top brands. We have established joint business plans and enhanced relationships with key strategic retail partners. We've instituted a new hybrid organizational model that brings our domain experts closer to our customers and consumers while leveraging the center for scale and efficiencies. 
We have made productivity a way of life. We've reduced complexity and overheads, improved cash conversion cycle and strengthened the balance sheet. 2021 has been a turning point for Newell despite challenges posed by supply and inflation. Our teams have done an incredible job executing in this environment. And we are poised to deliver 10-plus percentage core sales growth this year, a first for our company in recent history. 
We recognize that 2021 has been a tale of 2 cities, a first half and second half story. We delivered 23% core sales growth in the first half. And in the second half, we are lapping strong growth from 2020. The fact that we grew 3.2% in Q3 on top of last year's growth is an indication that our brands are resilient, are being rejuvenated, and we have the ability to grow even in this context of strong comps. The power of our diverse portfolio is coming through. 
The macro issues in the pandemic have taught us but we just cannot be reactive. We're laser focused on continuing to strengthen the fundamentals and reducing complexity, including lowering SKU count, improving forecast accuracy, simplifying our IT infrastructure and making it easier for customers to do business with us. We are creating an integrated one Newell distribution network through the consolidation of over 20 supply chains under the banner of project. 
Looking forward, we expect supply challenges and inflation to persist. Therefore, our stance is one of preparedness and realism and taking proactive actions to successfully navigate the macro environment. If 2021 was a year of turbocharging the top line, 2022 will be focused on improving margins, improving margins through 5 primary levers. 
First, an intense focus on pricing and optimizing promotional spending. We have now taken price increases in 2021 across all of our 8 businesses and most geographies. Our posture will be to maximize the impact of carryover pricing from '21 into '22. And we will be prepared to take further increases in '22 based on inflationary trends to protect gross margin. Of course, we'll do this in consultation with our customers and ensure that our brands remain a great value for consumers. 
Second, we'll accelerate our efforts to improve the profitability of our international business. by reducing duplication, consolidating operations and adopting a one new approach. Third, we will price innovations to be margin accretive. Fourth, we will continue to be more efficient with our overheads. And finally, we'll continue to be strive to be best-in-class in our productivity efforts and drive about 3% to 4% improvement in COGS as we have done over the last few years. 
I'm extremely thankful to our 31,000 hard-working employees for their unwavering commitment, tenacity and perseverance. I remain optimistic that Newell can create tremendous shareholder value, and our best days are ahead of us, onwards and upwards. And now over to Chris."

During the third quarter, we delivered solid results as we continue to drive our strategy into action. Strong operational execution, coupled with financial discipline, enabled us to generate better-than-anticipated operating profit and sustained progress on the cash conversion cycle. We accomplished this in the context of a choppy operating environment as our teams did a terrific job navigating through a myriad of supply and logistical bottlenecks. 
Before getting into the details, I want to provide a little color on the current operating environment and proactive choices we are making. Similar to other companies, throughout the third quarter, we continued to experience significant inflation and supply chain disruption. Escalation in cost has been an ongoing dynamic throughout 2021. While inflationary pressures have been broad-based, the largest impact for us has been around commodities, particularly resin, ocean freight, sourced finished goods and labor. The expected headwind from inflation on 2021 cost of goods sold is now forecast to be about $40 million worse relative to our expectations last quarter. We currently expect inflation to represent 9% of our full year cost of goods sold as compared to our expectation of about 3% at the start of the year. 
We have taken numerous actions to alleviate the headwind from inflation, including leading in on our productivity initiatives, implementing price increases across all of our businesses with some announcing multiple rounds, continuing to exercise disciplined control over expenses, driving efficiencies from promotional spend and leveraging strong top line growth. The full benefit from the mitigating actions to offset the unprecedented inflationary pressures will not flow through until next year, given the timing lag on pricing. 
We do expect that Q3 represents the largest gap between the pricing and inflation impact to the P&L and expect this gap to narrow sequentially from here. Despite this dynamic and the continued escalation in costs for Q4, we are raising our normalized EPS guidance for this year towards the higher end of the previous range. a strong outcome and a testament to the resilience and excellent execution by our teams. 
Moving on to supply chain. Lead times for sourced products, some components and raw materials have increased significantly from prepandemic levels as a result of port congestion, limited container availability as well as shortages in the labor force and truck drivers. This has been an ongoing challenge throughout 2021. However, the significant progress we have driven on SKU rationalization over the past few years, along with an early start on mitigating tactics, have put us in an advantage and allowed us to largely meet the strong demand. 
Some of the actions we've taken early in 2021 and throughout the year include the following: building inventory on top-selling and high priority SKUs, improving our forecasting process and adjusting it for longer lead times, diversifying our supplier base where feasible, accelerating automation across our factories and distribution centers and enhancing compensation, benefits, training opportunities and working conditions for our frontline employees. In fact, during the third quarter, we announced meaningful wage increases across many of our factories and distribution centers starting in Q4. 
We do not expect the supply pressures to dissipate in the near term, but we are confident that we are taking appropriate steps to both effectively manage them and create more agility within our supply chain in the future. We recently announced a new supply chain initiative, Ovid, which is expected to transform Newell's go-to-market capabilities and end-to-end customer experience in the U.S., enhanced customer service levels and drive significant operational efficiencies. We are planning to optimize the company's distribution network in the U.S. by consolidating 23 business unit-centric supply chains into a single integrated supply chain. We expect it will take about 18 months to fully implement Ovid. To minimize any potential disruption we intend to roll it out in waves. 
During Q3, we passed an important milestone as we completed blueprinting and the integrated design phase. We are now moving into the testing and implementation phase. Upon completion, Ovid is expected to streamline, automate and digitize our supply chain and position us as a reliable retailer partner of choice. While Ovid was being contemplated, prior to the recent events, once implemented, it should position us on a much stronger footing going forward. 
Let's now move to third quarter results. Net sales grew 3.3% year-over-year to $2.8 billion mostly driven by a core sales increase of 3.2%. This was an excellent outcome as we cycled against 7.2% core sales growth in the year ago period with difficult comparisons across every segment, except for learning and development. Normalized gross margin contracted 330 basis points year-over-year to 30.6%. Gains from fuel productivity savings, favorable business mix as well as pricing were more than offset by the inflationary headwind, which was nearly 800 basis points in the quarter. Normalized operating margin came in at 11.4%, down from 14.9% a year ago, reflecting gross margin pressure as well as a significant step-up in advertising and promotion expense. 
We continued to tightly manage costs and drive overhead to sales ratio lower year-over-year. Net interest expense came down by $6 million year-over-year to $65 million reflecting debt reduction of about $750 million relative to last year. The normalized tax rate was 8% versus a normalized tax benefit of nearly 7% in the year ago period due to a lower contribution from discrete items. Normalized diluted earnings per share amounted to $0.54 as compared to $0.84 in Q3 of 2020. The unfavorable move in the tax rate accounted for about $0.12 year-over-year. 
Now turning to our segment performance. Core sales for the Commercial Solutions segment decreased 9.2% due to declines in both the commercial and Connected Home & Security business units, which faced tough year-ago comps. Core sales for Home Appliances grew 1.9% primarily driven by Latin America. Core sales for the Home Solutions segment were down 3.6% as core growth in the Home Fragrance business was more than offset by a decline in food, which lapped its toughest quarterly comparison of 2020. Core sales for the Learning & Development segment grew 19.6% as both the Writing and Baby business units delivered strong double-digit increases. Core sales in the Outdoor & Recreation segment increased 1.7%. 
Newell's net sales were 8.5% above the third quarter of 2019 with each of the company's segments exceeding levels from 2 years ago. On a 2-year stack basis, core sales increased in the low double digits during Q3 as well as year-to-date periods. Year-to-date, in 2021, the company's operating cash flow was $490 million versus $820 million in the year ago period. This reflects an increase in working capital to support top line momentum and elevated in-transit times for inventory, which more than offset significant operating income growth. We continue to drive improvement in cash conversion cycle, which came down by another 10 days to 79 days. 
At the end of the third quarter, Newell's leverage ratio was 3.1x down from 3.9x a year ago. The improvement reflects our proactive choice to pay down debt as well as a mid-teen increase in trailing 12-month normalized EBITDA. In Q3, the company redeemed approximately EUR 300 million of its 3.75% notes that were due in October 2021. Furthermore, in mid-October, we announced our intention to redeem the remaining $250 million of the company's 4% senior notes next month. 
We have significantly strengthened Newell's balance sheet over the past several years and recently indicated that we are targeting a leverage ratio of 2.5x below our prior goal of 3x. We intend to grow our EBITDA into this target with no immediate plans for additional new debt tender offers. This morning, we updated our outlook for 2021, accounting for the stronger-than-anticipated performance in Q3, further escalation in costs in the fourth quarter, continuation of supply chain disruption as well as a relatively healthy consumer backdrop in the U.S. We are pleased to once again raise our top line forecast for 2021 as a result of healthy consumption and the early actions we have taken to alleviate the supply chain constraints. 
Our revised top line guidance implies that core sales are expected to grow versus 2019 during each quarter of 2021. Our outlook also indicates that core sales will be up versus 2020, in the first and second halves of 2021 as well as for the full year. 
Let's go through the details of the full year 2021 outlook. We currently forecast net sales of $10.38 billion to $10.46 billion up from $10.1 billion to $10.35 billion previously. This represents about 11% year-over-year growth. We are raising our core sales outlook to 10% to 11% from 7% to 10% previously with the majority of the upside in the fourth quarter. While the U.S. dollar has strengthened recently, currency favorability is still expected to modestly outweigh the impact from Yankee Candle retail store closures and other minor business exits. 
As a result of further escalation in costs, including our decision to raise wages for the front line, starting in Q4, we now expect full year normalized operating margin to be slightly down relative to 11.1% in 2020. Our updated forecast implies that normalized operating profit grows at a high single-digit rate, a solid result when factoring in the unprecedented level of inflation. 
We anticipate an increase in the absolute level of advertising and promotion spending. This forecast assumes a mid-teens normalized effective tax rate and a slight increase in shares outstanding. We are pleased to improve our full year normalized earnings per share outlook to $1.69 to $1.73 from a previous range of $1.63 to $1.73. There is no change in our full year operating cash flow guidance of approximately $1 billion as we continue to expect acceleration in Newell's cash conversion cycle. 
Focusing on the fourth quarter, we are guiding for net sales of $2.6 billion to $2.68 billion with core sales expected to be within a range of down 2% to up 1%. Our guidance assumes normalized operating margin of 8.7% to 9.2% versus 11.4% in the year ago period as inflation is expected to outweigh the continued benefits from productivity and pricing. We are forecasting a normalized effective tax rate around 20% and normalized earnings per share in the $0.29 to $0.33 range. 
While we are still early in our budgeting cycle for 2022, I wanted to provide a high-level perspective on how we are approaching it. We are encouraged by the progress our teams have made on the innovation side and have a strong funnel of new ideas planned for next year. However, we anticipate a more muted top line delivery due to a very difficult comparison. While inflation is expected to remain above normal levels, we are looking at significant benefits from carryover pricing as well as productivity. This should result in stronger margin performance in 2022 relative to 2021. We will continue to build operational excellence across the organization as we roll out additional automation projects and make strides with Ovid implementation. We intend to provide more specifics during the fourth quarter call, as has been the norm in recent years. 
We believe we have a strong path for value creation, and we'll continue to diligently execute on our strategic agenda to ensure that we position Newell Brands for sustainable and profitable growth. Operator, let's now open the call for Q&A."

Good morning. This is Ravi. Look, Writing really performed very well. I think the big thing was we weren't sure when we went into the quarter, we knew we'd have a good back-to-school, but there was some worries about the Delta variant. I think what became evident was this is one of the issues. Keeping the schools open for in-person learning was a fairly bipartisan view. And so we watched it by week and saw that the super majority of schools opened -- and so that was great. But also a credit to our team because they really hit the ball out of the park on merchandising, on e-commerce, on getting distribution, on innovation. They just have the whole package. And this is, as we have said before, one of the business -- this business because we manufacture most of our products, except for Dymo, which comes from China, in Tennessee. And so we were able to have good supply. So I think that really helped. 
And this is still in the backdrop because we had expected maybe offices to start opening up, but because of Delta, they didn't as much. So despite all of that, the fact that the business did extremely well, I think, is positive, and we're seeing that positive momentum continuing. So we're very pleased. And yes, it is probably a bit better than our expectation. But look, when you have the highest margin business, we will take that any day."

And that's why -- if you look at our balance sheet, part of the reason why our inventory levels are significantly higher than they were last year, and we've used cash to build inventory.

As far as small appliances goes, but we've had -- we've been very -- I'm very pleased to see the progress the team has been making and that we've had so many quarters of growth. Yes, clearly, as we look down the future, you have to say, is it -- has there been some acceleration of consumer purchases. But having said that, I think there are several categories within appliances, and we're driving a lot of innovation.

The inflation impact is affecting our business units a little bit differently. The 2 most significantly affected business units are the commercial business and the food business. And then there are other businesses like Writing and Home Fragrance, for example, that are much less affected by inflation, but everybody is affected. 
Because of that difference in terms of how the inflation is impacting the business units. And because the inflation picture has continued during the year to get significantly more of a headwind, we've announced pricing on different timings. And so the first set of pricing, broadly, that we put into place went into place kind of in the April, May, June time period. The good news about that pricing is that pricing is now fully reflected in retail. And at least to date, we have not seen any negative reaction to consumer demand from the pricing that we put in so far. And so that -- we take that as a very positive sign. 
There is a second round of pricing, broadly, that's going into effect that we've already announced that largely is going into effect in either November or beginning of January. And so when you look at the pricing impact in the P&L, the pricing impact in the P&L is going to get significantly bigger as we go forward sequentially from here. So pricing will be a bigger help in Q4 than it was in Q3. In Q1 of next year, pricing should be largely implemented and it will be a bigger help in Q1 of next year than it is in Q4 of this year. At the same time, inflation, we think, Q3, is if spot rates stay where they are, inflation will have been the biggest impact for us in Q3 of this year, and we'll begin to mitigate as we lap base periods. And so that gap, if you will, between inflation, pricing and productivity, we think Q3 was the biggest delta of that gap, and we think that gap starts to close and reduce sequentially each quarter going forward."

So we kicked off Project Ovid about 10 or 11 months ago, we didn't announce it until Barclays, but we kicked it off 10 or 11 months ago. And the reason why we thought now is the right time is because we've made a lot",369,"Yes. So let me try a couple of things. So we kicked off Project Ovid about 10 or 11 months ago, we didn't announce it until Barclays, but we kicked it off 10 or 11 months ago. And the reason why we thought now is the right time is because we've made a lot of progress on SKU rationalization. So if you recall, at the end of 2018, when we started with the turnaround plan, the company was trying to sell over 100,000 SKUs. We've now reduced that through last year to 47,000. As of today, we're at 42,000, and we're on our way down to 30,000. 
And so because we've taken that SKU count reduction out and improve the fundamentals of the operation, we believe we're now at a point where we can take the next step, which is to go from unique supply chains into a single integrated supply chain. We think this is going to allow us to move from shipping less-than-truckload shipments in small quantities, enforcing our retailers to order from us 23 different ways and to the ability to order from us in a single way and ship full truckloads. And so from both a service and a cost standpoint, we think that this is going to be a major step forward for the company and really leverage the scale of Newell going forward. 
Now when we kicked Project Ovid off, the supply chain constraints were not how they are today. And so we kicked the project off with that -- without that external backdrop in place. I think the team has done a pretty amazing job of keeping on track. And fortunately, we secured the 2 big new mixing distribution centers prior to the current supply-constrained dynamics. 
And so we're monitoring it. We're going to be prudent on the implementation dates that we go and make sure that we execute the transition with excellence. But if anything, the savings from the project have only gotten bigger as transportation costs have gotten bigger. So in fact, we think the project is likely going to generate more value to us today than when we first started the project 9 months ago or 10 months ago."

Olivia, we have to think about sort of the new journey. I've been here 2 years, Chris close to 3. And look, we've embarked on -- we started it as a turnaround, but we're really talking about a transformation of the company in terms of capabilities and looking at the long term while making sure that the short term is healthy. And so if you think about sort of the first year, we spent a lot of time on stabilizing the organization, getting the culture, revving up the people, bringing the team in the hybrid structure, et cetera. 
Next, our next phase is all about innovation of our brands, about e-commerce and really getting the top line, which is why you're seeing that momentum. The next one is really all about how do we get our gross margins up. And in addition to the pricing, the supply chain, whether it's automation or Ovid, we think are critical because we have to be easier to do business with, with our customers. This has been going on for years and years. We have to make it easier for our size of the company. 
So with that -- and then the next one is -- will be international. So all of this is about a journey of driving shareholder value. And we obviously manage very carefully the execution burden on our teams and make sure that we don't slip up. But I think these have been managed to a good cadence, and we are very confident that all of these will go along quite well as we progress forward."

We think about that as sort of pre pandemic, and that serves as a good guide. But over time, that will change. So -- but 2019 is a good base. So having said that, look, as we approach Q4, recognize a couple of things. One is that we've had a Baby business that has just been growing fantastically like in the teens and for all the reasons I mentioned in the prepared remarks. But one of the things that's happened, the stimulus did end. And so -- and without the huge rise in birth rates, there's only so many how -- and there's a huge comp last year in the Q4, which is also very strong. So where -- the Baby business is comping very high on Q4. So that clearly, we don't have that. We still have Writing, which is growing in pretty well and so far the businesses. 
So I think we shouldn't get hung up about any particular part of our business because we've got puts and takes. The overall thing is, look, what we're striving to do, Olivia, is to get to sustainable profitable growth over time. And I really think that we're well on our way to do that."

But is it still fair to assume that you think margins will be under pressure in the first half of the year?

But what I would say is that we certainly believe that next year is going to be a year of margin growth for the company. And the reason for that is what I said earlier, which is a lot of the inflation impact that's hit us this year, there's a timing lag between pricing and inflation. And even if you look at the 2 business units that we have suffered the most inflation, which are commercial and Food, we're on LIFO accounting, which means in those businesses that the inflation hits us immediately in those businesses, and those have been the 2 biggest impacts. 
So we've probably taken the big inflation impact from the move in resins already in the P&L. The lag in pricing creates a drag in the short term. But when we get into next year, we're expecting the benefit of carryover pricing plus productivity to be higher than the inflation impact next year if based on our current forecast, which is based on spot rates going forward. 
By the way, we're also -- as we think about the planning for next year, we are not assuming that inflation is going to be transitory. We are assuming that inflation is going to be significantly above normal next year, and we are building our plan, assuming that. And we are still confident despite that, that we are going to have significant margin growth next year"

When we started this process on taking price increases on way back when, I think the whole world, including us, thought that inflation was going to be transitory.

Over time, as we've seen, this will become very realistic. And now our pricing posture is very clear. We are going to recoup inflation, and that stance will continue into 2022.

If you look at our businesses, the 8 businesses we have today, the place where we have a lot of commonality is in the top retailers. And so if you look at the top 4 retailers that the company does business with in the U.S., Walmart, Target, Amazon and Costco, those top 4 retailers are pretty consistent across every one of our business units. And the thing that's good about that is that's why this integrated supply chain network makes a lot of sense because we're shipping to the same customers, the same locations. And instead of forcing those retailers to give us 23 separate orders and then we ship from 23 locations and we have 23 invoices and we're shipping 23 small less-than-truckload shipments, if we can have them give us one order on one set of terms and ship on full truck, that is a huge efficiency for both us and for the retailer. And I think it allows us to create a competitive advantage versus many of our subscale competitors. 
So that's largely the thinking behind that. On the portfolio pruning point, I think we've been pretty consistent there, which is we think we've got strong organic growth opportunities in both top and bottom line in each of our business units. It doesn't mean that we're not going to do some portfolio moves in the future but we're likely going to be more on the tuck-in or acquisition or tuck-out divestiture side. But we're going to be driven by shareholder value creation as we think about any portfolio moves."

I think that we view it not incremental to the 37, 38 target that we had put out previously. I think we view it as a building block to getting to that target over time. 
On the overhead part, we do not expect Ovid to have a material impact on overhead. What I will say is that embedded in this year's guidance is a pretty significant overhead investment that we've made in the team and consulting costs, et cetera, for the Ovid project, but that's already embedded in our existing guidance. And when we actually complete the project, that cost will come out. And so eventually, that sort of above going cost that we've got built in this year on overhead is likely to go away as we get to 2023. 
On the share repurchase question, just to be clear, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we retired about EUR 300 million of debt in Q3. In Q4, we've called our June 22 notes of $250 million, which we expect to retire in Q4 of this year. From -- as we go into next year, we do not expect any more reduction in the level of our gross debt. And we think that, as we move into next year, we are going to move to our leverage target through EBITDA growth not through debt reduction. And as a result, we think that, as we move into next year, it's going to open up the opportunity for share repurchase as we expect to generate more than enough cash to cover investment in the business and the dividends fully. And so we are moving into a period next year where the capital allocation begins to get freed up."

It's not a one-size-fits-all because despite building up the inventory, some of the businesses, we're importing that has an impact. But I'll just tell you on shares, the Writing business, as I mentioned, really a big winner on the share front not just in pens but overall. We think throughout the year this year on a year-to-date basis, the candle business, I'd hate to use the word saying it's been on fire, but it's been doing amazingly well. And we do believe that we're making a lot of traction in the Baby business. We've been gaining share. So I think we've got different businesses where we are gaining share. And -- but there are some businesses where the demand has been so high and unexpected that -- and also it depends on the price points we played out. 
Like in appliances, while we've had terrific growth, we operate more on the opening price points. And so there were -- so on a dollar basis, even though we've had good growth, we may not be seeing the share improvement. So I think it varies. Outdoor, where we bring stuff -- I mean, we're really pleased to see the good growth that is happening. And I think we're beginning to really get supply right. We had some issues during July, August, but I think we're now back on track there. And the outdoor, the beverage side, especially, we're getting back on track. So I think it varies. 
Our Food business, some of the demand has been so high on things like Ball. Certainly, that has been a challenge for us. And -- but Ball, that is really the very -- it's got such a dominant share of that business. So that's sort of -- that has been complicated for us from lids, bottles, et cetera. So it varies and -- but let's put it this way. Everything we can do to maximize the top line opportunity, we're doing, working in close collaboration with our customers. But it's been tough on service levels because I wish our service levels were better. But every competitor today, I think, is wishing there be better. 
So I can't say it's nirvana, but I do think that we're doing our best. And I really feel the one thing I can tell you, Lauren, our brands are in a better shape and rejuvenated far better today than they were. And I know one of your favorite businesses of ours is Baby. I'll tell you about -- you didn't ask me, but I'll tell you because you usually asked about our baby innovation. So I'm very excited about the Baby Jogger City Turn where you can turn the car seat to how the baby face you. Now I wish I had grandkids. [indiscernible] going to get married. So hopefully, I can start using this someday, but that -- and the city turn strollers. So I think Baby genre, we're doing a lot to rejuvenate that business. So look, brands are in good shape.

We delivered solid results in the third quarter, which reflect the effectiveness of our strategy as well as the resilience and agility of our operating model and portfolio.  Year-to-date,",2314,"Thank you, Sofya. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. We delivered solid results in the third quarter, which reflect the effectiveness of our strategy as well as the resilience and agility of our operating model and portfolio.  Year-to-date, core sales grew 15.2% versus 2020 as each business unit contributed to such a terrific outcome. Normalized operating profit improved over 21% and normalized earnings per share increased about 14%. We further strengthened our track record as the third quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter of core sales growth and sixth straight quarter of domestic consumption growth for the company. 
Core sales in the quarter increased 3.2% driven by excellent performance across 5 business units: Writing, Baby, Home Appliances, Home Fragrance and Outdoor & Recreation. This was no small feat given the difficult year ago comparison of 7.2% core sales growth, which embedded a recovery across the majority of Newell's businesses. 
To normalize for pandemic-related shifts, we think it's useful to compare this year's top line to 2019. On a 2-year stack basis, Newell's core sales grew low single digits in the third quarter. We also saw strong domestic consumption relative to 2019 across each of our business units, a terrific result and a testament to the significant progress we've been -- that we've made in forging stronger relationships with shoppers as we leverage consumer insights and foresights in new product launches. 
The resurgence in our Writing business continue. [indiscernible] team has done a superb job during the important back-to-school season with outstanding performance in consumption and share momentum. As anticipated, top line trends moderated against elevated year ago results in our Food and Commercial businesses. However, sales as well as domestic consumption for both business units remain about 2019 levels. 
Consumer behavior will undoubtedly evolve and categories will continue to normalize, but we believe that home as hub mindset will endure, as well the heightened interest in outdoor activities and personal well-being. It's also evident in the company's consumption trends as domestic POS remains well ahead of 2020 and 2019 levels both in the third quarter and year-to-date, despite supply constraints. Core sales in North America mirrored that of the total company. Outside North America, Latin America stood up once again, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth despite elevated comparisons. 
I'm also delighted that the strength of our iconic brands continue to come through this year, harnessing the benefits from the fortified innovation funnels and our brand-building efforts. Year-to-date, many of our largest brands such as Graco, Coleman, Oster, Yankee Candle, Sharpie, Rubbermaid, First Alert, Paper Mate, Dymo, EXPO, Ball and Mr. Coffee delivered excellent top line growth. Our brand's strength has also helped to successfully implement price increases. We are laser-focused on protecting the company's gross market. And if necessary, we will take additional pricing actions to ensure that we fully recoup the impact of inflation over time. 
Similarly, to the second quarter, e-commerce top line grew mid-single digits with digital penetration close to 22%, slightly above last year and significantly ahead of the mid-teens level from 2018. We continue to invest behind our omni capabilities and are well positioned to capitalize on consumer demand regardless of where they shop. 
Let me spend a few minutes on our business units beginning with Writing, the third quarter superstar. Core sales increased at a double-digit rate driven by broad-based strength in the U.S. and international markets. Core sales grew on a 2-year stack basis as well, even though the commercial channel has not fully recovered yet. This is a testament to the excellent health of our Writing business. Consumption in the U.S. has been strong throughout 2021 and accelerated sequentially in the third quarter as we leaned into the business momentum with higher A&P investment. 
The vast majority of [ K-12 ] schools in the U.S. returned to in-person learning. During the back-to-school season, we saw a strong rebound in everyday Writing business, which benefited from innovations such as Sharpie S-Gel and Sharpie S-Note, strong merchandising plans and distribution gains. 
We picked up considerable share during the quarter in our Writing business as a whole, including key back-to-school categories such as pens, pencils, glue, permanent markets, dry-erase markers and highlighters. Over the past 2 years, we've meaningfully enhanced Newell's position in the pen category, where we've gained over 850 basis points of share. Thus far, in 2021, within highlighters, Sharpie S-Note has tripled its share of the growing highlighter market segment. 
Core sales for Baby business increased at a double-digit rate, supported by terrific domestic consumption growth, both relative to 2020 and '19. Q3 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of core sales growth driven by expanded points of distribution, innovation, continued strength in e-commerce as well as stimulus funding. While Baby is the most highly penetrated business online within Newell's portfolio, we leveraged our omni progress to further boost our digital penetration in the quarter into the mid-50s. We believe child tax credits as well as increases in disposable income and durable goods consumption have all benefited the gear market over the past several quarters. While the category is likely to moderate, we expect it to remain healthy. In the U.S., Graco continued to gain momentum and picked up share in the rapidly growing market. 
Home Fragrance turned in its fifth consecutive quarter of core sales improvement as core sales grew both versus the elevated 2020 level as well as relative to 2019 driven in large part by EMEA. In the U.S., Yankee Candle retail stores maintained their positive growth momentum, benefiting from consumers increased mobility. As we continue to expand our omni capabilities, we rolled out buy online and pick up in stores as well as ship from store options across our Yankee Candle retail stores, which drove a favorable response from consumers and helped us to fulfill consumer demand. 
As anticipated, consumption moderated relative to the elevated base period but was significantly ahead of the 2019 level. Home Fragrance, along with Writing and Food, our growth and value accelerator businesses, and I see tremendous run rate for growth ahead. The team is gearing up for the holidays as Q4 is a crucial period for the business. 
In the third quarter, the Food business lapped its toughest double-digit core sales growth comparison of 2020 and was exacerbated by supply challenges, including a COVID-related lockdown of our Sistema plant in New Zealand, resulting in core sales decline. However, both top line and domestic consumption were meaningfully ahead of the 2019 base, which highlights the stickiness of the habits that consumers develop throughout the pandemic. We expect the category to continue to normalize, and that's been most evident on the cookware side. 
We drove strong share momentum in food storage and food preserving. Recent innovations such as Rubbermaid TakeAlongs Meal Prep, the updated Rubbermaid beverage line as well as Brilliance Glass have been instrumental in driving market share improvement for Rubbermaid as they elevate the consumer experience. In fresh preserving, Ball pantry storage latch and Ball nesting jars have contributed to share gains for Ball. 
In Home Appliances, core sales increased for the sixth consecutive quarter, even as we lapped the toughest double-digit comparison of the year. Latin America once again led the charge. In this market, our beloved Oster brand is spearheading the trend for multi-cooking functions and recently launched Oster toaster oven with air fryer as well as Oster rice cooker with air fryer. Throughout 2021, Oster blenders are celebrating the 75th anniversary in the U.S. and Latin America with brand activation and new product launches in each region. 
Domestic POS remained significantly ahead of 2019 levels and only modestly below last year's level, although the category continues to normalize relative to the outsized growth levels seen throughout the pandemic. Despite the fact that people have come back to dine-in restaurants, consumers continue to show interest in cooking at home post the pandemic. 
In our Commercial business, sales -- core sales declined versus the elevated base as the business cycled against a significant search -- surge in washroom solutions. On a 2-year stack basis, gross sales increased nicely during the third quarter. The team has done a great job in landing new wins, both on the B2B and retail sides, across a wide swap of categories ranging from cleaning and refuse to material handling and others. We saw healthy POS and tracked channels but have been significantly challenged on the supply side. The team is diligently addressing these constraints as well as inflationary pressures. 
During the third quarter, core sales for Connected Home & Security business were under pressure despite very strong consumption in the U.S. Core sales softness reflects both a challenging year ago comparison as we were restocking inventory at retail last year as well as component availability challenges in the current year mostly due to the well-publicized chip shortage. 
Our Outdoor & Recreation business delivered its third straight quarter of core sales growth at nearly 2% against a difficult year ago comparison of 8%. Core sales improvement was fueled by the strength in the outdoor equipment and on-the-go beverage categories with the latter continuing to rebound during improved consumer mobility. We are encouraged by the momentum in the outdoor and equipment unit with POS exceeding 2019 levels. The consumer continues to show interest in outdoors, a trend we think will endure and one we will continue to leverage throughout our innovation. 
Coleman turned another quarter growth benefiting from enhanced product lineup in 2021 with strong plans in place for next year as well. Many of our Coleman products such as the Skydome tent, cooler bag and 2-burner stove are featured by USA TODAY as perfect gifts for people who love to travel. So keep them in mind for the holidays. 
Strong results thus far gave us confidence to improve our outlooks on both top line and normalized earnings per share in 2021 despite significant inflationary and supply chain-related pressures that continue to plague the industry. Our updated guidance for 2021 implies that normalized operating profit is expected to grow high single digits, a great outcome, particularly in the context of a difficult operating environment. 
Although we are certainly not immune to the external forces, the strategic decisions we have actioned over the past several years have substantially strengthened the company and have made our portfolio much more resilient. First, we invested in omnichannel capabilities that have been instrumental in capturing consumer demand across all channels and, on the direct-to-consumer side, recently completed migration of our sites in North America to one consolidated platform with a dedicated team focused on continuous improvement on consumer experience. 
We substantially strengthened our innovation and marketing muscle, leveraging consumer insights and foresights. Then we've sharpened brand positioning for many of our top brands. We have established joint business brands and enhanced relationships with key strategic retail partners. We've instituted a new hybrid organizational model that brings our domain experts closer to our customers and consumers while leveraging the center for scale and efficiencies. 
We have made productivity a way of life. We've reduced complexity and overheads, improved cash conversion cycle and strengthened the balance sheet. 2021 has been a turning point for Newell despite challenges posed by supply and inflation. Our teams have done an incredible job executing in this environment. And we are poised to deliver 10-plus percentage core sales growth this year, a first for our company in recent history. 
We recognize that 2021 has been a tale of 2 cities, a first half and second half story. We delivered 23% core sales growth in the first half. And in the second half, we are lapping strong growth from 2020. The fact that we grew 3.2% in Q3 on top of last year's growth is an indication that our brands are resilient, are being rejuvenated, and we have the ability to grow even in this context of strong comps. The power of our diverse portfolio is coming through. 
The macro issues in the pandemic have taught us but we just cannot be reactive. We're laser focused on continuing to strengthen the fundamentals and reducing complexity, including lowering SKU count, improving forecast accuracy, simplifying our IT infrastructure and making it easier for customers to do business with us. We are creating an integrated one Newell distribution network through the consolidation of over 20 supply chains under the banner of Project Ovid.

Looking forward, we expect supply challenges and inflation to persist. Therefore, our stance is one of preparedness and realism and taking proactive actions to successfully navigate the macro environment. If 2021 was a year of turbocharging the top line, 2022 will be focused on improving margins, improving margins through 5 primary levers. 
First, an intense focus on pricing and optimizing promotional spending. We have now taken price increases in 2021 across all of our 8 businesses and most geographies. Our posture will be to maximize the impact of carryover pricing from '21 into '22. And we will be prepared to take further increases in '22 based on inflationary trends to protect gross margin. Of course, we'll do this in consultation with our customers and ensure that our brands remain a great value for consumers. 
Second, we'll accelerate our efforts to improve the profitability of our international business by reducing duplication, consolidating operations and adopting a one Newell approach. Third, we will price innovations to be margin accretive. Fourth, we will continue to be more efficient with overheads. And finally, we'll continue to be -- strive to be best-in-class in our productivity efforts and drive about 3% to 4% improvement in [ COGS ] as we have done over the last few years. 
I'm extremely thankful to our 31,000 hard-working employees for their unwavering commitment, tenacity and perseverance. I remain optimistic that Newell can create tremendous shareholder value, and our best days are ahead of us, onwards and upwards. And now over to Chris."

During the third quarter, we delivered solid results as we continue to drive our strategy into action. Strong operational execution, coupled with financial discipline, enabled us to generate better-than-anticipated operating profit and sustained progress on the cash conversion cycle. We accomplished this in the context of a choppy operating environment as our teams did a terrific job navigating through a myriad of supply and logistical bottlenecks. 
Before getting into the details, I want to provide a little color on the current operating environment and proactive choices we are making. Similar to other companies, throughout the third quarter, we continued to experience significant inflation and supply chain disruption. Escalation in cost has been an ongoing dynamic throughout 2021. While inflationary pressures have been broad-based, the largest impact for us has been around commodities, particularly resin, ocean freight, sourced finished goods and labor. The expected headwind from inflation on 2021 cost of goods sold is now forecast to be about $40 million worse relative to our expectations last quarter. We currently expect inflation to represent 9% of our full year cost of goods sold as compared to our expectation of about 3% at the start of the year. 
We have taken numerous actions to alleviate the headwind from inflation, including leading in on our productivity initiatives, implementing price increases across all of our businesses with some announcing multiple rounds, continuing to exercise disciplined control over expenses, driving efficiencies from promotional spend and leveraging strong top line growth. The full benefit from the mitigating actions to offset the unprecedented inflationary pressures will not flow-through until next year, given the timing lag on pricing. 
We do expect that Q3 represents the largest gap between the pricing and inflation impact to the P&L and expect this gap to narrow sequentially from here. Despite this dynamic and the continued escalation in costs for Q4, we are raising our normalized EPS guidance for this year towards the higher end of the previous range. A strong outcome and a testament to the resilience and excellent execution by our teams. 
Moving on to supply chain. Lead times for sourced products, some components and raw materials have increased significantly from pre-pandemic levels as a result of port congestion, limited container availability as well as shortages in the labor force and truck drivers. This has been an ongoing challenge throughout 2021. However, the significant progress we have driven on SKU rationalization over the past few years, along with an early start on mitigating tactics that put us in an advantage and allowed us to largely meet the strong demand. 
Some of the actions we've taken early in 2021 and throughout the year include the following: building inventory on top-selling and high priority SKUs, improving our forecasting process and adjusting it for longer lead times, diversifying our supplier base where feasible, accelerating automation across our factories and distribution centers and enhancing compensation, benefits, training opportunities and working conditions for our frontline employees. In fact, during the third quarter, we announced meaningful wage increases across many of our factories and distribution centers starting in Q4. 
We do not expect the supply pressures to dissipate in the near term, but we are confident that we are taking appropriate steps to both effectively manage them and create more agility within our supply chain in the future. We recently announced a new supply chain initiative, Ovid, which is expected to transform Newell's go-to-market capabilities and end-to-end customer experience in the U.S., enhance customer service levels and drive significant operational efficiencies. We are planning to optimize the company's distribution network in the U.S. by consolidating 23 business unit-centric supply chains into a single integrated supply chain. We expect it will take about 18 months to fully implement Ovid to minimize any potential disruption we intend to roll it out in waves. 
During Q3, we passed an important milestone as we completed blueprinting and the integrated design phase. We are now moving into the testing and implementation phase. Upon completion, Ovid is expected to streamline, automate and digitize our supply chain and position us as a reliable retailer partner of choice. While Ovid was being contemplated, prior to the recent events, once implemented, it should position us on a much stronger footing going forward. 
Let's now move to third quarter results. Net sales grew 3.3% year-over-year to $2.8 billion mostly driven by a core sales increase of 3.2%. This was an excellent outcome as we cycled against 7.2% core sales growth in the year ago period with difficult comparisons across every segment, except for Learning and Development. Normalized gross margin contracted 330 basis points year-over-year to 30.6%. Gains from FUEL productivity savings, favorable business mix as well as pricing were more than offset by the inflationary headwind, which was nearly 800 basis points in the quarter. Normalized operating margin came in at 11.4%, down from 14.9% a year ago, reflecting gross margin pressure as well as a significant step-up in advertising and promotion expense. 
We continued to tightly manage costs and drive overhead to sales ratio lower year-over-year. Net interest expense came down by $6 million year-over-year to $65 million reflecting debt reduction of about $750 million relative to last year. The normalized tax rate was 8% versus a normalized tax benefit of nearly 7% in the year ago period due to a lower contribution from discrete items. Normalized diluted earnings per share amounted to $0.54 as compared to $0.84 in Q3 of 2020. The unfavorable move in the tax rate accounted for about $0.12 year-over-year. 
Now turning to our segment performance. Core sales for the Commercial Solutions segment decreased 9.2% due to declines in both the Commercial and Connected Home & Security business units, which faced tough year-ago comps. Core sales for Home Appliances grew 1.9% primarily driven by Latin America. Core sales for the Home Solutions segment were down 3.6% as core growth in the Home Fragrance business was more than offset by a decline in Food, which lapped its toughest quarterly comparison of 2020. Core sales for the Learning & Development segment grew 19.6% as both the Writing and Baby business units delivered strong double-digit increases. Core sales in the Outdoor & Recreation segment increased 1.7%. 
Newell's net sales were 8.5% above the third quarter of 2019 with each of the company's segments exceeding levels from 2 years ago. On a 2-year stack basis, core sales increased in the low double digits during Q3 as well as year-to-date periods. Year-to-date, in 2021, the company's operating cash flow was $490 million versus $820 million in the year ago period. This reflects an increase in working capital to support top line momentum and elevated in-transit times for inventory, which more than offset significant operating income growth. We continue to drive improvement in cash conversion cycle, which came down by another 10 days to 79 days. 
At the end of the third quarter, Newell's leverage ratio was 3.1x down from 3.9x a year ago. The improvement reflects our proactive choice to pay down debt as well as a mid-teen increase in trailing 12-month normalized EBITDA. In Q3, the company redeemed approximately EUR 300 million of its 3.75% notes that were due in October 2021. Furthermore, in mid-October, we announced our intention to redeem the remaining $250 million of the company's 4% senior notes next month. 
We have significantly strengthened Newell's balance sheet over the past several years and recently indicated that we are targeting a leverage ratio of 2.5x below our prior goal of 3x. We intend to grow our EBITDA into this target with no immediate plans for additional new debt tender offers. This morning, we updated our outlook for 2021, accounting for the stronger-than-anticipated performance in Q3, further escalation in costs in the fourth quarter, continuation of supply chain disruption as well as a relatively healthy consumer backdrop in the U.S. We are pleased to once again raise our top line forecast for 2021 as a result of healthy consumption and the early actions we have taken to alleviate the supply chain constraints. 
Our revised top line guidance implies that core sales are expected to grow versus 2019 during each quarter of 2021. Our outlook also indicates that core sales will be up versus 2020, in the first and second halves of 2021 as well as for the full year. 
Let's go through the details of the full year 2021 outlook. We currently forecast net sales of $10.38 billion to $10.46 billion up from $10.1 billion to $10.35 billion previously. This represents about 11% year-over-year growth. We are raising our core sales outlook to 10% to 11% from 7% to 10% previously with the majority of the upside in the fourth quarter. While the U.S. dollar has strengthened recently, currency favorability is still expected to modestly outweigh the impact from Yankee Candle retail store closures and other minor business exits. 
As a result of further escalation in costs, including our decision to raise wages for the front line, starting in Q4, we now expect full year normalized operating margin to be slightly down relative to 11.1% in 2020. Our updated forecast implies that normalized operating profit grows at a high single-digit rate, a solid result when factoring in the unprecedented level of inflation. 
We anticipate an increase in the absolute level of advertising and promotion spending. This forecast assumes a mid-teens normalized effective tax rate and a slight increase in shares outstanding. We are pleased to improve our full year normalized earnings per share outlook to $1.69 to $1.73 from a previous range of $1.63 to $1.73. There is no change in our full year operating cash flow guidance of approximately $1 billion as we continue to expect acceleration in Newell's cash conversion cycle. 
Focusing on the fourth quarter, we are guiding for net sales of $2.6 billion to $2.68 billion with core sales expected to be within a range of down 2% to up 1%. Our guidance assumes normalized operating margin of 8.7% to 9.2% versus 11.4% in the year ago period as inflation is expected to outweigh the continued benefits from productivity and pricing. We are forecasting a normalized effective tax rate around 20% and normalized earnings per share in the $0.29 to $0.33 range. 
While we are still early in our budgeting cycle for 2022, I wanted to provide a high-level perspective on how we are approaching it. We are encouraged by the progress our teams have made on the innovation side and have a strong funnel of new ideas planned for next year. However, we anticipate a more muted top line delivery due to a very difficult comparison. While inflation is expected to remain above normal levels, we are looking at significant benefits from carryover pricing as well as productivity. This should result in stronger margin performance in 2022 relative to 2021. We will continue to build operational excellence across the organization as we roll out additional automation projects and make strides with Ovid implementation. We intend to provide more specifics during the fourth quarter call, as has been the norm in recent years. 
We believe we have a strong path for value creation, and we'll continue to diligently execute on our strategic agenda to ensure that we position Newell brands for sustainable and profitable growth. Operator, let's now open the call for Q&A."

Good morning. This is Ravi. Look, Writing really performed very well. I think the big thing was we weren't sure when we went into the quarter, we knew we'd have a good back-to-school, but there was some worries about the Delta variant. I think what became evident was this is one of the issues. Keeping the schools open for in-person learning was a fairly bipartisan view. And so we watched it week by week and saw that the super majority of schools opened, and so that was great. But also a credit to our team because they really hit the ball out of the park on merchandising, on e-commerce, on getting distribution, on innovation. They just have the whole package. And this is, as we have said before, one of the businesses -- this business because we manufacture most of our products, except for Dymo, which comes from China, in Tennessee. And so we were able to have good supply. So I think that really helped. 
And this is still in the backdrop because we had expected maybe offices to start opening up, but because of Delta, they didn't as much. So despite all of that, the fact that the business did extremely well, I think, is positive, and we're seeing that positive momentum continuing. So we're very pleased.

As far as small appliances goes, but we've had -- we've been very -- I'm very pleased to see the progress the team has been making and that we've had so many quarters of growth. Yes, clearly, as we look down the future, you have to say, is it -- has there been some acceleration of consumer purchases. But having said that, I think there are several categories within appliances, and we're driving a lot of innovation. 
So with the whole Mr. Coffee Iced, we now have iced coffee frappe. We've got hot and cold. So we've got a lot of new innovations coming into the market there, that will help us. So -- and we've actually brought in new users. So I think in the main, I feel we're in a good place. But at the end of the day, look, you have to view -- you will not -- you can't look at it just as one particular business for the entire portfolio. And that has been the beauty of how we manage the portfolio in entirety to work each quarter and to work the long term to say how do you drive growth as a whole."

The inflation impact is affecting our business units a little bit differently. The 2 most significantly affected business units are the Commercial business and the Food business. And then there are other businesses like Writing and Home Fragrance, for example, that are much less affected by inflation, but everybody is affected. 
Because of that difference in terms of how the inflation is impacting the business units, and because the inflation picture has continued during the year to get significantly more of a headwind, we've announced pricing on different timings. And so the first set of pricing, broadly, that we put into place -- went into place kind of in the April, May, June time period. The good news about that pricing is that pricing is now fully reflected in retail. And at least to date, we have not seen any negative reaction to consumer demand from the pricing that we put in so far. And so that -- we take that as a very positive sign. 
There is a second round of pricing, broadly, that's going into effect that we've already announced that largely is going into effect in either November or beginning of January. And so when you look at the pricing impact in the P&L, the pricing impact in the P&L is going to get significantly bigger as we go forward sequentially from here. So pricing will be a bigger help in Q4 than it was in Q3. In Q1 of next year, pricing should be largely implemented and it will be a bigger help in Q1 of next year than it is in Q4 of this year. At the same time, inflation, we think, Q3, is if spot rates stay where they are, inflation will have been the biggest impact for us in Q3 of this year, and we'll begin to mitigate as we lap base periods. And so that gap, if you will, between inflation, pricing and productivity, we think Q3 was the biggest delta of that gap, and we think that gap starts to close and reduce sequentially each quarter going forward."

So we kicked off Project Ovid about 10 or 11 months ago, we didn't announce it until Barclays, but we kicked it off 10 or 11 months ago.

So we kicked off Project Ovid about 10 or 11 months ago, we didn't announce it until Barclays, but we kicked it off 10 or 11 months ago. And the reason why we thought now is the right time is because we've made a lot of progress on SKU rationalization. So if you recall, at the end of 2018, when we started with the turnaround plan, the company was trying to sell over 100,000 SKUs. We've now reduced that through last year to 47,000. As of today, we're at 42,000, and we're on our way down to 30,000. 
And so because we've taken that SKU count reduction out and improved the fundamentals of the operation, we believe we're now at a point where we can take the next step, which is to go from 23 unique supply chains into a single integrated supply chain. We think this is going to allow us to move from shipping less-than-truckload shipments in small quantities, enforcing our retailers to order from us 23 different ways into the ability just to order from us in a single way and ship full truckloads. And so from both a service and a cost standpoint, we think that this is going to be a major step forward for the company and really leverage the scale of Newell going forward. 
Now when we kicked Project Ovid off, the supply chain constraints were not how they are today. And so we kicked the project off with that -- without that external backdrop in place. I think the team has done a pretty amazing job of keeping on track. And fortunately, we secured the 2 big new mixing distribution centers prior to the current supply-constrained dynamics. 
And so we're monitoring it. We're going to be prudent on the implementation dates that we go and make sure that we execute the transition with excellence. But if anything, the savings from the project have only gotten bigger as transportation costs have gotten bigger. So in fact, we think the project is likely going to generate more value to us today than when we first started the project 9 months ago or 10 months ago."

Olivia, we have to think about sort of the new journey. I've been here 2 years, Chris close to 3. And look, we've embarked on -- we started it as a turnaround, but we're really talking about a transformation of the company in terms of capabilities and looking at the long term while making sure that the short term is healthy. And so if you think about sort of the first year, we spent a lot of time on stabilizing the organization, getting the culture, revving up the people, bringing the team and the hybrid structure, et cetera. 
Next -- our next phase was all about innovation of our brands, about e-commerce and really getting the top line, which is why you're seeing that momentum. The next one is really all about how do we get our gross margins up. And in addition to the pricing, the supply chain, whether it's automation or Ovid, we think are critical because we have to be easier to do business with, with our customers. This has been going on for years and years. We have to make it easier for our size of the company. 
So with that -- and then the next one is -- will be international. So all of this is about a journey of driving shareholder value. And we obviously manage very carefully the execution burden on our teams and make sure that we don't slip up. But I think these have been managed to a good cadence, and we are very confident that all of these will go along quite well as we progress forward."

So having said that, look, as we approach Q4, recognize a couple of things. One is that we've had a Baby business that has just been growing fantastically like in the teens and for all the reasons I've mentioned in the prepared remarks. But one of the things that's happened, the stimulus did end. And so -- and without the huge rise in birth rates, there's only so many how -- and there's a huge comp last year in the Q4, which is also very strong. So where -- the Baby business is comping very high on Q4. So that clearly, we don't have that. We still have Writing, which is growing in pretty well and so far the businesses. 
So I think we shouldn't get hung up about any particular part of our business because we've got puts and takes. The overall thing is, look, what we're striving to do, Olivia, is to get to sustainable profitable growth over time. And I really think that we're well on our way to do that."

But what I would say is that we certainly believe that next year is going to be a year of margin growth for the company. And the reason for that is what I said earlier, which is a lot of the inflation impact that's hit us this year, there's a timing lag between pricing and inflation. And even if you look at the 2 business units that we have suffered the most inflation, which are Commercial and Food, we're on LIFO accounting, which means in those businesses that the inflation hits us immediately in those businesses, and those have been the 2 biggest impacts. 
So we've probably taken the big inflation impact from the move in resins already in the P&L. The lag in pricing creates a drag in the short term. But when we get into next year, we're expecting the benefit of carryover pricing plus productivity to be higher than the inflation impact next year if based on our current forecast, which is based on spot rates going forward. 
By the way, we're also -- as we think about the planning for next year, we are not assuming that inflation is going to be transitory. We are assuming that inflation is going to be significantly above normal next year, and we are building our plan, assuming that. And we are still confident despite that, that we are going to have significant margin growth next year"

If you look at our businesses, the 8 businesses we have today, the place where we have a lot of commonality is in the top retailers. And so if you look at the top 4 retailers that the company does business with in the U.S., Walmart, Target, Amazon and Costco, those top 4 retailers are pretty consistent across every one of our business units. And the thing that's good about that is that's why this integrated supply chain network makes a lot of sense because we're shipping to the same customers, the same locations. And instead of forcing those retailers to give us 23 separate orders and then we ship from 23 locations and we have 23 invoices and we're shipping 23 small less-than-truckload shipments, if we can have them give us one order on one set of terms and ship on full truck, that is a huge efficiency for both us and for the retailer. And I think it allows us to create a competitive advantage versus many of our subscale competitors. 
So that's largely the thinking behind that. On the portfolio pruning point, I think we've been pretty consistent there, which is we think we've got strong organic growth opportunities in both top and bottom line in each of our business units. It doesn't mean that we're not going to do some portfolio moves in the future but we're likely going to be more on the tuck-in or acquisition or tuck-out divestiture side. But we're going to be driven by shareholder value creation as we think about any portfolio moves."

On the overhead part, we do not expect Ovid to have a material impact on overhead. What I will say is that embedded in this year's guidance is a pretty significant overhead investment that we've made in the team and consulting costs, et cetera, for the Ovid project, but that's already embedded in our existing guidance. And when we actually complete the project, that cost will come out. And so eventually, that sort of above going cost that we've got built in this year on overhead is likely to go away as we get to 2023. 
On the share repurchase question, just to be clear, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we retired about EUR 300 million of debt in Q3. In Q4, we've called our June 22 notes of [ EUR 250 ] million, which we expect to retire in Q4 of this year. From -- as we go into next year, we do not expect any more reduction in the level of our gross debt. And we think that, as we move into next year, we are going to move to our leverage target through EBITDA growth not through debt reduction. And as a result, we think that, as we move into next year, it's going to open up the opportunity for share repurchase as we expect to generate more than enough cash to cover investment in the business and the dividends fully.

We think throughout the year this year on a year-to-date basis, the candle business, I'd hate to use the word saying it's been on fire, but it's been doing amazingly well. And we do believe that we're making a lot of traction in the Baby business. We've been gaining share. So I think we've got different businesses where we are gaining share. And -- but there are some businesses where the demand has been so high and unexpected that -- and also it depends on the price points we played out. 
Like in appliances, while we've had terrific growth, we operate more on the opening price points. And so there were -- so on a dollar basis, even though we've had good growth, we may not be seeing the share improvement. So I think it varies. Outdoor, where we bring stuff -- I mean, we're really pleased to see the good growth that is happening. And I think we're beginning to really get supply right. We had some issues during July, August, but I think we're now back on track there. And the outdoor, the beverage side, especially, we're getting back on track. So I think it varies. 
Our Food business, some of the demand has been so high on things like Ball. Certainly, that has been a challenge for us. And -- but Ball, that is really the very -- it's got such a dominant share of that business. So that's sort of -- that has been complicated for us from lids, bottles, et cetera. So it varies and -- but let's put it this way. Everything we can do to maximize the top line opportunity, we're doing, working in close collaboration with our customers. But it's been tough on service levels because I wish our service levels were better. But every competitor today, I think, is wishing there be better. 
So I can't say it's nirvana, but I do think that we're doing our best. And I really feel the one thing I can tell you, Lauren, our brands are in a better shape and rejuvenated far better today than they were. And I know one of your favorite businesses of ours is Baby. I'll tell you about -- you didn't ask me, but I'll tell you because you usually asked about our Baby innovation. So I'm very excited about the Baby Jogger City turn where you can turn the car seat to how the baby face you. Now I wish I had grandkids. My daughter is going to get married. So hopefully, I can start using this someday, but that -- and the City turn strollers. So I think Baby genre, we're doing a lot to rejuvenate that business. So look, brands are in good shape. So we'll get the top line and the share where we can."
