It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 1.4%, driven by 130 basis points of favorable price and 10 basis points of organic volume growth. Gross margin for the quarter was up 110 basis points to 44.2% and benefited from productivity, price and acquisitions. EBIT margin for the quarter was 23.6% of revenue, an increase of 250 basis points from the third quarter last year, due primarily to higher gross margin attainment and lower operating expenses for travel, sales and marketing and competition due in part from the business disruption from COVID-19. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.4%, somewhat lower-than-anticipated due to favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 20% to $149.2 million and earnings increased to $1.73 per diluted share as compared to $1.45 per diluted share in the prior year. Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Our leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter is once again below 2x as we continue to pay down debt post the Key Surgical acquisition. Considering our cash position of $253 million, access to available credit lines and a low leverage ratio, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. 
During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $53.8 million, while depreciation and amortization was $56.8 million. Free cash flow for the first 9 months was strong at $337.7 million, an increase of almost $100 million over the same period last year, primarily due to improvements in net income and working capital somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

It's a pleasure to be with you to discuss our third quarter results, which once again demonstrate the resilience of our business and the great work of our associates to serve the needs of our customers. Once again",1497,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you to discuss our third quarter results, which once again demonstrate the resilience of our business and the great work of our associates to serve the needs of our customers. Once again, we want to acknowledge the caregivers around the globe who are on the front lines of this pandemic and doing such a tremendous job. 
Looking back at the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year, the sequential improvement of our business is impressive. While we continue to experience the challenges of a global pandemic, the worst impact on our business appears to be in the rearview mirror. Despite significant numbers of new COVID-19 cases and some hospitals around the globe close to or at capacity, procedures continue to occur. 
Our most significant concern, healthcare capital equipment achieved a critical milestone, showing 3 straight quarters of sequential improvement and ending the third quarter with an all-time record order month. This resulted in near record backlog, which is greater than that before the pandemic at the end of Q3 last year. 
Even with pockets of slowdowns in procedures due to COVID-19 uptick, we are quite pleased with our position at this point of our fiscal year. Constant currency organic revenue grew 1% in our third quarter, driven by double-digit growth in AST, which was offset by flat to slightly down revenue in Life Sciences and Healthcare on a constant currency organic basis. 
Our strong growth in AST continues to be favorably impacted by demand for COVID-related single-use products such as PPE and COVID testing materials as well as components used in vaccine manufacturing and packaging. The business has also seen steady demand from its core medical device customers. Life Science revenue was flat in the quarter, with mid- single-digit growth in consumables and services, offset by a decline in capital equipment shipments. 
On the consumable side, we have been anticipating a return to more normalized growth for some time. It appears our customers are destocking the excess inventory that was built up over the last 3 quarters. With COVID vaccines now in production, we expect to see sustained high demand for our consumables offering, but not at the extraordinary growth rate of recent quarters when our pharma customers built inventory due to surety supply concerns for vaccine production. And as we have commented frequently over the years, capital equipment shipments in Life Science can be lumpy. The decline in Q3 was strictly a matter of timing as capital equipment orders were strong in the quarter, reflected in our Life Sciences record capital equipment order backlog. 
Healthcare benefited from the addition of key surgical during the quarter, which added about $15 million to Healthcare Consumable revenue. While it's still early days, we are quite pleased with our integration efforts and what we're seeing so far in that business. We continue to have high expectations for key surgical going forward. 
As I mentioned earlier, while the shipments for healthcare capital equipment declined year-over-year for the quarter, we did see sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3 and backlog ended above last year's levels. We are cautiously optimistic about our fourth quarter and start of our new fiscal year regarding health care capital equipment as the risks appear to have declined throughout this fiscal year. 
Our profit overall has exceeded our expectations as we continue to see the benefit of continued efficiency gains, along with lower operating expenses. The operating expense reduction is largely due to travel disruptions from the pandemic. As we've said all year, we do expect some of those expenses to phase back in as travel resumes, returning our operating expenses to more normal levels. 
We are committed, however, to evaluating opportunities to permanently reduce expenses as we have learned that some things can be accomplished virtually. Adjusted earnings for the quarter, as Mike mentioned, we're $1.73 per diluted share or growth of 19% as we benefited from higher gross margins, reduced operating expenses and a slightly lower-than-anticipated tax rate. 
With just 2 months remaining in our fiscal year, we like where we stand today and the long-term positioning of our global portfolio. Our thoughts on the full fiscal year have not changed materially from what we discussed last quarter. Constant currency organic revenue, excluding acquisitions, should be about flat for the fiscal year, that's impressive performance in this environment. But it is safe to say that we all look forward to getting back to normal and delivering the revenue growth we know we are capable of in the longer term. 
Once again, I would like to thank STERIS people for their commitment to our customers. Those health care professionals who continue to do a simply miraculous job on the front lines of this pandemic. We also welcome the people of Key Surgical to our team, and we're working through the process to complete the acquisition of Cantel Medical and look forward to welcoming the Cantel people to the STERIS family as well. 
Now before we open to Q&A, I want to comment on our announcement that I will be stepping down as CEO at the end of July. The Board and I have been working on my succession for years. And while we have other capable candidates, Dan Carestio, our current Chief Operating Officer, is our unanimous choice. Dan, the Board and I have been working to prepare him for this transition. And as the announcement said, I will be available through July of 2023 as an adviser to management and the Board. 
As you all know, I hold a significant amount of STERIS stock and options and continue to be highly vested in our long-term success, both personally and financially. When I came to STERIS a little over 13 years ago, the preponderance of investors and analysts advised me to exit the Life Science and AST business due to their more                 performance. I worked with the executives of those groups to determine whether or not that was the way to go. The answer is now abundantly clear, and we have Dan and his teams to thank for the improvements in those segments. 
Dan's early executive leadership role was running sales and marketing for the AST group. He developed and implemented the strategy to improve that business. A few years later, I asked him to take on Life Science as a General Manager, while maintaining the sales and marketing leadership for AST. He worked with that team and led the improvement in Life Sciences, while continuing the success at AST. He then successfully integrated Synergy Health AST business as General Manager of AST and Life Sciences. Dan took on the leadership of our healthcare IPT business several years ago, making him responsible then for all sterilization and disinfection products across the STERIS portfolio. And finally, he became responsible for all of our operations as Chief Operating Officer in 2018. STERIS' performance in the past 13 years, for which I have happily been able to take credit, are significantly the result of the work done by Dan and his management teams. I am extremely confident that he is the right person to leave STERIS into the future. 
To add to that confidence, I could relate a similar story about many additional members of our senior management team, especially including our CFO, our General Counsel; and the leaders of the commercial operations and business units of STERIS. Almost all of those leaders have been with us or companies we've acquired for over 15 years and have stepped up and made significant improvements in their operations, while taking on increasing responsibility as we have grown. 
They've done great work that is individually and collectively added to the success of our company. The median tenure of our 27 members of our senior management team is over 15 years, longer than I've been with the company. The median age is 53, so most should be here for a good long time. That talent and senior management team, along with the 13,000 people of STERIS are the bedrock of our past success and why STERIS' future is bright, and Dan and I both know it. 
I'm looking forward to having more time to spend with my family beginning this fall. I'm blessed with the wife of over 40 years. I meant to say a wonderful life of over 40 years and have 2 fantastic adult children and their spouses who have given us 9 young grandchildren. And I'm not stepping down until the end of July, and we'll be fully engaged as CEO until that time. With that, I will be available to our management team and the Board of Directors for an additional 2 years. 
We believe as STERIS is stronger and better positioned than ever. The STERIS team stands ready to capture additional opportunities, and we continue to be confident that the future of STERIS is bright. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Julie for Q&A."

But first, Walt, you sort of talked about what you want to do with your time. But why is now the right time for you to be leaving? And in particular, because you indicated that you'd be in a sort of consulting role here for -- until July of 2023?

I do think, again, there's always significant risk opportunities, whatever in the life of a company, that's the beauty of it. By the way, that's why CEOs work 60, 70 hours a week is because there's always something going on. There's too much to do all the time. So there's no perfect time, in my view, as it relates to that. Having said that, the right time is, again, while I'm still very active, very engaged, love what I'm doing. But see the end and when Dan is ready. And he's a little more than ready, he's probably in the                 to get my                 out of here. But the short answer is that, I think, is the key, is timing of the person leaving and the successor. 
Now having said that, if anyone who knows me knows that I'm not going to retire today, I'll be in there 60 hours a week until July 29, and they'll be lucky if they can get me out of here in less than 60 hours for the several months after that. I love what I do. Love the business. For the last 2 or 3 years, for all intents and purposes, I've been giving advice, not driving the business anyway. The people -- this senior management team in this business is extraordinary. And they don't need a whole lot of help in truth. And people like Dan and Mike and the people that work with them are more than capable of doing this work. I mean, truth of the matter is I've hardly been involved in Key because Dan has pretty much taken that on. 
I've been more involved in Cantel for some of my obvious reasons. And I had historic relationships there. But in terms of implementing the work, I haven't been an inflator for quite a while. So these guys are perfectly capable. I use guys in the both sexes term. By the way, 1/3 of that senior management team is female. So I'm serious about using it in the sex-neutral term, if you will. But these people know what they're doing, and they will do a great job with or without me. Dan, I'll turn the second half to you."

There's some some real synergies between the 3 businesses that we believe will play out in the future. And we're well down the path already in terms of integration as it relates to Key Surgical, and we're confident with where we are and the performance of the business.

So we are getting some benefit right now in terms of the COVID-related business, like testing kits and swabs and things of that nature, clearly are in high demand, and frankly, everybody with a 3D printer these days is making swabs for test kits right now, and those need to be sterile. 
In addition, we're seeing increased demand from bio manufacturers, syringe manufacturers and folks involved in supplying components into the manufacturing process for vaccine as well as significant growth in what we would categorize as bioprocess sterile disposables they're using pharmaceutical manufacturing. Those have been on a strong growth uptick for a number of years, but it has been accelerated by the demand in vaccine production. 
Now having said that, we're still seeing less than normal demand from our core medical device customers, especially those that operate in the realm of more elective type procedures, things like orthopedics and spine and things of that nature. So much of the core business has still been a bit suppressed in terms of normal growth rate or north. And we believe those return to normalcy, if you will, that will more than offset the short-term impact of some of the COVID-related benefit. 
Now having said that, vaccines aren't going away. I don't anticipate seeing any slowdown in either the Bioprocess disposable business or any of the packaging or materials going into vaccines in the future. So we think that will sustain at a pretty high level."

So obviously, very strong free cash flow for the first 9 months of the fiscal year. And as I stated earlier, the combination of increases in net income and working capital improvement, specifically when I'm talking working capital improvements, we've seen fantastic efforts across our business in the collections of our outstanding AR, our balances. And actually, our DSO has once again been down about 2 days for the third quarter, and we've continued to see improvements in those collection efforts throughout the whole year. And that's on top of elevated inventory levels, which we continue to maintain surety supply and level load. 
So if I look at longer term, obviously, I don't know if the levels of AR collections will be this good sitting here next year, but obviously, the opportunity for us is to reduce the inventory. So hopefully, over time, we continue and should continue to improve our free cash flow position. As far as our capital expenditures, year-to-date, we're up $11 million compared to where we were at this point last year. We anticipate to continue to spend at elevated levels not only for the rest of this year, but also as we look out for the next couple of years, specifically around our continued expansions into our AST segment, we spent roughly $100 million on the year over the last couple of years on those expansions. And sitting here today, I would guess that we would continue to spend a couple of hundred million dollars, at least annually for the next couple of years going forward."

Just trying to make -- get a better understanding of what types of projects you're seeing there that drove that new record backlog in that segment? And then secondly, I would like to follow-on to Larry's comment regarding the cash flow, which was extremely strong in the quarter, especially in light of what's transpiring. Just want to think -- or maybe this is for Mike or for Dan, if we should start to step up our expectations for free cash flow generation. When we look at the yield versus the sales line historically, you're trending up. And clearly, AST seems to be supporting that with higher margins. So I just want to think about how we should think about cash flow on a longer-term basis as well?"

The number of new products we have in the space right now is very, very strong. Virtually everything in our surgical line has been refreshed in the last 12 to 18 months. Booms, lights, tables, ORI. We have several new products that are in the infrastructure space. They're all doing nicely. So Surgical is clearly the operating room, what we call surgical is the operating room is very strong right now relative to last year. And IPT continues to be just an extraordinary piece of business on the capital side. So between the 2. And I would say, although, we had and still have a little trepidation about capital spending, when things -- when hospitals tend to pull back a little bit in capital, one of the last places they tend to pull back is with the surgeons who generate the income for the hospital. So we have traditionally not pulled back as hard as some other areas when things go bad. That means we don't jump up as much when things get a little bit better. 
But I think it's a combination of -- there was a little gap when there wasn't so many orders. I think they seem to be back to ""normal"", at least in our space on the surgical and IPT space. So I'd say at a high level, that's it. Now I'll let the other guys talk about the cash flow question you asked."

But one of the other things that you got to be cautious about is, as we do adjusted earnings on the P&L standpoint, we do not do adjusted free cash flow. So as we continue with acquisitions, especially the integrations, and the cost of those integrations, especially around Cantel, we're going to be spending a significant amount of cash to get those cost synergies. 
So I'd be just cautious. If you were to back out and start doing an adjusted free cash flow, I would agree with you that it may be time to look at our step-wise change. But since we do not report that way, I would just be cautious of how you look at it."

So Dan, if you average out the last 3 quarters for Life Sciences, consumables, it's about 25% growth off a pretty good base, which is good. But I guess it's just hard to believe that new vaccine demand is only up 25%. Can you give us a sense of like the mix of Life Sciences consumables tied to vaccines? And then also, when and where are your Life Science consumables typically used in production in comparison to?

So what I would say is, I think we've talked about, and you stated as well on a year-to-date basis, our Life Science consumable business is up roughly 25%, give or take. And what we're seeing now is a little bit of pullback in terms of as our customers burn off some of the the inventory they built early on in the early phase of the pandemic when there's a lot of concerns about of supply. And we made it a point at STERIS to serve our existing customers in pharma and never deviate from that and sell outside of market to make sure those folks knew that we would have those validated chemistries as demand continue to rise as they got into vaccine. 
In terms of an actual percentage of how much is going to vaccine, it is impossible for me to say. And the reason why is that many of the vaccine manufacturers are also -- have been long-term large customers of STERIS that use our product                 environment from a bioprocess cleaning perspective in their normal day-to-day production of pharmaceuticals and biopharma. So it's not as if we're tracking down to the SHOP 4 level as to every application our products go into. 
What we know, though, is that we are getting some uptick from vaccine as our customers sort of refocus in that area, especially around COVID. And we believe that will be a trend that continues. In terms of the beta bag product, that's a sterile transfer product that has an integrated lift or an isolator, it's not something we do. We are in the space of sterility maintenance and sterility assurance as it relates to bioprocess, no doubt with our sterile products solution group of products. And those have continued to do very well since the beginning of the pandemic -- they've done well since the time of acquisition, actually, but they've done very well since the pandemic really started, and those products are up in the well and has stayed fairly consistent in terms of their growth as opposed to slowing down, as we've seen in the chemistries piece. 
Specifically on the chemistries, we have mainly 2 offerings there. One is what we call critical environment products, and those are disinfecting some sterilants that are largely used in either aseptic manufacturing process or highly regulated clean rooms for pharma manufacturing. Not a lot has changed in terms of their application with COVID. There's just more application as it relates to increased vaccine production. 
And then the other large portion of our consumable business is what we would call bioprocess cleaners. And those are chemistry use for cleaning out the actual biopharma equipment used in the manufacturing process. So in between production runs, they assure they have the highest level of purity in terms of how they treat their machines the stainless steel in the process."

It was about -- I think, about $15 million uptick in revenue in the first quarter, and throughout this year, we really -- we've gotten rid of the backlog, if you will. But last year, it is still reflected in the backlog. And if you look year-over-year, there's about $12 million in last year's backlog. So if you need to adjust last year's backlog if you want a true apples-to-apples comparison, if you do that, obviously, we would be at an all-time record. But that's why we're near our record backlog because of that impact. 
Yes we'd be $12 million to $15 million over last year and $12 million or $13 million over the best year we've ever had, the best spot we've ever had. And then the second question? Sorry."

Obviously, the areas that have been very strong -- have tended to be toward our higher-margin products. So there has been a bit of a mix effect. And as we ship more of the capital and as we do more of that. There will be some, I'll call it, mix effect. But as you know, we don't plan on keeping our cost the same level ever. And so we are working to reduce costs, some of which we pass on through lack of price increase to our customers, some of which we take to the bottom line. So that's one set of mixes. 
And then as we bring the other businesses on board, it depends on which parts of those businesses are coming in. There is a natural mix effect. But on the other hand, given the level of synergies that we see, we think we will be offsetting that. So we think that if you were to look at it in a pro forma basis, if you will, how those businesses all look today and add them together, the margins are going to go up because we're going to take more than $100 million out of the businesses that are coming on board. So we feel very good about that. 
And you know from our long association that I only care about growing profit dollars. As long as we can go profit dollars double digits, that's what the team's mandate is. And if we happen to -- the margin happens to go up 10 basis points or down 10 basis points, I don't know there's any sleep over it. But in the end, it's pretty hard to grow revenue at high single digits and margins and then profits double digits unless we grow margins, and that's our mandate."

And that is what's going to happen with all these backlog surgeries that are elective or semi-elective once we get back to a normal steady state in terms of COVID in operating.

So we've taken the opportunity to capture those costs also, we've been able to get some government reimbursement for those folks at the same time. So we're netting that cost into the adjustments. 
In addition to that, we have had to put in some training tools. We've done some enhanced cleanings, some different protocols that we've also done in our facilities across the globe. We've made some modifications to our buildings. Obviously, traffic patterns have changed,                 has changed. So all of those costs surrounding that is what we're capturing, and we're identifying separately as the COVID incremental cost as we're adjusting those out.

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 1.4%, driven by 130 basis points of favorable price and 10 basis points of organic volume growth. Gross margin for the quarter was up 110 basis points to 44.2% and benefited from productivity, price and acquisitions. EBIT margin for the quarter was 23.6% of revenue, an increase of 250 basis points from the third quarter last year, due primarily to higher gross margin attainment and lower operating expenses for travel, sales and marketing and compensation due in part from the business disruption from COVID-19.  
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.4%, somewhat lower than anticipated due to favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 20% to $149.2 million and earnings increased to $1.73 per diluted share as compared to $1.45 per diluted share in the prior year. 
Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Our leverage ratio, at the end of the third quarter, is once again below 2x as we continue to pay down debt post the Key Surgical acquisition. Considering our cash position of $253 million, access to available credit lines and a low leverage ratio, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint.  
During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $53.8 million, while depreciation and amortization was $56.8 million. Free cash flow for the first 9 months was strong at $337.7 million, an increase of almost $100 million over the same period last year, primarily due to improvements in net income and working capital, somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures.  
With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

It's a pleasure to be with you to discuss our third quarter results, which once again demonstrate the resilience of our business and the great work of our associates to serve the needs of our customers. Once again",1499,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you to discuss our third quarter results, which once again demonstrate the resilience of our business and the great work of our associates to serve the needs of our customers. Once again, we want to acknowledge the caregivers around the globe, who are on the front lines of this pandemic and doing such a tremendous job.  
Looking back at the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year, the sequential improvement of our business is impressive. While we continue to experience the challenges of a global pandemic, the worst impact on our business appears to be in the rearview mirror. Despite significant numbers of new COVID-19 cases and some hospitals around the globe close to or at capacity, procedures continue to occur.  
Our most significant concern, Healthcare capital equipment, achieved a critical milestone, showing 3 straight quarters of sequential improvement and ending the third quarter with an all-time record order month. This resulted in near record backlog, which is greater than that before the pandemic at the end of Q3 last year.  
Even with pockets of slowdowns in procedures due to COVID-19 uptick, we are quite pleased with our position at this point of our fiscal year. Constant currency organic revenue grew 1% in our third quarter, driven by double-digit growth in AST, which was offset by flat to slightly down revenue in Life Sciences and Healthcare on a constant currency organic basis.  
Our strong growth in AST continues to be favorably impacted by demand for COVID-related single-use products, such as PPE and COVID testing materials as well as components used in vaccine manufacturing and packaging. The business has also seen steady demand from its core medical device customers. Life Sciences revenue was flat in the quarter, with mid-single digit growth in consumables and services, offset by a decline in capital equipment shipments.  
On the consumable side, we have been anticipating a return to more normalized growth for some time. It appears our customers are destocking the excess inventory that was built up over the last 3 quarters. With COVID vaccines now in production, we expect to see sustained high demand for our consumables offering, but not at the extraordinary growth rate of recent quarters when our pharma customers built inventory due to shortage of supply concerns for vaccine production. 
And as we have commented frequently over the years, capital equipment shipments in Life Sciences can be lumpy. The decline in Q3 was strictly a matter of timing as capital equipment orders were strong in the quarter, reflected in our Life Sciences record capital equipment order backlog.  
Healthcare benefited from the addition of Key Surgical during the quarter, which added about $15 million to Healthcare consumable revenue. While it's still early days, we are quite pleased with our integration efforts and what we're seeing so far in that business. We continue to have high expectations for Key Surgical going forward.  
As I mentioned earlier, while the shipments for healthcare capital equipment declined year-over-year for the quarter, we did see sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3 and backlog ended above last year's levels. We are cautiously optimistic about our fourth quarter and start of our new fiscal year regarding Healthcare capital equipment as the risks appear to have declined throughout this fiscal year.  
Our profit overall has exceeded our expectations as we continue to see the benefit of continued efficiency gains, along with lower operating expenses. The operating expense reduction is largely due to travel disruptions from the pandemic. As we've said all year, we do expect some of those expenses to phase back in as travel resumes, returning our operating expenses to more normal levels.  
We are committed, however, to evaluating opportunities to permanently reduce expenses as we have learned that some things can be accomplished virtually. Adjusted earnings for the quarter, as Mike mentioned, were $1.73 per diluted share or growth of 19% as we benefited from higher gross margins, reduced operating expenses and a slightly lower-than-anticipated tax rate.  
With just 2 months remaining in our fiscal year, we like where we stand today and the long-term positioning of our global portfolio. Our thoughts on the full fiscal year have not changed materially from what we discussed last quarter. Constant currency organic revenue, excluding acquisitions, should be about flat for the fiscal year. That's impressive performance in this environment, but it is safe to say that we all look forward to getting back to normal and delivering the revenue growth we know we are capable of in the longer term.  
Once again, I would like to thank STERIS people for their commitment to our customers, those health care professionals who continue to do a simply miraculous job on the front lines of this pandemic. We also welcome the people of Key Surgical to our team. And we're working through the process to complete the acquisition of Cantel Medical and look forward to welcoming the Cantel people to the STERIS family as well.  
Now before we open to Q&A, I want to comment on our announcement that I will be stepping down as the CEO at the end of July. The Board and I have been working on my succession for years. And while we have other capable candidates, Dan Carestio, our current Chief Operating Officer, is our unanimous choice. Dan, the Board and I have been working to prepare him for this transition. And as the announcement said, I will be available through July of 2023 as an adviser to management and the Board.  
As you all know, I hold a significant amount of STERIS stock and options, and continue to be highly vested in our long-term success, both personally and financially. When I came to STERIS a little over 13 years ago, the preponderance of investors and analysts advised me to exit the Life Sciences and AST business due to their morbe and performance. 
I worked with the executives of those groups to determine whether or not that was the way to go. The answer is now abundantly clear, and we have Dan and his teams to thank for the improvements in those segments.  
Dan's early executive leadership role was running sales and marketing for the AST group. He developed and implemented the strategy to improve that business. A few years later, I asked him to take on Life Science as a General Manager, while maintaining the sales and marketing leadership for AST. He worked with that team and led the improvement in Life Sciences, while continuing the success at AST. 
He then successfully integrated Synergy Health AST business as General Manager of AST and Life Sciences. Dan took on the leadership of our Healthcare IPT business several years ago, making him responsible then for all sterilization and disinfection products across the STERIS portfolio. 
And finally, he became responsible for all of our operations as Chief Operating Officer in 2018. STERIS' performance in the past 13 years, for which I have happily been able to take credit, are significantly the result of the work done by Dan and his management teams. I am extremely confident that he is the right person to lead STERIS into the future.  
To add to that confidence, I could relate a similar story about many additional members of our senior management team, especially including our CFO, our General Counsel, and the leaders of the commercial operations and business units of STERIS. Almost all of those leaders have been with us or companies we've acquired for over 15 years and have stepped up and made significant improvements in their operations, while taking on increasing responsibility as we have grown.  
They've done great work that has individually and collectively added to the success of our company. The median tenure of our 27 members of our senior management team is over 15 years, longer than I've been with the company. The median age is 53, so most should be here for a good long time. That talent in senior management team, along with the 13,000 people of STERIS are the bedrock of our past success and why STERIS' future is bright, and Dan and I both know it.  
I'm looking forward to having more time to spend with my family beginning this fall. I'm blessed with the wife of over 40 years. I meant to say, a wonderful life of over 40 years, and have 2 fantastic adult children and their spouses, who have given us 9 young grandchildren. And I'm not stepping down until the end of July, and will be fully engaged as CEO until that time. After that, I will be available to our management team and the Board of Directors for an additional 2 years.  
We believe that STERIS is stronger and better positioned than ever. The STERIS team stands ready to capture additional opportunities, and we continue to be confident that the future of STERIS is bright.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Julie for Q&A."

I guess, I wanted to just pick up on a couple of points on the succession, and then I had a couple of quick sort of maintenance questions. But first, Walt, you sort of talked about what you want to do with your time. But why is now the right time for you to be leaving, and in particular, because you indicated that you'd be in a sort of consulting role here for -- until July of 2023?
And then the second part of that question, I'd really love to hear from Dan because I think the -- one of the big investor questions will be, this is all happening in front of the acquisition of Cantel. And so I'd really love to hear from Dan sort of just his thoughts around how he sees approaching integration and specific thoughts around Key and Cantel specifically."

I do think, again, there's always significant risk opportunities, whatever in the life of a company, that's the beauty of it, by the way. That's why, the CEOs work 60, 70 hours a week is because there's always something going on. There's too much to do all the time. So there's no perfect time, in my view, as it relates to that. 
Having said that, the right time is, again, while I'm still very active, very engaged, love what I'm doing, but see the end. And when Dan is ready, and he's a little more than ready, he's probably a little anxious to get my a** out of here. But the short answer is that, I think, is the key, is timing of the person leaving and the successor.  
Now having said that, if anyone who knows me knows that I'm not going to retire today, I'll be in there 60 hours a week until July 29, and they'll be lucky if they can get me out of here in less than 60 hours a week for the several months after that. I love what I do, love the business. 
For the last 2 or 3 years, for all intents and purposes, I've been giving advice, not driving the business anyway. The people of this -- senior management team in this business is extraordinary. And they don't need a whole lot of help, in truth. And people like Dan and Mike and the people that work with them are more than capable of doing this work. I mean, truth of the matter is, I've hardly been involved in Key because Dan has pretty much taken that on.  
I've been more involved in Cantel for some of my obvious reasons. And I had historic relationships there. But in terms of implementing the work, I haven't been an implementer for quite a while. So these guys are perfectly capable. I use guys in the -- both sexes term. By the way, 1/3 of that senior management team is female. So I'm serious about using it in the sex-neutral term, if you will. But these people know what they're doing, and they will do a great job with or without me.

And we're ready to execute once we get through the proper regulatory processes on that deal. 
In terms of the timing as for Key, opportunity here for STERIS is to look at the broader integration of Key and STERIS and Cantel. There are some real synergies between the 3 businesses that we believe will play out in the future. And we're well down the path already in terms of integration as it relates to Key Surgical, and we're confident with where we are and the performance of the business.  
And our management teams have done roughly 50 deals over the last 6, 7, 8 years, right? This is -- I don't want to say it's another day in the office. This is a big deal, there's no doubt. But we did a pretty nice job with these exact teams working on synergy on the integration of that fairly large deal 5 or 6 years ago.

And frankly, everybody with a 3D printer these days is making swabs for test kits right now, and those need to be sterile. 
In addition, we're seeing increased demand from bio manufacturers, syringe manufacturers and folks involved in supplying components into the manufacturing process for vaccine as well as significant growth in what we would categorize as bioprocess sterile disposables, they're using pharmaceutical manufacturing. Those have been on a strong growth uptick for a number of years, but it has been accelerated by the demand in vaccine production. 
Now having said that, we're still seeing less than normal demand from our core medical device customers, especially those that operate in the realm of more elective type procedures, things like orthopedics and spine and things of that nature. So much of the core business has still been a bit suppressed in terms of normal growth rate or normalcy. And we believe those -- return to normalcy, if you will, that will more than offset the short-term impact of some of the COVID-related benefit. 
Now having said that, vaccines aren't going away. I don't anticipate seeing any slowdown in either the bioprocess disposable business or any of the packaging or materials going into vaccines in the future. So we think that will sustain at a pretty high level."

So obviously, very strong free cash flow for the first 9 months of the fiscal year. And as I stated earlier, the combination of increases in net income and working capital improvements, specifically when I'm talking working capital improvements, we've seen fantastic efforts across our business in the collections of our outstanding AR, our balances, and actually, our DSO has once again been down about 2 days for the third quarter, and we've continued to see improvements in those collection efforts throughout the whole year. And that's on top of elevated inventory levels, which we continue to maintain surety supply and level load. 
So if I look at longer term, obviously, I don't know if the levels of AR collections will be this good sitting here next year, but obviously, the opportunity for us is to reduce the inventory. So hopefully, over time, we continue and should continue to improve our free cash flow position. 
As far as our capital expenditures, year-to-date, we're up $11 million compared to where we were at this point last year. We anticipate to continue to spend at elevated levels, not only for the rest of this year, but also as we look out for the next couple of years, specifically around our continued expansions into our AST segment. We spent roughly $100 million a year over the last couple of years on those expansions. And sitting here today, I would guess that we would continue to spend a couple of hundred million dollars, at least annually, for the next couple of years going forward."

But also, I want to acknowledge that you've always had a very astute steady hand at the keel throughout the entire time, and you're going to be missed, but look forward to working with Dan. 
Maybe just two quick ones for me here this morning. First, when we think about what you're seeing more so on the Healthcare side with capital in that build, just trying to make -- get a better understanding of what types of projects you're seeing there that drove that new record backlog in that segment. 
And then secondly, I would like to follow-on to Larry's comment regarding the cash flow, which was extremely strong in the quarter, especially in light of what's transpiring. Just want to think -- or maybe this is for Mike or for Dan, if we should start to step up our expectations for free cash flow generation. When we look at the yield versus the sales line historically, you're trending up. And clearly, AST seems to be supporting that with higher margins. So I just want to think about how we should think about cash flow on a longer-term basis as well?"

The number of new products we have in the space right now is very, very strong. Virtually, everything in our surgical line has been refreshed in the last 12 to 18 months. Booms, lights, tables, ORI, we have several new products that are in the infrastructure space. They're all doing nicely. So surgical is clearly -- the operating room, what we call surgical is the operating room, is very strong right now relative to last year. And IPT continues to be just an extraordinary piece of business on the capital side. 
So between the two, and I would say, although, we had and still have a little trepidation about capital spending, when things -- when hospitals tend to pull back a little bit in capital, one of the last places they tend to pull back is with the surgeons who generate the income for the hospital. So we have traditionally not pulled back as hard as some other areas when things go bad. That means, we don't jump up as much when things get a little bit better. 
But I think it's a combination of -- there was a little gap when there weren't so many orders. I think they seem to be back to ""normal"", at least in our space on the surgical and IPT space. So I'd say at a high level, that's it. Now I'll let the other guys talk about the cash flow question you asked."

Obviously, we are very proud of what we've accomplished this year from not only an earnings perspective, but also from a free cash flow standpoint. Although, again, as we are not giving guidance the rest of this year, we hope to give guidance, I would think, in the May timeframe for the new fiscal year. 
But one of the other things that you got to be cautious about is, as we do adjusted earnings on the P&L standpoint, we do not do adjusted free cash flow. So as we continued with acquisitions, especially the integrations and the cost of those integrations, especially around Cantel, we're going to be spending a significant amount of cash to get those cost synergies. 
So I'd be just cautious. If you were to back out and start doing an adjusted free cash flow, I would agree with you that it may be time to look at our stepwise change. But since we do not report that way, I would just be cautious of how you look at it."

So what I would say is, I think we've talked about, and you stated as well, on a year-to-date basis, our Life Sciences consumable business is up roughly 25%, give or take. And what we're seeing now is a little bit of pullback in terms of as our customers burn off some of the the inventories they built early on in the early phase of the pandemic when there's a lot of concerns about shortage of supply. And we made it a point at STERIS to serve our existing customers in-pharma and never deviate from that and sell outside of market to make sure those folks knew that we would have those validated chemistries as demand continue to rise as they got into vaccine. 
In terms of an actual percentage of how much is going to vaccine, it is impossible for me to say. And the reason why is that many of the vaccine manufacturers are also -- have been long-term large customers of STERIS that use our product [indiscernible] environment or from a bioprocess cleaning perspective in their normal day-to-day production of pharmaceuticals and biopharma. So it's not as if we're tracking down to the shop 4 level as to every application our products go into. 
What we know, though, is that we are getting some uptick from vaccine as our customers sort of refocus in that area, especially around COVID. And we believe that will be a trend that continues. In terms of the beta bag product, that's a sterile transfer product that has an integrated lift or an isolator. It's not something we do. We are in the space of sterility maintenance and sterility assurance as it relates to bioprocess, no doubt, with our sterile products solution group of products. And those have continued to do very well since the beginning of the pandemic -- they've done well since the time of acquisition, actually, but they've done very well since the pandemic really started. And those products are up in the [indiscernible] as well and has stayed fairly consistent in terms of their growth as opposed to slowing down, as we've seen in the chemistries piece. 
Specifically, on the chemistries, we have mainly 2 offerings there. One is, what we call critical environment products, and those are disinfectants some sterilants that are largely used in either aseptic manufacturing process or highly regulated cleaning rooms for pharma manufacturing. Not a lot has changed in terms of their application with COVID. There's just more application as it relates to increased vaccine production. 
And then the other large portion of our consumable business is what we would call bioprocess cleaners. And those are chemistry used for cleaning out the actual biopharma equipment used in the manufacturing process. So in between production runs, they assure they have the highest level of purity in terms of how they treat their machines [indiscernible] the stainless steel in the process."

But last year, it is still reflected in the backlog. And if you look year-over-year, there's about $12 million in last year's backlog. So if you need to adjust last year's backlog if you want a true apples-to-apples comparison, if you do that, obviously, we would be at an all-time record.

Obviously, the areas that have been very strong have tended to be toward our higher margin products. So there has been a bit of a mix effect. And as we ship more of the capital and as we do more of that, there will be some, I'll call it, mix effect. 
But as you know, we don't plan on keeping our cost at same level ever. And so we are working to reduce costs, some of which we pass on through lack of price increase to our customers, some of which we take to the bottom line. So that's one set of mixes. 
And then as we bring the other businesses on board, it depends on which parts of those businesses are coming in. There is a natural mix effect. But on the other hand, given the level of synergies that we see, we think we will be offsetting that. 
So we think that if you were to look at it in a pro forma basis, if you will, how those businesses all look today and add them together, the margins are going to go up because we're going to take more than $100 million out of the businesses that are coming on board. So we feel very good about that. 
And you know from our long association that I only care about growing profit dollars. As long as we can grow profit dollars double digits, that's what the team's mandate is. And if we happen to -- the margin happens to go up 10 basis points or down 10 basis points, I don't know there's any sleep over it. But in the end, it's pretty hard to grow revenue at high single digits and margins, and then profits at double digits unless we grow margins, and that's our mandate."

So we've taken the opportunity to capture those costs. Also, we've been able to get some government reimbursement for those folks at the same time. So we're netting that cost into the adjustments. 
In addition to that, we have had to put in some training tools. We've done some enhanced cleanings, some different protocols that we've also done in our facilities across the globe. We've made some modifications to our buildings. 
Obviously, traffic patterns have changed, signage has changed. So all of those costs surrounding that is what we're capturing. And we're identifying separately as the COVID incremental cost as we're adjusting those out. 
To date, we're about just over $20 million for the first 9 months, and that has significantly dropped from the first quarter levels. And we anticipate it will continue to drop as most, if not all of our employees are back to work.

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance.

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 0.3% as favorable pricing was somewhat offset by organic volume which was slightly lower than last year's strong pre-COVID performance. Key Surgical added $32 million to revenue in the quarter, which is somewhat lower than we originally anticipated due to continued disruption from COVID-19. 
You will notice that we have a small acquisition called out within AST. In January, we completed the acquisition of one of our suppliers. While this is a vertical integration, we do expect revenue generation of approximately $25 million annually. 
Gross margin for the quarter was flat with the prior year at 44.3% as favorable pricing and cost management were offset by mix and currency. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.3% of revenue, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. 
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25% and 20.7% for the full fiscal year, higher than last year and higher than our expectations due to income mix from higher tax rate countries and discrete item adjustments, including stock compensation. As we noted in the release this morning, we have discontinued the use of LIFO. We believe that the FIFO method of accounting is preferable because it more closely resembles the physical flow of our inventory, aligns how we manage the business and improves comparability to other companies. 
Net income in the quarter was flat at $140.3 million and earnings per share were $1.63. Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Our leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter is below 1.9x as we continue to pay down debt post the Key Surgical acquisition. Considering our cash position of $220 million, access to available credit lines and a low leverage ratio, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. Following the close of Cantel Medical, we expect our leverage ratio to be about 3x as we take advantage of the financing arrangements already put in place including our first ever public debt offering. 
During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $74.8 million, while depreciation and amortization was $59 million. Free cash flow for fiscal '21 was strong at $450.9 million, an increase of approximately $70 million over last year, primarily due to working capital improvements somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

So I will focus on the full year and then turn the call to Dan to discuss our outlook for fiscal '22. Looking back on FY '21, STERIS fared",921,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Mike has already discussed the quarter. So I will focus on the full year and then turn the call to Dan to discuss our outlook for fiscal '22. 
Looking back on FY '21, STERIS fared better than our most positive expectations at the beginning of this unprecedented time in our history. The commitment of our people and the resilience of our businesses allowed us to weather this storm in a positive manner. Remarkably, our revenue was up somewhat in fiscal 2021 as our existing business was stable in total while we completed acquisitions that added to our growth for the year. 
Our net income and free cash flow both improved double digits as we manage costs and working capital across the business. From a segment perspective, our Life Science business had another very strong year, growing constant currency organic revenue 11% as our biopharma customers used our consumables and ordered a record amount of capital equipment. Our AST segment also had a very good year, ending up 7% on a constant currency organic revenue basis despite a slow start due to the global decline in health care procedure volumes. While global procedures are not yet back to pre-COVID levels, AST was able to grow as the year progressed because our previous capacity expansions allowed us to process single-use products related to COVID treatment, testing and vaccine production. As procedure volumes began to recover in the second half and core medical device customers increased manufacturing, AST has returned to more historic growth rates. 
Our Healthcare business was clearly the most impacted by the pandemic and the related decline in procedure volumes, with constant currency organic revenue down 4% for the year. By the end of the fiscal year, our consumables were trending up nicely, in line with procedures, and capital equipment orders were very strong, leading to a record year-end backlog of over $200 million. Our R&D teams have done a great job updating our offerings across our Healthcare business the past year or so. With the addition of Key Surgical and Cantel products and services, along with STERIS' portfolio, we will be better positioned than ever to meet the needs of our customers going forward. 
The strength of our balance sheet allowed us to operate almost normally last year, increasing our dividend; investing in R&D and capital spending opportunities in all our current businesses; not laying off any of our people for COVID-related volume reductions; completing the acquisition of key Surgical in November; and executing the merger agreement with Cantel Medical. We believe these long-term oriented actions will propel future revenue and profitability growth across our business. 
In support of the Cantel transaction, our people achieved another significant milestone when we completed our first public debt offering. This was after securing investment-grade ratings on our maiden voyage with all 3 rating agencies. Once the Cantel deal closes and that debt is on our books, we are committed to reducing our leverage to continue to justify those strong ratings. We expect the strength of our balance sheet to remain a hallmark of our company going forward. 
All in all, considering the additional issues required by the pandemic, a tremendous set of achievements for STERIS this past year. As you might expect, this is my final STERIS earnings call. As I shift to my new role as an adviser to management and the Board, I am very pleased to hand the reins to Dan Carestio, who will succeed me as President and CEO. 
Dan is a veteran senior executive of our company, having spent more than 2 decades with STERIS with increasing responsible leadership roles. He knows the business. He is fortunate to be supported by an outstanding senior management team, most of whom have also been with our company for a decade or more of success. I am confident that our company is in very good hands with Dan and the STERIS leadership team. 
I want to take a moment also to recognize our analysts. Several of you have been with us for many years. Chris for 12, Larry for 9, Dave and Matt, 7 years each. Mike and Mike have picked up coverage fairly recently, and we certainly value their addition. We appreciate all of your efforts on behalf of your clients and our long-term shareholders. And it has been my absolute pleasure to work with each of you this past decade or so. 
In closing, I would like to thank the people of STERIS for making our company what it is today, and better yet, what it will be tomorrow. The 13,000 people working every day in pursuit of our mission, soon to be over 16,000, are what make the company tick. I also greatly appreciate our Board members for the last 14 years. I've been blessed to work with, and for, a talented and diverse board and 2 wonderful Chairman in Jack and now Mohsen Sohi. This Board's guidance will continue to help Dan and the team move ever forward. 
And I'm tremendously grateful to all of our long-term shareholders who have believed in the value our company provides to our customers, our people and our shareholders. It's been my honor and pleasure to serve as CEO of this great company for nearly 14 years, and I look forward to its continued successes. I am absolutely confident that the best is yet to come, as you will hear next from Dan while reviewing our outlook. Mr. Carestio?"
34783,712888657,2292445,"STERIS plc, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, May 19, 2021",2021-05-19,"Earnings Calls","STERIS plc","Executives","Thanks, Walt. I want to echo Walt and Mike's welcome to all of you. We really appreciate you taking the time to join us today. As Walt discussed, STERIS had a great year in fiscal 2021, all things considered. And we remain very excited about what is yet",817,"Thanks, Walt. I want to echo Walt and Mike's welcome to all of you. We really appreciate you taking the time to join us today. 
As Walt discussed, STERIS had a great year in fiscal 2021, all things considered. And we remain very excited about what is yet to come. Not only do we expect a nice rebound in our base business in fiscal 2022, but we look forward to bringing together 3 great companies: STERIS, Key Surgical and soon, Cantel. That does, however, make modeling of STERIS a bit more difficult for all of you, so I will focus my comments today on our overall outlook and then walk you through our expectations for the new fiscal year. 
Including acquisitions, we expect total revenue of approximately $4.5 billion. That assumes 10 months of inorganic revenue from Cantel, the remaining 7 months of Key Surgical before it anniversaries, along with smaller AST supplier as inorganic contributors. It also assumes about $15 million favorability from foreign currency. Underlying that growth will be constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% for legacy STERIS. That growth rate will be driven by a significant rebound in our Healthcare segment, the ongoing success of AST and lower-than-normal growth versus comparisons to fiscal 2021's very strong performance for the Life Sciences segment. 
Before moving on to profitability, I wanted to take a moment to discuss the upcoming changes to our segments following the completion of the Cantel acquisition. Today, Cantel has 4 major businesses: medical, dental, life sciences and dialysis. Medical and dialysis will become part of STERIS' Healthcare segment. As we have said previously, we anticipate that dental will be its own segment. To more closely align with STERIS' customers, we will split Cantel's life sciences business with the renal business, about 85% of their revenue going to our Healthcare segment and the balance going to our Life Science segment. 
From a total revenue split perspective, the net impact of all these moves will leave us with the following segment breakdown: Healthcare, 63% of revenue; AST, 17% of revenue; Life Sciences, 11% of revenue; and Dental, 9% of revenue. Operating margins are expected to improve but they will be tempered a bit as we expect operating expenses, such as travel and sales and marketing to come back closer to normal, in particular, in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that the cost synergies of $110 million are achievable for Cantel, with about 50% of that total recognized in the first 24 months. Our fiscal 2022 outlook includes approximately $25 million of these cost synergies. 
Adjusted earnings per diluted share are anticipated to be in the range of $7.40 and to $7.65, which assumes an adjusted effective tax rate of 21% to 22% and a share count of approximately 99 million diluted shares. This share count assumes that Cantel's convertible notes are converted and settled in cash. We would expect stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year with earnings in line with our traditional 45-55 split. 
From a balance sheet perspective, as Mike discussed, our leverage will initially be a bit higher than normal for STERIS following the close of Cantel. We have committed to debt repayment as a priority over the next couple of years and would expect to be back closer to our normal sweet spot in the mid-2s within that time frame. 
As STERIS continues to invest in AST facility expansions and outsourced reprocessing centers, and assuming about $50 million of CapEx for Cantel, our total capital spending is anticipated to be approximately $320 million in fiscal 2022. Free cash flow will be impacted by the integration and deal-related costs of approximately $200 million and in total, is anticipated to be approximately $380 million. You will recall that we do not adjust free cash flow for deal integration costs. 
Other than focusing on repaying debt, our capital spending priorities will be the same: dividends, investing in our current businesses, tuck-in M&A and share buybacks. We are confident we have the cash generation capacity to invest appropriately in our growth priorities and reduce our debt in the coming years. 
I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to thank Walt today. Walt has been a mentor to me and the rest of the STERIS' leadership team for many years, and I would not be prepared to step into the CEO role without his support and counsel over these past years. Thank you, Walt, for everything you've done to get STERIS where we are today, a great company, consistently improving to meet the needs that are evolving for our customers, staffed by associates who have safe and rewarding work and generating above market returns for our investors as they have come to expect. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Julie to open up for Q&A. Julie?"

I want to first start on the cash flow guide for the full year. It's impressive. When we look at the $380 million obviously, inclusive of $200 million in charges if we make that adjustment, you're looking at roughly 13% of the reported revenue guide. But when I think about that, help me kind of unpack what the underlying assumptions are when we think about the margin structure because in this most recent quarter, on the core STERIS side, obviously, you had a record operating margin contribution from AST. Life Science tapered a little bit with the consumables coming down. Just want to try and make sure I'm understanding kind of what the underlying assumptions are there on getting to that $380 million for the full year? Then I have a quick follow-up."

Obviously, the deal-related and the integration costs, the $200 million, we're anticipating off of free cash flow. We are once again increasing our CapEx pretty substantially, both not only on the STERIS side, in particular, for AST facility expansions. But also continued operating ORC expansions, reprocessing expansions within, particularly North America. And then we do have about $50 million of CapEx identified specifically for Cantel Medical. 
But one of the things that we continue to see, and Dan talked about it a little bit is on an income standpoint, we are anticipating that both travel, sales and marketing will be up significantly year-over-year. In addition, R&D -- continued R&D spend will also increase. So that's definitely going to have an impact not only on the net income side, but also on the free cash flow standpoint. And then the other thing, we've done a really nice job on this year is improving and driving improvements in working capital. And we continue to think that we can do that. And then obviously, I think there's some opportunity longer-term with Cantel on a stand-alone basis to drive that, but that's going to take us a little bit of time as we integrate the companies to get those benefits, Chris."

And I appreciate all the color there. And then just lastly for me. When I think about just maybe bigger picture looking at the integration going forward, obviously, rolling in Key Surgical and about to close here on the Cantel acquisition. When we look at the guide, there seems to be some changes versus the last kind of major acquisition the company did. I'm thinking back to synergy. When we think about the related contribution from growth and similarly from margin. Help me just think a little bit, though, about kind of how you're approaching this, kind of where you see the kind of key milestones. And also, I think it's getting -- maybe getting lost a little bit this morning, but you did step up the core STERIS organic guide versus kind of what we've historically seen here. Help us kind of think about again, what you see there implicit in the guide? And what's a little bit different this time when you're doing integration versus synergy? Or as the different businesses, but just trying to think a little bit about where the challenges lie and where you have that confidence? And again, Walt, all the best."

Chris, what I would say is it's a very different deal than what and synergy was more of a complementary revenue play opportunity with a little bit of cost out because they were largely present in Europe where we had less presence. And there wasn't much overlap between the 2. In the case of Cantel, there is significant cost out opportunity. That's why we've identified the $110 million target that we're going after. And a lot of that is in some of the leadership compensation and sort of where we have redundancy amongst executives and folks within the organization. 
So we're actively working on day 1 now, if you will, all the messaging, all the mapping of who's reporting to who and getting the structures aligned and working with the Cantel teams to get there. We've but -- so that's the difference between the 2 deals in terms of where we are. And we do believe there's probably going to be some revenue synergies out of the complementary portfolio offering, but clearly, we're focused on the cost out piece early on. 
In terms of the other question, I think, around the margins, we do believe as procedures come back to normal, that will drive continue to drive growth in our AST business and in our reoccurring revenue consumables businesses, especially in the Healthcare segment, which tend to be higher-margin consumable-type annuity businesses. And we do think that as we get back to pre-COVID levels in the back half of our fiscal year, we'll see a significant benefit from that in our overall margin structure."

First of all, we're fortunate in that -- I mean, I used the word fortunate in kind of an odd way, COVID caused both of us to put higher increases across much of the company. And so a big piece of those cost synergies are going to be handled by not hiring people that one or both of us would have hired because we have people from the 2 companies. So a piece of this will go easier than normal. We haven't built that into our model in terms of the cost of synergies. We've included our -- what I'll call a normal cost of synergies. We could get a break on that, depending on how that works out. Unfortunately, people have to be in the right place at the right time in their career and all those things. But I think that's a real opportunity for us. And we're quite good about using people and not laying people off just to hire somebody else. And so I think that's a real positive. And then the second component is if you look at our history, we eventually get our revenue synergies. We always get our cost synergies. And so if I were a betting person, on Mr. Carestio and Mr. Tokich being able to get $110 million, I'd take the bet all day long for as big a bet you want to make."

It's once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our fourth quarter performance.  
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 0.3% as favorable pricing was somewhat offset by organic volume which was slightly lower than last year's strong pre-COVID performance. Key Surgical added $32 million to revenue in the quarter, which is somewhat lower than we originally anticipated due to continued disruption of COVID-19.  
You will notice that we have a small acquisition called out within AST. In January, we completed the acquisition of one of our suppliers. While this is a vertical integration, we do expect revenue generation of approximately $25 million annually.  
Gross margin for the quarter was flat with the prior year at 44.3% as favorable pricing and cost management were offset by mix and currency. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.3% of revenue, an increase of 60 basis points from last year.  
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25% and 20.7% for the full fiscal year, higher than last year and higher than our expectations due to income mix from higher tax rate countries and discrete item adjustments, including stock compensation. As we noted in the release this morning, we have discontinued the use of LIFO. We believe that the FIFO method of accounting is preferable because it more closely resembles the physical flow of our inventory, aligns how we manage the business and improves comparability to other companies.  
Net income in the quarter was flat at $140.3 million and earnings per share were $1.63. Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Our leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter is below 1.9x as we continue to pay down debt post the Key Surgical acquisition. Considering our cash position of $220 million, access to available credit lines and a low leverage ratio, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. Following the close of Cantel Medical, we expect our leverage ratio to be about 3x as we take advantage of the financing arrangements already put in place including our first ever public debt offering.  
During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures totaled $74.8 million, while depreciation and amortization was $59 million. Free cash flow for fiscal '21 was strong at $450.9 million, an increase of approximately $70 million over last year, primarily due to working capital improvements somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt for his remarks."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Mike has already discussed the quarter. So I will focus on the full year and then turn the call to Dan to discuss our outlook for fiscal '22.  
Looking back on FY '21, STERIS fared better than our most positive expectations at the beginning of this unprecedented time in our history. The commitment of our people and the resilience of our businesses allowed us to weather this storm in a positive manner. Remarkably, our revenue was up somewhat in fiscal 2021 as our existing business was stable in total while we completed acquisitions that added to our growth for the year.  
Our net income and free cash flow both improved double digits as we manage cost and working capital across the business. 
From a segment perspective, our Life Science business had another very strong year, growing constant currency organic revenue 11% as our biopharma customers used our consumables and ordered a record amount of capital equipment. Our AST segment also had a very good year, ending up 7% on a constant currency organic revenue basis despite a slow start due to the global decline in health care procedure volumes. While global procedures are not yet back to pre-COVID levels, AST was able to grow as the year progressed because our previous capacity expansions allowed us to process single-use products related to COVID treatment, testing and vaccine production. As procedure volumes began to recover in the second half and core medical device customers increased manufacturing, AST has returned to more historic growth rates.  
Our Healthcare business was clearly the most impacted by the pandemic and the related decline in procedure volumes, with constant currency organic revenue down 4% for the year. By the end of the fiscal year, our consumables were trending up nicely, in line with procedures, and capital equipment orders were very strong, leading to a record year-end backlog of over $200 million. Our R&D teams have done a great job updating our offerings across our Healthcare business the past year or so. With the addition of Key Surgical and Cantel products and services, along with STERIS' portfolio, we will be better positioned than ever to meet the needs of our customers going forward.  
The strength of our balance sheet allowed us to operate almost normally last year, increasing our dividend; investing in R&D and capital spending opportunities in all our current businesses; not laying off any of our people for COVID-related volume reductions; completing the acquisition of key Surgical in November; and executing the merger agreement with Cantel Medical. We believe these long-term-oriented actions will propel future revenue and profitability growth across our business.  
In support of the Cantel transaction, our people achieved another significant milestone when we completed our first public debt offering. This was after securing investment-grade ratings on our maiden voyage with all 3 rating agencies. Once the Cantel deal closes and that debt is on our books, we are committed to reducing our leverage to continue to justify those strong ratings. We expect the strength of our balance sheet to remain a hallmark of our company going forward.  
All in all, considering the additional issues required by the pandemic, a tremendous set of achievements for STERIS this past year. 
As you might expect, this is my final STERIS earnings call. As I shift to my new role as an adviser to management and the Board, I am very pleased to hand the reins to Dan Carestio, who will succeed me as President and CEO.  Dan is a veteran senior executive of our company, having spent more than 2 decades with STERIS with increasing responsible leadership roles. He knows the business. He is fortunate to be supported by an outstanding senior management team, most of whom have also been with our company for a decade or more of success. I am confident that our company is in very good hands with Dan and the STERIS leadership team.  
I want to take a moment also to recognize our analysts. Several of you have been with us for many years. Chris for 12, Larry for 9, Dave and Matt, 7 years each. Mike and Mike have picked up coverage fairly recently, and we certainly value their addition. We appreciate all of your efforts on behalf of your clients and our long-term shareholders. And it has been my absolute pleasure to work with each of you this past decade or so.  
In closing, I would like to thank the people of STERIS for making our company what it is today; and better yet, what it will be tomorrow. The 13,000 people working every day in pursuit of our mission, soon to be over 16,000, are what make the company tick. 
I also greatly appreciate our Board members for the last 14 years. I've been blessed to work with and for a talented and diverse Board, and 2 wonderful Chairman in Jack Wareham and now Mohsen Sohi. This Board's guidance will continue to help Dan and the team move ever forward.  
And I'm tremendously grateful to all of our long-term shareholders who have believed in the value our company provides to our customers, our people and our shareholders. It's been my honor and pleasure to serve as CEO of this great company for nearly 14 years, and I look forward to its continued successes. I am absolutely confident that the best is yet to come, as you will hear next from Dan while reviewing our outlook. Mr. Carestio?"

We really appreciate you taking the time to join us today. As Walt discussed, STERIS had a great year in fiscal 2021, all things considered. And we remain very excited about what is yet",817,"Thanks, Walt. I want to echo Walt and Mike's welcome to all of you. We really appreciate you taking the time to join us today. 
As Walt discussed, STERIS had a great year in fiscal 2021, all things considered. And we remain very excited about what is yet to come. Not only do we expect a nice rebound in our base business in fiscal 2022, but we look forward to bringing together 3 great companies: STERIS, Key Surgical, and soon, Cantel. That does, however, make modeling of STERIS a bit more difficult for all of you, so I will focus my comments today on our overall outlook and then walk you through our expectations for the new fiscal year. 
Including acquisitions, we expect total revenue of approximately $4.5 billion. That assumes 10 months of inorganic revenue from Cantel, the remaining 7 months of Key Surgical before it anniversaries, along with smaller AST supplier as inorganic contributors. It also assumes about $15 million favorability from foreign currency. Underlying that growth will be constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% for legacy STERIS. That growth rate will be driven by a significant rebound in our Healthcare segment, the ongoing success of AST, and lower-than-normal growth versus comparisons to fiscal 2021's very strong performance for the Life Sciences segment. 
Before moving on to profitability, I wanted to take a moment to discuss the upcoming changes to our segments following the completion of the Cantel acquisition. Today, Cantel has 4 major businesses: medical, dental, life sciences and dialysis. Medical and dialysis will become part of STERIS' Healthcare segment. As we have said previously, we anticipate that dental will be its own segment. To more closely align with STERIS' customers, we will split Cantel's life sciences business with the renal business, about 85% of their revenue going to our Healthcare segment, and the balance going to our Life Science segment. 
From a total revenue split perspective, the net impact of all these moves will leave us with the following segment breakdown: Healthcare, 63% of revenue; AST, 17% of revenue; Life Sciences, 11% of revenue; and Dental, 9% of revenue. Operating margins are expected to improve but they will be tempered a bit as we expect operating expenses, such as travel and sales and marketing to come back closer to normal, in particular, in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that the cost synergies of $110 million are achievable for Cantel, with about 50% of that total recognized in the first 24 months. Our fiscal 2022 outlook includes approximately $25 million of these cost synergies. 
Adjusted earnings per diluted share are anticipated to be in the range of $7.40 and to $7.65, which assumes an adjusted effective tax rate of 21% to 22% and a share count of approximately 99 million diluted shares. This share count assumes that Cantel's convertible notes are converted and settled in cash. We would expect stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year with earnings in line with our traditional 45-55 split. 
From a balance sheet perspective, as Mike discussed, our leverage will initially be a bit higher than normal for STERIS following the close of Cantel. We have committed to debt repayment as a priority over the next couple of years and would expect to be back closer to our normal sweet spot in the mid-2s within that time frame. 
As STERIS continues to invest in AST facility expansions and outsourced reprocessing centers, and assuming about $50 million of CapEx for Cantel, our total capital spending is anticipated to be approximately $320 million in fiscal 2022. Free cash flow will be impacted by the integration and deal-related costs of approximately $200 million, and in total, is anticipated to be approximately $380 million. You will recall that we do not adjust free cash flow for deal integration costs. 
Other than focusing on repaying debt, our capital spending priorities will be the same: dividends, investing in our current businesses, tuck-in M&A and share buybacks. We are confident we have the cash generation capacity to invest appropriately in our growth priorities and reduce our debt in the coming years. 
I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to thank Walt today. Walt has been a mentor to me and the rest of the STERIS' leadership team for many years, and I would not be prepared to step into the CEO role without his support and counsel over these past years. Thank you, Walt, for everything you've done to get STERIS where we are today, a great company, consistently improving to meet the needs that are evolving for our customers, staffed by associates who have safe and rewarding work and generating above market returns for our investors as they have come to expect. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Julie to open up for Q&A. Julie?"

So more to come on that. And then Matt, I don't think we're going to get into that level of detail on the quarterly breakouts. We're about 99 million shares for the year.

And also, I think it's getting -- maybe getting lost a little bit this morning, but you did step up the core STERIS organic guide versus kind of what we've historically seen here. Help us kind of think about again, what you see there implicit in the guide? And what's a little bit different this time when you're doing integration versus synergy? I know it's different businesses, but just trying to think a little bit about where the challenges lie and where you have added confidence? And again, Walt, all the best."

Chris, what I would say is it's a very different [indiscernible] synergy was more of a complementary revenue play opportunity with a little bit of cost out because they were largely present in Europe where we had less presence, and there wasn't much overlap between the 2. In the case of Cantel, there is significant cost out opportunity. That's why we've identified the $110 million target that we're going after. And a lot of that is in some of the leadership compensation and sort of where we have redundancy amongst executives and folks within the organization. 
So we're actively working on day 1 now, if you will. All the messaging, all the mapping of who's reporting to who and getting the structures aligned and working with the Cantel teams to get there. We've -- but -- so that's the difference between the 2 deals in terms of where we are. And we do believe there's probably going to be some revenue synergies out of the complementary portfolio offering, but clearly, we're focused on the cost out piece early on. 
In terms of the other question, I think, around the margins, we do believe as procedures come back to normal, that will drive -- continue to drive growth in our AST business and in our reoccurring revenue consumables businesses, especially in the Healthcare segment, which tend to be higher-margin consumable-type annuity businesses. And we do think that as we get back to pre-COVID levels in the back half of our fiscal year, we'll see a significant benefit from that in our overall margin structure."

First of all, we're fortunate in that -- I mean, I use the word fortunate in kind of an odd way. COVID caused both of us to put higher increases across much of the company. And so a big piece of those cost synergies are going to be handled by not hiring people that one or both of us would have hired because we have people from the 2 companies. So a piece of this will go easier than normal. We haven't built that into our model in terms of the cost of synergies. We've included our -- what I'll call a normal cost of synergies. We could get a break on that, depending on how that works out. Unfortunately, people have to be in the right place at the right time in their career and all those things. But I think that's a real opportunity for us. And we're quite good about using people and not laying people off just to hire somebody else. And so I think that's a real positive. And then the second component is if you look at our history, we eventually get our revenue synergies. We always get our cost synergies. And so if I were a betting person,  Mr. Carestio and Mr. Tokich being able to get $110 million, I'd take the bet all day long for as big a bet you want to make."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 21%. Growth was driven by orga",477,"Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 21%. Growth was driven by organic volume as well as 130 basis points of price. Acquisitions in total added $141 million to revenue in the quarter, which is broken down by segment in the press release tables. To assist you with your modeling, I will share some color on the acquisition revenue contribution within the Healthcare segment. 
Of the approximately $96 million in acquired revenue, about 70% is consumable revenue from both Key Surgical and Cantel Medical. About 20% of the balance is capital equipment revenue with the last 10% being service revenue. We will not be breaking that down any further as it is already difficult to differentiate some product lines as we are integrating the businesses quickly, and that challenge will only escalate as with each passing quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points compared with the prior year to 46.6% as favorable productivity, pricing and acquisitions were somewhat offset by negative foreign currency inflation and mix. Looking at the rest of the year, we do expect additional headwinds from inflation on raw materials. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.9% of revenue, an increase of 130 basis points from the first quarter last year. 
As anticipated, we are starting to see some operating expenses such as travel and sales and marketing costs return, which limited EBIT margin growth. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.8%, higher than last year but in line with our expectations for the fiscal year. Net income in the quarter increased to $159.9 million and earnings were $1.76 per diluted share. 
Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Our leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter is lower than our expectations and is below 2.9x. We have less debt and higher EBITDA than we originally modeled. Cash at the end of the quarter totaled $535 million. 
Regarding the Cantel convertible notes, 100% of the holders have elected to convert their notes. All conversions will be fully settled in cash during the second quarter of fiscal '22. As of June 30, the estimated total cash settlement value was approximately $366.5 million. During the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $56.4 million, while depreciation and amortization was $83.6 million. Capital spending in the first quarter was somewhat lower than planned due to weather-related delays for several of our AST construction projects. 
Free cash flow for the first quarter was $41.2 million, and as anticipated, this is a decline from the prior year due to costs associated with the Cantel Medical acquisition. With that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks."

We had a strong start to our fiscal year. Revenue growth in Q1 exceeded our expectations as we saw a faster recovery in customer demand than planned, in particular in our Healthcare and AST segments. Due to strong volume growth, we were able to expand margins nicely during the quarter. 
Our integration teams have been hard at work and significant progress has been made integrating Cantel Medical. We are pleased with what we are seeing, but of course, we still have significant work to do. Since the June 2nd close and acquisition, we have made a number of decisions that impact how we go to market with our customer-first mentality. For example, leveraging the talent and expertise of the Cantel sales organization, we have created a dedicated sales channel focused solely on endoscope reprocessing. 
We added a new Dental segment and mapped the Cantel businesses over to the 4 STERIS reporting segments. Executive alignment and leadership has been completely defined from both a field and back-office perspective. We have started to educate and implement STERIS lean practices within Cantel, and we have made significant progress realigning our European Healthcare business as we bring STERIS Key Surgical and Cantel together. 
From a synergy perspective, we continue to expect a $25 million benefit for this fiscal year, as the majority of the savings are driven by the elimination of corporate costs and much of that integration is complete. In terms of longer-term synergies, we are increasingly confident of exceeding our $110 million cost target as we continue to see opportunities to improve. 
Shifting to our outlook. Based on what we have seen in STERIS and across the broader industry, we believe there has been a significantly faster rebound in procedures than we anticipated. This has created stronger demand for capital, consumables and services and has led us to raise -- revise our guidance upward for the year. 
Starting with revenue. Our constant currency organic growth outlook has been increased to 10% to 11% growth for fiscal 2022. This improvement, combined with additional foreign currency benefit and higher expectations for Cantel's Medical business, has increased our expectation for total reported revenue to $4.6 billion. Our organic growth is driven by revenue recovery across business, but in particular, from our Healthcare and AST segments. 
Within the Healthcare segment, we have record capital backlog at the end of the first quarter with strength in both surgical and infection prevention. The record healthcare backlog is entirely organic as we have not yet added the Cantel Capital Equipment to our backlog. 
Consumables also had a strong start to the year as we have relatively easy comparisons and experienced some restocking by our customers. AST is also expected to remain strong as our core medical device customers are benefiting from the rebound procedures and rebuilding some inventory. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for COVID-related products and vaccines as well as bioprocess manufacturing disposables. 
Given the strength of AST, our segment allocation will shift from what we shared last quarter. AST is now expected to be approximately 18% of total company revenue, while Dental will be about 8% on of total company revenue for the full fiscal year. We are increasing our adjusted earnings per diluted share expectations to a range of $7.60 to $7.85 based on higher volume growth and improved margins. 
We are mindful that there is still considerable uncertainty around procedure volumes as we see COVID variance continuing to spread continued inflationary pressure and we also have an expectation that we will pick up some increases in OpEx in the second half of the year. 
Reflecting on the stronger projected earnings growth, free cash flow expectations have been increased by $20 million. Fiscal 2022 is shaping up to be another record year for STERIS. We look forward to continue to update all of you on our progress. I will now turn the call back over to Julie to open up for Q&A. Julie?"

Nothing material from our standpoint. Corporate costs, obviously, we have seen travel and we have seen some return of additional costs. So I would say $75 million may be a little high, but think about obviously a larger increase as we go on. And usually, the first quarter is a little bit higher for us as we are providing for bonuses for the year at the start. Obviously, there are some commissions also in there. 
But I would say, relatively, you're definitely going to see an increase in the operating expenses. If everything is assumed without, as Dan talked about, without seeing any additional variance, we have seen travel pick up for our field and for our corporate staff."

The other factor is Cantel actually was able to pay down their debt much more quickly, and it was lower than we anticipated at close.

So that also was a factor in allowing us to continue to pay down, but more importantly, borrow less debt as the transaction closed. So those are the 2 main factors."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance.  For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 21%. Growth was driven by org",476,"Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our first quarter performance.  
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 21%. Growth was driven by organic volume as well as 130 basis points of price. Acquisitions in total added $141 million to revenue in the quarter, which is broken down by segment in the press release tables. To assist you with your modeling, I will share some color on the acquisition revenue contribution within the Healthcare segment.  
Of the approximately $96 million in acquired revenue, about 70% is consumable revenue from both Key Surgical and Cantel Medical. About 20% of the balance is capital equipment revenue, with the last 10% being service revenue. We will not be breaking that down any further as it's already difficult to differentiate some product lines as we are integrating the businesses quickly, and that challenge will only escalate as with each passing quarter.  
Gross margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points compared with the prior year to 46.6% as favorable productivity, pricing and acquisitions were somewhat offset by negative foreign currency, inflation and mix. Looking at the rest of the year, we do expect additional headwinds from inflation on raw materials. EBIT margin for the quarter was 22.9% of revenue, an increase of 130 basis points from the first quarter last year.  
As anticipated, we are starting to see some operating expenses such as travel and sales and marketing costs return, which limited EBIT margin growth. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.8%, higher than last year but in line with our expectations for the fiscal year. Net income in the quarter increased to $159.9 million and earnings were $1.76 per diluted share.  
Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Our leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter is lower than our expectations and is below 2.9x. We have less debt and higher EBITDA than we originally modeled. Cash at the end of the quarter totaled $535 million.  
Regarding the Cantel convertible notes, 100% of the holders have elected to convert their notes. All conversions will be fully settled in cash during the second quarter of fiscal '22. As of June 30, the estimated total cash settlement value was approximately $366.5 million. During the first quarter, capital expenditures totaled $56.4 million, while depreciation and amortization was $83.6 million. Capital spending in the first quarter was somewhat lower than planned due to weather-related delays for several of our AST construction projects.  
Free cash flow for the first quarter was $41.2 million, and as anticipated, this is a decline from the prior year due to costs associated with the Cantel Medical acquisition. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Dan for his remarks."

We had a strong start to our fiscal year.

We had a strong start to our fiscal year. Revenue growth in Q1 exceeded our expectations as we saw a faster recovery in customer demand than planned, in particular in our Healthcare and AST segments. Due to strong volume growth, we were able to expand margins nicely during the quarter.  
Our integration teams have been hard at work, and significant progress has been made integrating Cantel Medical. We are pleased with what we are seeing, but of course, we still have significant work to do. Since the June 2nd close and acquisition, we have made a number of decisions that impact how we go to market with our customer-first mentality. For example, leveraging the talent and expertise of the Cantel sales organization, we have created a dedicated sales channel focused solely on endoscope reprocessing.  
We added a new Dental segment and mapped the Cantel businesses over to the 4 STERIS reporting segments. Executive alignment and leadership has been completely defined from both a field and back-office perspective. We have started to educate and implement STERIS lean practices within Cantel, and we have made significant progress realigning our European Healthcare business as we bring STERIS Key Surgical and Cantel together. From a synergy perspective, we continue to expect a $25 million benefit for this fiscal year, as the majority of the savings are driven by the elimination of corporate costs and much of that integration is complete.  
In terms of longer-term synergies, we are increasingly confident of exceeding our $110 million cost target as we continue to see opportunities to improve. 
Shifting to our outlook. Based on what we have seen in STERIS and across the broader industry, we believe there has been a significantly faster rebound in procedures than we anticipated. This has created stronger demand for capital, consumables and services and has led us to raise -- revise our guidance upward for the year.  
Starting with revenue. Our constant currency organic growth outlook has been increased to 10% to 11% growth for fiscal 2022. This improvement, combined with additional foreign currency benefit and higher expectations for Cantel's Medical business, has increased our expectation for total reported revenue to $4.6 billion. Our organic growth is driven by revenue recovery across business, but in particular, from our Healthcare and AST segments.  
Within the Healthcare segment, we have record capital backlog at the end of the first quarter, with strength in both surgical and infection prevention. The record healthcare backlog is entirely organic as we have not yet added the Cantel Capital Equipment to our backlog.  
Consumables also had a strong start to the year as we have relatively easy comparisons and experienced some restocking by our customers. AST is also expected to remain strong as our core medical device customers are benefiting from the rebound procedures and rebuilding some inventory. In addition, we continue to see strong demand for COVID-related products and vaccines as well as bioprocess manufacturing disposables.  
Given the strength of AST, our segment allocation will shift from what we shared last quarter. AST is now expected to be approximately 18% of total company revenue, while Dental will be about 8% of total company revenue for the full fiscal year. We are increasing our adjusted earnings per diluted share expectations to a range of $7.60 to $7.85 based on higher volume growth and improved margins.  
We are mindful that there is still considerable uncertainty around procedure volumes as we see COVID variants continuing to spread, continued inflationary pressure and we also have an expectation that we will pick up some increases in OpEx in the second half of the year.  
Reflecting on the stronger projected earnings growth, free cash flow expectations have been increased by $20 million. Fiscal 2022 is shaping up to be another record year for STERIS. We look forward to continue to update all of you on our progress. I will now turn the call back over to Julie to open up for Q&A. Julie?"

So that's where we're seeing a lot of the improvement now. In the past, Matt, we saw the benefit of PPE and some of the COVID-related products when we saw declines in normal procedural type products. Going forward, assuming that things are resuming at normal levels of procedural occurrences and we don't get slipped up significantly by another COVID variant in terms of procedural slowdown, we're highly confident that we'll continue to grow. And we believe that the COVID-related products are here to stay for the foreseeable future anyways. 
And then clearly, the work that we're doing with bioprocessing disposables is long-term sustainable growth for us. So all in all, I think we're reaping the benefits of a lot of investments we put in place over the last few years in terms of capacity expansion and able to fill those as customers' demand continues to tick up."

So I would say $75 million may be a little high, but think about, obviously, a larger increase as we go on.

The other factor is Cantel, actually, was able to pay down their debt much more quickly, and it was lower than we anticipated at close.

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 12%, with growth across all s",465,"Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 12%, with growth across all segments. Growth was driven by organic volume as well as 130 basis points of price. Acquisitions total added $346 million to revenue in the second quarter, which is broken down by segment in the press release tables. 
To assist you with your modeling, I will share some color on the acquisition revenue contribution within the Healthcare segment. Of the approximately $220 million in acquired revenue, about 65% is consumable revenue from both Key and Cantel Medical, about 20% of the balance is capital equipment revenue, with the last 15% being service revenue. We will not be breaking that down any further as it is already difficult to differentiate some product lines as we are integrating the businesses quickly, and that challenge will only increase with each passing quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points compared to the prior year to 46.2%, as favorable productivity, pricing and acquisitions were somewhat offset by higher material and labor costs. Combined, material and labor costs were about $10 million in the quarter, significantly higher than we were expecting. As we look at the second half of the fiscal year, we anticipate that higher material labor costs will continue to impact gross margin by approximately $20 million or more. EBIT margin for the quarter was 23.3% of revenue, an increase of 80 basis points from the second quarter of last year. As anticipated, we are starting to see some operating expenses, such as travel and sales and marketing costs, return somewhat limiting EBIT margin growth. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22%, higher than last year, but in line with our expectations for the full fiscal year. Net income in the quarter increased to $200.3 million and earnings per share were $1.99. 
Our balance sheet continues to be a source of strength for the company. Our leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter is now below 2.8x. As a reminder, we cash settled all of Cantel's convertible notes during the second quarter. The total cash settlement value was approximately $371.4 million. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $383.5 million. 
During the first half, capital expenditures totaled $133.4 million, while depreciation and amortization was $201.7 million, reflecting recent acquisitions. 
Free cash flow for the first half was $135.8 million. As anticipated, this is a decline from last year due to costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Cantel Medical and slightly higher capital spending year-over-year. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Dan for his remarks."

Our fiscal 2022 is shaping up to be another record year for STERIS. Our first half turned out to be stronger than we anticipated, with constant currency organic growth across the business. 
In particular, growth in our AST segment remained strong, with 23% constant currency organic growth year-to-date despite some tough comparisons in the second quarter of last year. Healthcare has also rebounded nicely, with 17% constant currency organic growth in the first half and record backlog of $311 million at the end of the quarter for the legacy STERIS products. Life Sciences consumables have stabilized, contributing 3% constant currency organic growth in the first half. And our capital equipment business backlog has grown to a record $98 million. Lastly, our newest segment, Dental, reported 10% growth for the quarter, in line with our expectations. 
Underlying our performance, procedure volumes in the U.S. have held steady as hospitals have learned how to manage through the pandemic. While we continue to see pockets of the world that are more limited in procedure volume due to COVID outbreaks, overall, we believe procedure volume is moving closer to pre-pandemic levels. We are cautiously optimistic about the coming months as COVID cases appear to have peaked and are now once again receding. Despite the more difficult comparisons, we expect revenue to stay strong in our second half as we continue to benefit from these trends. 
We also continued to make progress on the integration of Cantel in the quarter. The majority of our staffing changes have been made, aligning STERIS to better serve customers, positioning us for growth going forward and contributing to cost synergies. We are also making swift progress implementing Lean, and we are very pleased with how receptive our new colleagues are to our passion for continuous improvement. All said, we would expect to exceed our synergy cost targets for the year and also in total. 
Looking at the full year, while we are increasingly confident in our ability to achieve our improved outlook provided last quarter, we are not increasing guidance further at this time. While we overachieved earnings in the second quarter, we have a few offsets that will likely impact the back half of the year. 
On the revenue side, our comparisons do get a bit more challenging. And we do expect some headwinds from FX, in particular, from the euro and the pound. In addition, while our teams have done outstanding work to mitigate the supply chain challenges so far this year, it is difficult to predict the unknown implications the current environment may have on the second half of the fiscal year. 
All said, we are pleased with where we stand today and the underlying strength of our diversified business, and remain optimistic that if it were not for supply chain and inflation uncertainties, we would be at the high end or above our adjusted EPS guidance range for the full year. 
We look forward to continuing to update all of you on our progress.

And kind of -- and I'm -- and I guess what I'm asking is, as you go out to your third and your fourth quarter, where are you potentially looking at having supply chain constraints? Does it impacts you potentially with your backlog and capital equipment and being able to deliver in 3Q and 4Q?"

So what I would say is, to date, other than the cost escalation of many of our precursor materials, we've been able to navigate the supply side of it and make sure that we have been able to keep up and meet customer demand. And we had a little bit of excess sort of precursor inventories coming into the year as well as some safety. 
In the current environment, with the uncertainty around delivery time of these materials, it may -- it could potentially result in sort of extended lead times for deliveries. We don't see a scenario where stock out would happen or anything like that. But the ability to deliver on what now is over $400 million in backlog in the next 6 months just from a -- if we miss production slots, it's going to be hard to get them back if we miss them because of supply shortages. So I believe our teams will continue to do the outstanding work that we've been doing thus far, but there are challenges."

The other thing I would say is that we have a number of facilities that are operating at extremely high utilization levels right now. And the nature of the business is such that there's a very high fixed cost on each one of these individual plants. And the difference of running at 80% utilization versus 97% or something like that has got major implications on the drop-through profitability of the operations. 
So as we've talked about a number of times, we're in the process of building out a number of expansions in that business. And then as those come online, we're not going to see any significant drop in profitability percentages. But we do believe going forward, it will stabilize in the ranges of where it is today."

Same in Life Sciences, we anticipated higher operating expenses throughout the year. And obviously, the COVID impact has slowed some of that, the travel and marketing and sales expenses, although we are starting to see those come back, but that is one factor that is definitely adding to the increased operating profit. 
And the other one, you alluded to already, Chris, is mixed. We continue to see very good growth out of the consumables business. And with the addition of Cantel, the consumables business, although it was only up 1% organically, it is up almost 11% if you include the Cantel acquisition. So we are seeing, as I think you understand, consumables are higher margins -- tend to be higher margins for us. So that is also helping drive the improved profitability margin."

What I would say on the Healthcare backlog, it's really strong across all product segments at this point, whether that's surgical or IPT. And then in terms of project versus sort of short-term work, a year ago, we were almost exclusively long-term projects and builds and things like that. And we've seen a significant recovery in the replacement business in the last 6, 7 months, I would say, to where it's kind of back to pre-COVID levels in terms of replacement type spending. So we've got a -- our backlog still not maybe what it would have looked like proportionately 2 years ago before the pandemic. But the last sort of 6 months or so of order intake definitely is. 
In terms of the Life Science capital, there's a lot of money being spent expanding production in terms of biologics, vaccines and gene therapies, all these different type of applications that require aseptic manufacturing environments. And as we've discussed before, that's really STERIS' sweet spot. We tend to benefit on the consumables side of that. We tend to benefit in AST, on the disposable side going into those manufacturing environments. And then we also tend to benefit on the capital equipment side for GMP type equipment for sterilization into those type environments as well. 
The other thing I would mention is, we have seen since the beginning of our fiscal year recovery in sort of research type spending, which was really slow during the pandemic. Much of that is state or federal funded public institutional spending, and that dried up pretty bad last year.

But hopefully, we'll see something sooner than later out of the agency that gets us to a final path. And in the interim, we've made some significant investments ahead of any regulation in anticipation of any change, where our facilities are -- now are down to just tying off a few minor things in terms of what we think are enhanced improvements ahead of any regulatory NESHAP rule that might change the requirements to operate."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our second quarter performance. 
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 12%, with growth across all segments. Growth was driven by organic volume as well as 130 basis points of price. Acquisitions total added $346 million to revenue in the second quarter, which is broken down by segment in the press release tables. 
To assist you with your modeling, I will share some color on the acquisition revenue contribution within the Healthcare segment. Of the approximately $220 million in acquired revenue, about 65% is consumable revenue from both Key and Cantel Medical, about 20% of the balance is capital equipment revenue, with the last 15% being service revenue. We will not be breaking that down any further as it is already difficult to differentiate some product lines as we are integrating the businesses quickly, and that challenge will only increase with each passing quarter. 
Gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points compared to the prior year to 46.2%, as favorable productivity, pricing and acquisitions were somewhat offset by higher material and labor costs. Combined, material and labor costs were about $10 million in the quarter, significantly higher than we were expecting. As we look at the second half of the fiscal year, we anticipate that higher material labor costs will continue to impact gross margin by approximately $20 million or more. EBIT margin for the quarter was 23.3% of revenue, an increase of 80 basis points from the second quarter of last year. As anticipated, we are starting to see some operating expenses, such as travel and sales and marketing costs, return somewhat limiting EBIT margin growth. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22%, higher than last year, but in line with our expectations for the full fiscal year. Net income in the quarter increased to $200.3 million and earnings per share were $1.99. 
Our balance sheet continues to be a source of strength for the company. Our leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter is now below 2.8x. As a reminder, we cash settled all of Cantel's convertible notes during the second quarter. The total cash settlement value was approximately $371.4 million. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $383.5 million. 
During the first half, capital expenditures totaled $133.4 million, while depreciation and amortization was $201.7 million, reflecting recent acquisitions. 
Free cash flow for the first half was $135.8 million. As anticipated, this is a decline from last year due to costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Cantel Medical and slightly higher capital spending year-over-year. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Dan for his remarks."

Our fiscal 2022 is shaping up to be another record year for STERIS. Our first half turned out to be stronger than we anticipated, with constant currency organic growth across the business. 
In particular, growth in our AST segment remained strong, with 23% constant currency organic growth year-to-date despite some tough comparisons in the second quarter of last year. Healthcare has also rebounded nicely, with 17% constant currency organic growth in the first half and record backlog of $311 million at the end of the quarter for the legacy STERIS products. Life Sciences consumables have stabilized, contributing 3% constant currency organic growth in the first half. And our capital equipment business backlog has grown to a record $98 million. Lastly, our newest segment, Dental, reported 10% growth for the quarter, in line with our expectations. 
Underlying our performance, procedure volumes in the U.S. have held steady as hospitals have learned how to manage through the pandemic. While we continue to see pockets of the world that are more limited in procedure volume due to COVID outbreaks, overall, we believe procedure volume is moving closer to pre-pandemic levels. We are cautiously optimistic about the coming months as COVID cases appear to have peaked and are now once again receding. Despite the more difficult comparisons, we expect revenue to stay strong in our second half as we continue to benefit from these trends. 
We also continued to make progress on the integration of Cantel in the quarter. The majority of our staffing changes have been made, aligning STERIS to better serve customers, positioning us for growth going forward and contributing to cost synergies. We are also making swift progress implementing Lean, and we are very pleased with how receptive our new colleagues are to our passion for continuous improvement. All said, we would expect to exceed our synergy cost targets for the year and also in total. 
Looking at the full year, while we are increasingly confident in our ability to achieve our improved outlook provided last quarter, we are not increasing guidance further at this time. While we overachieved earnings in the second quarter, we have a few offsets that will likely impact the back half of the year. 
On the revenue side, our comparisons do get a bit more challenging. And we do expect some headwinds from FX, in particular, from the euro and the pound. In addition, while our teams have done outstanding work to mitigate the supply chain challenges so far this year, it is difficult to predict the unknown implications the current environment may have on the second half of the fiscal year. 
All said, we are pleased with where we stand today and the underlying strength of our diversified business, and remain optimistic that if it were not for supply chain and inflation uncertainties, we would be at the high end or above our adjusted EPS guidance range for the full year. 
We look forward to continuing to update all of you on our progress. 
Thank you. And I will now turn the call back over to Julie to open up for Q&A. Julie?"

But the ability to deliver on what now is over $400 million in backlog in the next 6 months just from a -- if we miss production slots, it's going to be hard to get them back if we miss them because of supply shortages.

The other thing I would say is that we have a number of facilities that are operating at extremely high utilization levels right now. And the nature of the business is such that there's a very high fixed cost on each one of these individual plants. And the difference of running at 80% utilization versus 97% or something like that has got major implications on the drop-through profitability of the operations. 
So as we've talked about a number of times, we're in the process of building out a number of expansions in that business. And then as those come online, we're not going to see any significant drop in profitability percentages. But we do believe going forward, it will stabilize in the ranges of where it is today."

Same in Life Sciences, we anticipated higher operating expenses throughout the year. And obviously, the COVID impact has slowed some of that, the travel and marketing and sales expenses, although we are starting to see those come back, but that is one factor that is definitely adding to the increased operating profit. 
And the other one, you alluded to already, Chris, is mixed. We continue to see very good growth out of the consumables business. And with the addition of Cantel, the consumables business, although it was only up 1% organically, it is up almost 11% if you include the Cantel acquisition. So we are seeing, as I think you understand, consumables are higher margins -- tend to be higher margins for us. So that is also helping drive the improved profitability margin."

What I would say on the Healthcare backlog, it's really strong across all product segments at this point, whether that's surgical or IPT. And then in terms of project versus sort of short-term work, a year ago, we were almost exclusively long-term projects and builds and things like that. And we've seen a significant recovery in the replacement business in the last 6, 7 months, I would say, to where it's kind of back to pre-COVID levels in terms of replacement type spending. So we've got a -- our backlog still not maybe what it would have looked like proportionately 2 years ago before the pandemic. But the last sort of 6 months or so of order intake definitely is. 
In terms of the Life Science capital, there's a lot of money being spent expanding production in terms of biologics, vaccines and gene therapies, all these different type of applications that require aseptic manufacturing environments. And as we've discussed before, that's really STERIS' sweet spot. We tend to benefit on the consumables side of that. We tend to benefit in AST, on the disposable side going into those manufacturing environments. And then we also tend to benefit on the capital equipment side for GMP type equipment for sterilization into those type environments as well. 
The other thing I would mention is, we have seen since the beginning of our fiscal year recovery in sort of research type spending, which was really slow during the pandemic. Much of that is state or federal funded public institutional spending, and that dried up pretty bad last year. And we have seen our replacement business and -- what we would categorize more as lab or research come back, at least on an order input, to what it would look like pre -- close to what it would look like pre-pandemic."

It is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review the highlights of our third quarter performance. For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 1.4%, driven by 130 basis points of favorable price and 10 basis points of organic volume growth. Gross margin for the quarter was up 110 basis points to 44.2% and benefited from productivity, price and acquisitions. EBIT margin for the quarter was 23.6% of revenue, an increase of 250 basis points from the third quarter last year, due primarily to higher gross margin attainment and lower operating expenses for travel, sales and marketing and compensation due in part from the business disruption from COVID-19.  
Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.4%, somewhat lower than anticipated due to favorable discrete items. Net income in the quarter grew 20% to $149.2 million and earnings increased to $1.73 per diluted share as compared to $1.45 per diluted share in the prior year. 
Our balance sheet is a continued source of strength for the company. Our leverage ratio, at the end of the third quarter, is once again below 2x as we continue to pay down debt post the Key Surgical acquisition. Considering our cash position of $253 million, access to available credit lines and a low leverage ratio, we are well positioned from a liquidity standpoint.  
During the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $53.8 million, while depreciation and amortization was $56.8 million. Free cash flow for the first 9 months was strong at $337.7 million, an increase of almost $100 million over the same period last year, primarily due to improvements in net income and working capital, somewhat offset by higher capital expenditures.

It's a pleasure to be with you to discuss our third quarter results, which once again demonstrate the resilience of our business and the great work of our associates to serve the needs of our customers. Once again",1499,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you to discuss our third quarter results, which once again demonstrate the resilience of our business and the great work of our associates to serve the needs of our customers. Once again, we want to acknowledge the caregivers around the globe, who are on the front lines of this pandemic and doing such a tremendous job.  
Looking back at the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year, the sequential improvement of our business is impressive. While we continue to experience the challenges of a global pandemic, the worst impact on our business appears to be in the rearview mirror. Despite significant numbers of new COVID-19 cases and some hospitals around the globe close to or at capacity, procedures continue to occur.  
Our most significant concern, Healthcare capital equipment, achieved a critical milestone, showing 3 straight quarters of sequential improvement and ending the third quarter with an all-time record order month. This resulted in near record backlog, which is greater than that before the pandemic at the end of Q3 last year.  
Even with pockets of slowdowns in procedures due to COVID-19 uptick, we are quite pleased with our position at this point of our fiscal year. Constant currency organic revenue grew 1% in our third quarter, driven by double-digit growth in AST, which was offset by flat to slightly down revenue in Life Sciences and Healthcare on a constant currency organic basis.  
Our strong growth in AST continues to be favorably impacted by demand for COVID-related single-use products, such as PPE and COVID testing materials as well as components used in vaccine manufacturing and packaging. The business has also seen steady demand from its core medical device customers. Life Sciences revenue was flat in the quarter, with mid-single digit growth in consumables and services, offset by a decline in capital equipment shipments.  
On the consumable side, we have been anticipating a return to more normalized growth for some time. It appears our customers are destocking the excess inventory that was built up over the last 3 quarters. With COVID vaccines now in production, we expect to see sustained high demand for our consumables offering, but not at the extraordinary growth rate of recent quarters when our pharma customers built inventory due to shortage of supply concerns for vaccine production. 
And as we have commented frequently over the years, capital equipment shipments in Life Sciences can be lumpy. The decline in Q3 was strictly a matter of timing as capital equipment orders were strong in the quarter, reflected in our Life Sciences record capital equipment order backlog.  
Healthcare benefited from the addition of Key Surgical during the quarter, which added about $15 million to Healthcare consumable revenue. While it's still early days, we are quite pleased with our integration efforts and what we're seeing so far in that business. We continue to have high expectations for Key Surgical going forward.  
As I mentioned earlier, while the shipments for healthcare capital equipment declined year-over-year for the quarter, we did see sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3 and backlog ended above last year's levels. We are cautiously optimistic about our fourth quarter and start of our new fiscal year regarding Healthcare capital equipment as the risks appear to have declined throughout this fiscal year.  
Our profit overall has exceeded our expectations as we continue to see the benefit of continued efficiency gains, along with lower operating expenses. The operating expense reduction is largely due to travel disruptions from the pandemic. As we've said all year, we do expect some of those expenses to phase back in as travel resumes, returning our operating expenses to more normal levels.  
We are committed, however, to evaluating opportunities to permanently reduce expenses as we have learned that some things can be accomplished virtually. Adjusted earnings for the quarter, as Mike mentioned, were $1.73 per diluted share or growth of 19% as we benefited from higher gross margins, reduced operating expenses and a slightly lower-than-anticipated tax rate.  
With just 2 months remaining in our fiscal year, we like where we stand today and the long-term positioning of our global portfolio. Our thoughts on the full fiscal year have not changed materially from what we discussed last quarter. Constant currency organic revenue, excluding acquisitions, should be about flat for the fiscal year. That's impressive performance in this environment, but it is safe to say that we all look forward to getting back to normal and delivering the revenue growth we know we are capable of in the longer term.  
Once again, I would like to thank STERIS people for their commitment to our customers, those health care professionals who continue to do a simply miraculous job on the front lines of this pandemic. We also welcome the people of Key Surgical to our team. And we're working through the process to complete the acquisition of Cantel Medical and look forward to welcoming the Cantel people to the STERIS family as well.  
Now before we open to Q&A, I want to comment on our announcement that I will be stepping down as the CEO at the end of July. The Board and I have been working on my succession for years. And while we have other capable candidates, Dan Carestio, our current Chief Operating Officer, is our unanimous choice. Dan, the Board and I have been working to prepare him for this transition. And as the announcement said, I will be available through July of 2023 as an adviser to management and the Board.  
As you all know, I hold a significant amount of STERIS stock and options, and continue to be highly vested in our long-term success, both personally and financially. When I came to STERIS a little over 13 years ago, the preponderance of investors and analysts advised me to exit the Life Sciences and AST business due to their morbe and performance. 
I worked with the executives of those groups to determine whether or not that was the way to go. The answer is now abundantly clear, and we have Dan and his teams to thank for the improvements in those segments.  
Dan's early executive leadership role was running sales and marketing for the AST group. He developed and implemented the strategy to improve that business. A few years later, I asked him to take on Life Science as a General Manager, while maintaining the sales and marketing leadership for AST. He worked with that team and led the improvement in Life Sciences, while continuing the success at AST. 
He then successfully integrated Synergy Health AST business as General Manager of AST and Life Sciences. Dan took on the leadership of our Healthcare IPT business several years ago, making him responsible then for all sterilization and disinfection products across the STERIS portfolio. 
And finally, he became responsible for all of our operations as Chief Operating Officer in 2018. STERIS' performance in the past 13 years, for which I have happily been able to take credit, are significantly the result of the work done by Dan and his management teams. I am extremely confident that he is the right person to lead STERIS into the future.  
To add to that confidence, I could relate a similar story about many additional members of our senior management team, especially including our CFO, our General Counsel, and the leaders of the commercial operations and business units of STERIS. Almost all of those leaders have been with us or companies we've acquired for over 15 years and have stepped up and made significant improvements in their operations, while taking on increasing responsibility as we have grown.  
They've done great work that has individually and collectively added to the success of our company. The median tenure of our 27 members of our senior management team is over 15 years, longer than I've been with the company. The median age is 53, so most should be here for a good long time. That talent in senior management team, along with the 13,000 people of STERIS are the bedrock of our past success and why STERIS' future is bright, and Dan and I both know it.  
I'm looking forward to having more time to spend with my family beginning this fall. I'm blessed with the wife of over 40 years. I meant to say, a wonderful life of over 40 years, and have 2 fantastic adult children and their spouses, who have given us 9 young grandchildren. And I'm not stepping down until the end of July, and will be fully engaged as CEO until that time. After that, I will be available to our management team and the Board of Directors for an additional 2 years.  
We believe that STERIS is stronger and better positioned than ever. The STERIS team stands ready to capture additional opportunities, and we continue to be confident that the future of STERIS is bright.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Julie for Q&A."

So the question really is, what's the perfect time for a transition? And the perfect time, in my opinion, for a transition is just before a successful CEO is ready to go and just after the incumbent CEO is ready to take over. That's the perfect time for a change, and that's where we are right now."

That's why, the CEOs work 60, 70 hours a week is because there's always something going on. There's too much to do all the time. So there's no perfect time, in my view, as it relates to that. 
Having said that, the right time is, again, while I'm still very active, very engaged, love what I'm doing, but see the end. And when Dan is ready, and he's a little more than ready, he's probably a little anxious to get my a** out of here. But the short answer is that, I think, is the key, is timing of the person leaving and the successor.  
Now having said that, if anyone who knows me knows that I'm not going to retire today, I'll be in there 60 hours a week until July 29, and they'll be lucky if they can get me out of here in less than 60 hours a week for the several months after that. I love what I do, love the business. 
For the last 2 or 3 years, for all intents and purposes, I've been giving advice, not driving the business anyway. The people of this -- senior management team in this business is extraordinary. And they don't need a whole lot of help, in truth. And people like Dan and Mike and the people that work with them are more than capable of doing this work. I mean, truth of the matter is, I've hardly been involved in Key because Dan has pretty much taken that on.  
I've been more involved in Cantel for some of my obvious reasons. And I had historic relationships there. But in terms of implementing the work, I haven't been an implementer for quite a while. So these guys are perfectly capable. I use guys in the -- both sexes term. By the way, 1/3 of that senior management team is female. So I'm serious about using it in the sex-neutral term, if you will. But these people know what they're doing, and they will do a great job with or without me.

In terms of the timing as for Key, opportunity here for STERIS is to look at the broader integration of Key and STERIS and Cantel. There are some real synergies between the 3 businesses that we believe will play out in the future. And we're well down the path already in terms of integration as it relates to Key Surgical, and we're confident with where we are and the performance of the business.  
And our management teams have done roughly 50 deals over the last 6, 7, 8 years, right? This is -- I don't want to say it's another day in the office. This is a big deal, there's no doubt.

And frankly, everybody with a 3D printer these days is making swabs for test kits right now, and those need to be sterile. 
In addition, we're seeing increased demand from bio manufacturers, syringe manufacturers and folks involved in supplying components into the manufacturing process for vaccine as well as significant growth in what we would categorize as bioprocess sterile disposables, they're using pharmaceutical manufacturing. Those have been on a strong growth uptick for a number of years, but it has been accelerated by the demand in vaccine production. 
Now having said that, we're still seeing less than normal demand from our core medical device customers, especially those that operate in the realm of more elective type procedures, things like orthopedics and spine and things of that nature. So much of the core business has still been a bit suppressed in terms of normal growth rate or normalcy. And we believe those -- return to normalcy, if you will, that will more than offset the short-term impact of some of the COVID-related benefit. 
Now having said that, vaccines aren't going away. I don't anticipate seeing any slowdown in either the bioprocess disposable business or any of the packaging or materials going into vaccines in the future. So we think that will sustain at a pretty high level."

So obviously, very strong free cash flow for the first 9 months of the fiscal year. And as I stated earlier, the combination of increases in net income and working capital improvements, specifically when I'm talking working capital improvements, we've seen fantastic efforts across our business in the collections of our outstanding AR, our balances, and actually, our DSO has once again been down about 2 days for the third quarter, and we've continued to see improvements in those collection efforts throughout the whole year. And that's on top of elevated inventory levels, which we continue to maintain surety supply and level load. 
So if I look at longer term, obviously, I don't know if the levels of AR collections will be this good sitting here next year, but obviously, the opportunity for us is to reduce the inventory. So hopefully, over time, we continue and should continue to improve our free cash flow position. 
As far as our capital expenditures, year-to-date, we're up $11 million compared to where we were at this point last year. We anticipate to continue to spend at elevated levels, not only for the rest of this year, but also as we look out for the next couple of years, specifically around our continued expansions into our AST segment.

Maybe just two quick ones for me here this morning. First, when we think about what you're seeing more so on the Healthcare side with capital in that build, just trying to make -- get a better understanding of what types of projects you're seeing there that drove that new record backlog in that segment. 
And then secondly, I would like to follow-on to Larry's comment regarding the cash flow, which was extremely strong in the quarter, especially in light of what's transpiring. Just want to think -- or maybe this is for Mike or for Dan, if we should start to step up our expectations for free cash flow generation. When we look at the yield versus the sales line historically, you're trending up. And clearly, AST seems to be supporting that with higher margins. So I just want to think about how we should think about cash flow on a longer-term basis as well?"

The number of new products we have in the space right now is very, very strong. Virtually, everything in our surgical line has been refreshed in the last 12 to 18 months. Booms, lights, tables, ORI, we have several new products that are in the infrastructure space. They're all doing nicely. So surgical is clearly -- the operating room, what we call surgical is the operating room, is very strong right now relative to last year. And IPT continues to be just an extraordinary piece of business on the capital side. 
So between the two, and I would say, although, we had and still have a little trepidation about capital spending, when things -- when hospitals tend to pull back a little bit in capital, one of the last places they tend to pull back is with the surgeons who generate the income for the hospital. So we have traditionally not pulled back as hard as some other areas when things go bad. That means, we don't jump up as much when things get a little bit better. 
But I think it's a combination of -- there was a little gap when there weren't so many orders. I think they seem to be back to ""normal"", at least in our space on the surgical and IPT space. So I'd say at a high level, that's it. Now I'll let the other guys talk about the cash flow question you asked."

But one of the other things that you got to be cautious about is, as we do adjusted earnings on the P&L standpoint, we do not do adjusted free cash flow. So as we continued with acquisitions, especially the integrations and the cost of those integrations, especially around Cantel, we're going to be spending a significant amount of cash to get those cost synergies.

So what I would say is, I think we've talked about, and you stated as well, on a year-to-date basis, our Life Sciences consumable business is up roughly 25%, give or take. And what we're seeing now is a little bit of pullback in terms of as our customers burn off some of the the inventories they built early on in the early phase of the pandemic when there's a lot of concerns about shortage of supply. And we made it a point at STERIS to serve our existing customers in-pharma and never deviate from that and sell outside of market to make sure those folks knew that we would have those validated chemistries as demand continue to rise as they got into vaccine. 
In terms of an actual percentage of how much is going to vaccine, it is impossible for me to say. And the reason why is that many of the vaccine manufacturers are also -- have been long-term large customers of STERIS that use our product [indiscernible] environment or from a bioprocess cleaning perspective in their normal day-to-day production of pharmaceuticals and biopharma. So it's not as if we're tracking down to the shop 4 level as to every application our products go into. 
What we know, though, is that we are getting some uptick from vaccine as our customers sort of refocus in that area, especially around COVID. And we believe that will be a trend that continues. In terms of the beta bag product, that's a sterile transfer product that has an integrated lift or an isolator. It's not something we do. We are in the space of sterility maintenance and sterility assurance as it relates to bioprocess, no doubt, with our sterile products solution group of products. And those have continued to do very well since the beginning of the pandemic -- they've done well since the time of acquisition, actually, but they've done very well since the pandemic really started. And those products are up in the [indiscernible] as well and has stayed fairly consistent in terms of their growth as opposed to slowing down, as we've seen in the chemistries piece. 
Specifically, on the chemistries, we have mainly 2 offerings there. One is, what we call critical environment products, and those are disinfectants some sterilants that are largely used in either aseptic manufacturing process or highly regulated cleaning rooms for pharma manufacturing. Not a lot has changed in terms of their application with COVID. There's just more application as it relates to increased vaccine production. 
And then the other large portion of our consumable business is what we would call bioprocess cleaners. And those are chemistry used for cleaning out the actual biopharma equipment used in the manufacturing process. So in between production runs, they assure they have the highest level of purity in terms of how they treat their machines [indiscernible] the stainless steel in the process."

Obviously, the areas that have been very strong have tended to be toward our higher margin products. So there has been a bit of a mix effect. And as we ship more of the capital and as we do more of that, there will be some, I'll call it, mix effect. 
But as you know, we don't plan on keeping our cost at same level ever. And so we are working to reduce costs, some of which we pass on through lack of price increase to our customers, some of which we take to the bottom line. So that's one set of mixes. 
And then as we bring the other businesses on board, it depends on which parts of those businesses are coming in. There is a natural mix effect. But on the other hand, given the level of synergies that we see, we think we will be offsetting that. 
So we think that if you were to look at it in a pro forma basis, if you will, how those businesses all look today and add them together, the margins are going to go up because we're going to take more than $100 million out of the businesses that are coming on board. So we feel very good about that. 
And you know from our long association that I only care about growing profit dollars. As long as we can grow profit dollars double digits, that's what the team's mandate is. And if we happen to -- the margin happens to go up 10 basis points or down 10 basis points, I don't know there's any sleep over it. But in the end, it's pretty hard to grow revenue at high single digits and margins, and then profits at double digits unless we grow margins, and that's our mandate."

And specifically, I mean, we had a really tough time with sales reps getting access for 3, 4 months, give or take. And just that -- don't ever underestimate the ability of a sales organization's ability to sell. And being present is very important. So I think there's some catch-up in those numbers. 
But generally speaking, when we talk to customers and hospital systems, there is a concern about the surge after the surge. And that is, what's going to happen with all these backlog surgeries that are elective or semi-elective once we get back to a normal steady state in terms of COVID in operating? So I think that's also helping us in terms of the sustainability of the capital backlog in the orders we're seeing."

And we've been, I'll call it, consistent, if you will, all year, surrounding this. And the make up of that is, as we have put employees on furlough, and when I mean furlough, they're not doing anything for the company. So they're pretty -- they're just off completely. So we've taken the opportunity to capture those costs. Also, we've been able to get some government reimbursement for those folks at the same time. So we're netting that cost into the adjustments. 
In addition to that, we have had to put in some training tools. We've done some enhanced cleanings, some different protocols that we've also done in our facilities across the globe. We've made some modifications to our buildings. 
Obviously, traffic patterns have changed, signage has changed. So all of those costs surrounding that is what we're capturing. And we're identifying separately as the COVID incremental cost as we're adjusting those out. 
To date, we're about just over $20 million for the first 9 months, and that has significantly dropped from the first quarter levels. And we anticipate it will continue to drop as most, if not all of our employees are back to work. 
And recall, we were also very proud that we did not have to lay off anybody. This was our intention of keeping our folks whole. And when our customers were ready to come back to work, we were there right alongside with them."

And so the governments of the world, depending on which part of the world they're in, make up some portion of that, but never all of it. And so that's been the cost. And that's really the most significant cost that we have captured. 
And in most cases, where there is -- and certainly, when there's a government subsidy, it's absolutely clear that they cannot do anything while we're -- while they're on furlough, if you will. And we have taken that approach on anyone who we have captured in this is that they are absolutely not working and absolutely being paid 100% of their pay."
