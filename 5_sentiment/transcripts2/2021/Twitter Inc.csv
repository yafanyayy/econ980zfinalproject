Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 earnings conference call. We have Jack and Ned with us today. 
We published our shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website and with the SEC about 2 hours ago, and hope everyone had a chance to read it. We'll keep our opening remarks brief so that we can dive right into your questions. As a reminder, we will also take questions asked on Twitter, so please tweet us at @twitterir using the #TWTR. 
During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements, including statements about our business outlook, strategies and long-term goals. These comments are based on our plans, predictions and expectations as of today, which may change over time. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors in our most recent 10-Q and the upcoming 10-K to be filed with the SEC. 
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. We have reconciled those to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in our shareholder letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. 
And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website, and an audio replay will be available on Twitter and on our website in a few hours. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jack."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. A few comments from me and Ned before we get to your questions. I'm really proud of how we navigated 2020 and our remarkable finish in Q4.

I'm really proud of how we navigated 2020 and our remarkable finish in Q4. We reported revenue of $1.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year, reflecting great progress across both brand and direct response, with 31% year-over-year growth in total ad revenue and greater than 50% year-over-year growth in MAP revenue in Q4. 
We made significant progress with new ad formats, stronger attribution and improved targeting in Q4. And that momentum continues in Q1 with the launch of our rebuilt MAP offering and website clicks objective. These improvements allow us to serve DR advertisers of all sizes with better performance and puts us in a much stronger position to drive accelerating revenue growth in 2021 and beyond. 
Average monetizable DAU reached 192 million in Q4, up 27% year-over-year, with growth from product improvements reaching an all-time high in 2020. Looking ahead, we have a strong product road map designed to deliver even more daily utility for new and existing customers. 
I'm also proud of the work we did in Q4 and over the course of the year to protect the integrity of the conversation around the U.S. elections, scale our infrastructure and service -- and service to operate reliably throughout the major events of 2020 and for our team while keeping people safe in the face of a global pandemic. 
With everything that's been happening in the world, in the U.S. and on our service around the U.S. elections, we've been getting a number of questions from you all about our audience. We are a platform that is obviously much larger than any one topic or any one account. 80% of our audience is outside the United States, and we have more than 50 accounts with over 25 million followers. Conversations on Twitter every day are based on what's happening in the world. And we have proven in the past few years that if we do the work to serve the public conversation, our daily audience grows. 
To anticipate the question, the increase in average absolute mDAU through the end of January was above the historical average for the last 4 years, and we expect to see mDAU growth of approximately 20% year-over-year in Q1. We look forward to seeing you all at our Virtual Analyst Day on February 25, where we're going to go deeper on all of our plans. 
And lastly, I want to thank our teams for their incredible resilience and dedication during these trying times. We continue to see the strength and value of our service, the incredible potential of our business, and the importance of our purpose to serve the public conversation. Ned?"

Before I get into Q&A, I'd like to highlight a few topics. As Jack noted, Q4 was a strong finish to the year. Total revenue of $1.3 billion was our highest ever in a quarter.

Total revenue of $1.3 billion was our highest ever in a quarter. We grew total ad revenue 43% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. ad revenue was up 27%, and international ad revenue was up 35%, compared to 11% and 20%, respectively, in Q3. Advertiser demand was stronger than expected throughout the quarter, outside of a short period bracketing the U.S. elections on November 3. 
Given the more stable business backdrop, we are able to move faster in hiring, resulting in total expense growth for Q4 of 21% and CapEx growth of 95% year-over-year. As a result of our strong revenue performance, we reported our highest ever quarterly operating income of $252 million, a reminder of the leverage in our business when we deliver revenue strength like we did in Q4. 
Based on our conviction and our strategy, and the opportunity and execution and pace of innovation, we're maintaining our investment posture in 2021 and expect to grow total cost and expenses 25% or more, with most of our OpEx focused on headcount, particularly in engineering and product. We're also modestly increasing our CapEx spend in 2021 to support a bigger base of audience and advertising and to complete the build-out of a new data center. 
We're pleased with the steady progress we're making in both brand and performance ads. From Xbox Mexico, using the new Map Carousel to launch its next-generation console to Yahoo! Japan rebranding its big annual e-commerce campaign, advertisers are turning to Twitter for campaigns that drive awareness and deliver results. While still early, we're also laying the foundation for more revenue from small and medium businesses, as well as non-advertising subscription-based revenue streams that we'll experiment with this year and see revenue from in a more meaningful way next year. Assuming COVID improves and that we see modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14 we expect revenue in 2021 to grow faster than expenses. 
While we typically don't provide an outlook for mDAU, this is an unusual year on a number of levels, and we recognize our recent outsized growth will impact our growth rates in 2021 in a way that merits explanation. There are no changes to the ambition we shared pre pandemic when mDAU was at 152 million for us to grow mDAU 20% or more over multiple years. But the accelerated mDAU growth driven by COVID sets tougher comparables for most of 2021. 
We announced on March 23 last year that mDAU year-over-year growth was already 23% quarter to date. And the mid-March surge from COVID that sustained the rest of the year had an outsized impact on the last 3 quarters' growth rates. We expect mDAU growth, as Jack had mentioned, of about 20% in Q1. But due to the tougher comps, we expect quarterly growth rates in the low double digits on a year-over-year basis in Q2, Q3 and Q4, with the low point likely in Q2. We remain focused on delivering higher growth rates in years to come as we reset some more normal comps. 
And you've also seen, we announced our rebuilt map and website clicks products yesterday as well. There's a great blog with more details on Twitter and on our website. 
In summary, we're pleased with the results and the momentum we carry into 2021, and we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

Jack, I was just hoping you could talk on the product side, a little bit about fleets and engagement that you're seeing so far?

And then similarly in Spaces, I know it's early, but there's clearly a lot going on in terms of the adoption in the audio conversation space. So just hoping to get some thoughts there. 
And then, Ned, quickly, a lot of ad innovation kind of coming together at once. Curious if you're seeing a lift in advertiser count yet? And what kind of timing you'd expect for that?"

We're looking more at the use cases in terms of what serves all the conversation best and how we best serve that on Twitter. Fleets goes after the use case of a ephemeral content, making sure that we can provide a solution for people who may not want to have a tweet up permanently, but be more in a moment. We have a long road map ahead for that feature. And the early results after our global launch look good, but it's still pretty early. 
Spaces is a really compelling area. Really love what we're seeing early with our beta testers in terms of the audio conversations that they can have free flowing, giving a lot more control to the participants. It will present a new model for how we think about instantaneous and potentially ephemeral communities in public conversation. And there's another area that we announced recently, which is around newsletters. This is really the long-form use case, making sure that people can use Twitter, not just for the short 280 character burst, but also to expand on their thoughts. We're just getting started there. But you saw us integrate it very quickly into our web service. 
So with all three, we have some foundational use cases that we'll be watching very closely and learning from and iterating quickly on. But generally, the thing that ties all these together are -- there are multiple ways to have public conversation. And we want to make sure that we have the best offering that not only is best-of-class for each individual use case. But more importantly, what makes them strong is how they connect together and how Twitter can thread all of them. So that will be the real work and the real magic. And really excited to learn from each one individually. But more importantly, tying them together is going to be the going to drive the most value to my mind."

We think a lot of the work that we've been doing, whether it's around topics or the work to preserve the health of the conversation on the service have really helped people find what they're looking for and staying there, number one. 
And two, I think that second part of your question was around MAP and why now? So we have released over 30 improvements to that product over the last year. And they've been things from improving our terms of service and working with third-party measurement partners to releasing the Carousel format and improving the models that do prediction. And you're already seeing the early results from it, such as the 80% plus impression growth that we're able to drive in Q4 and the over 50% growth in revenues from that in Q4, albeit off of a slightly depressed base in Q4 of 2019. 
And as we thought about how to balance all these new features that we had in getting this into advertisers' hands with the changes that are coming from iOS 14, we felt that the product is ready, and it was time to get this in people's hands, recognizing that there always are going to be changes to which we need to adapt. We've also already done a lot of the work to prepare for iOS 14, we announced a couple of things yesterday. One is called Twitter Click ID, which will help you attribute a click from Twitter to an advertiser's website without a cookie as the world moves away from cookies over time. And we've also implemented the SK ad network, which is Apple's aggregated reporting service for advertisers to see what happened. So I felt like it was time to go on that. And also on the revamped website clicks product, but there'll be lots of improvements that will continue to come on both of those over time."

If you could just spend a minute, maybe just kind of delineate what -- as you think about everything you're doing in direct response and performance marketing, where does MAP fit in? How much is kind of outside the bounds of MAP? 
Because obviously, when you talk about a doubling of revenue in Q4 in terms of kind of where you got to, I think a lot of that gets lost in sort of the delay that's happened in MAP. And so just kind of helping us understand what's in that mix would be really helpful."

As we talked about, the DR roadmap, we've said, just as we've said around other parts of our service that we've worked to improve over the years, that we need to begin by fixing the foundation.

So we're not going to give guidance today on what that's going to do over the course of the year, but we feel like we've got some real strong momentum behind us with that 50% growth during the fourth quarter. And we know there's so much more that we can do for app install advertisers with this new product out in the market now and over 30 improvements. And we'll likely see easier comps in the first couple of quarters of the year and lapping that 50% growth in the fourth quarter, obviously, is going to be harder than the earlier parts of the year. 
I think we're going to work hard to deliver for them. And if you think about it, $300 million in the context of tens of billions of dollars spent on app install ads, we feel like there's lots of room for us with a growing audience and strong relationships already with the advertisers. 
The second part of your question around Q1. So you'll recall that delay advertisers typically approach the year. They spend the first week or 2 of the year coming back to the office and planning and thinking about where they want to show up and how they want to show up. And this year, and it's all the secular change that we've seen, which I think really benefits Twitter, that we have become the second screen for sports and for watch parties for movies and for other things where people can't necessarily be in the stadiums or in the seats, the way they have been before and as dollars continue to go away from linear television. I think a lot of that accrues to our benefit. But they spend the first week or 2 thinking about where and how they want to show up. 
During that time frame, we had riots at the capital. And that may have exacerbated that a bit. But as we look ahead and I'd start to look ahead with the Super Bowl this past weekend, where we were able to deliver for over 40 of the advertisers who were advertising during the game, there are a ton of great things happening that caused people to want to come together and have conversation around sports, around award ceremonies, around entertainment and other topics, and we're really excited about our ability to deliver around those things for advertisers with a larger audience, with better formats and improved relevance."

We are also not dependent upon just news and politics being what drives Twitter. 
What we're excited about especially in the future is helping everyone unlock more of the long tail of topics and interest. This is why I believe being able to follow topics and interest is so critical and so important. And we give that functionality to people as soon as they sign up for Twitter. 
People just spend so much time trying to find the right accounts instead of really being able to focus on what topics they're interested in. And it lends itself not to a better -- not only to a better consumption experience, but also more conversation, ultimately, and that's what we want to do.

And that just gives so much power to the individual using Twitter, but it also gives a lot of power to our advertisers, because it unlocks an entirely new way of advertising on Twitter and getting introductions to would be consumers for your product or services, especially as we make local topics easy to follow and we add those topics. 
We have over 6,000 topics that you can follow today. And we're adding them as quickly as we can all around the world. So that is the one area that I'd point to really focus on because it unlocks so much in terms of our experience, but also our business."

And then we've got a strong small and medium-sized business sales team. But there'll be terrific leverage for us as well over time as we make it easier and easier for advertisers of all sizes to buy really compelling direct response ads from us when we make it easier and easier for them to buy the ads when the ads are more and more performing. It will attract not just the advertisers, but whom we work very closely who we can go in and pitch around big campaigns, but also those now exactly what they want to do and are running highly quantified models to assess where the best places are for them to show up with their campaigns. 
And we think around website clicks and around MAP, there's a lot of that that's in front of us. But as we've said for a while now, it's important to get the product out into people's hands so that they can test and learn around it, and then allow their models to adjust. And so we hope to see a lot of that play out over the coming years as we continue to improve these products. 
You asked about e-commerce. E-commerce is on the road map. If you think about the advertiser funnel being in the middle around getting people the opportunity to click-through the website or to download an app is really important, and those have been places where we've already been able to help advertisers, but we really won't be done until we help somebody begin a purchase on the service. And you'll see us work around those things in the coming period here as we figure out the best way to do it and engineer it and deliver it to people at a time."

But I wouldn't expect you to see these be meaningful contributors until next year. 
Having said that, I just want to give a little perspective around subscriptions more broadly. Remember, 85% of our revenue today is showing ads to people on Twitter. And this is a hundreds of billions of dollar addressable market. And there is -- that is growing because of secular shifts and because of what's going on in the economy right now. And we see so much opportunity to deliver better and better for advertisers and to gain more and more of that market with a growing audience, with better formats, with better performance of those formats. And so we love talking about subscriptions and the potential and the durability they can provide and predictability to our revenue streams, but we also maintain a big focus around our revenue products. And we feel really good about the pace of innovation that we're delivering around that now where it feels like things are really accelerating on the back of our improved ad server last year, where we're shipping more and more improvements now than we've been able to in the past. Now having MAP and website clicks out as of yesterday. We'll continue to work to improve these products as well."

But Jack, when you think about where Twitter is going over the medium to long term, we're talking a lot on this call about DR and identifiers and giving the advertiser an opportunity, more right than wrong. And you've written a lot about getting decentralization into the web and bitcoin and things like that. How do you think about a parallel where parts of the web decentralized versus some parts of the web continue to centralize and how you sort of marry those views and how you think about aligning Twitter as a platform for the medium to long term? Would love your sort of philosophical and operational view on that. 
And then maybe, Ned, just to come back to MAP. I think you talked about up 50% in Q4. Can you just discern a little bit of how much of that was an easy comp in Q4 that you called out a year ago? Because it seems like to be flat on the year and up 50% in Q4. Obviously, there was a fair bit of weakness between Q4 and maybe the first half of '20. I just want to make sure we're sort of interpreting the rate of change, right?"

It gives many more inputs to public conversation. And the more conversation that we kind of access to, the more -- the better job we can do to surface relevant content to people. And that's where we will be competitive, is making sure that we are delivering the best out of a much, much larger corpus of conversation. 
So as we look at things that we can decentralize, this one becomes very, very obvious. The problem of discovery around content is one that is easiest when it is centralized, and that's how we've operated for almost the past 15 years. But even that has some potential to shift. And one of the things we brought up last year in our Senate testimonies in terms of where we're excited to build to address some of the problems that is facing Section 230, is giving more people choice around what relevance algorithms they're using for ranking algorithms you're using. You can imagine a more market-driven and marketplace approach to algorithms. And that is something that not only we can host but we can participate in. 
So I think the thing that gets me really excited about all of this is we will have access to a much larger conversation, have access to much more content, and we'll be able to put many more ranking algorithms that suit different people's needs on top of it. And you can imagine an app store like [indiscernible] are ranking algorithms that give people optimal flexibility in terms of how they see it. 
And that will not only help our business, but drive more people into participating in social media in the first place. So this is something we believe in, not just from an open Internet standpoint, but also we believe it's important. And it really helps our business thrive in a significantly new way, given how much bigger it could be."

So it's really hard to look at the growth from one quarter in 2019 to the growth in another quarter of 2020 and assign analogies and percentages. As you can imagine, with a product that we've rebuilt with over 30 new features, many of which are already available in Q4, we need to earn the trust of the advertisers who use our service every day. And many of the advertisers who show up in Q4 of '20 are different than the ones who show up in 2019. Those who are the same are often advertising something different: A new game; a new rollout of a second season of a show on their streaming platform; or something else that they didn't have the year before. And so they're constantly testing and observing where they get the best performance and where they want to show up with their ad dollars. 
And so we do have -- we did have an easy comp in Q4 of '19 because we faced a number of challenges in the middle of Q3 of '19, which persisted into Q4. But we still had to go out and earn every one of those dollars with this -- largely rebuilt, but not completely rebuilt product in Q4. 
So as I look ahead, I feel like what's in the question is, where do we go from here? We're going to work hard to continue to grow the size of MAP and direct response more broadly from now into the future, because we know that that's an important segment for our advertising customers. We know that, that is a large and growing part of the digital ads market. So -- and we feel like we're well positioned to deliver against it with all the inputs that we've got."

And within these comments, how are you thinking about growth in the U.S.? 
And then second, bigger picture question. I know throughout the second half of last year, you took some efforts to sort of improve your data capture to maybe drive better relevancy of your ad units. Talk to us about some examples where you improved your overall data set and you're targeting offerings for your advertisers?"

Thanks, Brian. So on mDAU first, when we forecast DAU, which whether we share with you all or not, you can imagine is an important part of the work that we do as we plan on and think about how to resource things, we look at the products that we're building. We look at history and try to think through how things that have happened in the past are likely to impact the future. We look at how our retention rates have improved and evolved over time, and we try to roll those forward. We don't roll forward global pandemics. And there are certainly exogenous events that happen that are harder for us to predict. 
But when we have a base of a foundation on which to forecast, the numbers that we share today fall out of all the hard work we do to analyze those and think about how we roll those forward. We do think there's opportunity for us to continue to grow in the United States and outside of the United States, with hundreds of millions of people in the United States who still don't use the service every day with a very healthy top of funnel, both in the United States and outside of the United States, we have lots of that. That's every day to help people find what they're looking for better so that they make Twitter a part of their daily habit. 
And this group that joined us around the time that shelter-in-place began in mid-March that has stayed with us better than previous groups have, really gives us confidence that we are doing a better and better job. Jack talked about topics and how there's real opportunity for us to surface those for people earlier in their experience. We're getting better and better at that. Not just at onboarding, but in their initial weeks with us so that we can help them have a better experience. We even -- within topics, I have to be thoughtful about how we show somebody on the East Coast who says that they are a baseball fan, different tweets from somebody on the West Coast who is a baseball fan. And as we adapt and learn around these things, they can have a better and better impact on our ability to retain the people who come to the service all the time. 
The second part of your question was around our ability to leverage more data in order to deliver them better for advertisers. There's a lot that we've done here. I'll give you a few examples. One is, as we talked about in the past, we have taken the opportunity over the last few quarters to trust people a couple of times outside of the EU, to ask their permission to give them a more personalized experience. And this is something that we try to do in a transparent way that builds trust, that doesn't take it away, that makes it clear to people exactly what we're asking and gives them the opportunity to say, no, if they want to. These have been successful, both in terms of getting more people to choose a personalized experience, but also in terms of not adding the people who said, no, I feel like we did anything untoward in how we approach them. So that's one example. 
A second one is we take a model that we use to predict how -- who ought to see a [indiscernible] ad. And we apply a learning period to it. So we give the model a chance to adjust for a few days so that it can learn from how the ads are engaged with in the early days and then adapt over time, we found that, that has helped a lot. 
And lastly, just in how people use the service as we know more and more about what they're looking for because they tell us they care about a whole topic, not just calling together the accounts that they think might inform about that topic. If they go to an event-specific time line, we know exactly what it is that they care about in a moment, as they give us signal when they serve something on the service, there are more and more opportunities for us to leverage those signals, some of which we've had for a long time, but there's still opportunity to leverage better than we have in the past than others which are newer to us. We still see lots of opportunity to better utilize those to show people more and more compelling ads over time."

We still believe that over the long term, our focus on promoting more healthy conversation is a growth sector. And we definitely see the effects of that.

We focused on 3 areas: public health, civic integrity and [indiscernible] and media. I think, ultimately, over time, this is a problem best solved by the people using Twitter itself. So that means giving folks much better controls to perform moderation individually or as a group. And also, things like a beta we launched recently called Bird Watch, which allows people to add context to tweets that just give people more broader context for the things that we are not able to handle as a centralized service. So the more we can decentralize the moderation and give people better tools to curate their experience, I think it continues to be a very, very strong growth vector for growth over the long term."

So remember, there are 3 big buckets there a few other things, but 3 that I focus you on, around cost of revenue. One is our infrastructure, whether it is depreciation for servers that live in our data centers or it's in quarter spend where we're sending a check to Google Cloud or eventually to AWS. And that's a very big bucket, and that's going to continue to grow over time. It will scale with things like our needs to do more and more analysis, which we do ROI analysis when we do that work to make sure that there's a payoff for it. But we can define that when our teams have access to better analytics and the best tools at the best cloud partners that they can do better work than they were able to previously. So that's one bucket that will grow over time. 
Second bucket is traffic acquisition costs. When revenue is higher, TAC will tend to grow with revenue. It also got a little bump in the middle of this year when we added the [indiscernible] install team as their revenue has TAC associated with it. 
And then the third bucket that can be more variable and is larger, is that revenue share where -- when content partners bring awesome clips and highlights to Twitter. And we split an ad dollar with them, their part of the ad dollar shows up in cost of revenue. And in a year like this, you saw fewer of those dollars in Q2, and you saw more of them in Q4, just the way that the event calendars shifted. 
Now remember, when we think about our profitability, we're going to be more gross profit dollar sensitive than gross margin sensitive. And so they could vary over time, and you know where our bias is. But you should see leverage when we deliver revenue outcomes like the one that we did today when you add up all the expenses to run the company."

We reported revenue of $1.3 billion, up 28% year-over-year, reflecting great progress across both brand and direct response, with 31% year-over-year growth in total ad revenue and greater than 50% year-over-year growth in MAP revenue in Q4. 
We made significant progress with new ad formats, stronger attribution and improved targeting in Q4. And that momentum continues in Q1 with the launch of our rebuilt MAP offering and website clicks objective. These improvements allow us to serve DR advertisers of all sizes with better performance and puts us in a much stronger position to drive accelerating revenue growth in 2021 and beyond. 
Average monetizable DAU reached 192 million in Q4, up 27% year-over-year, with growth from product improvements reaching an all-time high in 2020. Looking ahead, we have a strong product road map designed to deliver even more daily utility for new and existing customers. 
I'm also proud of the work we did in Q4 and over the course of the year to protect the integrity of the conversation around the U.S. elections, scale our infrastructure and service -- and service to operate reliably throughout the major events of 2020 and grow our team while keeping people safe in the face of a global pandemic. 
With everything that's been happening in the world, in the U.S. and on our service around the U.S. elections, we've been getting a number of questions from you all about our audience. We are a platform that is obviously much larger than any one topic or any one account. 80% of our audience is outside the United States, and we have more than 50 accounts with over 25 million followers. Conversations on Twitter every day are based on what's happening in the world. And we have proven in the past few years that if we do the work to serve the public conversation, our daily audience grows. 
To anticipate the question, the increase in average absolute mDAU through the end of January was above the historical average for the last 4 years, and we expect to see mDAU growth of approximately 20% year-over-year in Q1. We look forward to seeing you all at our Virtual Analyst Day on February 25, where we're going to go deeper on all of our plans. 
And lastly, I want to thank our teams for their incredible resilience and dedication during these trying times. We continue to see the strength and value of our service, the incredible potential of our business, and the importance of our purpose to serve the public conversation. Ned?"

Before we get into Q&A, I'd like to highlight a few topics. As Jack noted, Q4 was a strong finish to the year. Total revenue of $1.3 billion was our highest ever in a quarter.

Total revenue of $1.3 billion was our highest ever in a quarter. We grew total ad revenue 43% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. ad revenue was up 27%, and international ad revenue was up 35%, compared to 11% and 20%, respectively, in Q3. Advertiser demand was stronger than expected throughout the quarter, outside of a short period bracketing the U.S. elections on November 3. 
Given the more stable business backdrop, we are able to move faster in hiring, resulting in total expense growth for Q4 of 21% and CapEx growth of 95% year-over-year. As a result of our strong revenue performance, we reported our highest ever quarterly operating income of $252 million, a reminder of the leverage in our business when we deliver revenue strength like we did in Q4. 
Based on our conviction and our strategy, and the opportunity and execution and pace of innovation, we're maintaining our investment posture in 2021 and expect to grow total cost and expenses 25% or more, with most of our OpEx focused on headcount, particularly in engineering and product. We're also modestly increasing our CapEx spend in 2021 to support a bigger base of audience and advertising and to complete the build-out of a new data center. 
We're pleased with the steady progress we're making in both brand and performance ads. From Xbox Mexico, using the new MAP Carousel to launch its next-generation console to Yahoo! Japan rebranding its big annual e-commerce campaign, advertisers are turning to Twitter for campaigns that drive awareness and deliver results. While still early, we're also laying the foundation for more revenue from small and medium businesses, as well as non-advertising subscription-based revenue streams that we'll experiment with this year and see revenue from in a more meaningful way next year. Assuming COVID improves and that we see modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14, we expect revenue in 2021 to grow faster than expenses. 
While we typically don't provide an outlook for mDAU, this is an unusual year on a number of levels, and we recognize our recent outsized growth will impact our growth rates in 2021 in a way that merits explanation. There are no changes to the ambition we shared pre-pandemic when mDAU was at 152 million, for us to grow mDAU 20% or more over multiple years. But the accelerated mDAU growth driven by COVID sets tougher comparables for most of 2021. 
We announced on March 23 last year that mDAU year-over-year growth was already 23% quarter to date. And the mid-March surge from COVID that sustained the rest of the year had an outsized impact on the last 3 quarters' growth rates. We expect mDAU growth, as Jack had mentioned, of about 20% in Q1. But due to the tougher comps, we expect quarterly growth rates in the low double digits on a year-over-year basis in Q2, Q3 and Q4, with the low point likely in Q2. We remain focused on delivering higher growth rates in years to come as we reset some of our normal comps. 
And you've also seen, we announced our rebuilt MAP and website clicks products yesterday as well. There's a great blog with more details on Twitter and on our website. 
In summary, we're pleased with our results and the momentum we carry into 2021, and we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

Jack, I was just hoping you could talk on the product side, a little bit about Fleets and engagement that you're seeing so far? And just how you think that drives, kind of, a different user experience and kind of distribution of content.  
And then similarly in Spaces, I know it's early, but there's clearly a lot going on in terms of the adoption in the audio conversation space. So just hoping to get some thoughts there. 
And then, Ned, quickly, a lot of ad innovation kind of coming together at once. Curious if you're seeing a lift in advertiser count yet? And what kind of timing you'd expect for that?"

We're looking more at the use cases in terms of what serves over conversation best and how we best serve that on Twitter. Fleets goes after the use case of a ephemeral content, making sure that we can provide a solution for people who may not want to have to tweet up permanently, but be more in the moment. We have a long road map ahead for that feature. And the early results after our global launch look good, but it's still pretty early. 
Spaces is a really compelling area. I really love what we're seeing early with our beta testers in terms of the audio conversations that they can have free flowing, giving a lot more control to the participants. It will present a new model for how we think about instantaneous and potentially ephemeral communities in public conversation. And there's another area that we announced recently, which is around newsletters. This is really the long-form use case, making sure that people can use Twitter, not just for the short 280-character bursts, but also to expand on their thoughts. We're just getting started there. But you saw us integrate it very quickly into our web service.  
So with all 3, we have some foundational use cases that we'll be watching very closely and learning from and iterating quickly on. But generally, the thing that ties all these together are -- there are multiple ways to have public conversation. And we want to make sure that we have the best offering that not only is best-of-class for each individual use case, but more importantly, what makes them strong is how they connect together and how Twitter can thread all of them. So that will be the real work and the real magic. And really excited to learn from each one individually. But more importantly, tying them together is going to be the -- is going to drive the most value to my mind."

We think a lot of the work that we've been doing, whether it's around topics or the work to preserve the health of the conversation on the service have really helped people find what they're looking for and staying there, number one. 
And two, I think that second part of your question was around MAP and why now? So we have released over 30 improvements to that product over the last year. And they've been things from improving our terms of service and working with third-party measurement partners to releasing the Carousel format and improving the models that do prediction. And you're already seeing the early results from it, such as the 80% plus impression growth that we were able to drive in Q4 and the over 50% growth in revenues from that in Q4, albeit off of a slightly depressed base in Q4 of 2019. 
And as we thought about how to balance all these new features that we had in getting this into advertisers' hands with the changes that are coming from iOS 14, we felt that the product is ready, and it was time to get this in people's hands, recognizing that there always are going to be changes to which we need to adapt. We've also already done a lot of the work to prepare for iOS 14, we announced a couple of things yesterday. One is called Twitter Click ID, which will help you attribute a click from Twitter to an advertiser's website without a cookie as the world moves away from cookies over time. And we've also implemented the SK Ad Network, which is Apple's aggregated reporting service for advertisers to see what happened. So it felt like it was time to go on MAP and also on the revamped website clicks product, but there'll be lots of improvements that will continue to come on both of those over time."

How much is kind of outside the bounds of MAP? 
Because obviously, when you talk about a doubling of revenue in Q4 in terms of kind of where you got to, I think a lot of that gets lost in sort of the delay that's happened in MAP. And so just kind of helping us understand what's in that mix would be really helpful."

As we talked about the DR roadmap, we've said, just as we've said around other parts of our service that we've worked to improve over the years, that we need to begin by fixing the foundations.

So we're not going to give guidance today on what that's going to do over the course of the year, but we feel like we've got some real strong momentum behind us with that 50% growth during the fourth quarter. And we know there's so much more that we can do for app install advertisers with this new MAP product out in the market now and over 30 improvements in it. We'll likely see easier comps in the first couple of quarters of the year and lapping that 50% growth in the fourth quarter, obviously, is going to be harder than the earlier parts of the year. 
We're going to work hard to deliver for them. And if you think about it, $300 million in the context of tens of billions of dollars spent on app install ads, we feel like there's lots of room for us with a growing audience and strong relationships already with the advertisers. 
The second part of your question around Q1. So you'll recall that the way advertisers typically approach the year, they spend the first week or 2 of the year coming back to the office and planning and thinking about where they want to show up and how they want to show up. And this year, and it's all the secular change that we've seen, which I think really benefits Twitter, that we have become the second screen for sports and for watch parties for movies and for other things where people can't necessarily be in the stadiums or in the seats the way they have been before and as dollars continue to move away from linear television. I think a lot of that accrues to our benefit. But they spend the first week or 2 thinking about where and how they want to show up. 
During that time frame, we had the riots at the Capitol. And that may have exacerbated that a bit. But as we look ahead and I'd start to look ahead with the Super Bowl this past weekend, where we were able to deliver for over 40 of the advertisers who were advertising during the game, there are a ton of great things happening that cause people to want to come together and have conversation around sports, around award ceremonies, around entertainment and other topics, and we're really excited about our ability to deliver around those things for advertisers with a larger audience, with better formats and improved relevance."

We are also not dependent upon just news and politics being what drives Twitter. 
What we're excited about especially in the future is helping everyone unlock more of the long tail of topics and interest. This is why I believe being able to follow topics and interest is so critical and so important. And we give that functionality to people as soon as they sign up for Twitter.  
 
People just spend so much time trying to find the right accounts instead of really being able to focus on what topics they're interested in. And it lends itself not to a better -- not only to a better consumption experience, but also more conversation, ultimately, and that's what we want to do. 
So while we have seen an increase in news and politics, especially in the United States, we are not a service that's dependent upon that. And as we continue to add more functionality around interest and topics, we remove more and more of that very light dependency on it. And that just gives so much power to the individual using Twitter, but it also gives a lot of power to our advertisers because it unlocks an entirely new way of advertising on Twitter and getting introductions to would-be consumers for your product or services, especially as we make local topics easy to follow and we add those topics. 
We have over 6,000 topics that you can follow today. And we're adding them as quickly as we can all around the world. So that is the one area that I'd point to really focus on because it unlocks so much in terms of our experience, but also our business."

But there'll be terrific leverage for us as well over time as we make it easier and easier for advertisers of all sizes to buy really compelling direct response ads from us when we make it easier and easier for them to buy the ads when the ads are more and more performing. It will attract not just the advertisers, but whom we work very closely who we can go in and pitch around big campaigns, but also those that know exactly what they want to do and are running highly quantified models to assess where the best places are for them to show up with their campaigns. 
And we think around website clicks and around MAP, there's a lot of that that's in front of us. But as we've said for a while now, it's important to get the product out into people's hands so that they can test and learn around it, and then allow their models to adjust. And so we hope to see a lot of that play out over the coming years as we continue to improve these products. 
You asked about e-commerce. E-commerce is on the road map. If you think about the advertiser funnel being in the middle around getting people the opportunity to click-through the website or to download an app is really important, and those have been places where we've already been able to help advertisers, but we really won't be done until we help somebody begin a purchase on the service. And you'll see us work around those things in the coming period here as we figure out the best way to do it and engineer it and deliver it to people at a time."

So nothing new to report on subscriptions today. We will continue to build out these teams and to research and also to test on Twitter, and I'm sure you all will see those tests and have the opportunity to participate or observe them. But I wouldn't expect you to see these be meaningful contributors until next year. 
Having said that, I just want to give a little perspective around subscriptions more broadly. Remember, 85% of our revenue today is showing ads to people on Twitter. And this is a hundreds of billions of dollar addressable market. And there is -- that is growing because of secular shifts and because of what's going on in the economy right now. And we see so much opportunity to deliver better and better for advertisers and to gain more and more of that market with a growing audience, with better formats, with better performance of those formats. And so we love talking about subscriptions and the potential and the durability they can provide and predictability to our revenue streams, but we also maintain a big focus around our revenue products. 
And we feel really good about the pace of innovation that we're delivering around that now where it feels like things are really accelerating on the back of our improved ad server last year, where we're shipping more and more improvements now than we've been able to in the past. Now having MAP and website clicks out as of yesterday, we'll continue to work to improve these products as well."

Jack, maybe I'd love to ask you one big philosophical question. And maybe Ned, if I could just come back on that, and I apologize to sort of belabor the point. But Jack, when you think about where Twitter is going over the medium to long term, we're talking a lot on this call about DR and identifiers and giving the advertiser an opportunity, more right than wrong. And you've written a lot about getting decentralization into the web and Bitcoin and things like that. How do you think about a parallel where parts of the web decentralized versus some parts of the web continue to centralize and how you sort of marry those views and how you think about aligning Twitter as a platform for the medium to long term? Would love your sort of philosophical and operational view on that. 
And then maybe, Ned, just to come back to MAP. I think you talked about up 50% in Q4. Can you just discern a little bit of how much of that was an easy comp in Q4 that you called out a year ago? Because it seems like to be flat on the year and up 50% in Q4. Obviously, there was a fair bit of weakness between Q4 and maybe the first half of '20. I just want to make sure we're sort of interpreting the rate of change right?"

I think the most important thing to focus on in terms of decentralizing social media is that it creates a much larger corpus of conversation. It gives many more inputs to public conversation. And the more conversation that we kind of access to, the more -- the better job we can do to surface relevant content to people. And that's where we will be competitive, is making sure that we are delivering the best out of a much, much larger corpus of conversation. 
So as we look at things that we can decentralize, this one becomes very, very obvious. The problem of discovery around content is one that is easiest when it is centralized, and that's how we've operated for almost the past 15 years. But even that has some potential to shift. And one of the things we brought up last year in our Senate testimonies in terms of where we're excited to build to address some of the problems that is facing Section 230, is giving more people choice around what relevance algorithms they're using or ranking algorithms you're using. You can imagine a more market-driven and marketplace approach to algorithms. And that is something that not only we can host but we can participate in. 
So I think the thing that gets me really excited about all of this is we will have access to a much larger conversation, have access to much more content, and we'll be able to put many more ranking algorithms that suit different people's needs on top of it. And you can imagine an app store-like view of ranking algorithms that give people ultimate flexibility in terms of how they see it. 
And that will not only help our business, but drive more people into participating in social media in the first place. So this is something we believe in, not just from an open internet standpoint, but also we believe it's important. And it really helps our business thrive in a significantly new way, given how much bigger it could be."

So it's really hard to look at the growth from one quarter in 2019 to the growth in another quarter of 2020 and assign it all just to percentages. As you can imagine, with a product that we've rebuilt with over 30 new features, many of which are already available in Q4, we need to earn the trust of the advertisers who use our service every day. And many of the advertisers who showed up in Q4 of '20 are different than the ones who showed up in 2019. Those who are the same are often advertising something different: a new game; a new rollout of a second season of a show on their streaming platform; or something else that they didn't have the year before. And so they're constantly testing and observing where they get the best performance and where they want to show up with their ad dollars. 
And so we do have -- we did have an easy comp in Q4 of '19 because we faced a number of challenges in the middle of Q3 of '19, which persisted into Q4. But we still had to go out and earn every one of those dollars with this largely rebuilt, but not completely rebuilt product in Q4. 
So as I look ahead, I feel like what's -- the question is, where do we go from here? We're going to work hard to continue to grow the size of MAP and direct response more broadly from now into the future because we know that that's an important segment for our advertising customers. We know that, that is a large and growing part of the digital ads market. So -- and we feel like we're well positioned to deliver against it with all the inputs that we've got."

And within these comments, how are you thinking about growth in the U.S.? 
And then second, bigger picture question. I know throughout the second half of last year, you took some efforts to sort of improve your data capture to maybe drive better relevancy of your ad units. Talk to us about some examples where you've improved your overall data set and you're targeting offerings for your advertisers?"

Thanks, Brian. So on mDAU first, when we forecast DAU, which whether we share with you all or not, you can imagine is an important part of the work that we do as we plan and think about how to resource things, we look at the products that we're building. We look at history and try to think through how things that have happened in the past are likely to impact the future. We look at how our retention rates have improved and evolved over time, and we try to roll those forward. We don't roll forward global pandemics. And there are certainly exogenous events that happen that are harder for us to predict. 
But when we have a base of -- a foundation on which to forecast, the numbers that we share today fall out of all the hard work we do to analyze those and think about how we roll those forward. We do think there's opportunity for us to continue to grow in the United States and outside of the United States. With hundreds of millions of people in the United States who still don't use the service every day with a very healthy top of funnel, both in the United States and outside of the United States, we have lots of that about every day to help people find what they're looking for better so that they make Twitter a part of their daily habit. 
And this group that joined us around the time that shelter-in-place began in mid-March that has stayed with us better than previous groups have, really gives us confidence that we are doing a better and better job. Jack talked about Topics and how there's real opportunity for us to surface those for people earlier in their experience. We're getting better and better at that. Not just at onboarding, but in their initial weeks with us so that we can help them have a better experience. We even within Topics have to be thoughtful about how we show somebody on the East Coast who says that they're a baseball fan, different tweets than somebody on the West Coast who is a baseball fan. And as we adapt and learn around these things, they can have a better and better impact on our ability to retain the people who come to the service all the time. 
The second part of your question was around our ability to leverage more data in order to deliver them better for advertisers. There's a lot that we've done here. I'll give you a few examples. One is, as we talked about in the past, we have taken the opportunity over the last few quarters to ask people a couple of times outside of the EU, to ask their permission to give them a more personalized experience. And this is something that we try to do in a transparent way that builds trust, that doesn't take it away, that makes it clear to people exactly what we're asking and gives them the opportunity to say, no, if they want to. These have been successful, both in terms of getting more people to choose a personalized experience, but also in terms of not having the people who said, no, not feel like we did anything untoward in how we approach them. So that's one example. 
A second one is we take a model that we use to predict how -- who ought to see a MAP ad. And we apply a learning period to it. So we give the model a chance to adjust for a few days so that it can learn from how the ads are engaged with in the early days and then adapt over time. We found that, that has helped a lot. 
And lastly, just in how people use the service as we know more and more about what they're looking for because they tell us they care about a whole topic, not just coming together the accounts that they think might inform about that topic. If they go to an event-specific time line, we know exactly what it is that they care about in a moment, as they give us signal when they search something on the service, there are more and more opportunities for us to leverage those signals, some of which we've had for a long time, but there's still opportunity to leverage better than we have in the past than others which are newer to us. We still see lots of opportunity to better utilize those to show people more and more compelling ads over time."

We still believe that over the long term, our focus on promoting more healthy conversation is a growth vector. And we definitely see the effects of that. As you mentioned, our earliest tasks were around reducing harassment, and now we are broadening our scope to misleading information. We focused on 3 areas: public health, civic integrity and manipulating media. I think, ultimately, over time, this is a problem best solved by the people using Twitter itself. So that means giving folks much better controls to perform moderation individually or as a group. 
And also, things like a beta we launched recently called Bird-watch, which allows people to add context to tweets that just give people more broader context for the things that we are not able to handle as a centralized service. So the more we can decentralize the moderation and give people better tools to curate their experience, I think it continues to be a very, very strong growth vector for growth over the long term."

And that's why, over time, you're going to see us continue to improve our existing ad formats. You're going to see us move further and further down the funnel until you can start to buy something on Twitter, where you'll see subscription opportunities for consumers and for businesses, where you'll see that SMB opportunity become bigger and bigger for us over time as we work the product opportunity and the sales side of it.

So remember, there are 3 big buckets, there are a few other things, but 3 that I focus you on, around cost of revenue. One is our infrastructure, whether it is depreciation for servers that live in our data centers or it's in quarter spend where we're sending a check to Google Cloud or eventually to AWS. And that's a very big bucket, and that's going to continue to grow over time. It will scale with things like our needs to do more and more analysis, which we do ROI analysis when we do that work to make sure that there's a payoff for it. But we tend to find that when our teams have access to better analytics and the best tools at the best cloud partners that they can do better work than they were able to previously. So that's one bucket that will grow over time. 
Second bucket is traffic acquisition costs. When revenue is higher, TAC will tend to grow with revenue. It also got a little bump in the middle of this year when we added the CrossInstall team as their revenue has TAC associated with it. 
And then the third bucket that can be more variable and is larger, is that revenue share where -- when content partners bring awesome clips and highlights to Twitter. And we split an ad dollar with them, their part of the ad dollar shows up in cost of revenue. And in a year like this, you saw few of those dollars in Q2, and you saw more of them in Q4, just the way that the event calendars shifted. 
Now remember, when we think about our profitability, we're going to be more gross profit dollar sensitive than gross margin sensitive. And so they could vary over time, and you know where our bias is. But you should see leverage when we deliver revenue outcomes like the one that we did today when you add up all the expenses to run the company."

We now expect head count growth to more closely mirror expense growth in 2021 with head count and total costs and expenses growing 25% or more on a year-over-year basis in 2021, ramping in absolute dollars over the course of the year. There are no changes to our thinking on revenue. We expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021, assuming that global pandemic continues to improve and that we see modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14.5. 
Second, on mDAU. There are no changes here either. I'll remind you that we're lapping unusual comps given the significant pandemic-related surge that we saw last year. As a result, we continue to expect mDAU growth rates to be in the low double digits on a year-over-year basis in Q2, 3 and 4, with the low point likely in Q2. 
And finally, on ATT. We've been actively preparing for the changes that Apple just released as part of iOS 14.5. Our outlook for Q2 in 2021 assumes a modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14.5 across owned and operated ads and [ MOPU ]. Long term, we're confident that our brand advertising strength and better performance products position us well to help advertisers achieve their goals. There are no changes to our long-term plans. We're laser-focused on executing against the strategy that we laid out at the Analyst Day, and we look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. 
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator?"

Remember, our business on the owned and operated side is about 85% brand and 15% direct response. On the brand side, advertisers typically come back from holidays and plan how they want to show up all year. And that means that we often get off to a slower start on the brand side. That was likely exacerbated by 2 factors. One is that the Capitol riot and the lead up to an aftermath of the inauguration in the United States, those likely slowed things down a bit. You also had events that typically show up earlier in the quarter, like the Grammys or the Oscars either happened later in the quarter or get pushed out to Q2. And so that meant that there were fewer events against which for brands to show up while they were still mapping out plans that they typically would have mapped out earlier in the year. So our brands got off to a slower start. January and February were slower, but March was strong. 
On the direct response side, that was strong all quarter. And the best evidence of that is to look at MAP, with app installs are an important part of our direct response offering. Remember, we came out with new versions of our website clicks format and of MAP in early February, and we saw accelerating revenue growth from that 50% that we shared for Q4 for MAP in Q1. 
I'll give you a fun fact. We saw the betting crypto and investing space were a great conversation on Twitter. Those MAP advertisers who advertise into those areas to have people download their apps for a crypto or investing or betting, they 10x their spend in Q1 relative to what they spent last year, demonstrating how we're benefiting from one of these strong secular trends, and we have a large and growing audience and an active conversation around the topic and a better ad format that delivers relevant ads to people. 
So those are some of the dynamics that we saw in Q1. If you play those forward to Q2, if that brand strength that we saw in March continues, that likely points us towards the higher end of the range that we provided. And that MAP strength that we saw, we think that based on those secular trends and the hard work that we've done that those can continue throughout the year, although the comps do vary at different points in the year."

So these people were seeing ads before, but we weren't able to target them appropriately to show them MAP ads and then report back to advertisers in a way that gave us confidence that we could give them good outcomes before the way that we can now. This is just one example of the work that we're doing to remediate any impact that we feel from the changes in 14.5. We think this -- when we step back from it likely has more impact on DR than it does on brand. We think it likely levels the playing field in terms of signal that people have, And we layered modest impact from ATT into the guidance that we provided for Q2."

So first, remember, COVID had a varied impact in different parts of the world, at different times of the year. And so since the COVID impact was greater in Asia and in Europe earlier in the quarter, we had easier comps internationally than we did in the United States earlier in the quarter. And that meant that on a year-over-year basis, those regions tended to perform better, which pulls up that international growth relative to what you saw in the U.S. 
That, coupled with what I described earlier to Doug's question around the brand DR mix and how brand got off to a slower start than it typically does but finished strong in March, I think that ought to explain the U.S. growth that you were asking about. 
My comment about the guidance was if you carry forward that strength that we saw in March that, that would point you towards the higher end of the range of the guidance that we provided relative to the slowness that we saw in January and February for the reasons that I started earlier. 
You asked about MAP in the second half of the year. So on a year-over-year basis, you may see the comps get trickier for MAP just because we start to lap and we were showing real improvement in the second half of last year. At the same time, on an absolute basis, we feel like we're now able to deliver ongoing improvement for MAP, where we're reaching more advertisers, where there are more high cost per install advertisers who have gained confidence that MAP can perform for them. The betting and investing in crypto spaces are really good examples of that, but they're certainly not the only ones. 
And so we'll report on the mix of brands to DR on an annual basis. We said it was 85-15 2020, brand to DR, and the long-term goal is to get to 50-50, but we haven't put a time frame on that, and we'll work hard to make our way there over time."

Or do you feel like that was short-lived? 
And then the second one, you talked about some of these categories that 10x their spend on MAP. So wondering, was that a direct function of the performance, where those are kind of untapped spenders who would have spent just as much a year ago had the performance been there and now they're seeing the performance? Like anything you can share about what's really getting them excited to spend that much more."

So first, in terms of visibility, visibility can come in lots of different forms when you think about the brand side. It can come from events that happen every year or in most typical years when there isn't a global pandemic. It can come from events that happen every 4 years. And looking at these things and thinking through how advertisers typically show up, sometimes preselling takeover products to them, which are performing much better and where we can get higher prices than we've been able to in the past against a larger audience. Sometimes it comes from an upfront that an agency or an advertiser signs with us, which is an incentive for them to spend at a certain level, which we're really pleased with how the upfront went for us, a real indication of how this growing audience and better ad formats are able to yield better results for advertisers and they're willing to commit to spend more and to incentives -- to spend more than they have in the past. 
I can also come from them contracting with us to spend around a certain thing. But then a lot of it just comes from how they spend on any given day in the auction and our ability to perform for them on any given day. What we've noticed in the past is when there is unrest for one reason or another, and last June is a great example of this, that advertisers around brand, they often pause when there's a more important conversation than the conversation around their product. When they come back, their objectives haven't changed. Their need to reach the same number of customers haven't changed. And they often should then try to do that in a shorter time frame. And so we often see a catch-up. 
So if we look at the beginning of this year and how things got off to a slower start, that doesn't give us pause about the opportunity for the rest of the year. We look at March, and we see how things can play out as economies are opening up when brands have decided how they want to show up from a brand advertising perspective and we see lots of positive momentum. 
Your second question was about these MAP advertisers and maybe what caused them to grow their spend so significantly. And I'd point to a few different trends. The first is that their topics have become a bigger conversation amongst consumers perhaps than they were in years past as betting comes to the leagues in the United States and becomes more mainstream here. I think you could say the same thing for crypto and even for retail investing. 
The second is that we have a better performing, more appealing ad formats to let them reach their audience on Twitter, where there's a great conversation around those topics. And then if it doesn't perform, they're not going to use it, but it's been performing at their high lifetime value, and that means they're willing to perhaps spend more than others have been for their ads that is performing for them, which allows them to keep coming back and spending more. 
So we're optimistic that these are secular trends that can continue for some time, but that they're also indicative of our ability to deliver for advertisers at the right moment against the right conversation on Twitter."

And then if we step back, during the Analyst Day, you talked a little bit about how e-commerce is going to be one of the new DR areas that you go after kind of after MAP. And can you just talk a little bit about the strategy for bringing in more e-commerce advertisers and what kind of time line that might happen on?

Thanks, Ross. So first, on international, there's 2 things at play. I mentioned one earlier, but if you think about them more broadly, first, it's comps are different all around the world around when COVID started to impact the geography. And COVID was a bigger impact earlier in the quarter in Asia and in Europe than it was in the United States. And so that can lead to some of this year-over-year growth that you're seeing. But so too can the MAP trend that you described, that we have some MAP-heavier markets outside of the United States. Japan, Europe are great examples of that. And that means that when MAP is performing really well and -- in January and February, for example, when brands were still showing up or deciding how they want to show up and we saw things weren't as strong as they were in March on the brand side that when MAPs carrying the day, that can be better for those markets where it's a bigger part of the business naturally. 
So those 2 things combined definitely helped us on the international side. And now that we've got things -- when we look at March and you see where we were gaining momentum on the brand side, that bodes well -- or better for the United States. 
On the e-commerce side, there are a couple of things that we should point out. The first is you'll hopefully see a steady cadence from us of improvements both on the revenue product and the consumer product side over the course of this year. I'll point to one, which is just last week, we released business profiles to hundreds of businesses where they can have a profile that's different than yours or mine might be on Twitter with their hours of operation, their phone number, a menu or something that's relevant to their business. We'll roll those out over time to more folks, and it's just a good example of the things that we need to do to continue to move further and further down funnel and help advertisers find their customers on the service."

Now you can actually pick some interest, and we can give you tweets and also accounts right in the time line. And then once you're in the time line, we will continue to introduce you 2 topics that you might follow. And then you can also use that to follow accounts long term as well. We think this is going to be a huge boost for people's experience on Twitter, and we've already seen improvement that led new customers following 33% more Topics during sign up. 
So to me, this continues to be the focus area that will pay the most dividends because it goes into the rest of our ecosystem, including things like Spaces. And Spaces is still very early. We're updating our app every week so we can iterate it very, very quickly. We've more or less published in our road map and take feedback and share of plans and designs with everyone if you follow @TwitterSpaces you can see everything we're thinking and everything that we're doing. We don't have any metrics to share right now, but we do believe it's an important part of serving conversation, one important format that complements what people do with tweets and what will complement what people will do with long-form content as well. And we're really excited about what people are doing with it, and we see new use cases nearly every day.

I wouldn't want to call out any one of them because it ought to be more like a steady drumbeat. 
As much as MAP is important though, I want to just point you more broadly to the DR opportunity for us. As we move DR from 15% of revenue -- of ads revenue to 50% over time, we need to move all the way down the funnel. You need to be able to begin a purchase on Twitter. You need to be able to know all the things about a business and for them to be able to share all the things that they want to with you so that you're comfortable transacting with them, not just learning about them, which has been such a great use case for Twitter over time as people launched new products and services and connected with what's happening. So you should keep looking for improvements on MAP, but you should also look for us continuing to move down the funnel and helping you, as an advertiser, deliver better and better outcomes."

So that's why I continue to point to topics and interest, and we continue to make a lot of progress there. The more we make easy, the more we have a larger catalog of topics, the more our machine learning algorithms take over, over time in terms of enabling more and more topics every single day around the world. It certainly benefits the U.S. and it certainly benefits our global audience. 
So I believe our core use case of answering the question what's happening, and the secondary use case I being able to talk about it are fundamental.

So everything that we're doing is really around serving those 2 core jobs and that's it. And the reason that's important is because it's a massive fundamental human behavior, and we continue to unlock parts of it as we go on."

When we look at our product road map, when we look at the way events tend to bring people to our service, both events that we know about and the steady cadence of events that we don't know about that bring people to Twitter to learn more, to discuss them, to hear from people a different perspective about those events, those things give us the confidence as we look in the past at how we've been able to drive people to the service and help them find what they're looking for. When we look at the healthy top of funnel that we've got, those people who are new to Twitter or who haven't been on Twitter for some time and are coming back, but those all present opportunities for us to grow our DAU on a compounded basis at 20% or so, which is what it will take to get to that 315 million.

So if we don't have confidence that we can deliver a relevant MAP add to somebody. We weren't showing them a MAP ad. And there was -- we weren't able to report out to advertisers the success of their campaign wit",516,"Thanks, Brian. So first, on SK Ad Network. So if we don't have confidence that we can deliver a relevant MAP add to somebody. We weren't showing them a MAP ad. And there was -- we weren't able to report out to advertisers the success of their campaign without having access to something like the SK Ad Network or something that another measurement partner in the past was able to provide to us. And so with SK Ad Network, we're able to provide better reporting to a MAP advertiser across a broader group of people than we were able to before who are using iOS. 
Now remember, MAP advertisers will have to decide in an ATT world if they're getting the data that they want in order to show their ads and deciding what price they're willing to pay in order for those ads to hit because they'll be getting aggregated or campaign-level data as opposed to device-level data. And the entire ecosystem will have to adjust to that. Certain advertisers' objectives aren't changing. They want to acquire the same number of customers. They want to know as much about them as they can, and the economics for their businesses aren't changing. So it's going to take a while for the broader ecosystem to adjust to this. And as we said, we've incorporated some modest impact from ATT into Q2, and it will take a while for us to know exactly how this is all going to play out. 
The second part of your question was about the number of MAP advertisers. So increasing the number of advertisers on Twitter is an important objective for us over time. But it's not going to be the best measure of near-term success because there are so many large advertisers with whom, whether it's MAP or brand ads or DR more broadly, where we have strong relationships with them already. But with a larger audience of better formats with more relevance that we can deliver even better outcomes for them and a better ROI than we could before, and they can, therefore, put more dollars against Twitter than they could before. 
And so MAP could easily grow, the brand side of the business could easily grow really nicely without you seeing the number of advertisers growing meaningfully. Now over time, it's an important objective for us to grow the number of advertisers, and that's why we staffed the product and engineering and the sales teams on the SMB side so that we can help those smaller businesses find their customers, help them understand the use case to advertise on Twitter, help them launch their campaigns because it's a different dynamic to help an advertiser launch a campaign than it is to help an entrepreneur who is running a small business down the street launch their campaign. And as Jack has talked about before, things like Topics should really help bring those small businesses closer to their customers over time on Twitter, but number of advertisers might not be the best near-term measure although over time, it will be important."

One is that when you grow expenses, 20% or so in Q1 and you continue to grow head count in Q2. You've got a larger expense base, and you can tell from our guidance the range of outcomes for revenue. So you're matching a steadily growing expense base with that revenue base that falls out of the revenue guidance. But if you think about the things underneath that, one, we'll continue to hire at a steady pace, and we're lapping a period where we didn't grow head count as quickly in Q2 of last year when we were adjusting to this shelter in place and hire people from home environment. At this point, we actually have over 1,500 people who work at Twitter who have never met their manager in person and were onboarded from their homes. 
When you add that with some of the recent acquisitions that we've done with the share grants, the annual refreshes that we do that happen in Q2 that have an outsized impact on Q2's P&L because they start to vest in Q2 as well. So you have a little catch up. We had the same dynamic last year as we granted the same way. And as long as we're granting this way, you should expect the same thing to continue that the biggest absolute dollar increase in stock-based compensation will happen from Q1 to Q2 because of those refresh grants. So those are some of the things that I'd point you to, Colin. I'll turn to Jack for the second part."

But the goal is like for any engineer to come in and to be able to get up to speed within 2 to 3 weeks and be able to push production and for any idea that we can get it out within a matter of a month so we can experiment and we can learn and we can iterate as best as possible. So we are on the track. We are on track to do that. And we're definitely seeing it in some of our consumer products, and we're definitely going to see a lot more of it in the revenue product. 
The -- on the commerce side and subscription, we are going to see those products live hopefully very, very soon. And we're excited to learn from them. They're not going to be fully complete.

I think that's spot on, whether it's the Olympics, which we've been talking to advertisers and agencies about for over a year now. We've got a great relationship with NBCUniversal to make sure that the medal moments and the highlights are on Twitter and near real-time because there'll be conversation around those things, and we can go find advertisers who want to sponsor those highlights; or the Euro Cup, which is coming up soon. These things may be happening in a different way than they have in the past, but the conversation on Twitter continues to be really rich around them. 
It's true for award ceremonies as well, where sometimes there are fewer people watching them on TV, but the conversation on Twitter continues to be robust. These will continue to be great conversation pieces for us with partners as we talk about how they can launch their new products and services, many of which there's pent-up supply for because they waited to launch things and connect with what's happening because that will inevitably be more happening. 
At the same time, as those are important conversation starters with advertisers and agencies, as we continue to move closer and closer to 50-50 brand to direct response, those conversations with advertisers will be important, but so too will be us delivering this really easy-to-measure, awesome outcomes on the direct response side where there'll be important conversations with those advertisers that they'll be able to measure their success directly by their performance and of their downloads and purchases that are started on Twitter."

This continues to be the fastest and best way to get value out of Twitter immediately. We're also moving faster and made talking on Twitter better with Twitter Spaces, our audio conversations products, being our newest division. We expanded the feature to Android, and we're shipping weekly iOS updates with a focus on giving hosts more controls and moderation tools as well as better discovery and reliability.
Our revenue products were moving faster than ever before, building out a suite of products that positively reinforce one another. MAP is the first step, unlocking revenue opportunities in direct response with large and small businesses alike. In Q1, we launched our rebuilt App Installs and website click offerings, improved the viewer experience for ads across Twitter Amplify and improved brand safety with the launch of conversation controls for advertisers. We also launched curated categories, a brand-safe way for advertisers to run pre-roll ads exclusively against premium video content.

As Jack mentioned, Q1 was a solid start to the year. Total revenue reached $1.04 billion, up 28% year-over-year. Total ads revenue grew 32% year-over-year driven by strong brand advertising in March and accelerating year-over-year growth in MAP. mDAU grew 20%, in line with the outlook that we shared in February. Overall, we're benefiting from a growing audience, better ad formats, improved relevance and strong secular trends.
Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to touch on 3 topics. First, like our performance, hiring is off to a great start. We're attracting more great people to Twitter than ever before and investing in our highest priorities to deliver on our long-term goals across consumer products, revenue products and platform. We now expect head count growth to more closely mirror expense growth in 2021 with head count and total costs and expenses growing 25% or more on a year-over-year basis in 2021, ramping in absolute dollars over the course of the year. There are no changes to our thinking on revenue. We expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021, assuming the global pandemic continues to improve and that we see modest impacts from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14.5.
Second, on mDAU. There are no changes here either. I'll remind you that we're lapping unusual comps given the significant pandemic-related surge that we saw last year. As a result, we continue to expect mDAU growth rates to be in the low double digits on a year-over-year basis in Q2, 3 and 4 with the low point likely in Q2.
And finally, on ATT. We've been actively preparing for the changes that Apple just released as part of iOS 14.5. Our outlook for Q2 in 2021 assumes a modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14.5 across owned and operated ads and MoPub. Long term, we're confident that our brand advertising strength and better performance products position us well to help advertisers achieve their goals. There are no changes to our long-term plans. We're laser-focused on executing against the strategy that we laid out at the Analyst Day, and we look forward to updating you on our progress along the way.
With that, let's move to Q&A. Operator?"

Remember, our business on the owned and operated side is about 85% brand and 15% direct response. On the brand side, advertisers typically come back from holidays and plan how they want to show up all year, and that means that we often get off to a slower start on the brand side. That was likely exacerbated by 2 factors. One is that the Capitol riot and the lead up to and aftermath of the inauguration in the United States, those likely slowed things down a bit.
We also had events that typically show up earlier in the quarter, like the GRAMMYs or the Oscars, either happened later in the quarter or get pushed out to Q2. And so that meant that there were fewer events against which for brands to show up while they were still mapping out plans that they typically would have mapped out earlier in the year. So our brands got off to a slower start. January and February were slower, but March was strong.
On the direct response side, that was strong all quarter. And the best evidence of that is to look at MAP, with App Installs are an important part of our direct response offering. Remember, we came out with new versions of our website clicks format and of MAP in early February, and we saw accelerating revenue growth from that 50% that we shared for Q4 for MAP in Q1.
I'll give you a fun fact. We saw the betting, crypto and investing space were there's great conversation on Twitter. Those MAP advertisers who advertise into those areas to have people download their apps for a crypto or investing or betting, they 10x-ed their spend in Q1 relative to what they spent last year, demonstrating how we're benefiting from one of these strong secular trends. And we have a large and growing audience and an active conversation around the topic and a better ad format that delivers relevant ads to people.
So those are some of the dynamics that we saw in Q1. If you play those forward to Q2, if that brand strength that we saw in March continues, that likely points us towards the higher end of the range that we provided. And that MAP strength that we saw, we think that based on those secular trends and the hard work that we've done that those can continue throughout the year, although the comps do vary at different points in the year."

Sorry, Doug. So when you implement the SKAdNetwork and you can provide advertisers with aggregated data on how their campaigns performed, because of the way that we were leveraging the signal that we were getting from iOS, we just now have access to over 30% more people to show MAP ads. So these people were seeing ads before, but we weren't able to target them appropriately to show them MAP ads and then report back to advertisers in a way that gave us confidence that we could give them good outcomes before the way that we can now.
This is just one example of the work that we're doing to remediate any impact that we feel from the changes in 14.5. We think this, when we step back from it, likely has more impact on DR than it does on brand. We think it likely levels the playing field in terms of signal that people have, and we layered modest impact from ATT into the guidance that we provided for Q2."

So first, remember, COVID had a varied impact in different parts of the world at different times of the year. And so since the COVID impact was greater in Asia and in Europe earlier in the quarter, we had easier comps internationally than we did in the United States earlier in the quarter. And that meant that on a year-over-year basis, those regions tended to perform better, which pulls up that international growth relative to what you saw in the U.S. That, coupled with what I described earlier to Doug's question around the brand-DR mix and how brand got off to a slower start than it typically does but finished strong in March, I think that ought to explain the U.S. growth that you were asking about.
My comment about the guidance was if you carry forward that strength that we saw in March that, that would point you towards the higher end of the range of the guidance that we provided relative to the slowness that we saw in January and February for the reasons that I described earlier. You asked about MAP in the second half of the year. So on a year-over-year basis, you may see the comps get trickier for MAP just because we start to lap and we were showing real improvement in the second half of last year.
At the same time, on an absolute basis, we feel like we're now able to deliver ongoing improvement for MAP where we're reaching more advertisers, where there are more high cost per install advertisers who have gained confidence that MAP can perform for them. The betting and investing and crypto spaces are really good examples of that, but they're certainly not the only ones. And so we'll report on the mix of brand to DR on an annual basis. We said it was 85-15 for 2020, brand to DR, and the long-term goal is to get to 50-50, but we haven't put a time frame on that and we'll work hard to make our way there over time."

So first, in terms of visibility, visibility can come in lots of different forms when you think about the brand side. It can come from events that happen every year or in most typical years when there isn't a global pandemic, it can come from events that happen every 4 years. And looking at these things and thinking through how advertisers typically show up, sometimes preselling takeover products to them, which are performing much better and where we can get higher prices than we've been able to in the past against a larger audience. Sometimes it comes from an upfront that an agency or an advertiser signs with us, which is an incentive for them to spend at a certain level, which we're really pleased with how the upfront went for us, a real indication of how this growing audience and better ad formats are able to yield better results for advertisers and they're willing to commit to spend more and to [ incent us ] to spend more than they have in the past.
It can also come from them contracting with us to spend around a certain thing. But then a lot of it just comes from how they spend on any given day in the auction and our ability to perform for them on any given day. What we've noticed in the past is when there is unrest for one reason or another, and last June is a great example of this, that advertisers around brand, they often pause when there's a more important conversation than the conversation around their product. When they come back, their objectives haven't changed. Their need to reach the same number of customers haven't changed, and they often should then try to do that in a shorter time frame. And so we often see a catch-up. So if we look at the beginning of this year and how things got off to a slower start, that doesn't give us pause about the opportunity for the rest of the year. We look at March and we see how things can play out as economies are opening up when brands have decided how they want to show up from a brand advertising perspective and we see lots of positive momentum.
Your second question was about these MAP advertisers and maybe what caused them to grow their spend so significantly, and I'd point to a few different trends. The first is that their topics have become a bigger conversation amongst consumers perhaps than they were in years past, as betting comes to the leagues in the United States and becomes more mainstream here. I think you could say the same thing for crypto and even for retail investing.
The second is that we have a better performing, more appealing ad format to let them reach their audience on Twitter where there's great conversation around those topics. And then if it doesn't perform, they're not going to use it. But it's been performing at their high lifetime value, and that means they're willing to perhaps spend more than others have been for their ads that is performing for them, which allows them to keep coming back and spending more. So we're optimistic that these are secular trends that can continue for some time, but that they're also indicative of our ability to deliver for advertisers at the right moment against the right conversation on Twitter."

So first, on international, there's 2 things at play. I mentioned one earlier. But if you think about them more broadly, first, it's comps are different all around the world around when COVID started to impact the geography, and COVID was a bigger impact earlier in the quarter in Asia and in Europe than it was in the United States. And so that can lead to some of this year-over-year growth that you're seeing. But so too can the MAP trend that you described that we have some MAP-heavier markets outside the United States. Japan, Europe are great examples of that.
And that means that when MAP is performing really well and -- in January and February, for example, when brands were still showing up or deciding how they want to show up and we saw things weren't as strong as they were in March on the brand side, that when MAPs [ carrying ] the day, that can be better for those markets where it's a bigger part of the business naturally. So those 2 things combined definitely helped us on the international side. And now that we've got things -- when we look at March and you see where we were gaining momentum on the brand side, that bodes well -- or better for the United States.
On the e-commerce side, there are a couple of things that we should point out. The first is you'll hopefully see a steady cadence from us of improvements both on the revenue product and the consumer product side over the course of this year. I'll point to one, which is just last week, we released business profiles to hundreds of businesses where they can have a profile that's different than yours or mine might be on Twitter with their hours of operation, their phone number, a menu or something that's relevant to their business. We'll roll those out over time to more folks, and it's just a good example of the things that we need to do to continue to move further and further down funnel and help advertisers find their customers on the service."

And then once you're in the timeline, we will continue to introduce you 2 topics that you might follow, and then you can also use that to follow accounts long term as well. We think this is going to be a huge boost for people's experience on Twitter, and we've already seen an improvement that led new customers following 33% more topics during sign up.
So to me, this continues to be the focus area that will pay the most dividends because it goes into the rest of our ecosystem, including things like Spaces. And Spaces is still very early. We're updating our app every week so we can iterate it very, very quickly. We've more or less published a road map and take feedback and share our plans and designs with everyone. If you follow @TwitterSpaces, you can see everything we're thinking and everything that we're doing. We don't have any metrics to share right now.

I wouldn't want to call out any one of them because it ought to be more like a steady drumbeat.
As much as MAP is important, though, I want to just point you more broadly to the DR opportunity for us. As we move DR from 15% of revenue -- of ads revenue to 50% over time, we need to move all the way down the funnel. You need to be able to begin a purchase on Twitter. You need to be able to know all the things about a business and for them to be able to share all the things that they want to with you so that you're comfortable transacting with them, not just learning about them, which has been such a great use case for Twitter over time as people launched new products and services and connected with what's happening.

The reason why is I look at the use case and the use case are just asking the question what's happening [ under these use case ]. Everyone has that question, and everyone wants to be informed. And where we have failed in serving that use case is not enabling people to get to what they're interested in fast enough. So that's why I continue to point to topics and interest, and we continue to make a lot of progress there. The more we make that easy, the more we have a larger catalog of topics, the more our machine learning algorithms take over, over time in terms of enabling more and more topics every single day around the world, it certainly benefits the U.S. and it certainly benefits our global audience.
So I believe our core use case of answering the question what's happening and the secondary use case of being able to talk about it are fundamental. And it's just a question of making sure that we provide the easiest flow in order to do that. And that when people do come into Twitter for particular events that they see around them, that we are able to retain them. And that is the whole thesis behind topics and interests is you came in for COVID, but there's so much more in terms of these niche topics that you can follow now and be updated on regularly and then also [ person ] to talk about it. So everything that we're doing is really around serving those 2 core jobs and that's it. And the reason that's important is because it's a massive fundamental human behavior, and we continue to unlock parts of it as we go on."

When we look at our product road map, when we look at the way events tend to bring people to our service, both events that we know about and the steady cadence of events that we don't know about that bring people to Twitter to learn more, to discuss them, to hear from people a different perspective about those events, those things give us the confidence as we look in the past at how we've been able to drive people to the service and help them find what they're looking for. When we look at the healthy top of funnel that we've got, those people who are new to Twitter or who haven't been on Twitter for some time and are coming back, but those all present opportunities for us to grow our DAU on a compounded basis at 20% or so, which is what it will take to get to that 315 million.

So if we don't have confidence that we can deliver a relevant MAP ad to somebody, we weren't showing them a MAP ad.

So if we don't have confidence that we can deliver a relevant MAP ad to somebody, we weren't showing them a MAP ad. And there was -- we weren't able to report out to advertisers the success of their campaign without having access to something like the SKAdNetwork or something that another measurement partner in the past was able to provide to us. And so with SKAdNetwork, we're able to provide better reporting to a MAP advertiser across a broader group of people than we were able to before who are using iOS.
Now remember, MAP advertisers will have to decide in an ATT world if they're getting the data that they want in order to show their ads and deciding what price they're willing to pay in order for those ads to hit because they'll be getting aggregated or campaign-level data as opposed to device-level data and the entire ecosystem will have to adjust to that. Certain advertisers' objectives aren't changing. They want to acquire the same number of customers. They want to know as much about them as they can, and the economics for their businesses aren't changing. So it's going to take a while for the broader ecosystem to adjust to this. And as we said, we've incorporated some modest impact from ATT into Q2, and it will take a while for us to know exactly how this is all going to play out.
The second part of your question was about the number of MAP advertisers. So increasing the number of advertisers on Twitter is an important objective for us over time. But it's not going to be the best measure of near-term success because there are so many large advertisers with whom, whether it's MAP or brand ads or DR more broadly, where we have strong relationships with them already. But with a larger audience of better formats with more relevance, that we can deliver even better outcomes for them and a better ROI than we could before, and they can therefore put more dollars against Twitter than they could before.
And so MAP could easily grow. The brand side of the business could easily grow really nicely without you seeing the number of advertisers growing meaningfully. Now over time, it's an important objective for us to grow the number of advertisers, and that's why we staffed the product and engineering and the sales teams on the SMB side so that we can help those smaller businesses find their customers, help them understand the use case to advertise on Twitter, help them launch their campaigns because it's a different dynamic to help an advertiser launch a campaign than it is to help an entrepreneur who is running a small business down the street launch their campaign. And as Jack has talked about before, things like topics should really help bring those small businesses closer to their customers over time on Twitter, but number of advertisers might not be the best near-term measure, although over time, it will be important."

One is that when you grow expenses 20% or so in Q1 and you continue to grow head count in Q2, you've got a larger expense base and you can tell from our guidance the range of outcomes for revenue. So you're matching a steadily growing expense base with that revenue base that falls out of the revenue guidance. But if you think about the things underneath that, one, we'll continue to hire at a steady pace, and we're lapping a period where we didn't grow head count as quickly in Q2 of last year when we were adjusting to this shelter in place and hire-people-from-home environment.
At this point, we actually have over 1,500 people who work at Twitter who have never met their manager in person and were onboarded from their homes. When you add that with some of the recent acquisitions that we've done with the share grants, the annual refreshes that we do that happen in Q2 that have an outsized impact on Q2's P&L because they start to vest in Q2 as well. So you have a little catch up. We had the same dynamic last year as we granted the same way. And as long as we're granting this way, you should expect the same thing to continue that the biggest absolute dollar increase in stock-based compensation will happen from Q1 to Q2 because of those refresh grants. So those are some of the things that I'd point you to, Colin. I'll turn to Jack for the second part."

I think that's spot on whether it's the Olympics, which we've been talking to advertisers and agencies about for over a year now. We've got a great relationship with NBCUniversal to make sure that the medal moments and the highlights are on Twitter in near real-time because there'll be conversation around those things, and we can go find advertisers who want to sponsor those highlights; or the Euro Cup, which is coming up soon.
These things may be happening in a different way than they have in the past, but the conversation on Twitter continues to be really rich around them. It's true for award ceremonies as well where sometimes there are fewer people watching them on TV but the conversation on Twitter continues to be robust. These will continue to be great conversation pieces for us with partners as we talk about how they can launch their new products and services, many of which there's pent-up supply for because they waited to launch things and connect with what's happening because there will inevitably be more happening.
At the same time, as those are important conversation starters with advertisers and agencies, as we continue to move closer and closer to 50-50 brand to direct response, those conversations with advertisers will be important, but so, too, will be us delivering this really easy-to-measure, awesome outcomes on the direct response side where there'll be important conversations with those advertisers that they'll be able to measure their success directly by the performance of their downloads and purchases that are started on Twitter."

Every single person in the world has some need for at least the first 2 and [ pre fully deferred. ] Building a model like this is an easier [ fast ] and its deliberateness ensures resilience and ever-increasing global value. 
There are 3 trends relevant to Twitter and you, our shareholders: AI; decentralization; and the Internet finally having access to a global native currency in Bitcoin. All these will help our do our jobs better, and we intend to lead the way in each. 
With AI and machine learning, we increased relevance and discovery, a long-standing issue on Twitter, which we're improving every day, from sign-up to in-app sessions. The decentralization will increase the size of the corpus of conversation we have access to and improve conversational health by giving more people -- more power to individuals. 
And with the global currency, we can ensure people and companies can freely trade goods and services anywhere on the planet. The ecosystem model will enable an experience for an individual or company of any size, can tweet, reply, move to an audio chat, build a following, write a newsletter, charge for content and eventually sell a service or good, all in 1 simple flow. Each part of this cycle will positively reinforce other parts and build upon itself. I've seen this work elsewhere, and it will work even more for Twitter. 
Along the way, we're going to try things to end up not being a fit. We're going to be fast to recognize this and take action without hesitation, as we did with Fleets. There are better solutions to the problem we are trying to solve on the stories format everyone has adopted. Entirely new formats that are unique to Twitter and our model, this is what we're striving to create.  Expect us to start and stop many more features than we have in the past. 
That's all for me for now. I want to thank you all for your continued trust and belief as we do our work. Ned?"

As Jack noted, Q2 was a strong quarter, particularly for advertising. We exited March with momentum across both brand and DR, and April trends continued to improve with ongoing strength throughout the quarter across all major products and geographies. 
A growing audience, better ad products, strong sales execution, global events, and advertiser product launches all had a big impact on our performance. As it all, we exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 10% or approximately $110 million. In our guidance, we equally weighted the slower start to the year that we saw in January and February in brand with a strong return to brand spend that we saw in March, which was, in hindsight, too conservative. The impact to ATT on the second quarter was also more muted than we expected, although it's too early to assess the long-term impact. 
mDAU grew 11% year-over-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter, in line with historical seasonal trends and the outlook we provided in April. Within our global mDAU growth of 11%, our sequential growth in the U.S. may get some attention. Here are some context. In the 3 years prior to COVID, reported quarter-over-quarter growth for U.S. mDAU in the second quarter has ranged from $1 million up to $1 million down. So our performance this year is relatively consistent with this historical range despite an atypical backdrop, which includes better news cycles in the U.S. as well as the beginning of reopening across many communities where consumer behavior likely has not yet normalized. 
While it's too early to tell how people's behavior may change and as some economies reopen, while others are still struggling, I'd remind you that sequential growth for U.S. mDAU in Q3 over the last 4 years has ranged from flat to up 1 million, suggesting U.S. mDAU could be flat on a sequential basis in Q3 of '21. The good news is that we're confident in our ability to accelerate growth longer term. And in the near term, these same trends have been great for advertisers with a return to global events, product launches and our better ad products, all driving improved advertiser ROI and our ability to deliver strong results. 
And there are no changes to our thinking about mDAU over the course of the year. We continue to expect low double-digit year-over-year growth in Q3 and Q4 with the low point likely now behind us. 
Given the momentum we're seeing as we enter the second half of the year, we're updating our thinking on investment and revenue. Our expectations for 25% or more expense growth in 2021 and revenue growing faster than expenses now appears too low. We are accelerating our investments and now expect the headcount along with total costs and expenses to grow 30% or more for the full year with a focus on engineering and products. As you'd expect, incremental headcount investments in 2021 will flow into our annual expense base in 2022.  
With regard to revenue, we continue to expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021, assuming the global pandemic continues to improve and that we continue to see modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14.5. 
You also may have noticed in our Shareholder Letter that we purchased $334 million of Twitter shares in Q2, a little more than twice the amount we repurchased in Q1, reflecting the pullback in share price we saw in early May. We'll continue to be thoughtful and nimble as we move forward, likely varying our pace based on the operating environment, our capital needs and market conditions. 
In summary, we're pleased with our results and the momentum we see as we enter the second half of the year. And with that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

In terms of MAP, we feel really good about our progress there. With our revamped product out in February, we began to see some strong momentum there, and that momentum continued into Q2. 
I'll give you a couple of fun facts. The streamers, as they continue to grow their business and launch new shows and get people interested in their services, they grew their spend over 40% sequentially with Twitter in Q2. We -- we are piloting a playables ad format for gamers, so that you can play a game inside of [indiscernible] inside of MAP, so you can send people to different, different places.

This is just a great way to engage people who use Twitter where they could be able to come to Twitter and find the medal moments right after they happen. The highlights will be there. There will be pre-roll in front of them from advertisers who have been waiting for this opportunity to connect with their customers around a big global event like this. 
I'd point you back to last year where there were a lot of events that happened where fans weren't in the stands. Twitter took the place of the stand. It was the war of the crowd. It was one of the fewer places where advertisers could connect with their customers and know that they'd be there. So we've been working hard to make sure that this can be a success for us. It's going to be [indiscernible] how it plays out. We haven't broken it out in terms of how we quantify it. We tend to do that

less these days because it you've got to judge how much of spend is truly incremental. There's some subjectivity in that. And I don't think we'd do it justice. But when we step back from  
[Audio Gap]
the dollars and the specific audience on a given day, this is a great opportunity to showcase for people how much better Twitter is when the last time they came, if that was the World Cup or the Olympics or a different event as opposed to them having Twitter as a part of their daily habit. And the same thing is true for advertisers. So we're really looking forward to -- the Olympics didn't go on with the opening ceremony here shortly. 
The second part of your question on ATT or IDFA. So far, we're pleased with what we've seen, but it's too early to call a long-term trend. I point you to a few things that when they're prompted from Twitter and we give them a really clear explanation of what we're asking, hopefully, that means they're more likely to accept the prompt from us than they might be from others. Second, we worked really hard to implement the SKI network to give that data to third-party measurement partners to now show MAP ads to people who have limited ad tracking on, to continue to work on place that we can help attribution with in a post-cookie world. I think all these things are helping us a bunch with advertisers and with the people who use our service. But given it's really not been that long here, not everybody is upgraded and agencies and advertisers and the broader ecosystem likely hasn't fully adjusted yet.

The original problem we were trying to solve was -- with Fleets was around [indiscernible] and helping people feel comfortable sharing something that they don't have to worry about being on their public record forever.

And how should we think about the potential here? We look at the -- across the Pacific. And things like gifting are very significant revenue contributors to the Chinese social networks. And we're -- people obviously want to compensate great services. So I can see some match here. How should we think about that and the revenue impact of these types of new products scale over time? And kind of along these lines, rounding up the business model considerations.

If the creator is creating great content and you see it in Super Follows, or it's just a tweet and somebody puts money in their tip jar, or it's long-form content that we include in a different price point for a subscription without ads that's complemented with other features that come from us, then we would make sure that the part of the value that can be attributed to the creator where those dollars go to them and when we're facilitating a transaction.

They'll continue to create great free content, and they will also create great paid content as well. And if there's lots of good things happening on Twitter, there'll be great ways for us to monetize the service, whether it be ads, subscriptions or otherwise.

We definitely incorporated too much at the beginning of the quarter into our guidance when we guided for Q2. Where we got off to a slower start in terms of brand in January and February and March, we saw strength, and we equal weighted them in the guidance. And that strength from March really continued throughout Q2. So much for the crystal ball. 
On the second part of your question about pricing. There are lots of different factors that play into pricing. And so as you've seen in the past with us, if you go back to 2018 as an example, there are times where cost per engagement can go down dramatically and revenue growth can be pretty significant. And I point that out because as you think about the mix of brand versus DR, as you think about what the threshold is for something to be a click, we're now actually at the point where more than half of the videos that you see on Twitter in ads are 15 seconds or less. It's taken us a long time to get there. The likelihood that those -- that we and -- that we get paid for them, that the advertiser realizes their objective is higher than it is for longer videos typically. This is a great example of something that can throw a wrench in comparables when you look at ad engagements or cost per engagement. And so I'd focus less on the pricing and more on the return on investment for the advertiser. And when we're improving at the age-based targeting, location-based targeting, improving the formats, growing the audience, and hopefully there are lots of ways that can play out well for advertisers. Some of them include pricing being higher, but others where pricing is meaningfully lower, and they're just getting more reach and more return and therefore, invest even more against our growing audience."

And those advertisers spending more than they had in previous periods broadly and hopefully as well on Twitter. Over time, we do think we can grow the number of advertisers on our service, both because we can show incredible value proposition to lots of medium-sized advertisers who haven't historically advertised with us, where our sales team can continue to do a great job growing the dollars spent by some small businesses, but also where the work we're doing around topics, the work we're doing on quick promote, the work we're doing to make it easier to buy ads and see the return from those ads for small advertisers will help us meaningfully grow the number of advertisers. There are millions of small businesses on Twitter today, but most of them don't yet advertise because we haven't made a good case to them what the value proposition is or made it easy for them to do it. 
So I think the benefits of growing the advertiser base are in front of us.

Total revenue hit $1.19 billion, with ad revenue up 87% year-over-year driven by faster shipping cadence, strong sales execution and a broad increase in advertiser demand. Average monetizable DAU reached 206 million, up 11% year-over-year, in line with our outlook and historical seasonal trends. 
We intend to build an ecosystem of connected features and services focused on serving 3 core jobs: News, which is what's happening; discussion, conversation; and helping people get paid. Every single person in the world has some need for at least the first 2 and [ pre fully deferred. ] Building a model like this is an easier [ fast ] and its deliberateness ensures resilience and ever-increasing global value. 
There are 3 trends relevant to Twitter and you, our shareholders: AI; decentralization; and the Internet finally having access to a global native currency in Bitcoin. All these will help our do our jobs better, and we intend to lead the way in each. 
With AI and machine learning, we increased relevance and discovery, a long-standing issue on Twitter, which we're improving every day, from sign-up to in-app sessions. The decentralization will increase the size of the corpus of conversation we have access to and improve conversational health by giving more people -- more power to individuals. 
And with the global currency, we can ensure people and companies can freely trade goods and services anywhere on the planet. The ecosystem model will enable an experience for an individual or company of any size, can tweet, reply, move to an audio chat, build a following, write a newsletter, charge for content and eventually sell a service or good, all in 1 simple flow. Each part of this cycle will positively reinforce other parts and build upon itself. I've seen this work elsewhere, and it will work even more for Twitter. 
Along the way, we're going to try things to end up not being a fit. We're going to be fast to recognize this and take action without hesitation, as we did with Fleets. There are better solutions to the problem we are trying to solve on the stories format everyone has adopted. Entirely new formats that are unique to Twitter and our model, this is what we're striving to create.  Expect us to start and stop many more features than we have in the past. 
That's all for me for now. I want to thank you all for your continued trust and belief as we do our work. Ned?"

As Jack noted, Q2 was a strong quarter, particularly for advertising. We exited March with momentum across both brand and DR, and April trends continued to improve with ongoing strength throughout the quarter across all major products and geographies. 
A growing audience, better ad products, strong sales execution, global events, and advertiser product launches all had a big impact on our performance. As it all, we exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 10% or approximately $110 million. In our guidance, we equally weighted the slower start to the year that we saw in January and February in brand with a strong return to brand spend that we saw in March, which was, in hindsight, too conservative. The impact to ATT on the second quarter was also more muted than we expected, although it's too early to assess the long-term impact. 
mDAU grew 11% year-over-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter, in line with historical seasonal trends and the outlook we provided in April. Within our global mDAU growth of 11%, our sequential growth in the U.S. may get some attention. Here are some context. In the 3 years prior to COVID, reported quarter-over-quarter growth for U.S. mDAU in the second quarter has ranged from $1 million up to $1 million down. So our performance this year is relatively consistent with this historical range despite an atypical backdrop, which includes better news cycles in the U.S. as well as the beginning of reopening across many communities where consumer behavior likely has not yet normalized. 
While it's too early to tell how people's behavior may change and as some economies reopen, while others are still struggling, I'd remind you that sequential growth for U.S. mDAU in Q3 over the last 4 years has ranged from flat to up 1 million, suggesting U.S. mDAU could be flat on a sequential basis in Q3 of '21. The good news is that we're confident in our ability to accelerate growth longer term. And in the near term, these same trends have been great for advertisers with a return to global events, product launches and our better ad products, all driving improved advertiser ROI and our ability to deliver strong results. 
And there are no changes to our thinking about mDAU over the course of the year. We continue to expect low double-digit year-over-year growth in Q3 and Q4 with the low point likely now behind us. 
Given the momentum we're seeing as we enter the second half of the year, we're updating our thinking on investment and revenue. Our expectations for 25% or more expense growth in 2021 and revenue growing faster than expenses now appears too low. We are accelerating our investments and now expect the headcount along with total costs and expenses to grow 30% or more for the full year with a focus on engineering and products. As you'd expect, incremental headcount investments in 2021 will flow into our annual expense base in 2022.  
With regard to revenue, we continue to expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021, assuming the global pandemic continues to improve and that we continue to see modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14.5. 
You also may have noticed in our Shareholder Letter that we purchased $334 million of Twitter shares in Q2, a little more than twice the amount we repurchased in Q1, reflecting the pullback in share price we saw in early May. We'll continue to be thoughtful and nimble as we move forward, likely varying our pace based on the operating environment, our capital needs and market conditions. 
In summary, we're pleased with our results and the momentum we see as we enter the second half of the year. And with that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

When you take that in the context of a slower news cycle in the U.S. and people coming out of shelter in place and many communities in the U.S. and you keep in mind that they likely haven't normalized their habits, those who -- for Twitter is a new part of their daily ritual, and those who are already Twitter faithful are active people beforehand.

If the Internet has a native currency, a global currency, we are able to move so much faster with products such as Super Follows, commerce, subscription, tip jar, and we can reach every single person on the planet because of that, instead of going down it market-by-market approach. I think this is a big part of our future. I think there's a lot of it to be had, especially as we think about decentralizing social media more and providing more economic incentive. And to Twitter shareholders that we continue to look at the space and invest aggressively in it. I'm not alone here. I mean what Facebook is trying to do with Libra or DM or I'm not sure what they're calling that right now, but there's an obvious need for this and appreciation for standard that's made me see that it's the right way to go, which is why my focus and our focus should be on Bitcoin.

One, when we think about an inflection point in terms of the number of advertisers on Twitter, that's in front of us. The work we're doing in SMB, which had another strong quarter, so far has been to help grow the spend from the existing customers while we put a pilot for is going well, but more work to do there. And while we continue to make it easier for small businesses with a new version and to help them understand the value proposition of doing so. 
In terms of MAP, we feel really good about our progress there. With our revamped product out in February, we began to see some strong momentum there, and that momentum continued into Q2. 
I'll give you a couple of fun facts. The streamers, as they continue to grow their business and launch new shows and get people interested in their services, they grew their spend over 40% sequentially with Twitter in Q2. We -- we are piloting a playable ad format for gamers, so that you can play a game inside of an ad. We have multi-destination carousels inside of MAP, so you can send people to different, different places. These are great examples of some of the innovation. When you add those up with better age-based, better location-based targeting to those folks who had limit ad tracking on before what we couldn't report on them ad network, we made really good progress here and feel like we've got the wind at our backs on MAP going into the second half."

So first on the Olympics, we're really excited about the Olympics. One, from an audience perspective. This is just a great way to engage people who use Twitter where they could be able to come to Twitter and find the medal moments right after they happen. The highlights will be there. There will be pre-roll in front of them from advertisers who have been waiting for this opportunity to connect with their customers around a big global event like this. 
I'd point you back to last year where there were a lot of events that happened where fans weren't in the stands. Twitter took the place of the stand. It was the war of the crowd. It was one of the fewer places where advertisers could connect with their customers and know that they'd be there. So we've been working hard to make sure that this can be a success for us. It's going to be an Olympics unlike any other, and it's still uncertain exactly how it plays out. 
We haven't broken it out in terms of how we quantify it. We tend to do that less these days because it you've got to judge how much of spend is truly incremental. There's some subjectivity in that. And I don't think we'd do it justice. But when we step back from the dollars and the specific audience on a given day, this is a great opportunity to showcase for people how much better Twitter is when the last time they came, if that was the World Cup or the Olympics or a different event as opposed to them having Twitter as a part of their daily habit. And the same thing is true for advertisers. So we're really looking forward to -- the Olympics didn't go on with the opening ceremony here shortly. 
The second part of your question on ATT or IDFA. So far, we're pleased with what we've seen, but it's too early to call a long-term trend. I point you to a few things that when they're prompted from Twitter and we give them a really clear explanation of what we're asking, hopefully, that means they're more likely to accept the prompt from us than they might be from others. Second, we worked really hard to implement the SKI network to give that data to third-party measurement partners to now show MAP ads to people who have limited ad tracking on, to continue to work on place that we can help attribution with in a post-cookie world. I think all these things are helping us a bunch with advertisers and with the people who use our service. But given it's really not been that long here, not everybody is upgraded and agencies and advertisers and the broader ecosystem likely hasn't fully adjusted yet. We're going to have to wait and see how this plays out completely. The last thing I'd point out is, just remember, at the end of last year, we were 85% brand, 15% DR, and there's still lots of opportunity for us to better leverage first-party signal than we historically have. And so we're probably coming at this from a different angle than many other ad platforms are, and we see opportunity where others may see it differently."

It evolves from 1 geography to another at different points in the year, but overall, it continues to be really healthy. 
In the U.S., as new cycles come and go, as how it's evolved post COVID, hopefully, it's -- people are still merging their old -- their pre-COVID habits with their new habits. Many -- for many of people, that means that they're new on Twitter, and they're sorting out all kinds of different things that have changed in their life. So we're not sure exactly how that plays out. But when we look at Q2, we continue to see healthy usage of service. And the DAU trend, since it was consistent with what we saw at pre-COVID, we're not sure there's that much to read into it just yet."

The original problem we were trying to solve was -- with Fleets was around [ time ] and helping people feel comfortable sharing something that they don't have to worry about being on their public record forever.

If the creator is creating great content and you see it in Super Follows, or it's just a tweet and somebody puts money in their tip jar, or it's long-form content that we include in a different price point for a subscription without ads that's complemented with other features that come from us, then we would make sure that the part of the value that can be attributed to the creator where those dollars go to them and when we're facilitating a transaction.

And that strength from March really continued throughout Q2. So much for the crystal ball. 
On the second part of your question about pricing. There are lots of different factors that play into pricing. And so as you've seen in the past with us, if you go back to 2018 as an example, there are times where cost per engagement can go down dramatically and revenue growth can be pretty significant. And I point that out because as you think about the mix of brand versus DR, as you think about what the threshold is for something to be a click, we're now actually at the point where more than half of the videos that you see on Twitter in ads are 15 seconds or less. It's taken us a long time to get there. The likelihood that those -- that we and -- that we get paid for them, that the advertiser realizes their objective is higher than it is for longer videos typically. This is a great example of something that can throw a wrench in comparables when you look at ad engagements or cost per engagement. And so I'd focus less on the pricing and more on the return on investment for the advertiser. And when we're improving at the age-based targeting, location-based targeting, improving the formats, growing the audience, and hopefully there are lots of ways that can play out well for advertisers. Some of them include pricing being higher, but others where pricing is meaningfully lower, and they're just getting more reach and more return and therefore, invest even more against our growing audience."

And those advertisers spending more than they had in previous periods broadly and hopefully as well on Twitter. Over time, we do think we can grow the number of advertisers on our service, both because we can show incredible value proposition to lots of medium-sized advertisers who haven't historically advertised with us, where our sales team can continue to do a great job growing the dollars spent by some small businesses, but also where the work we're doing around topics, the work we're doing on quick promote, the work we're doing to make it easier to buy ads and see the return from those ads for small advertisers will help us meaningfully grow the number of advertisers. There are millions of small businesses on Twitter today, but most of them don't yet advertise because we haven't made a good case to them what the value proposition is or made it easy for them to do it. 
So I think the benefits of growing the advertiser base are in front of us.

Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q2 earnings conference call. We have Jack and Ned with us today.
We published our Shareholder Letter on our Investor Relations website and with the SEC a couple of hours ago and hope that you've all had a chance to read it. As usual, we'll keep our opening remarks brief so that we can get right to your questions. As a reminder, we will also take questions asked on Twitter, so please tweet us at @TwitterIR using the #TWTR.
During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements, including statements about our business outlook, strategies and long-term goals. These comments are based on our plans, predictions and expectations as of today, which may change over time. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors in our most recent 10-K and upcoming -- and 10-Q and upcoming 10-Q that will be filed with the SEC.
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. We reconcile those to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in our Shareholder Letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website, and an audio replay will be available on Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jack."

Total revenue hit $1.19 billion with ad revenue up 87% year-over-year driven by faster shipping cadence, strong sales execution and a broad increase in advertiser demand. Average monetizable DAU reached 206 million, up 11% year-over-year, in line with our outlook and historical seasonal trends.
We intend to build an ecosystem of connected features and services focused on serving 3 core jobs: news, which is what's happening; discussion, conversation; and helping people get paid. Every single person in the world has some need for at least the first 2 and [ preferably ] the third. Building a model like this isn't easy or fast, and its [ deliberateness ] ensures resilience and ever-increasing global value.
There are 3 trends relevant to Twitter and you, our shareholders: AI, decentralization and the Internet finally having access to a global native currency in Bitcoin. All these will help [ do our ] jobs better, and we intend to lead the way in each. With AI and machine learning, we increased relevance and discovery, a long-standing issue on Twitter which we're improving every day from sign-up to in-app sessions. With decentralization, we increased the size of the [ corpus ] of conversation we have access to and improved conversational health by giving more people -- more power to individuals.
And with the global currency, we can ensure people and companies can freely trade goods and services anywhere on the planet. The ecosystem model will enable an experience for an individual or company of any size: can tweet, reply, move to an audio chat, build a following, write a newsletter, charge for content and eventually sell a service or good all in one simple flow. Each part of this cycle will positively reinforce other parts and build upon itself. I've seen this work elsewhere, and it will work even more for Twitter.
Along the way, we're going to try things that end up not being a fit. We're going to be fast to recognize this and take action without hesitation, as we did with Fleets. There are better solutions to the problem we are trying to solve than the stories format everyone has adopted, entirely new formats that are unique to Twitter and our model. This is what we're striving to create.  Expect us to start and stop many more features than we have in the past.
That's all for me for now. I want to thank you all for your continued trust and belief as we do our work. Ned?"

As Jack noted, Q2 was a strong quarter, particularly for advertising. We exited March with momentum across both brand and DR, and April trends continued to improve with ongoing strength throughout the quarter across all major products and geographies. A growing audience, better ad products, strong sales execution, global events and advertiser product launches all had a big impact on our performance.
As a result, we exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 10% or approximately $110 million. In our guidance, we equally weighted the slower start to the year that we saw in January and February in brand with the strong return to brand spend that we saw in March, which was, in hindsight, too conservative. The impact of ATT on the second quarter was also more muted than we expected, although it's too early to assess the long-term impact.
mDAU grew 11% year-over-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter, in line with historical seasonal trends and the outlook we provided in April. Within our global mDAU growth of 11%, our sequential growth in the U.S. may get some attention. Here are some context. In the 3 years prior to COVID, reported quarter-over-quarter growth for U.S. mDAU in the second quarter has ranged from 1 million up to 1 million down. So our performance this year is relatively consistent with this historical range despite an atypical backdrop, which includes [ lighter ] news cycles in the U.S. as well as the beginning of reopening across many communities where consumer behavior likely has not yet normalized.
While it's too early to tell how people's behavior may change and as some economies reopen while others are still struggling, I'd remind you that sequential growth for U.S. mDAU in Q3 over the last 4 years has ranged from flat to up 1 million, suggesting U.S. mDAU could be flat on a sequential basis in Q3 of '21. The good news is that we're confident in our ability to accelerate growth longer term. And in the near term, these same trends have been great for advertisers, with a return to global events, product launches and our better ad products all driving improved advertiser ROI and our ability to deliver strong results. And there are no changes to our thinking about mDAU over the course of the year. We continue to expect low double-digit year-over-year growth in Q3 and Q4 with the low point likely now behind us.
Given the momentum we're seeing as we enter the second half of the year, we're updating our thinking on investment and revenue. Our expectations for 25% or more expense growth in 2021 and revenue growing faster than expenses now appears too low. We are accelerating our investments and now expect the headcount, along with total costs and expenses, to grow 30% or more for the full year with a focus on engineering and products. As you'd expect, incremental headcount investments in 2021 will flow into our annual expense base in 2022. With regard to revenue, we continue to expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021, assuming the global pandemic continues to improve, and that we continue to see modest impact from the rollout of changes associated with iOS 14.5.
You also may have noticed in our Shareholder Letter that we purchased $334 million of Twitter shares in Q2, a little more than twice the amount we repurchased in Q1, reflecting the pullback in share price we saw in early May. We'll continue to be thoughtful and nimble as we move forward, likely varying our pace based on the operating environment, our capital needs and market conditions. In summary, we're pleased with our results and the momentum we see as we enter the second half of the year.
And with that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator?"

So obviously, I've been tweeting and talking a lot about Bitcoin, and so I thought it was important that I explain a little bit more as to why in my opening remarks. I think -- not -- focusing on the use case of the Internet having native currency and that Bitcoin probably is the best -- actually known to be the best candidate for that role, that's what I think we should really focus on. If the Internet has a native currency, a global currency, we are able to move so much faster with products such as Super Follows, commerce, subscription, Tip Jar, and we can reach every single person on the planet because of that instead of going down on market by market by market approach.
I think this is a big part of our future. I think there's a lot of innovation above just currency to be had, especially as we think about decentralizing social media more and providing more economic incentive. So I think it's hugely important to Twitter and to Twitter shareholders that we continue to look at the space and invest aggressively in it. And we're not alone here. I mean look at what Facebook is trying to do with Libra or Diem, or I'm not sure what they're calling them right now. But there's an obvious need for this and appreciation for it. And I think an [ open standard ] that's native to one of that is the right way to go, which is where -- why my focus on -- our focus will then -- should be on Bitcoin. So I do think it allows speed.

One, when we think about an inflection point in terms of the number of advertisers on Twitter, that's in front of us. The work we're doing in SMB, which had another strong quarter, so far has been to help grow the spend from the existing customers while we put a pilot out for Business Profiles back in April, which so far is going well but more work to do there, and while we continue to make it easier for small businesses with the new version of Quick Promote to buy ads on Twitter and to help them understand the value proposition of doing so. In terms of MAP, we feel really good about our progress there. With a revamped product out in February, we began to see some strong momentum there, and that momentum continued into Q2.
I'll give you a couple of fun facts. The streamers, as they continue to grow their business and launch new shows and get people interested in their services, they grew their spend over 40% sequentially with Twitter in Q2. We are piloting a playable ad format for gamers so that you can play a game inside of an ad. We have multi-destination carousels inside of MAP, so you can send people to different places. These are great examples of some of the innovation. When you add those up with a better age-based, better location-based targeting and the ability to show MAP ads to those folks who had limit ad tracking on before where we couldn't report on them earlier but now we can as a part of the SKAdNetwork, we made really good progress here and feel like we've got the wind at our backs on MAP going into the second half."

And I'm curious if there's other things that you can look at that sort of tie to that in terms of like other things on the ad product side that you're doing or about to do that are starting to really make local advertising more appealing.

Leveraging that signal for small businesses to find their customers, whether those are small businesses that have a distributed customer base or those that are local to a specific market, we think can really help us help small businesses find their customers in a differentiated way.
So the cities, I think that plays out for Topics over time. It plays out right now in terms of how we can help an advertiser target their customers or people who are in a given location. We've made improvements to our age-based targeting as well. These are things that help large advertisers as well as the smallest advertisers. I know when you look at why you see an ad and you see that it's either because you're in a state or in a country or you're a certain age, we're getting better and better at helping advertisers find their customers this way.

So first, on the Olympics, we're really excited about the Olympics, one, from an audience perspective. This is just a great way to engage people who use Twitter where they -- because they're going to be able to come to Twitter and find the medal moments right after they happen. The highlights will be there. There will be pre-roll in front of them from advertisers who've been waiting for this opportunity to connect with their customers around a big global event like this. I'd point you back to last year where there were a lot of events that happened where fans weren't in the stands. Twitter took the place of the stand. It was the roar of the crowd. It was one of the fewer places where advertisers could connect with their customers and know that they'd be there. So we've been working hard to make sure that this can be a success for us. It's going to be an Olympics unlike any other, and it's still uncertain exactly how it plays out.
We haven't broken it out in terms of how we'd quantify it. We tend to do that less these days because it -- you've got to judge how much of spend is truly incremental. There's some subjectivity in that, and I don't think we'd do it justice. But when we step back from the dollars and the specific audience on a given day, this is a great opportunity to showcase for people how much better Twitter is from the last time they came, if that was the World Cup or the Olympics or a different event as opposed to them having Twitter as a part of their daily habit. And the same thing is true for advertisers. So we're really looking forward to the Olympics getting going with the opening ceremonies here shortly.
The second part of your question on ATT or IDFA, so far, we're pleased with what we've seen, but it's too early to call a long-term trend. I'd point you to a few different things. The first is we've worked really hard as long as the company has been around to build trust with the people who use our service. Hopefully, that means that when they're prompted from Twitter and we give them a really clear explanation of what we're asking, hopefully that means they're more likely to accept the prompt from us than they might be from others.
Second, we worked really hard to implement the SKAdNetwork, to give that data to third-party measurement partners, to now show MAP ads to people who have limited ad tracking on, to continue to work on ways that we can help attribution with -- in a post-cookie world. I think all these things are helping us a bunch with advertisers and with the people who use our service. But given it's really not been that long here, not everybody's upgraded and agencies and advertisers and the broader ecosystem likely hasn't fully adjusted yet, we're going to have to wait and see how this plays out completely.
The last thing I'd point out is just remember, at the end of last year, we were 85% brand, 15% DR, and there's still lots of opportunity for us to better leverage first-party signal than we historically have. And so we're probably coming at this from a different angle than many other ad platforms are, and we see opportunity where others may see it differently."

First, on the crystal ball, I wish we had one. We definitely incorporated too much at the beginning of the quarter into our guidance when we guided for Q2, where we got off to a slower start in terms of brand in January and February and March, we saw strength and we equal weighted them in the guidance. And that strength from March really continued throughout Q2. So, so much for the crystal ball. On the second part of your question about pricing. There are lots of different factors that play into pricing. And so as you've seen in the past with us, if you go back to 2018 as an example, there are times where cost per engagement can go down dramatically and revenue growth can be pretty significant.
And I point that out because as you think about the mix of brand versus DR, as you think about what the threshold is for something to be a click, we're now actually at the point where more than half of the videos that you see on Twitter in ads are 15 seconds or less. It's taken us a long time to get there. The likelihood that those -- that we and -- that we get paid for them, that the advertiser realizes their objective is higher than it is for longer videos typically. This is a great example of something that can throw a wrench in comparables when you look at ad engagements or cost per engagement.
And so I'd focus less on the pricing and more on the return on investment for the advertiser. And when we're improving at the age-based targeting, location-based targeting, improving the formats, growing the audience and hopefully over time continue to see a mix shift towards DR from brand, that -- there are lots of ways that, that can play out well for advertisers. Some of them include pricing being higher, but others where pricing is meaningfully lower and they're just getting more reach and more return and therefore invest even more against our growing audience."

It's been less about new advertisers and more about growing our share of wallet and those advertisers spending more than they had in previous periods broadly and hopefully as well on Twitter. Over time, we do think we can grow the number of advertisers on our service both because we can show incredible value proposition to lots of medium-sized advertisers who haven't historically advertised with us, where our sales team can continue to do a great job growing the dollars spent by some small businesses. But also where the work we're doing around Topics, the work we're doing around Quick Promote, the work we're doing to make it easier to buy ads and see the return from those ads for small advertisers will help us meaningfully grow the number of advertisers.
There are millions of small businesses on Twitter today, but most of them don't yet advertise because we haven't made a good case to them what the value proposition is or made it easy for them to do it. So I think the benefits of growing the advertiser base are in front of us. And the strength that we're seeing today is about that larger audience with better ad formats, with more relevance, with a really strong macroeconomic backdrop of events coming back, more product launches and a lot of that to come in the second half of the year as well."

We had a solid Q3 with strong performance across revenue products and continued audience growth. Revenue was $1.28 billion in Q3, and we continue to see significant ad revenue growth, which increased 41% year-over-year this quarter. Average monetizable DAU increased to $211 million, up 13% year-over-year, with growth accelerating from an increase of 11% year-over-year in Q2. 
Before we get deep into the quarter and how we're looking at the rest of the year, as you may have seen, we announced that we agreed to sell MoPub to Apple. First, I want to thank the MoPub team for all their hard work and contributions to Twitter and our customers who put trust in us and the MoPub team for many years. The sale demonstrates our confidence in our core revenue product strategy, allowing us to refocus our energy and resources on our direct response, SMB and Commerce road maps. 
The last time we talked, you heard us talk about our intention to build an ecosystem of connected features and services focused on serving 3 core jobs: news, discussion and helping people get paid. In Q3, we launched products across all these categories, including Ticketed Spaces, Tips, Super Follows and narrow casting with communities. We also had the ability to pay your favorite creators using a variety of payment methods, including for the first time Bitcoin. We continue to upgrade our machine learning systems as well, which are improving personalization throughout the product. 
We're just getting started, but already Twitter feels more responsive and intuitive. Lots more to come here. As we approach the end of the year, we feel confident about where we're headed. Overall, we're on course to leave 2021 a more focused company with clear priorities. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Ned."

Q3 was a solid quarter driven by focus and execution. Total revenue grew 37% year-over-year at the high end of our guidance. mDAU grew 13% year-over-year to $211 million with U.S. mDAU essentially flat quarter-over-quarter and up 4% year-over-year, both in line with our expectations due to the unusual comps from the pandemic surge last year, coupled with typical seasonality. We expect total mDAU in Q4 to grow at or above the Q3 rate of 13% on a year-over-year basis, and we continue to believe the low point for year-over-year mDAU growth in 2021 was back in Q2 due to those tough comps. The impact of COVID remains fragmented across the world, and we believe consumer behavior has yet to normalize. 
Despite these uncertainties, we remain optimistic given our healthy top of funnel, our conversion rate and our product road map, which allow us to serve more and more people every day. Let me share some of the highlights from the Olympics and our DR road map from Q3. 
The Olympics were a strong event for us. Olympics-related tweets with video content reviewed more than 1 billion times on Twitter. There were 76 billion tweet impressions related to the Olympics, and 12 of the 14 official Olympic sponsors advertised on Twitter. 
Our shift to direct response ads also made great strides. For Map advertisers, we launched an updated learning period model that delivers more consistent campaign performance. And for website clicks, we introduced a multi-destination carousel to enable advertisers to market and drive traffic to multiple products inside the same ad on Twitter. 
These are just a few examples of our accelerated pace of testing and rolling out new features, yet we won't stop there when it comes to increasing focus on our most critical work. As Jack mentioned earlier, and although it happened in October, it's worth spending a moment on the announced sale of MoPub. 
The sale of MoPub positions us to reallocate resources and accelerate product development by investing more in the team's focus on better monetizing our website and apps. The sale is expected to close in Q1. And while the associated product engineering and go-to-market teams are largely expected to shift to DR, SMB and Commerce upon closing, it will take time for their work to deliver results. We do not expect to recoup the full revenue loss associated with the sale of MoPub in 2022, which is estimated to be between $200 million and $250 million. 
Despite some expected 2022 revenue loss, there are no changes to our goal of generating $7.5 billion or more of annual revenue in 2023 with our increased focus and additional resources working on increasing our market share in the $150 billion and growing addressable market for ads on Twitter. 
I've also noticed there's been a lot of focus more broadly on the impact of the supply chain on the economy in general and advertising in particular. I'm pleased to share that our launch and connect value proposition continues to resonate with advertisers across the economy with well more than half of our total ad revenue year-to-date associated with services and digital goods. 
Let me also spend a moment on ATT. We continue to see opportunities around personalization on Twitter as we better leverage our unique signal to improve people's experience and show their more effective ads across both brand and direct response. The revenue impact we experienced from ATT in Q3 increased on a sequential basis but remains modest. The impact of ATT is likely to vary across ad platforms given the unique mix of ad formats, signal and remediations on each as well as other factors, the mitigations we put in place and the speed with which we've adopted new standards like the SKAdNetwork and resulting changes across our technical stack have contributed to minimizing the impact to us. Since the launch of ATT in April, we've invested in supporting SKAdNetwork, opening up 30%-plus more inventory and scale on iOS and launch support for view-through attribution and SK Campaign ID management features in the Twitter ads manager. 
It's still too early for Twitter to assess the long-term impact of Apple's privacy-related IOS changes, but the Q3 revenue impact was lower than expected, and we've incorporated an ongoing modest impact into our Q4 guidance. We've seen our revenue product development, both related to and distinct from ATT, improved the performance of our products, and we expect that to continue. 
Let me quickly turn to a couple of points regarding our outlook. We continue to expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021, excluding the litigation settlement announced in Q3, and we expect to continue our investment posture as we enter next year. We'll talk more about 2022 in February, but let me provide a little more context here. 
Our 30% plus headcount growth in 2021 with annual merit increases and other investments we've made in 2021, including our new data center, will flow into annual expenses for 2022, likely resulting in a mid-20% increase in total expenses next year prior to hiring any more people or additional investments during 2022. We're pleased with our Q3 results, and we're excited about the momentum we bring with us into Q4. 
Let's go to questions."

And then secondly, Ned, just on the -- your comment you just made just about the increase in expenses. So I just want to make sure we're understanding it right. You're kind of saying the expenses ending '21 will take you to a mid-20s percent increase flowing that through before you even hire anybody or add additional expenses. So that's a number that you'll update in 3 months?"

Just to take the first question, our greatest opportunity and potential for growth is around personalization and relevance.

Just to take the first question, our greatest opportunity and potential for growth is around personalization and relevance. That is where we've consistently gotten the greatest gains in everything that we do, and we intend to put a lot more emphasis here. This mainly speaks to our application of machine learning and general AI across every product surface that we have, but it also lends itself into some of the newer product surfaces and capabilities that we've been talking about, some for longer, some more recently. 
Topics and interest continues to be a highlight. We have close to 12,000 topics now, 11 different languages, 230 million accounts for at least 1 topic. We're putting this closer and closer to onboarding, but this helps everything. This helps our experience, consumer experience, it helps our business because it gives us a signal with a ton of intent, expressing intent to run a particular issue or topic instead of us having to infer it. And it also lays the foundation for the products that we want to create. So space is an example of this, which we just rolled out to 100% of all of our customers. 
Communities, which is the narrow casting use case, allowing people to talk specifically in what feels like a much smaller room about a topic interest, and that could be a location with my neighborhood. I think we will definitely see a lot of usage as people find new ways of having conversations that don't feel like they're tweeting to just the entire world and broadcasting it but actually have a much tighter feedback group because they're talking about something that is locally interesting, whether that be a particular interest or that should be a location [indiscernible]. 
So those are the ones I would point to, but the biggest impact will continue to be personalization. And this is an area where we feel we are behind, although we've put a lot -- we've gotten a lot of gains from it. That just really speaks to the potential we have so much more work to do in terms of machine learning and just generally applying AI to every surface area we have."

The top of funnel continues to be healthy all around the world for us, that is the folks who haven't been on Twitter for a month or more, whether they've never been on Twitter before or they've tried it in the past but haven't made it a part of their daily ritual. So all the product stuff that Jack took you through, plus that healthy top of funnel and all the events and topics that continue to bring people to Twitter all over the world, those are the components that build us up to that $350 million number for the end of next year. When we put it out there in February, remember, we knew that this was going to be a year where we'd be lapping last year's pretty incredible growth and that acceleration was required, and so we've now started that with 11% from Q2 going to 13% DAU growth in Q3. 
The second part of your question on expenses. So we'll give more color around 2022 in February as we typically do. But we just want to remind everybody, one, our investment posture hasn't changed. And as we mentioned back in February, as long as we're on track for our goals, we're going to continue with the mindset to invest to drive growth. And when you just do the math on the hiring and investment decisions that we've already put to work, whether it's the data center or people who've already joined the company, that when you roll those through the P&L for a full year, you added merit increases and so on, you naturally get to -- and this includes depreciation for the data center, for example, which doesn't start until you actually start to use the data center, you naturally get to the mid-20s. And so we're in the middle of the process where we sort out all the things that we want to do next year, so I don't want to get in front of that. But we do want to continue to invest to drive growth next year, and anything else that we decide to do that is in a resource reallocation decision would be on top of that."

One is MAP grew slightly faster than overall ads, which gives you a sense that we're continuing to make progress there. We saw strength from some areas where we haven't always seen in the past such as travel, where launch campaigns as people begin to travel again from the travel advertisers grew 40%. A lot of that's tied to MAP. Fintech, they grew their spend 200% year-over-year with us. Food delivery, where a lot of that's pointing people to apps, that grew 140%. 
I'd give you a sense for where some of the strength is coming from. You mentioned shopping, so we now have business profiles to differentiate businesses from your account and mine on Twitter where you can put your hours operation, you can put your website. We will also make it so you can buy products straight from those profiles. So stay tuned for that, and we've been experimenting with that over the course of this year. Also on the direct response side, the multi-destination carousel is improving click-through rates by 20%, which gives you a good sense for why this is attracting more and more advertisers and more and more dollars to our service. So we'll keep marching down that road map. And with the sale of MoPub, we'll have more resources to put against it. 
To your second question around revenue guidance. So if you back out last year, which was by no means a normal year and you look at the 4 prior years, you see sequential growth in Q4 for us that was from the mid-teens to the mid-20s. And so when you compare this to that $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion range, you can see that, that's reasonably consistent with what we've seen in the past. We feel like we're entering Q4 with the wind at our backs, with the Olympics having got off to a strong start in Q3. The Olympics went a little bit better than we had expected them to from a revenue perspective. We were really pleased with how we were able to deliver for advertisers. And the strength continued throughout the quarter across geographies, across formats, across verticals and with a great event calendar with lots of product launches in front of us with that strong mix of services and digital goods that we talked about earlier, we feel like we've got a lot of momentum at our backs right now."

So privacy is about making sure that people have an understanding of what data is being collected about them, having control over that. We want to make sure that we're leading our peers in exactly that but also making sure that we have much more direct ways of people telling us what they're interested in. And being able to follow a topic in interest is one such way. Being able to join a particular community to talk about an interest or topic is another way. These are all things that people are intently opting into saying that they're interested in this particular thing gives us much, much stronger signal. 
It also gives us new surface area to consider what we can do with communities, which hasn't launched fully in beta yet. We're testing it internally. But it gives us the surface area for advertisers who may just want to be shown around a particular topic instead of more broad-based in home time line. So it gives them a much safer space if they want to avoid particular topics or anything that might be political or not. And they have the ability to act on more intent, not just the people that they're trying to reach. 
So that's ultimately what we want to drive, and it starts with the product itself and then making sure that we utilize those signals to deliver a person, an individual, the most relevant ad or introduction to a product or service but -- that they can imagine. And they'll tell us whether that's variable or not as to whether they tap on it or purchase something, and all of these things give us more information so that we can create a much tighter feedback loop so that all these actions can positively reinforce one another. So everything from spaces to the newsletters to covering topics, all these things show a particular intent in a particular interest, and we have to depend less and less around inference in order to strengthen our relevance and get better signal."

One, is we do have a lot of small businesses on Twitter, but we have not served them more both in terms of the product and also the advertising capabilities. DR is a big part of this thinking sure that we continue to move towards more and more performance-based advertising. Self-serve is a big part, providing an intuitive interface where a one-person small business or sole proprietorship can actually come on to our system and understand how to reach the customers that they're trying to reach. And then there's a bunch of product surface areas that I think make us better, the topics that I keep talking about. Increased locations as well. So now we have keeping my hometown in Missouri as a topic, I can follow. And again, that's intent that we've been using to signal, Communities is going to be a big part here as you consider topical communities, interest communities and also community focused around particular locations. That's going to be an incredible surface area for small businesses. 
So there's some foundational work in terms of the performance direction that we're moving to, but also making sure that we are building something that ultimately self-serve for a small business, that they can open up the website and get the advertising right away and actually see value in it immediately, which means that they are really crisp and intuitive analytics. And then the more and more capabilities we have through the products, including our aspirations around commerce, that helps with retaining and attracting new small businesses as well. We did -- we have been launching some things recently like the business profile, and there's a lot more to come, but all of these things will help the smallest businesses be able to utilize us and scale up as we [indiscernible] ourselves."

A part of it is the Olympics, which we think went better than we had expected by a little bit. And a lot of that shows up in the U.S., certainly not all of it, though. But as events began to come back, as people went back to stadiums, as they went back to theaters and other places, they continue to use Twitter. And advertisers continue to use Twitter as a way to reach them, whether it's the 2 billion impressions we saw during the video music awards or the 76 billion impressions we saw during the Olympics. These are just great examples of that and helping advertisers connect with their customers around full baseball season in the U.S., around the lead up to the football season both pro and college and all the highlights that we've got with every touch spend now during the NFL and a lot of the commentary around this. Those have been great opportunities for us in the U.S., but they're just some of the examples of what we've seen. 
And when we look at places like Japan, which grew 20% year-over-year, it's a powerful reminder that different economies are coming out of COVID at different times and went into lockdown at different points. And so although the year-over-years are going to be wonky for one reason or another, there's still lots of opportunity for us in other geographies where we have a sizable audience and great relationships with advertisers. Japan as MAP continues to improve, as they gradually come out of lockdown, we see lots of opportunity there. Just as another great example of where there's a geographic opportunity for us. I'll turn to Jack on the second part."

Both tipping subscriptions are new. These are products that we want to make sure that, again, we're starting small and then we figure out the right product that people want to stick with and they're valuing every single day, and then we'll open up to more and more people and scale it and continue to iterate on the product. 
The progress of Revue, which is our new auto product, a reminder why we did this. We want to make sure that Twitter is a place where you can express yourself in multiple formats, whether that be through short format updates like Tweets; Spaces, which is an audio conversation in real time; or long form, which is Revue in the newsletter. The more we integrate this to more opportunity and potential that we see. 
I think rather than looking at any one part of the equation, though, it's useful to consider the ecosystem, someone being able to tweet out that they're going to host this space, add emission price for that space, which is what we call ticket expenses, have and host the space, potentially be able to sell our products to commerce initiatives. Then after the space is complete, writing newsletter to all their followers around how, when or a recap or any team insights. All these things positively reinforce one another and allows people to reach in entirely new ways. Some people might not be able to see the space, but they can get the newsletter, write back to the tweets and so forth. So we're focused on the ecosystem model, the connection between the parts as being the strength, not the individual aspects of it and making them the strongest, but actually the connection between is where we think the greatest value is for the company."

But we think that over time, that's the right mix for Twitter to be at. We feel like we've made really good progress, having rolled out a new version of MAP, having made a bunch of improvements to website clicks, including the carousel that we talked a straight line from here to there. 
When you look across geographies, there are some that are inherently much heavier in one product or another. Japan being a heavier MAP market is a good example of that. Europe tends to be more MAP heavy as well. But a lot of this can change from one period to another from one advertiser campaign to another based on our product rollouts and improvements that we make. So we'll update that 85-15 mix annually, so that time will be in February. And between them, we'll just continue to give you highlights and give you a sense for all the progress that we're making."

On topics, we launched 2,300 new topics in this quarter. There's still a lot to do in terms of applying machine learning and personalization to it, both in terms of like being able to open up new topics much faster, but also enabling more relevance around the topics, A lot of tweets that I find most viable these days are right in the home time line or introduced by following topics or a related topic, the system thinks I'm interested in. So I've discovered a ton that I wouldn't otherwise from just following accounts and doing all that work. So we do think it's really helpful both in terms of retaining card users and giving them more of a breadth of what Twitter offers. And also, we're starting to put it more and more into onboarding. So we do think that there's going to be a lot of momentum from that. 
However, I would say that our experience around it, the UI and just how to navigate it and understand it, is still a little bit old. And the more work we do to make it feel more cohesive make us feel like a less taxing, being able to show and demonstrate tweets right there, selection of tweets that you might see, if you follow a topic I think would help a lot.

But we do think that over time, we can get back on track towards that $7.5 billion or more goal for 2023, and that will be on a more solid ground with more focus around monetizing Twitter than we had been before. And so from an expense perspective, this really doesn't change the picture for next year because we hope to have as many of those people as possible remain at Twitter.

So first on SKAdNetwork, it's hard for us to speak to what others have done, and a lot of this is that we're coming at the things from different angles. And so we continue to work hard to give advertisers reporting at whatever level customers allow us to around the success of their campaigns, and the SKAdNetwork did a couple of things for us. 
One is it opened up more inventory where we hadn't been able to report to advertisers on how their campaigns have done before, and we are now able to show 30% more iOS customers ads and then report on them on an anonymized aggregated basis. Two is that we've worked hard to help the measurement partners have access to SKAdNetwork and did this early enough to make sure that people could benefit from it, and advertisers can use that to the best of their abilities. 
There's just a lot of signal both from showing ads to people and also reporting on how campaigns have performed on Twitter historically where there's been room for us to improve. And so I think the fact that we're all coming at these things from different angles, maybe we implement it at different times, maybe the campaigns that we're reporting on are different as such that this has had -- the ATT has had less impact on us than perhaps it's not on others who have a different mix or starting from a different starting point. 
The second question around single sign on. We're looking at all the ways that we can reduce friction and helping people get to what they're looking for on Twitter as quickly as possible. Single sign-on is a great example of it, where a lot of people have created accounts on Twitter over time, but they may not remember their password or maybe on a different device. And everything we can do to get them into a time line as quickly as possible is to help them find the conversation that they were looking for as quickly as possible, we want to do. This has been a nice contributor and something that should continue to reduce friction over time for us, given how our top of funnel works for a lot of the people who come to Twitter have been on the service before. They just haven't been on it for a while. And every new at bat we get with them is an opportunity to show them how much better Twitter is than the last time they were with us. 
So single sign-on is a great example of that. Jack talked about topics as another important lever. As those get closer and closer to onboarding, we're able to help people find the accounts that they want to follow or the topics that they want to learn most about through the process of showing them topics and refining what accounts we suggest to them or finding what topics we suggest to them and get them to value in their time line faster than we were able to before."

Average monetizable DAU increased to $211 million, up 13% year-over-year, with growth accelerating from an increase of 11% year-over-year in Q2. 
Before we get deep into the quarter and how we're looking at the rest of the year, as you may have seen, we announced that we agreed to sell MoPub to AppLovin. First, I want to thank the MoPub team for all their hard work and contributions to Twitter and our customers who put trust in us and the MoPub team for many years. The sale demonstrates our confidence in our core revenue product strategy, allowing us to refocus our energy and resources on our direct response, SMB and Commerce road maps. 
The last time we talked, you heard us talk about our intention to build an ecosystem of connected features and services focused on serving 3 core jobs: news, discussion and helping people get paid. In Q3, we launched products across all these categories, including Ticketed Spaces, Tips, Super Follows and narrowcasting with communities. We also had the ability to pay your favorite creators using a variety of payment methods, including for the first time Bitcoin. We continue to upgrade our machine learning systems as well, which are improving personalization throughout the product. 
We're just getting started, but already Twitter feels more responsive and intuitive. Lots more to come here. As we approach the end of the year, we feel confident about where we're headed. Overall, we're on course to leave 2021 a more focused company with clear priorities. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Ned."

Q3 was a solid quarter driven by focus and execution. Total revenue grew 37% year-over-year at the high end of our guidance. mDAU grew 13% year-over-year to $211 million with U.S. mDAU essentially flat quarter-over-quarter and up 4% year-over-year, both in line with our expectations due to the unusual comps from the pandemic surge last year, coupled with typical seasonality. We expect total mDAU in Q4 to grow at or above the Q3 rate of 13% on a year-over-year basis, and we continue to believe the low point for year-over-year mDAU growth in 2021 was back in Q2 due to those tough comps. The impact of COVID remains fragmented across the world, and we believe consumer behavior has yet to normalize. 
Despite these uncertainties, we remain optimistic given our healthy top of funnel, our conversion rate and our product road map, which allow us to serve more and more people every day. Let me share some of the highlights from the Olympics and our DR road map from Q3. 
The Olympics were a strong event for us. Olympics-related tweets with video content were viewed more than 1 billion times on Twitter. There were 76 billion tweet impressions related to the Olympics, and 12 of the 14 official Olympic sponsors advertised on Twitter. 
Our shift to direct response ads also made great strides. For MAP advertisers, we launched an updated learning period model that delivers more consistent campaign performance. And for website clicks, we introduced a multi-destination carousel to enable advertisers to market and drive traffic to multiple products inside the same ad on Twitter. 
These are just a few examples of our accelerated pace of testing and rolling out new features, yet we won't stop there when it comes to increasing focus on our most critical work. As Jack mentioned earlier, and although it happened in October, it's worth spending a moment on the announced sale of MoPub. 
The sale of MoPub positions us to reallocate resources and accelerate product development by investing more in the team's focus on better monetizing our website and apps. The sale is expected to close in Q1. And while the associated product engineering and go-to-market teams are largely expected to shift to DR, SMB and Commerce upon closing, it will take time for their work to deliver results. We do not expect to recoup the full revenue loss associated with the sale of MoPub in 2022, which is estimated to be between $200 million and $250 million. 
Despite some expected 2022 revenue loss, there are no changes to our goal of generating $7.5 billion or more of annual revenue in 2023 with our increased focus and additional resources working on increasing our market share in the $150 billion and growing addressable market for ads on Twitter. 
I've also noticed there's been a lot of focus more broadly on the impact of the supply chain on the economy in general and advertising in particular. I'm pleased to share that our launch and connect value proposition continues to resonate with advertisers across the economy, with well more than half of our total ad revenue year-to-date associated with services and digital goods. 
Let me also spend a moment on ATT. We continue to see opportunities around personalization on Twitter as we better leverage our unique signal to improve people's experience and show their more effective ads across both brand and direct response. The revenue impact we experienced from ATT in Q3 increased on a sequential basis but remains modest. The impact of ATT is likely to vary across ad platforms given the unique mix of ad formats, signal and remediations on each as well as other factors, the mitigations we put in place and the speed with which we've adopted new standards like the SKAdNetwork and resulting changes across our technical stack have contributed to minimizing the impact to us. Since the launch of ATT in April, we've invested in supporting SKAdNetwork, opening up 30%-plus more inventory and scale on iOS and launch support for view-through attribution and SK Campaign ID management features in the Twitter ads manager. 
It's still too early for Twitter to assess the long-term impact of Apple's privacy-related IOS changes, but the Q3 revenue impact was lower than expected, and we've incorporated an ongoing modest impact into our Q4 guidance. We've seen our revenue product development, both related to and distinct from ATT, improved the performance of our products, and we expect that to continue. 
Let me quickly turn to a couple of points regarding our outlook. We continue to expect total revenue to grow faster than expenses in 2021, excluding the litigation settlement announced in Q3, and we expect to continue our investment posture as we enter next year. We'll talk more about 2022 in February, but let me provide a little more context here. 
Our 30%-plus headcount growth in 2021 with annual merit increases and other investments we've made in 2021, including our new data center, will flow into annual expenses for 2022, likely resulting in a mid-20% increase in total expenses next year prior to hiring any more people or additional investments during 2022. We're pleased with our Q3 results, and we're excited about the momentum we bring with us into Q4. 
Let's go to questions."

Just to take the first question, our greatest opportunity and potential for growth is around personalization and relevance. That is where we've consistently gotten the greatest gains in everything that we do, and we intend to put a lot more emphasis here. This mainly speaks to our application of machine learning and general AI across every product surface that we have, but it also lends itself into some of the newer product surfaces and capabilities that we've been talking about, some for longer, some more recently. 
Topics and interest continues to be a highlight. We have close to 12,000 topics now, 11 different languages, 230 million accounts for at least one topic. We're putting this closer and closer to onboarding, but this helps everything. This helps our experience, consumer experience, it helps our business because it gives us a signal with a ton of intent, and expressing intent to run a particular issue or topic instead of us having to infer it. And it also lays the foundation for the products that we want to create. So space is an example of this, which we just rolled out to 100% of all of our customers. 
Communities, which is the narrowcasting use case, allowing people to talk specifically in what feels like a much smaller room about a topic interest, and that could be a location with my neighborhood. I think we will definitely see a lot of usage as people find new ways of having conversations that don't feel like they're tweeting to just the entire world and broadcasting it but actually have a much tighter feedback group because they're talking about something that is locally interesting, whether that be a particular interest or that should be a location, a geography. 
So those are the ones I would point to, but the biggest impact will continue to be personalization. And this is an area where we feel we are behind, although we've put a lot -- we've gotten a lot of gains from it. That just really speaks to the potential we have so much more work to do in terms of machine learning and just generally applying AI to every surface area we have."

The top of funnel continues to be healthy all around the world for us, that is the folks who haven't been on Twitter for a month or more, whether they've never been on Twitter before or they've tried it in the past but haven't made it a part of their daily ritual. So all the product stuff that Jack took you through, plus that healthy top of funnel and all the events and topics that continue to bring people to Twitter all over the world, those are the components that build us up to that $350 million number for the end of next year. When we put it out there in February, remember, we knew that this was going to be a year where we'd be lapping last year's pretty incredible growth and that acceleration was required, and so we've now started that with 11% from Q2 going to 13% DAU growth in Q3. 
The second part of your question on expenses. So we'll give more color around 2022 in February as we typically do. But we just want to remind everybody, one, our investment posture hasn't changed. And as we mentioned back in February, as long as we're on track for our goals, we're going to continue with the mindset to invest to drive growth. And when you just do the math on the hiring and investment decisions that we've already put to work, whether it's the data center or people who've already joined the company, that when you roll those through the P&L for a full year, you add in merit increases and so on, you naturally get to -- and this includes depreciation for the data center, for example, which doesn't start until you actually start to use the data center, you naturally get to the mid-20s. And so we're in the middle of the process where we sort out all the things that we want to do next year, so I don't want to get in front of that. But we do want to continue to invest to drive growth next year, and anything else that we decide to do that is in a resource reallocation decision would be on top of that."

One is MAP grew slightly faster than overall ads, which gives you a sense that we're continuing to make progress there. We saw strength from some areas where we haven't always seen in the past such as travel, where launch campaigns as people begin to travel again from the travel advertisers grew 40%. A lot of that's tied to MAP. Fintech, they grew their spend 200% year-over-year with us. Food delivery, where a lot of that's pointing people to apps, that grew 140%. 
I'd give you a sense for where some of the strength is coming from. You mentioned shopping, so we now have business profiles to differentiate businesses from your account and mine on Twitter where you can put your hours operation, you can put your website. We will also make it so you can buy products straight from those profiles. So stay tuned for that, and we've been experimenting with that over the course of this year. Also on the direct response side, the multi-destination carousel is improving click-through rates by 20%, which gives you a good sense for why this is attracting more and more advertisers and more and more dollars to our service. So we'll keep marching down that road map. And with the sale of MoPub, we'll have more resources to put against it. 
To your second question around revenue guidance. So if you back out last year, which was by no means a normal year and you look at the 4 prior years, you see sequential growth in Q4 for us that was from the mid-teens to the mid-20s. And so when you compare this to that $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion range, you can see that, that's reasonably consistent with what we've seen in the past. We feel like we're entering Q4 with the wind at our backs, with the Olympics having got off to a strong start in Q3. The Olympics went a little bit better than we had expected them to from a revenue perspective. We were really pleased with how we were able to deliver for advertisers. And the strength continued throughout the quarter across geographies, across formats, across verticals and with a great event calendar with lots of product launches in front of us with that strong mix of services and digital goods that we talked about earlier, we feel like we've got a lot of momentum at our backs right now."

So privacy is about making sure that people have an understanding of what data is being collected about them, having control over that. We want to make sure that we're leading our peers in exactly that but also making sure that we have much more direct ways of people telling us what they're interested in. And being able to follow a topic in interest is one such way. Being able to join a particular community to talk about an interest in topic is another way. These are all things that people are intently opting into saying that they're interested in this particular thing and gives us much, much stronger signal. 
It also gives us new surface area to consider what we can do with communities, which hasn't launched fully in beta yet. We're testing it internally. But it gives us the surface area for advertisers who may just want to be shown around a particular topic instead of more broad-based in home time line. So it gives them a much safer space if they want to avoid particular topics or anything that might be political or not. And they have the ability to act on more intent, not just the people that they're trying to reach. 
So that's ultimately what we want to drive, and it starts with the product itself and then making sure that we utilize those signals to deliver a person, an individual, the most relevant ad or introduction to a product or service but -- that they can imagine. And they'll tell us whether that's variable or not as to whether they tap on it or purchase something, and all of these things give us more information so that we can create a much tighter feedback loop so that all these actions can positively reinforce one another. So everything from spaces to the newsletters to covering topics, all these things show a particular intent and a particular interest, and we have to depend less and less around inference in order to strengthen our relevance and get better signal."

And again, that's intent that we've been using to signal, Communities is going to be a big part here as you consider topical communities, interest communities and also community focused around particular locations. That's going to be an incredible surface area for small businesses. 
So there's some foundational work in terms of the performance direction that we're moving to, but also making sure that we are building something that ultimately self-serve for a small business, that they can open up the website and get the advertising right away and actually see value in it immediately, which means that they are really crisp and intuitive analytics. And then the more and more capabilities we have through the products, including our aspirations around commerce, that helps with retaining and attracting new small businesses as well. We did -- we have been launching some things recently like the business profile, and there's a lot more to come, but all of these things will help the smallest businesses be able to utilize us and scale up as they move forward and more so."

But as events began to come back, as people went back to stadiums, as they went back to theaters and other places, they continue to use Twitter.

These are just great examples of that and helping advertisers connect with their customers around full baseball season in the U.S., around the lead up to the football season both pro and college and all the highlights that we've got with every touch spend now during the NFL and a lot of the commentary around this.

I also think there's a lot of opportunity to partner a lot more so the people who already have e-commerce solutions up and running with their inventory and tied into potential legacy systems where a lot of larger retailers have constraints around. But there's just one tap or one click to turn it on and turn that inventory to Twitter as well. So we want to make sure that we're, first and foremost, building great products, and then we'll look to scale it and then turn on more of the sales engine, as you mentioned."

What makes Bitcoin interesting is that is its curably accessible. It doesn't matter where you are in the world. If you have a Bitcoin address to receive, then you have the condescend specifically over the Lightning network, you can do it. So it really opens up the aperture. If we can participate instead of having to go market by market and look for services that operate with a bank that's within each one of those, so it allows for -- gives us much more speed. 
Both tipping subscriptions are new. These are products that we want to make sure that, again, we're starting small and then we figure out the right product that people want to stick with and they're valuing every single day, and then we'll open up to more and more people and scale it and continue to iterate on the product. 
The progress of Revue, which is our newsletter product, just a reminder why we did this. We want to make sure that Twitter is a place where you can express yourself in multiple formats, whether that be through short format updates like Tweets; Spaces, which is an audio conversation in real-time; or long form, which is Revue in the newsletter. The more we integrate this the more opportunity and potential that we see. 
I think rather than looking at any one part of the equation, though, it's useful to consider the ecosystem, someone being able to tweet out that they're going to host this space, add admission price for that space, which is what we call ticketed spaces, have and host the space, potentially be able to sell our products through commerce initiatives. Then after the space is complete, writing newsletter to all their followers around how, when or a recap or any instant insights. All these things positively reinforce one another and allows people to reach in entirely new ways. Some people might not be able to see the space, but they can get the newsletter, write, come back to the tweets and so forth. So we're focused on the ecosystem model, the connection between the parts as being the strength, not the individual aspects of it and making them the strongest, but actually the connection between is where we think the greatest value is for the company."

Is there any way to size sort of the brand advertising upside you saw and separate that out between the U.S. business and rest of the world in terms of where some of that brand advertising strength was derived from? 
And maybe the same element with respect to direct response. When we think about what you've built so far to date as a revenue mix component in the business, how much of that is located in the U.S. business versus more widely distributed globally? And how should we think about that evolving in the years ahead?"

So remember back at the Analyst Day, we mentioned that we had been 85-15 brand DR in terms of ads on Twitter and that the long-term goal is to get to 50-50. We said it wouldn't be a straight line to get to 50-50 because for a variety of reasons, we could see brand outperform DR in any given quarter or in any given year. But we think that over time, that's the right mix for Twitter to be at. We feel like we've made really good progress, having rolled out a new version of MAP, having made a bunch of improvements to website clicks, including the carousel that we talked about maybe a straight line from here to there. 
When you look across geographies, there are some that are inherently much heavier in one product or another. Japan being a heavier MAP market is a good example of that. Europe tends to be more MAP heavy as well. But a lot of this can change from one period to another from one advertisers campaign to another based on our product rollouts and improvements that we make. So we'll update that 85-15 mix annually, so the next time will be in February. And between them, we'll just continue to give you highlights and give you a sense for all the progress that we're making."

On topics, we launched 2,300 new topics in this quarter. There's still a lot to do in terms of applying machine learning and personalization to it, both in terms of like being able to open up new topics much faster, but also enabling more relevance around the topics, A lot of tweets that I find most viable these days are right in the home time line and they're introduced by following topics or a related topic, the system thinks I'm interested in. So I've discovered a ton that I wouldn't otherwise from just following accounts and doing all that work. So we do think it's really helpful both in terms of retaining current users and giving them more of a breadth of what Twitter offers. And also, we're starting to put it more and more into onboarding. So we do think that there's going to be a lot of momentum from that. 
However, I would say that our experience around it, the UI and just how to navigate it and understand it, is still a little bit old. And the more work we do to make it feel more cohesive make us feel like a less taxing browse experience, being able to show and demonstrate tweets right there, a selection of tweets that you might see, if you follow a topic I think would help a lot. So right now, we're looking at the interface more cohesively and now that we have the core infrastructure working, it's just creating a much better experience from a UI perspective."

I'll just start around the expenses. So Colin, the thought is that we will reallocate as many people as we can, a lot of whom will remain at Twitter from MoPub to SMB, to commerce, to DR more broadly, that many of the go-to-market people will move to other parts of our sales organization. And it will take time for their work to turn into revenue, so we don't expect to recoup all of that $200 million to $250 million. But we do think that over time, we can get back on track towards that $7.5 billion or more goal for 2023, and that will be on a more solid ground with more focus around monetizing Twitter than we had been before. And so from an expense perspective, this really doesn't change the picture for next year because we hope to have as many of those people as possible remain at Twitter. Of course, some will be going with MoPub, but most will be staying with us and moving to other work around monetizing Twitter."

So first on SKAdNetwork, it's hard for us to speak to what others have done, and a lot of this is that we're coming at things from different angles. And so we continue to work hard to give advertisers reporting at whatever level customers allow us to around the success of their campaigns, and the SKAdNetwork did a couple of things for us. 
One is it opened up more inventory where we hadn't been able to report to advertisers on how their campaigns have done before, and we are now able to show 30% more iOS customers ads and then report on them on an anonymized aggregated basis. Two is that we've worked hard to help the measurement partners have access to SKAdNetwork and did this early enough to make sure that people could benefit from it, and advertisers can use that to the best of their abilities. 
There's just a lot of signal both from showing ads to people and also reporting on how campaigns have performed on Twitter historically where there's been room for us to improve. And so I think the fact that we're all coming at these things from different angles, maybe we implement it at different times, maybe the campaigns that we're reporting on are different as such that this has had -- the ATT has had less impact on us than perhaps it's had on others who have a different mix or starting from a different starting point. 
The second question around single sign-on. We're looking at all the ways that we can reduce friction and helping people get to what they're looking for on Twitter as quickly as possible. Single sign-on is a great example of it, where a lot of people have created accounts on Twitter over time, but they may not remember their password or maybe on a different device. And everything we can do to get them into a time line as quickly as possible is to help them find the conversation that they were looking for as quickly as possible, we want to do. This has been a nice contributor and something that should continue to reduce friction over time for us, given how our top of funnel works for a lot of the people who come to Twitter have been on this service before. They just haven't been on it for a while. And every new addback we get with them is an opportunity to show them how much better Twitter has been the last time they were with us. 
So single sign-on is a great example of that. Jack talked about topics as another important lever. As those get closer and closer to onboarding, we're able to help people find the accounts that they want to follow or the topics that they want to learn most about through the process of showing them topics and refining what accounts we suggest to them or refining what topics we suggest to them and get them to value in their time line faster than we were able to before."

Secondly, there's that signal that Jack was talking about earlier that we typically or historically just haven't leveraged as well as we can to show people MAP ads, to show them website click ads to help them buy products or goods and services on Twitter. So they just be that there's a lot of signal that is unique to Twitter that we haven't done as good a job of leveraging in the past as we expect to do in the future.
